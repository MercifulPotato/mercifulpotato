Item(by='astrobe_', descendants=None, kids=[25550588], score=None, time=1609071077, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25549896, text='You are describing a different Zero-K than I know. In the ZK I know switching to another factory is a late game thing, not something after you get a few builders for you first factory.<p>Also each factory has mid-tier and high-tier units with unique capabilities. Some factories even have low tier units with specific features (e.g. Jumpbot&#x27;s pyro or Cloakbots cloaking builder).<p>I don&#x27;t understand at all how you can say that many copy each other. That&#x27;s blatantly unfair.<p>Furthermore despite the wide choice of units and structures, every stat and an helpful description of the typical role of the unit is available in-game.<p>The reason for the various AA towers is because you need bigger guns against bigger beasts. Your basic cheap and fast built AA tower will wreck locusts all day, but Ravens will laugh at them and crush your factory anyway. Depending on which style of unit you face (swarm of light units, pack of medium unit, or a few heavy and high DPS units), you need a different type of weapon (e.g. low DPS area of effect or single target high burst).')
