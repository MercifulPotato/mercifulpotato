The XTensa cores always felt weird.<p>Too bad they only included the I&#x2F;M&#x2F;C extensions - no floats, vectors, or atomics. And USB would be nice (nevermind, it has USB :D).<p>But it&#x27;s still very exciting. Maybe there&#x27;ll be less conflict between ARM&#x2F;XTensa&#x2F;PIC32&#x2F;etc. cores in the coming years.')
