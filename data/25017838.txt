It&#x27;s technically not possible to archive, but you can fix some of the issues, like tracking on the backend to get around ad blockers or by setting up a CNAME record and serve the script from your own domain.<p>Anyway, even if tracking (or analytics, which is not the same!) isn&#x27;t perfect, it&#x27;s at least an indicator of how well you&#x27;re doing. Which is better than having no data at all. Paying for ads that were &quot;clicked&quot; by bots or simply don&#x27;t reach the target audience is a whole different story and the author is right, you will probably waste money.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pirsch.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pirsch.io&#x2F;</a>')
