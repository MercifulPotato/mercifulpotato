Economics was the &#x27;dismal science&#x27; because it didn&#x27;t support racism, segregation, and slavery.<p>I had slavery in mind with the private enterprise comment.<p>But it&#x27;s not like businesses are actually run by perfectly rational automatons according to textbook economics.  They&#x27;re run by owners and managers who can be just as racist as the surrounding community, and who can very well prioritize prejudice over a little more profit.')
