Item(by='cryptica', descendants=None, kids=[25429841], score=None, time=1608031572, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25426976, text='I was doing this early in my coding career, but after a certain point, I noticed that people kept making mistakes that I already made before and I didn&#x27;t have the confidence to say anything because I assumed that they knew better and there was probably some other factor that I wasn&#x27;t smart enough to see.<p>Because of my passive attitude, everyone was getting promoted ahead of me at work and I was forced to code in a way that I knew was incorrect. Projects in my day job working in a bigger team moved at snails pace while my personal open source projects with only a couple of contributors progressed very quickly and the products were higher quality with fewer bugs (even though I had a lot less time to work on them).<p>Now I&#x27;ve become extremely confident (inwardly) but I still struggle to assert myself (outwardly) so my new approach is to steer people towards my ideas in a way that they think it was their own ideas. If only I could have more money, I could afford to be more outwardly confident and I wouldn&#x27;t have to resort to such pathetic manipulations.<p>When you don&#x27;t have money, people don&#x27;t believe their own eyes when they see talent... People believe that money is a measurement of talent. It&#x27;s even hard to believe your own talent. But beyond a certain point, after many years, you can&#x27;t keep ignoring the results.')
