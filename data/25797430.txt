TaskTrain lets you take those unread standard operating procedures off of the company intranet and make them actionable.<p>WHY I MADE IT<p>TaskTrain was sparked by my experience running IT service departments:<p>•I hired smart, dedicated techs.<p>•We developed standard operating procedures.<p>•But we still screwed up … way too often …<p>… because we had a lot of multi-step workflows and the time pressures of users needing things done quickly. So the standard operating procedures too often sat unread on a shelf in the midst of actually carrying out the work. And, because human attention &amp; memory are limited, we would often forget a step. And that avoidable oversight would inevitably come back to bite us. TaskTrain tries to address this problem of avoidable errors and inefficient execution in routine service delivery.<p>WHAT IT DOES<p>The idea behind TaskTrain is super-simple:<p>•TaskTrain lets you <i>define</i> all of your standard operating procedures as multi-level outlines, with each step holding optional embedded training like videos, product manuals, links to relevant resources, and explanatory text.<p>•You share these with your team via secure Procedure Manuals. Every time the need arises, you <i>assign</i> an instance of the Procedure. A TaskTrain Assignment is like a work order but with all of the tasks identified and just-in-time training resources embedded.<p>•Each Task in an Assignment can have its own assignee, start and due dates, and comment threads, making it easy to <i>track</i> progress and collaborate with teammates without resorting to e-mail or Slack, increasing coordination efficiency and avoiding missed hand-offs.<p>WHAT I USED<p>TaskTrain is written in TypeScript as an Angular Progressive Web Application communicating via (Apollo) GraphQL to a Node.JS server backed by a MongoDB store.<p>HOW TO TRY<p>Head to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;TaskTrain.app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;TaskTrain.app</a> and press <i>Sign Up Free</i> to register a free-forever account and poke around.
