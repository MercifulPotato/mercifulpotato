I moved away in 2014, because the hours and pay were abysmal. I still love the industry.<p>I moved to a large profitable financial news paper, which had cute scaling issues (ie they were all solved, so engineers tried to find new and interesting ways to unsolved them )<p>I then moved to a startup that made self building machine readable maps, which allowed me to play with scale again, but on AWS (alas no real hardware). We were then bought out by a FAAMG company, so now I&#x27;m getting bored but being paid loads to do so.<p>Once the golden handcuffs have been broken, I&#x27;d like to go back, but only if I can go home at 5 every day...')
