When they finally shrink that to 7 or 5nm, the power savings should be significant.<p>Zen 4 is expected to bring DDR5 support which will both drastically increase bandwidth <i>and</i> lower RAM power consumption. Likewise, it is expected to support PCIe 5 which doubles the bandwidth per lane to a little shy of 4GB&#x2F;s.<p>All of these things together could mean a decent improvement in IPC and total performance and a very big improvement in performance per watt.<p>Meanwhile, I suspect we&#x27;ll start seeing large &quot;Infinity Cache&quot; additions to their APUs that is shared between the CPU and GPU as the bus width of DDR just doesn&#x27;t offer the bandwidth to keep larger GPUs from fighting the CPU for bandwidth. This should not only improve APU total performance, but fewer trips to RAM has a significant effect on power consumption (it costs more to move 2 bytes than to add them together).')
