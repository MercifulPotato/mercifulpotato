I saw some of the shit posted about this on Cryptocurrency forums when Coinbase posted their weird tirade about wanting to be &quot;neutral and apolitical&quot; with regards to social justice and a few days ago about how everything is a lie as they tried to pre-empt this article.<p>It all feels of gaslighting and has a shit ton of people buying into it.<p>At the end of the day, the best thing for Coinbase employees to do is to jump ship to a competitor (I for one, am happy to give a referral to any Coinbase employee who is leaving due to all this) - but absolutely vile that they would try to buy-out all POC in the company.')
