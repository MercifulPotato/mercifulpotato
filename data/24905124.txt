What&#x27;s your edge?<p>&gt;You don&#x27;t need to open a new tab, just reply to the email to take notes.<p>Why reply to an email when I can just open a new tab in my editor?

Landing page doesn&#x27;t explain why this solution is better.<p>&gt; We&#x27;ll send you an email before your meetings with all the notes you&#x27;ve taken about all the people that are present at the meeting. Automatically figure out who you&#x27;re losing touch with and reconnect!
