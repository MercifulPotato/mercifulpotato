And why should they when there are pictures of TV shows using <i>CPU coolers</i> to represent bombs and computer power supplies to represent <i>hard drives</i>?<p>&gt; Anyone who actually takes a look at the photos of what the &quot;clock&quot; looks like will immediately think it looks like a bomb<p>Kind of makes my point. You realize the thing was in a pencil box, not some full size briefcase? The most common image used:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.shellypalmer.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;images&#x2F;2015&#x2F;09&#x2F;ahmedmohamedcomposit-compressor.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.shellypalmer.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;images&#x2F;2015&#x2F;09&#x2F;ahm...</a><p>doesn&#x27;t actually convey the actual scale of it, the thing was barely larger than the original alarm and maybe an inch thick.<p>If you found this in a train unattended it&#x27;d be one thing, but the student says it&#x27;s an alarm clock, anyone with a modicum of electronics knowledge would immediately look at it and say &quot;yes that&#x27;s an alarm clock&quot;. Which is exactly what both teachers did.<p>No one ever thought it was an <i>actual</i> bomb, the confusion was the <i>intent</i> behind it since Texas has a law about <i>hoax</i> bombs that treats them seriously based on <i>intent</i> not just appearance.<p>-<p>And more generally I bring it up because it should show, laypeople are easy to convince of guilt if your standards are literally adding &quot;allegedly&quot; to every claim.<p>People in general are vastly overestimate their own reliability and underestimate their suggestibility. It takes a few weasel words to fool people into creating alternate realities so far and away from reality they almost seem absurd compared to the truth, yet they&#x27;re absolutely convicted about them.')
