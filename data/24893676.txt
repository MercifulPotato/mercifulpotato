That certainly didn&#x27;t make all their google search bar revenue profit. Also as Apple sell more devices they can and do charge Google more, so making better phones and marketing them well, both of which incur costs, earns more search bar revenue. That&#x27;s direct causal line between costs and that revenue. The fact they also have other revenue doesn&#x27;t change that. Whole companies have failed because the owners bought that fallacy and fundamentally misunderstood how their own business worked.')
