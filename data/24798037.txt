The title mentions q&#x27;s for EM&#x27;s but would love input from anyone who has experience or an opinion.\nQ: Did you get hired in a new company &#x2F; team as an EM, or transition within the same team?<p>Q: Do you keep on building your technical knowledge? In your experience, is there a need for doing that or does experience gained in people management skills remove that requirement<p>Q: How good of an engineer would you rate yourself when you made the transition? Did you ever think &#x27;I don&#x27;t know enough eng yet&#x27;?<p>Q: Do you manage teams in the same technical domain you worked in before? Have you been an EM for teams in different domains? Did that have some effect &#x2F; no effect &#x2F; needed tech ramp up?<p>Q: Have you moved back to an eng role? Was that easy? Difficult? Have you ping-ponged between the two?<p>Context: I&#x27;m a senior (whatever that means) engineer, and casually considering moving more towards the management side (currently a tech lead for a team).
