When you&#x27;re developing code you&#x27;re essentially loading up that code into your brain. Every interruption causes it to fall out of your head and you need to start that process over. It can take a good half hour or more to get into the programming &quot;zone&quot;, so each interruption costs a significant amount of time.<p>Interruptions are really bad for software development productivity.<p>&gt;  or have some other secret method to flourish in open plan.<p>Nope. A very good pair of noise cancelling earphones maybe help some, but mostly we just have to put up with it because that&#x27;s what management decided to do to save a little money without realizing that it&#x27;s detrimental to productivity.')
