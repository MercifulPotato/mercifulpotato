It&#x27;s just racism that nobody talks about because it&#x27;s Asians who are seemingly well off economically when in reality the wealth disparity in this demographic is one of the widest.<p>People see fu er dai students driving Lamborghini and think thats how all Asians live when in fact Asia is not even a country.<p>For instance, its socially acceptable to make fun of Asian accents or other racially insensitive remarks but other minority groups are a no go.<p>I recall when Justin Kan moved into his new home he was welcomed with a vandalized garage door with racial slurs. This supposedly the &quot;most socio progressive and liberal state&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s the latter self titled label is an excuse to be even more blatantly racist while patting themselves on the back for having X number of friends from X ethnic group therefore I can&#x27;t be a racist, not even realizing Asia isn&#x27;t even a group of its own, its literally describing half of the lands on earth.')
