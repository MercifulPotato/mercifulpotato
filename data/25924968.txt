The world needs more NTP-powered (alarm) clocks. If you want a self-setting clock traditionally that meant an atomic clock, but those are expensive. Google Home &#x2F; Alexa based smart devices (like the Lenovo Smart Clock) are cool but are a bit overkill (and a bit questionable from a privacy aspect). It&#x27;d be nice to see more NTP clocks that do little more than show the time and have basic alarm functionality.')
