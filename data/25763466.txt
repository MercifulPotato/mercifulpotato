Even stuff like contract law has only existed since the 1990s and onwards. The Chinese constitution foresees no separation of powers, the court system is not independent, it is under the influence of the party.<p>Their Constitution states:<p>&gt; Article 4 All nationalities in the People’s Republic of China are equal. The State protects the lawful rights and interests of the minority nationalities and upholds and develops a relationship of equality, unity and mutual assistance among all of China’s nationalities. Discrimination against and oppression of any nationality are prohibited; any act which undermines the unity of the nationalities or instigates division is prohibited.<p>&gt; The State assists areas inhabited by minority nationalities in accelerating their economic and cultural development according to the characteristics and needs of the various minority nationalities.<p>&gt; Regional autonomy is practised in areas where people of minority nationalities live in concentrated communities; in these areas organs of self-government are established to exercise the power of autonomy. All national autonomous areas are integral parts of the People’s Republic of China.<p>&gt; All nationalities have the freedom to use and develop their own spoken and written languages and to preserve or reform their own folkways and customs.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Human_rights_in_China" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Human_rights_in_China</a>')
