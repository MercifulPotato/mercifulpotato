It&#x27;s slower with fewer office workers in Manhattan, but it&#x27;s still NYC. Manhattan is less busy in some areas anyway as the new construction of money laundering condo units get built. Queens, Brooklyn, etc look pretty much the same, but then the scope of &quot;everyone&quot; fleeing to their Hamptons beach homes is limited in scope.')
