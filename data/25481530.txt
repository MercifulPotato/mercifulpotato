Today, workers can switch unions with a vote, right? If the argument is that the workforce at any given company should be represented by an arbitrary number of unions... I&#x27;d have to give that some thought, but it sounds like something that would occur in a post-scarcity science fiction world (a dystopia, or perhaps just an anti-union parody) wherein the future workforce consists almost entirely of lawyers. Maybe it wouldn&#x27;t be that bad.')
