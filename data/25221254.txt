Isn’t typechecking a means of making impossible states impossible? The article references ideas like non empty arrays or limiting the input from all numbers to just integers between 1 and 5 inclusive.<p>These are both ideas you can express in a type system (quite trivially in most as well). But instead we should use a function at runtime to parse the input and return an object of this type?<p>Is this article against static type systems, or against runtime type checks? Or both...<p>Personally I love having a type system and typescript (what I work with professionally) allows for making impossible states impossible just like many other type systems')
