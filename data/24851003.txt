It&#x27;s a tiny transaction. It can even operate across networks - FireWire had hardware compare and swap support. Compare and swap with retry may have to wait and retry, which is effectively waiting for someone else to stop using a resource you want. So it&#x27;s a form of a critical section lock.')
