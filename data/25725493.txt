These aren&#x27;t starry-eyed idealists whose na√Øve beliefs about politics have suddenly been crushed, they voted for for the rudest blowhard on Twitter <i>after</i> having him as President for the last 4 years.<p>They know he pushes hardline policies, they know he&#x27;s super-antagonistic, they know he&#x27;s been impeached for corruption, they know that half of what he says makes no sense. They may not like or approve of Biden (I don&#x27;t either tbh) but Trump voters absolutely know who he is. Poll after poll has established that a plurality of them them don&#x27;t really give a shit about democracy and that loyalty to Trump is their top concern.<p>I think what you&#x27;re worried about is that if they get shut down they will become more aggressive, and I agree that&#x27;s highly likely. But the approach of appeasing these people and soothing their ruffled feathers has been tried for years and they have just become more and more aggressive over that time. You have a draw a line somewhere, and their attempt to overrun Congress and halt the confirmation of an election seems like a good place to do it.')
