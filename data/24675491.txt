You can take a T, and bind T to std::set at compile time; but that is Generic Programming: analogous, in some ways, but not the same.<p>In the &#x27;90s it was fightin&#x27; words to say &quot;X is not Object Oriented&quot;, because Object-Oriented was taken as a high-status way to say Good, and &quot;Not Object-Oriented&quot; translated implicitly to &quot;Not Good&quot;.<p>But in our brave new world, object-oriented is but one design discipline, and we have others, and enough language primitives to construct our own disciplines by mix-and-match as problems dictate.<p>And, I have myself simplified code that had used a virtual function to use, instead, a function pointer, and it was (still) Good. Better, even.')
