My paper does not make any attempt to weigh on that question, neither does it claim nor imply that humans have any supernatural powers of enumerating reals or ordinals, and you grossly misrepresent me by implying it does.<p>Rather, my paper is on the less ambitious question of whether the traditional RL model (with its real-valued rewards) accurately captures the full set of reward-giving environments an AGI should be capable of comprehending.')
