I mean Antifa setup it’s own autonomous zone in Seattle, effectively overthrowing the gov’ts authority (albeit on a small and temporary scale).  People were killed there.  Is this that not sedition or at least a direct attempt to usurp the gov’ts authority?<p>“Protestors” took over a Seattle City Hall and demanded the mayor resign.  Is that not disrupting the legitimate legislative process?  Isn’t that attempting to force a legitimately elected official out of office?<p>The mayor of Portland was being accosted at his home (so much so he moved) and while out in public having dinner (just this past week).  Is that not intimidating and threatening our elected leaders?<p>The point is the left said <i>nothing</i> about about all this violence and rioting and in some cases <i>encouraged it</i>.  Said “it was legitimate anger” and therefore authorities shouldn’t try and stop it.<p>Why the double standard?  Why  is arson and looting by Antifa given the benefit of the doubt and called “protesting”, while, when the right riots and causes disruption we go right to using words like “coup” and “sedition” and suddenly need to start creating new laws to stop it?')
