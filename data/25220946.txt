They were at the level of requirements and high-level design, and were not specific to the discipline of software engineering. We&#x27;re not talking about a missing <i>break</i> statement here.<p>&gt; The MCAS software was modified to read from both angle of attack sensors and to be less aggressive in pushing the nose of the plane down.<p>That strikes me as a design issue in the domain of aeronautical engineering, rather than in software engineering. Software engineers aren&#x27;t the ones with the domain expertise to determine the right aggression parameters.<p>&gt; The software that controlled the indicator light that illuminated when the two angle of attack sensors disagreed was also fixed.<p>I thought the issue was that the sensor-disagree warning light was not included as standard, it was sold as an optional extra. [0]<p>&gt; While reviewing the software systems, a number of other software issues were found.<p>Interesting, I wasn&#x27;t aware of that. If I understand correctly these issues aren&#x27;t thought to have a direct bearing on the crashes.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;05&#x2F;business&#x2F;boeing-737-max-warning-light.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;05&#x2F;business&#x2F;boeing-737-max-w...</a>')
