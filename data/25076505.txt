There are a multitude of reasons a person could be obese (genetics, digestive disorders&#x2F;longer intestines). Also people have choices, if a Dr. tells me smoking is bad and he smokes he is choosing to do so despite evidence that its dangerous. I respect the ability for individuals to make choices, even if I don&#x27;t agree with them.')
