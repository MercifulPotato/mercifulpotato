Well - just &#x27;smoke weed&#x27; once and you realize it&#x27;s frankly just not that big of a deal.<p>Ads are ancient, normal, universal. The industry has serious efficiency problems, we&#x27;re starting to face privacy issues (which are overstated but nevertheless legit), and I don&#x27;t like some mediums (I for one, think we should dump most billboards) - but the nature of the industry is not wrong or evil, it&#x27;s actually beneifical.<p>&#x27;Good ads&#x27; are a win for everyone. HFT is only a win for those directly involved and it&#x27;s zero sum.')
