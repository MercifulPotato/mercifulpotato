This is trivial stuff.<p>Setting interest rates to 0 also heavily reduces lending because no one would be incentivized anymore to lend as they&#x27;re not getting any benefit. This is why in Islam, lending is purely an act of charity since the lender can in no way shape or form be contractually owed any sort of benefit, monetary or otherwise.<p>This is proven to work up to even recent times before everyone was forced by the West to succumb to their dangerous economic practices. Claiming that these ideas are only suitable for millenia ago is outright false.')
