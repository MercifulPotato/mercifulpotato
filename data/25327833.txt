Find the thing to update<p>2. Update it<p>Linus&#x27;s version does just that.<p>But the first version is more complex because step 1 instead emits something that may or may not be the thing to update, and so step 2 has to reason about that. Additionally, it introduces a bookkeeping variable -- cur -- which becomes redundant before step 2 (by which point it&#x27;s equal to target).<p>IMO Linus is right here. The form of his solution directly matches the problem and allows you to look at the code as two clean steps -- no reasoning about the output of the first step and no bookkeeping cruft variable that you have to ignore or remind yourself that it&#x27;s the same as another variable after some point in the function. At least once you&#x27;re used to working with double pointers I think that&#x27;s a much easier function to read.')
