In my project, we moved from Java&#x2F;Spring because it was just too much magic happening behind the scenes. We wanted something that was just clear and straight to the point. We should be able to read the code and it should do exactly that, not something else because you annotated the class.\nI just wish it wasn&#x27;t so bloated with error handling. It&#x27;s difficult to see the actual code among all the if err != nil (even though GoLand does a pretty good job at hiding them). Something like this?<p><pre><code>  f := os.Open(&quot;file&quot;) or {\n      return err\n  }\n</code></pre>\nAfter a couple of years with Scala, I&#x27;m also really missing proper FP, pattern matching, optional types, immutability, etc. Still, I&#x27;m pretty happy with Go and it has made me more excited about coding again.')
