I agree that fiat money can&#x27;t make up for a human life, since if money is destroyed, the remaining money supply increases in value through deflation and no actual resources are destroyed.<p>However I disagree that a human life can&#x27;t be equated with resources. Would you destroy $10 billion of value&#x2F;resources in the economy to save 1 person? I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s worth it, because that $10 billion of value could&#x27;ve been food and medicine which can save thousands of people. This is really just the trolley problem. But the bigger you make the sum (if you don&#x27;t agree at $10 billion, what about $1 trillion?), at some extreme point you&#x27;re going to have to say &quot;ok, one life isn&#x27;t worth that much.&quot;')
