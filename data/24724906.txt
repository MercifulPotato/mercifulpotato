I ultimately got a job that paid 10% better than my previous job, and I rushed the decision because I had only a small fraction of the severance that coinbase employees are receiving. Even with the &quot;looking for work&quot; switch toggled off, I get several messages from recruiters every day. No doubt our industry is affected by COVID, but there&#x27;s no shortage of high-paying work.')
