Harvard could have done worse and kept it under wraps, we won’t definitely know until someone does an Ito there too. In fact there are credible reasons to believe something even more dubious was going on there.<p>Think about the process of what giving anyone a nice office in one of the prime buildings at Harvard in that manner requires in that timeframe, what else it implies, and here’s the critical thing, without anyone else in that building or on that floor raising any concerns publicly.<p>It at the very least means all those concerns were intercepted privately before anyone could have aired the dirty laundry.<p>And do you know of anyone who could have gotten all that just by asking nicely, some smooth talking, a flight to an island, and a big cheque?<p>A named building maybe, nice press releases sure, an actual position complete with office, slot in the org. chart, and name plaque, in the academic bureaucracy of the most status conscious school in the world?<p>The one that ousted their own esteemed president, the former treasury secretary who got an AM and PhD at said school, for an off the cuff remark in a speech not long before?<p>Can just some millions be enough to motivate the decision makers at Harvard to do that?<p>Put another way, there are only a few, far more credible, folks who had setups even a fraction as cushy as Epstein had, at least on the record.<p>You sound like someone who understands how academia truly works. From your experience doesn’t that chain of events imply something more was involved?<p>Though of course the fact that BillG was acting as a secret intermediary for Epstein’s funds at MIT also really implies something more was involved there too and it implies that Ito still has some secrets and&#x2F;or was used as a patsy. So in the end you may be correct.<p>Whatever force(s) powerful enough to motivate BillG to act like that may indeed make Harvard’s type more preferable, assuming the folks there were strong enough to resist what BillG could not.<p>The funky DoD accounting though... has profound implications nationwide.')
