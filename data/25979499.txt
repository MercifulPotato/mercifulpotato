I use the Hy language (hylang, has a Clojure style syntax) that is built on Python (you can get a copy of my Hy book for free, the minimum price is free <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leanpub.com&#x2F;hy-lisp-python" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leanpub.com&#x2F;hy-lisp-python</a>), but I still like Common Lisp as my main driver.<p>Anyway, I consider myself to be very fortunate to have about half of my career since 1982 use Lisp languages.')
