Anything more complex, make it executable and put it on the path and then call it from make.<p>Gradle.  It&#x27;s a full programming language.  And let&#x27;s not forget there&#x27;s a ray tracer in pure cmake doing the rounds.<p>Being cross-platform without having to drop out of the main build tool isn&#x27;t necessarily a benefit, and that&#x27;s part of the reason for it&#x27;s complexity.')
