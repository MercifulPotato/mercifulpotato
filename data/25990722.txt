This is where they put the sitcoms and dramas and reality shows.  And &quot;Product Placement&quot; refers not to advertising per se, but paid placement of retail products (e.g. cars, sodas, whatever) into the scenes in the fiction, or to appear as prizes, etc...<p>It doesn&#x27;t refer to news programming or other journalism, you just got confused.  And I&#x27;ll say it again: if NBC News, or any other major news media organization, ever got caught teasing a segment because of third party payment, it would be a much, much (seriously: much) bigger story than this minor nonsense about GameStop.  They simply do not do what you are alleging, period.')
