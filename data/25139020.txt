Possibly going to be more stable on Linux as well as the card can recover itself from crashes. Big Navi also has its driver upstreamed in current 5.9 kernel so no more first day disaster like Navi.<p>(Meanwhile Nvidia also removed the &quot;error 43&quot; limitation when it detected the card is being run in a VM, so VFIO scene is getting a lot more interesting in this generation.)<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ykiU49gTNak" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ykiU49gTNak</a>')
