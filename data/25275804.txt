Same thing happens in the US - to hear some Americans speak they have become a dictatorship with a tyrant in charge, and the whole system is broken. Meanwhile they continue to have free and fair elections, first amendment rights, the ability to take their government to court etc. In my country (in west africa) just voting against the dictator in charge can get you banned from getting any employment, send you to jail to be tortured etc. And marching on the streets in peaceful protest has actually had people sent to death row awaiting execution. I guess itâ€™s a matter of perspective :)')
