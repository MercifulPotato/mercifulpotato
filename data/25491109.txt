The objections to taxation by Parliament rested on the colonists&#x27; lack of representation in that body.<p>&gt; Like even at its founding, the US was only marginally better than the UK in terms of enfranchisement. About 2% of Philidelphians were eligible voters.<p>Perhaps <i>at the founding of the US</i> that was true, but Pennsylvania passed a radically democratic state constitution in 1776 that was highly innovative and unusual in many ways (e.g., a council elected by the people every 7 years to review all laws passed since the last council, with the power to veto any law they considered unconstitutional). The new state constitution granted the right to vote to any man who paid taxes, which by 1787 was nearly 90% of the adult white male population.<p>&gt; Northern businesses that depended on various plantation based exports also gained.<p>How did they gain from slavery? They could but cotton from anywhere, and if the South wasn&#x27;t delivering, they could import it from other countries. The argument works much better in reverse: Southern plantation owners depended critically on the rapidly expanding British and American textile industries. The planters were delivering a relatively low-tech, raw product. The textile mills didn&#x27;t particularly care <i>how</i> it was produced, and they had multiple sources they could buy it from.<p>&gt; The gilded age didn&#x27;t fix wealth inequality.<p>But it did deliver much more economic development than the old slaveocracy.')
