Item(by='vram22', descendants=None, kids=[24956153, 24956646], score=None, time=1604186455, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24955536, text='&gt; One of my favorite Unicode oddities is in the cyrillic block. Some books used to use the letter &quot;ꙩ&quot; when writing the word eye (ꙩко).<p>Interesting. That &quot;ꙩко&quot; looks phonetically (if that&#x27;s the right word, I&#x27;m not well up on linguistics (if that&#x27;s the right word again, ha ha)) a bit like the Hindi word &quot;aankh&quot; for &quot;eye&quot;. The &quot;n&quot; sound in &quot;aankh&quot; is emphasized less, for lack of a better term. Actually, in Hindi, it is shown as a dot on top of one of the other letters, to show that.<p>Also reminded by this, via George Borrow&#x27;s novel Lavengro[1] (a story about gypsies), that the gypsy and Hindi words for &quot;nose&quot; are similar, &quot;nak&quot;.<p>One theory is that the gypsies (Roma(ni)[2]) migrated from northwestern parts of India to other parts of the world, such as North Africa and Europe.<p>Aankh (pronounced almost like aak) and nak, get it?  :)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lavengro" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lavengro</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Romani_people" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Romani_people</a>')
