Pytorch is much more than just an API (which is also nothing to scoff at).<p>It&#x27;s also much cleaner documentation, a very different ecosystem of libraries (mostly better, but sometimes lacking depending on the niche), less magic (which makes it easier to debug). It also has the benefit of less ecosystem churn, while the transitions of TF1-&gt;2 as well as the external Keras-&gt;internal Keras are a shitshow that&#x27;s almost as bad as Python2-&gt;3.')
