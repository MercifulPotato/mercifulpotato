I don&#x27;t have a formal training or CS degree either. :)<p>And I know how scary and complex it can look, but in the end it&#x27;s not that much harder compared to JavaScript or Web development. It&#x27;s just different, but just as fun, and my goal here is to show that it doesn&#x27;t have to be intimidating!')
