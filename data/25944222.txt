Item(by='phkahler', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611850690, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25943552, text='&gt;&gt; By the time someone sends a pull request they already put a significant amount of effort into their message and thus will rightfully get angry when their efforts are being rejected.<p>I&#x27;d prefer if they open an issue - or use an existing one - as a forum to discuss what they&#x27;ll be doing in a PR. That way we can either reject an idea prior to someone putting in the effort, or talk about implementation so the resulting PR is more likely to be accepted.<p>Drive by PRs are fine if they&#x27;re simple, but the ones of higher impact need more consideration.<p>Even more than PRs, I have mixed feelings about feature requests. Many of them are legit things that would make the software better, but with limited resources they&#x27;re likely to sit for years. Is it better to let them pile up or close them? Maybe a new tag - Deferred.')
