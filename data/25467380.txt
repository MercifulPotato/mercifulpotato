It’s terribly liberating as I don’t have to do much of what’s called out in authors complaint list but still has all the fun of solving problems writing code.<p>It was hard to find such a position but I’ve bumped into quite a few others like me who are “crypto coders” who do their work that’s really only possible with software. In some ways I actively don’t want people to know I can code as then word gets out and I might be “forced” to code.<p>Although I’m probably a terrible programmer compared to really good ones, I did support myself for a decade or two.')
