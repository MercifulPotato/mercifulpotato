There are companies that offer this information by analyzing voter rolls based on campaign themes and much more - the data is there, the usual &#x27;game theory&#x27; is you only focus on turning out your base and doing what you can for undecideds.<p>&gt; So if I were trying to sway the current presidential election, I would have had to alter 10,000+ votes in multiple states. If my success rate (meaning I&#x27;m not discovered) is 50%, suddenly I had to alter 20,000 votes.<p>OP must mean &#x27;easy&#x27; for a large organization, or coordinated effort, not a one off individual.<p>Finally, I agree on the idea that &#x27;there should be smoke&#x27; - we would be seeing many people show up to the polls only to discover they have &#x27;already voted&#x27; or &#x27;received a ballot by mail&#x27; - and those people would be making a fuss.<p>The question is how credible the unlikely voter information in the current polling and political strategy services.')
