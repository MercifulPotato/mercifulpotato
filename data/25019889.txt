They didn&#x27;t need to use violence to size power when they could cut a deal with the Centre (Catholic) party and the Conservative party.  The ones who went to violence first was the KPD (communist party) who were losing votes and members of parliament for years; of course when Moscow told them that the Social Democrats were the enemy they spurned an offer to work together against the Nazis at a time when the two of them together had more members of parliament than the Nazis.  No need to use violence to sieze power when your opponents are either stupid or greedy.<p>You need to at least learn the history of the period if you are going to try to play this game.')
