Our data set consists of one species.  Enough of this species wants to visit an extraterrestrial civilization, and given no other examples, we assume it&#x27;s probably the same.\n  (2) Related to (1), we have exactly zero evidence of the existence of *any* extraterrestrial life, let alone life that understands that they live on &quot;something in space&quot;, that there is other life on a planet orbiting a sun amongst an infinite number of stars, etc.\n</code></pre>\nMaybe I&#x27;m not the article&#x27;s target audience, but this is so far down the list of questions that need to be answered at this point that I had a hard time being motivated to read the whole thing.<p>The first, and a more interesting question is: &quot;Is there any life, intelligent or otherwise, outside of this planet?[1]&quot;  If we found, say, that samples from Mars or some other planet&#x2F;asteroid had a diversity of different bacteria&#x2F;single-celled organisms, etc, it would increase the probability that there is intelligent life out there &quot;somewhere&quot;.  If everything comes back empty, there&#x27;s probably better things to focus research energy on.<p>[0] The title is missing that important piece.  If they are unaware that life could exist they won&#x27;t be all that interested in visiting.  The mattresses (from the planet &quot;where mattresses are grown&quot;) likely haven&#x27;t pondered any of the big questions of life, the universe and... everything.<p>[1] Tricky problem: you sent something up from a planet teaming with all kinds of bacteria&#x2F;life; I&#x27;ve read about how they sanitize&#x2F;handle things but it still amazes me that they can say with any confidence that there was no cross-contamination, but IANARS.')
