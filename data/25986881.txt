Here&#x27;s the scam app:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;gb&#x2F;app&#x2F;keywatch-watch-keyboard&#x2F;id1499067567" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;gb&#x2F;app&#x2F;keywatch-watch-keyboard&#x2F;id1499...</a><p>Apparently the paid for 5 stars comments have been deleted, all that&#x27;s left are comments in the 1 star range but the app is still rated 4.1&#x2F;5. It&#x27;s not the first time I see this discrepancy and makes it very hard for a user to understand who to believe: the 1 star comments or the very positive rating average?')
