People are not really happy with current status quo so they are looking to choose alternative leaders via elections, just as expected in democratic countries.<p>2. Some bad guys post bad stuff on Facebook and, like, 30% of german voters read it and march to election booth like zombies to vote the way bad guys said them to vote (for Alternative for Germany).<p>Well, you can pick which theory survives the Occam Razor test better.<p>EDIT: And oh, wrt to &quot;a large voice so quickly&quot; -- when a lot of stuff happens quickly (i mean, between 1 or 2 elections) -- yes, a lot of people can change their minds quickly. Turbulent times, you know. In stable times people change their minds slowly.')
