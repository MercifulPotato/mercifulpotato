At any one time a certain percentage of kids in the class would be off sick, it was a given. So the curriculum doesn&#x27;t proceed linearly but more like a helix: it circles around and around the same topics year by year with each child being supported to learn at the level they are - always a broad range in any one class.<p>So it&#x27;s in my experience totally untrue to suggest that any child would have to &quot;catch up&quot; any learning missed due to sickness (and also reveals that schools are talking bollocks when they suggest that taking a few days off to go on holiday during termtime will have any noticeable adverse effect, but shhhh)')
