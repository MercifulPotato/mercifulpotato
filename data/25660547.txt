So the gift cards are usually sold for below face value to the retailer.  In turn, some retailers will sell gift cards for below their face value.<p>So, e.g., at this moment, Nintendo eShop $50 cards are $44.99; XBox&#x2F;Sony Playstation $100 gift cards are $89.99; a $500 gift card on Alaska Airlines is $449.99; $100 at Hulu is $89.99.<p>These are not particularly good prices.  Oftentimes Apple $100 gift cards will be $79.99.<p>The other incentives at Costco still hold, too; you can get the Executive Membership 2% back and the 2% credit card cash back.')
