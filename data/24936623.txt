Item(by='meowface', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604008947, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24936572, text='For the record, I read the email exchange Greenwald published and I am a little more sympathetic to the editors now. I don&#x27;t totally agree with their criticisms, but I think Greenwald unnecessarily escalated into ad hominems before even giving them a chance to reply, and I think there was a valid discussion to be had there before there was no choice but to throw in the towel. He should&#x27;ve just kept the part of the email with the editor comments vs. article comparisons and left out the rest. I understand why he felt like he was being pressured, though.<p>I still don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything like blind acceptance of disinformation in the article, but he could&#x27;ve hedged certain parts a bit more.<p>Also, I kind of regret some of my earlier comments. I still think the way the media and Twitter handled this is absolutely ridiculous, and I really don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a disinformation aspect to this article (bias and dis&#x2F;misinformation are very different), but I kind of jumped to the conclusion about the rigor of the article after only reading about half of it (mostly the parts about the media). I think the truth about the article&#x27;s rigor probably lies in the middle between your and my initial opinions of it, and similarly I think proper rigor kind of lies between Greenwald&#x27;s and the editor&#x27;s opinions. I prefer Taibbi&#x27;s reporting on it (and Taibbi&#x27;s reporting in general).<p>And to be clear, as I mentioned in my other comments, I&#x27;ve never seen very good evidence of corruption on Joe&#x27;s part; my concern is pretty much just with the emails and the media&#x27;s handling of them.<p>edit: Actually, I just went ahead and removed my very initial comment and another one. I was kind of shooting from the hip, though I definitely still stand by the parts about the media, and probably most of my other comments so far. But I might change my mind tomorrow about some of the other comments, and this definitely isn&#x27;t the ideal platform for an extremely lengthy and careful debate.')
