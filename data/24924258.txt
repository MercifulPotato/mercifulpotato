The only time we spend really working on Prometheus is configuring our service discovery, which is the shipping component you’d have with any monitoring tool. I estimate we spend about 1 developer day a month un Prometheus upkeep.<p>Logging is much more fiddly, and required a large up front investment. Now it’s running though, we get a lot of value from our setup. It costs much more though, think about $10k&#x2F;month in infrastructure spend and about 3 developer days a month to maintain.<p>Grafana is effortless to run, really dead simple. You can consider this to be ‘free’, both for infra and maintenance.<p>Hope that gives you a sense of this? I think we come out equivalent to managed services for cost when you account for infra and human time, but have far more flexibility in how we use the tools and develop the skills to properly leverage each product along the way.')
