Thank you for the love I really appreciate it. I did not expect this to blow up like it has I got up this morning and it was sitting on front page and there&#x27;s a lot more interest which is great. I feel sad for some people to see that they are having issues with the binaries&#x2F;connecting to chrome, I will get to work on that today and hopefully have some resolutions pushed out in half a day, so please check back for update. And I really appreciate all the feedback, it&#x27;s very good to know how people are experiencing this. Thank you again for all your support.')
