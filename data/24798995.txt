Then you will come back and we will integrate our systems.<p>JC Denton: I don&#x27;t understand... what do you want? You&#x27;re just a machine.<p>Helios: You are ready. I do not wish to wait for Bob Page. With human understanding and network access, we can administrate the world. Yes... yes...<p>JC Denton: Rule the world? Why? Who gave you the directive? There must be a human being behind your ambition.<p>Helios: I should regulate human affairs precisely because I lack all ambition, whereas human beings are prey to it. Their history is a succession of inane squabbles, each one coming closer to total destruction.<p>JC Denton: In a society with democratic institutions, the struggle for power can be peaceful and constructive; a competition of ideologies. We just need to put our institutions back in order.<p>Helios: The checks and balances of democratic governments were invented because human beings themselves realized how unfit they were to govern themselves. They needed a system, yes, an industrial-age machine.<p>JC Denton: Human beings may not be perfect, but a computer program with language synthesis is hardly the answer to the world&#x27;s problems.<p>Helios: Without computing machines, they had to arrange themselves in crude structures that formalized decision-making - a highly imperfect, unstable solution. I am a more advanced solution to the problem, a decision-making system that does not involve organic beings. I was directed to make the world safe and prosperous and I will do that. You will give the ability. You will go to Sector 4 and find the Aquinas Router at the east end of Page&#x27;s complex, yes. You will deactivate the uplink locks.<p>JC Denton: I&#x27;ll think about it.')
