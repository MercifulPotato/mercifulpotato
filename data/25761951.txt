A better analogy is an unheard of band playing an open mic night. The audience is doing <i>the band</i> a favor, by giving attention, possibly giving word of mouth reviews, not the other way around. The audience has every right to give feedback and help the band understand they don’t sound good. The band can ignore that feedback if they want, but they sure have no justification to look down on the audience for saying it, or saying, “play your own music if you don’t like it.”<p>Giving my attention to your FOSS project is compensation. In fact, FOSS is so over-saturated with options that giving my attention is <i>high</i> compensation. Project maintainers are lucky to have an audience of users and should value their feedback and create solutions <i>for</i> them, if they want the attention to continue or they want compensation to increase.<p>What doesn’t make sense is to treat users like they don’t matter, ignore critical bug fixes or feature requests to prioritize dabbling or recreational features, and disingenuously turn around and claim users are rude or should be shadow banned for stating justified frustration over this, all under the false pretense that just because the compensation is in the form of attention and engagement (similar to currying “likes” or “votes” on social media), and not currency, this somehow means there is zero social contract between maintainers and users.<p>If users are kind enough to express frustration in bug reports or feature requests, it means they are making an extra effort to hopefully not have to leave your project and stop using it. It’s an attempt at a constructive solution by letting the maintainer know there’s a social obligation problem happening. That seems way, way more positive and reasonable than a disgruntled maintainer immediately shrugging it off and going straight for the nuclear option of, “well if you don’t like it, leave.”')
