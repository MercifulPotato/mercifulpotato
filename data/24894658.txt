The surface go is portable and easy to bring around, the desktop has the power, if I need it on the surface I just remote in to the desktop. My laptop (a Dell XPS), basically now only exists for flights&#x2F;abroad trips where I might need more power than the surface go but reliable connectivity is not guaranteed. Which means it hasn&#x27;t been used this year')
