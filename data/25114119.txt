The goal is not to overburden the health system. Hospitals have a limited amount of intensive care units. And if Covid patients fill them up doctors need to do triage (that happened on the first wave in Italy). Then it&#x27;s not only an issue of people who have Covid, but also a problem of other people who need an intensive care unit.<p>Also just because you don&#x27;t know anyone doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s bad. If we can reduce people dying it&#x27;s worth doing it. And it&#x27;s just not a few in this case.')
