The problem is that technology&#x27;s ecological impact is not being measured. Mainly, because societal changes ocurring after technological advances are unpredictable but also because technology moves faster than social science.<p>The state of the art is to revert to previous tech or invent new solutions when social damage has become clear. Sadly, some times this is not possible and we are left with open problems bigger than the initial ones we encountered. Consider for example climate change, the birth of the precariat social class, declining birth rates, etc.<p>Technology can be good but it has to be created, nurtured and regulated to such a purpose.')
