So libraries.<p>That&#x27;s one opinion, sure.<p>However, DSLs are always in a far better position to solve domain-specific problems because, unlike generic programming libraries, they not only reflect domain-specific knowledge and best practices and represent standardized solutions for recurring problems.<p>Consequently, Makefiles and other DAG-related DSLs are omnipresent and dominate domains such as build systems, and generic library-based proposals always failed to gain any form of traction.<p>And it&#x27;s not just Makefiles or build systems. There&#x27;s also markup languages, infrastructure as code, CICD&#x2F;processing pipelines, configuration, etc etc etc.')
