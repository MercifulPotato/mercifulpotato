May require periodic relocation to facilitate street sweeping, snow plowing, or other activities sanctioned by the municipality (e.g. clearing space for loading&#x2F;unloading moving trucks or construction equipment).<p>* Zoned street parking - Parking in the zone follows the same general pattern of &#x27;unrestricted&#x27; above, except vehicles need a specially-issued identifier (usually a sticker) from the municipality to park in the zone.<p>* Reserved street parking - In conventional circumstances, usually limited to parking spaces for those with mobility impairments, or some special circumstance (e.g. a city might lease spots to a car-sharing service to improve transport access for residents). Sometimes found in cases where there are parking spaces directly off the street (e.g. &quot;pull-in angle parking&quot;) in less heavily trafficked areas&#x2F;neighborhoods.')
