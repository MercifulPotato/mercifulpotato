Others are rich, but small (the Vatican). Most just don&#x27;t care enough to prioritise it over better things they could be doing.<p>And then, there are countries that simply consider the US an ally, and consider it morally dubious or practically unpromising to spy on them.<p>Add this up, and I&#x27;d be willing to give at least 10:1 odds it&#x27;s one of a list of maybe ten suspects, even when adjusted for GDP or population.<p>As an aside, I&#x27;d really be curious why this &quot;everyone does it&quot; is used anytime something like this comes up? Is it just macho &quot;I don&#x27;t have friends but there are useful idiots that consider themselves my friend&quot; talk? Is it nihilistic&#x2F;cynical pretentiousness? International whataboutism to defend one&#x27;s team?<p>Because it certainly isn&#x27;t based on any actual data. If you add up offensive hacking by the USA, China, Russia, Israel, and maybe two or three others, you&#x27;re pretty well done with the full list, but still close to &lt;x&gt; nations short, where &lt;x&gt; is the number of nations that exist.')
