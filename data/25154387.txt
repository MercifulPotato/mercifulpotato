I remember being on old forums like Digitally Imported and it really felt like a warm and welcoming community where people knew each other and exchanged birthday wishes, discussed interesting topics, shared music projects they worked on and listened to music together. Your join date and your relationship with other users was more important than any likes or karma and everyone just stuck around. Today, casual internet experience lacks humanity and warmth. It feels mindless, politicized and disconnected because everything is fueled by money, subscribers and likes. Spend 5 minutes on Instagram and it&#x27;ll feel like we&#x27;re moments away from the main plot in Idiocracy.')
