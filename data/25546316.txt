This produces “analysis paralysis” in a principled way.<p>Also, there’s sort of a “curse of knowledge” here, because I’ve been in many teams building products. Once you’ve been through this a few times, you come to recognize the myths and the emotional aspects that are oddly integral to this human activity, even though the majority of the work and sentiments often turn out to be useless. This makes me distrustful of myself, as you would be distrustful of any leadership (that wants you to work for free).<p>Breaking out each step of feature and somewhat articulating the dependencies would help me overcome both problems described above.<p>I’m looking for a framework that would help me do this.')
