As a developer with XCode maxing my CPU 90% of the day, I consider any Apple laptop unusable without additional cooling. Whenever I&#x27;m plugged into a monitor, I also have two fans to go by the vents. Runs better if you download a program like iStat Menus and force the fans to always be high too.<p>Does it suck? Yes. Are fans only $10 to save a $2000 machine? Yep. Apple simply doesn&#x27;t design their kit to run hard and run often. It&#x27;s like those internet services that sell higher speed than they can actually give every customer. They depend on you not using it all.')
