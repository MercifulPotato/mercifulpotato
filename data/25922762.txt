The method includes the steps of: (a) orienting and affixing the clock display with respect to the polygon (b) weighting the polygon such that it can be balanced on any edge (c) rotating the polygon to orient the display at the desired angle; and (d) reading the time on the display.<p>PRIOR ART<p>Traditionally, alarm clocks have been embedded in circular enclosures (polygons of order infinity) or rectangular enclosure (polygons of order four). The innovation of clocks embedded in polygons of order 5 and higher (excluding infinity) is new and non obvious.')
