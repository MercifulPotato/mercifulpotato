I&#x27;d guess that many peasants wouldn&#x27;t have known this, especially if they came from regions which didn&#x27;t have any traditions around making acorns safe, and that may be a simpler explanation for why they had a reputation as a food of last resort in times of famine - better to eat something that will make you a bit sick but keep you alive rather than eat nothing at all and starve to death.')
