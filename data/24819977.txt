They have &gt;100M users, and with an app&#x2F;service portal, they&#x27;ll be required to be &quot;interoperable&quot;.<p>Banks around here (Norway) are required to provide API access because of Eu regulations (yeay EU, sometimes you are a great idea even if I&#x27;m happy that we aren&#x27;t a member) and I can already see accounts from other banks I have used before.<p>&gt; I also don&#x27;t want my bank to have an interoperability interface; as an internet plumber, I fully realize the first thing you need to have a blockage is a pipe with something in it.<p>Couldn&#x27;t this be used as an argument against every standardization effort?')
