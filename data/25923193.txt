And also #3.<p>One of my earliest and still one of my favorite career achievements was optimizing a stored procedure in Oracle.  Our application called the procedure and depending on the result dropped a character from the input and called the procedure again.<p>This was the highest load on our database.  We were negotiating a new license to scale up the Oracle database.  Estimates were in the six figure range.<p>I simply reproduced that modification&#x2F;retry logic inside the procedure.  The application always got the desired result on the first call over the network.  No application side code change needed at all.<p>IIRC my optimization reduced load by ~an order of magnitude.  We no longer needed the additional Oracle capacity.  Saved a multiple of my salary in an afternoon, just looking for a hot spot.  I think my boss bought me a sandwich.  It was a good day.')
