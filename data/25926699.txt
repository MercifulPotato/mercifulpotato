QAnon believers have destroyed important personal relationships while promoting their obviously-wrong belief. Some have continued believing even when absolutely and incontrovertibly proven wrong.<p>Obviously they perceived the social cost of acknowledging that they were wrong as higher than the gain of getting their friends and family back. And obviously there&#x27;s places they can go on the internet where this continued belief is socially rewarded.<p>I see correlations here with &quot;being weak&quot;, where &quot;strength&quot; is correlated with not giving in, not accepting that the other person was right, not changing your opinion in the light of better evidence, etc. For some people, the ego cost of being wrong is much higher than for others. Their self-esteem is somehow connected to this belief. It&#x27;s less about social, and more about ego.')
