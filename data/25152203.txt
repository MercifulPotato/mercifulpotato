The Very Large Array has “the resolution of an antenna 36 km (22 miles) across, with the equivalent sensitivity of a dish 130 meters (422 feet) in diameter”[0], i.e. amazing resolution but sensitivity much smaller than the current largest single dish, which is China’s FAST (500 meters in diameter).<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vla.nrao.edu&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vla.nrao.edu&#x2F;</a>')
