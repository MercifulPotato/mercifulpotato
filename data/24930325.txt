Programmers of the time resorted to a lot of complicated tricks to keep what you&#x27;re describing from working properly, but assembly of the era is pretty easy to follow and having a 30 year advantage in tooling helps a lot.<p>Hyperspeed was an interesting one. The crack that comes with the Steam version doesn&#x27;t actually work since it triggers a lockup the first time you use the spindrive, so players just disable the crack and play the game normally with a PDF manual. I spent a long time trying to  bypass that copy protection screen and all the checks to see if I&#x27;d bypassed it, but every time I thought I&#x27;d finally nailed it I ran into a new place the game would intentionally lock up. Ultimately I just truncated the word match table to a single entry so the word would always be the same. That was a single-byte change.')
