Helsinki is 650k, but actually it&#x27;s a tri-city with Espoo and Vantaa, going over 1M population. That&#x27;s more than SF in a similar area.<p>Helsinki alone is almost twice the area of SF, Vantaa is more than twice SF’s area, and Espoo is closer to three times SF’s area, so, yes, that tri-city is more people than SF, but, no, it&#x27;s not “in a similar area”.')
