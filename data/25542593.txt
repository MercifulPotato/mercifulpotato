I follow an ovolactovegetarian diet, and I exercise <i>heavily</i> six days a week. I find it really difficult to take even the minimum 50 grams of <i>complete</i> (which is crucial) protein just from eggs, dairy, and plant-based foods. Having the chance of eating cruelty-free meat would save me from thinking so much about coming up with ways of fulfilling my nutritional requirements.')
