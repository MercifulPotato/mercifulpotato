That’s credit risk.<p>Except in RH case, their customers have already transferred money from their bank account to RH. RH should have 100% of the money they need for normal buys. The reasoning given doesn’t actually make sense.<p>(unless it was margin accounts  that were the problem, in which case RH should stop issuing margin. or the “instant deposit” feature. They could just disable that until they could afford it again.)')
