An SD card slot would be fine, and if there&#x27;s something like MagSafe, I&#x27;d want USB C charging to still be possible so I can just travel with a single kind of charger and cable.<p>Lots of random USB-charging gadgets have switched to USB C.  I like the idea of making USB A, one of the worst port designs of all time, die a slow painful death.  I am very happy with my thumb drive-shaped portable card read that has USB C on one side and A on the other.')
