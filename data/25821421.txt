The article discusses a new french law that tries to &quot;backport&quot; (if I understood correctly) the DSA changes into the french legislation to skip the time needed for DSA to be discussed and finalized on the european level.<p>And doing a quick CTRL+F in the DSA proposal I found a section which I think is similar to &quot;section 230&quot;.<p><i>The proposal maintains the liability rules for providers of intermediary services set out in the e-Commerce Directive – by now established as a foundation of the digital economy and instrumental to the protection of fundamental rights online. Those rules have been interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union, thus providing valuable clarifications and guidance. Nevertheless, to ensure an effective harmonisation across the Union and avoid legal fragmentation, it is necessary to include those rules in a Regulation. It is also appropriate to clarify some aspects of those rules to eliminate existing disincentives towards voluntary own-investigations undertaken by providers of intermediary services to ensure their users’ safety and to clarify their role from the perspective of consumers in certain circumstances. Those clarifications should help smaller, innovative providers scale up and grow by benefitting from greater legal certainty.</i><p>So something similar to section 230 already exists in EU legislation.')
