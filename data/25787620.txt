Item(by='dirkt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610691457, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25776589, text='Not for twitter, but on a european reddit: Starting at about the refugee &quot;crisis&quot;, I have seen regularly postings using the following script:<p>- newly created account (or, in the more sophisticated variants, an account created some time ago with a few meaningless postings)\n- ask for help, or ask a question to distract from the actual goal\n- somewhere in the text, throw in some association that should stick (like &quot;refugees steal&quot;, or &quot;refugees sexually assault woman&quot;, as a fact that doesn&#x27;t need discussion)\n- when confronted, the only answers were contentless excuses, like &quot;but I am really asking this for my mother, who can&#x27;t use a computer&quot;. Never any attempt to engage in actual discussion.<p>The reaction to these is that people usually address the question, don&#x27;t address the baseless association, which probably then starts to stick in the unconsciousness of at least some of them.<p>And on the political side, at the same time there was an increase in support for extremist and nationalist, anti-foreigner parties.<p>Though of course how much such messages contribute to that is difficult to say.')
