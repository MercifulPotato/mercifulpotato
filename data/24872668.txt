It&#x27;s reasonable to disagree with that - it&#x27;s a difficult judgement call. But, people seem to be caught up in pointing out why a CEO wouldn&#x27;t normally want to send this kind of email, not focusing on the more interesting point which is whether or not the threat from Trump justifies this kind of breaking of norms. In a way, breaking those norms is a feature, not a bug - it highlights how seriously he&#x27;s taking this message that he would risk damage to his company to deliver it.')
