You can try and train people to write good code or follow best practices but from what I have seen, you&#x27;re swimming against strong currents.<p>What we have here is the: &quot;I don&#x27;t get it, why don&#x27;t you read this 500 pages manual and type in those 10 commands to print your document&quot; era of computing.
