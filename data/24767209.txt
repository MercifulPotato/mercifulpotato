Actually countering Russian military capacity really isn&#x27;t an issue any more, and Britain and France have enough nukes to act as a deterrent.<p>Russia is a threat, but in the annoying neighbours who keeps holding loud parties, deal drugs and litter the streets and who&#x27;s dog keeps crapping on your lawn kind of way. You don&#x27;t want to do anything to encourage them, but actually your uncle is in the police and you have two cousins in the Army, and if the neighbours tried anything really serious, reality would assert itself pretty fast, and not in their favour.<p>The US is keeping it&#x27;s military presence in Europe to serve US strategic interests, yes versus Russia but also with respect to the Middle East. US operations in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan are heavily supported from bases in Europe. Pulling out those bases would cripple US ability to support those operations and project power across large swathes of Euraisa and Africa.')
