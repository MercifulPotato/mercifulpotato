It&#x27;s time to resocialize people.<p>Proper incentive? Like being thrown into jail which is not designed to rehabilitate those people?<p>It looks to me that this is a very good approach on how its handled in the USA. Not solving any real issues, making sure people land in jail and when they are out, continuing what they where doing before. Additional more police force, more video cameras, more survailance systems, more guns (don&#x27;t forget the guns!) etc.<p>Sounds similar to &#x27;war of drugs&#x27; which works as well as the USA prison system.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, perhaps USA is just so so much different then the rest of the world but the USA has the most people incarcerated per 100,000 residents of the whole world. Just let that sink in and question yourself if there is just something not working.<p>&quot;The U.S. incarceration rate is 693 per 100,000 residents â€”compared to 76 per 100,000 in Germany&quot;')
