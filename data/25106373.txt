That’s a relatively small chunk of the overall OSS community which is well known specially because maintainers have a personal desire or financial incentive to increase adoption.<p>Far more often projects are released as OSS because sharing a project is a net benefit to the world and costs the donator nothing.   That’s really the central idea of the OSS movement, when copying is free it’s easy to be generous.  Forcing a social obligation is therefore toxic to the OSS community as releasing software becomes expensive.')
