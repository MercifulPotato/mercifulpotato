Julia is high performance - in the same class as C, C++, Rust etc (perhaps 1.5x slower on average, but still pretty fast). This allows you to write <i>all</i> your code in Julia rather than just the surface level wrapper.<p>Then, because it&#x27;s 20 years younger than Python, it has tonnes of ergonomics you would expect of a modern language: A nice, built-in package manager. Good code introspection. Easy ability to call C. An actually usable REPL. Built-in unit testing etc.')
