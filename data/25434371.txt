Once you create your own custom page (see sample - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rob.withlaguna.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rob.withlaguna.com&#x2F;</a>) you&#x27;ll be able to import your trades automatically (Plaid), notify followers&#x2F;friends through text, and grow an audience.<p>In our beta we have casual users sharing with friends &amp; family to keep them updated, new traders sharing on their social media to build an audience, and existing traders more deeply connecting with their loyal followers through text. We even have someone using it as a faster way to see their portfolio holdings over Robinhood.<p>Would love to get some feedback from HN! What do you like&#x2F;dislike? What features should we add?')
