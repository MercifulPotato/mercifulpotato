I am more concerned about the amount of market influence and power wrapped up in Google (Search and Ads), Microsoft (able to freely steal ideas like Slack and turn it into Teams by leveraging O365), Amazon (amassed capital letting them compete in any segment), Apple (acquiring companies and then over-verticalizing) etc. We need a revision of anti-trust law for the modern era, to encourage competition against these giant conglomerates.<p>I think there will be a lot of ancillary benefits from breaking up these organizations that should be welcome to all parts of the political spectrum. Distribution of market power means distribution of financial outcomes as well. It lowers barriers for others to challenge incumbents. It allows companies to decentralize from a few overly-powerful city-states. And so on.')
