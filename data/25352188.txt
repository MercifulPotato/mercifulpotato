These are a special type of mental health hospital that deal with people who are detained under the mental health act, and who have complex risk behaviours. Some, but not all, patients will have some criminal justice system involvement in their care. So, for example, they may have been in prison and then become mentally ill. Or they may have been mentally ill when they committed their offence and been sent by the courts to hospital.  But some of the patients in a medium secure unit will not have any criminal justice system involvement in their treatment.')
