People who don&#x27;t know how to jailbreak their devices themselves see their friends phones and ask them for help or even bring their phone to phone repair shops to get them jailbroken and customized (in the same manner that you don&#x27;t have to be a mechanic to modify your car: you simply need to have the money to pay a body shop for whatever you want; I gave a TEDx talk on this topic a while back called &quot;Even Software Should Have Screws&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ReKCp9K_Jqw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ReKCp9K_Jqw</a>). Honestly, I am not sure if I&#x27;ve <i>ever</i> heard an &quot;end user&quot; <i>ask</i> to be prevented from doing something they actually wanted to do... the only people who seem to have that particular kink are developers attempting to justify the bondage and control ecosystem they are a part of maintaining; everyone else either finds out after it is too late, had to accept it for some other reasonable (but <i>entirely unrelated</i>) tradeoff such as &quot;I wanted a phone with a good camera and both of the top options from Apple&#x2F;Samsung were locked down&quot;, or are &quot;stuck&quot; due to ecosystem lock-in and networking effects (it doesn&#x27;t just cost you a new phone to escape the jail you are in: you will have to re-purchase all of the software you already own and even lose access entirely to some unique services... and again, all of this is <i>entirely unrelated</i> to the actual issue in question).')
