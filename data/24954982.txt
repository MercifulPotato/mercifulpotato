Fortunately we were able to resolve this with them (by paying them some extra money to sign a CLA), if it wouldn&#x27;t have worked we would&#x27;ve removed and rewritten the code instead. It&#x27;s silly but legally it&#x27;s doable.<p>Of course this strategy doesn&#x27;t work if a large part of your codebase originates from third-party contributors, but from my experience Github projects receive mostly small&#x2F;cosmetic PRs from non-core developers (not saying that those contributions are not valuable btw).')
