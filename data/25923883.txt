Modal editing. I use the boon package for emacs, but basically vim<p>2. Sticky keys. Basically, I don&#x27;t have to hold down any modifiers, I just press Ctrl then press N for example. Or two Ctrl to lock it, NNNNNN, then Ctrl to return to normal. On macs this is in the Accessibility app under Keyboard. It doesn&#x27;t work so well with Shift + mouse scroll though.<p>3. Kinesis advantage 2<p>4. Dvorak<p>I still sometimes get a bit of pinky pain since I shift and ctrl with my pinkies. With sticky keys, modal editing, and mechanical switches in the Advantage 2, it&#x27;s not really a problem.<p>I learned that the macbook keyboards aren&#x27;t that bad if I use modal editing and sticky modifier keys. Also I need to be careful to avoid so-called &quot;ulnar deviation&quot; of my wrists. This means I lift my wrists, let my fingers hang down more, so I can keep the wrists neutral while hitting shift etc.<p>I don&#x27;t think Dvorak helps much, but I still like it. It was intentionally put together. I think it helped to learn Dvorak and the concave key well of Advantage 2 at the same time. I never learned qwerty on the Advantage 2 or Dvorak on macbook keyboard. I want to try the programmer&#x27;s dvorak layout as well for lisp.')
