I really did. I&#x27;ve worked in everything from a sysadmin at a debt collection firm to developing data entry software for a travel agency, to health insurance data science to identity management for a University with 20,000 students (actually, that one was rewarding. Working for a Uni didn&#x27;t feel like a total waste).<p>I dreamed of getting back into a University and getting my PhD so I could earn way less, but at least try to get grants for research I wanted to do and have summers to develop the classwork so I could lie to--<i>cough-cough</i>--I mean &quot;tech&quot; students. I got my masters, but PhD programs were much more challenging to get into, and my GRE scores are terrible. With the way Universities have turned so ideological and anti-free thought, I doubt I&#x27;ll ever actually go back.<p>I lived in some other countries (did software there too), took a year off to backpack, ran out of money, took more tech jobs ... and now, I feel like I&#x27;m okay working tech for the rest of my life. I&#x27;ll probably be 100% remote from here on out (I have before 2020 at one place) and plan on moving out as far away from the city as I can (and still have decent enough Internet to work).<p>Sure my life might be wasting away playing video games, blogging or attempting to learn banjo while working for another firm soaking up money ... but I&#x27;ve had adventures. I&#x27;ve literally traveled around the world. I might not hit a lot of my goals .. but man, I&#x27;ve done quite a bit and I&#x27;m not even 40 yet.<p>I&#x27;m sad due to the pandemic, but at least I&#x27;m not bitter. I know if I was stuck locked up in Chicago with younger me, that kid would not have made it. My old project owner at a job sent me an e-mail about how her Italian roommate had committed suicide during the UK lock downs. Could have been me. It&#x27;s only luck and timing that it isn&#x27;t.')
