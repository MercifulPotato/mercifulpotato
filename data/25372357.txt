I would say that what we deem &quot;imaginable&quot; is a pretty good proxy to what is &quot;probable&quot;, especially in the long run.<p>There&#x27;s also a dishonest sleight of hand here - when determining a course of action, it&#x27;s not the probability alone you look at, but the probability multiplied by the expected harm. The probability of getting in a car accident is low, but the <i>expected harm</i> is high enough that the hassle of wearing a seatbelt each time you go for a drive is still worth it. If he were being consistent, Pinker would say: &quot;why are you putting on a seatbelt? Just because you can imagine a car accident, doesn&#x27;t mean it will happen today&quot;.<p>The purpose of the &#x27;long bet&#x27; exercise isn&#x27;t really about the money - it&#x27;s about our ability to reason about the future. So talking about these things as abstract probabilities as if they are the outcomes of sporting events, not the lives of a million people, is dishonest bordering on morally repugnant.')
