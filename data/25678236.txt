Item(by='camhart', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610057077, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25672202, text='I agree, I cannot see how all the stories could be true.  I <i>believe</i> one to be true, and the rest to be false.  Does that mean I have scientific proof that one is true?  No, and I have never claimed to.  Does that mean I&#x27;m asking you to believe what I believe, simply because I believe it?  No, I&#x27;d never do that.  But this is beyond the point.<p>My arguments on this thread have been about the claim that <i>all</i> religion is based on &quot;misinformation&quot;.  I feel a bit like a broken record here, but in order for something to be misinformation it must be proven false.  Claims can either be proven true, proven false, or simply not proven true or false.  There are 3 states--not 2. \n Religions fall into the last category, where the claims have not been proven or disproved.  It&#x27;s not misinformation until it&#x27;s proven false.  It&#x27;s also not information until it&#x27;s proven true.  Which gets back to the key differences between faith and scientific fact.  Faith is belief in something not (yet) proven true or false.  Belief in science is based on something science has proven true or false.  You&#x27;re trying to take the way you approach science, likely because it&#x27;s what you&#x27;ve been surrounded by in your recent life, and force it upon religious views.  It doesn&#x27;t work, because the basis for faith in a religion implies that the thing isn&#x27;t proven using science.<p>&gt; Statistically speaking, the answer is because it is the one your parents believed. It&#x27;s hard to explain away the eerie correlation between a person&#x27;s religion and where they were born. Why is it that a child born in the Middle-East is so likely to follow Islam, a child in the West Christianity, in India Hindu, etc. etc.? It&#x27;s almost as if these religions are a product of the people, not some greater truth.<p>What environment have you been raised in?  Western world, analytically educated?  Atheism is a religion.  It&#x27;s the belief that there is no higher power--but it&#x27;s still a belief... based on faith (not science).  Science has neither proven or disproved the existence of God.  Agnostic is also a religion based on faith.  Whatever your actual beliefs or lack of beliefs are, it&#x27;s not based on scientific fact.<p>The word &quot;myth&quot; implies the account is proven false (through science).  It&#x27;s not accurate to use, unless you&#x27;re able to prove the religious accounts false.<p>I&#x27;m not asking you to believe me.  I&#x27;m not asking you to believe in my religion.  I&#x27;m simply stating that claiming all religions are based on misinformation cannot be done until they&#x27;re all proven false.<p>You&#x27;ve made great leaps about why I believe without understanding me, my faith, or the process I went through (and continue going through) to obtain and keep my faith.  You can make as many assumptions as you want, but they haven&#x27;t been accurate and likely won&#x27;t be if you continue to do so.<p>&gt; What role does &quot;faith&quot; play when appraising the above questions? Are you applying &quot;faith&quot; in the same way to the above as you do to your religion? Probably not.<p>I do not have faith in any of the claims you&#x27;ve made, no matter how reasonable.  I&#x27;m not arguing that any one of them is true or false.<p>&gt; The most interesting question worth answering is: Why do you believe the myths that you do?<p>I agree, this is the more interesting question.  But it&#x27;s not something I wish to discuss on a public forum.  It&#x27;s deeply personal.  If you are genuinely interested, I&#x27;d happily share it in a different venue.')
