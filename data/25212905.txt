Like learning a new language, if you aren&#x27;t really serious it isn&#x27;t going to happen, and going at it slower makes it take disproportionately longer, making it disproportionately more likely you&#x27;ll get frustrated and give up before you succeed at it.<p>As for younger versus older, I&#x27;d say this is a screening process that filters young people out even more if anything. When it comes to students in a MS program, older students are much more able to handle it in my experience.')
