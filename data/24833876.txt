In fact, I&#x27;d say the great majority of bugs were fixed if not all. I&#x27;ve never had a bug fixed in open source software I&#x27;ve submitted bugs for, and I&#x27;ve even had trouble getting them even assessed as bugs in the first place.<p>Did you pay them as much as you paid for proprietary software?')
