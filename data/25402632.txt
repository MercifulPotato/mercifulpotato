You&#x27;re right, &quot;government&quot; does do things that, prospectively, contemporaneously and&#x2F;or retrospectively are inappropriate, unfair and&#x2F;or just plain bad&#x2F;stupid.<p>That said, at least in the United States, &quot;government&quot; isn&#x27;t some foreign agency or third party.  Government is <i>us</i>.  All of us, through those <i>we select</i> as representatives in our town, county, state and federal governments.<p>We can (and, in my estimation, should) do better.  But I believe it&#x27;s incorrect to place blame on some nebulous &quot;government&quot;, as if it&#x27;s not us Americans.<p>A good way to <i>start</i> &quot;doing better&quot; would be to remove the perverse incentives that make money the primary currency of our political system.<p>Independent, non-partisan creation of local&#x2F;state&#x2F;federal election districts is a good idea too.<p>That&#x27;s a huge problem.  For example[0], in the 2018  elections, 53% of Wisconsinites voted for Democratic <i>state</i> (assembly and senate) candidates, but those candidates only won 36% of seats in those bodies.<p>That&#x27;s just one example. I&#x27;m not singling out any particular party, there certainly are states with Democratic majorities that have created district maps that favor their candidates too.<p>In any case, I agree with OP, but just wanted to point out that, at least in the US (and many other places too), we <i>are</i> the government, not downtrodden serfs crushed under the heel of some other group.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2018&#x2F;12&#x2F;04&#x2F;several-layers-republican-power-grabbing-wisconsin&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2018&#x2F;12&#x2F;04&#x2F;several-l...</a><p>Edit: Fixed typographical error and redundant wording.')
