A disaster can take phone lines out as well as electricity. You might not have zero cell phone service if towers are working. Land lines would get clogged at times and simply fail you (I&#x27;ve had this happen).<p>You generally have <i>some</i> charge on your phone, though, and lots of folks have power banks now - or cars they can charge their phones with.<p>Don&#x27;t forget all the times when disaster strikes and the cell phones are a real help: Car accidents, for example. At one time, you were reliant on you - or someone else - stopping by a house and hoping they&#x27;d be home. And I&#x27;m sure there are lots of other examples of this as well. Now that laws changed, cell phones can pretty much always call 911 as well, even without service at all: This was not the case with phone lines. If the house didn&#x27;t have service, you couldn&#x27;t get help.')
