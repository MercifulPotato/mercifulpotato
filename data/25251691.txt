You can end up with things like passwords, credit card details etc in the logs. If you&#x27;re running a log concentrator, now they&#x27;re in the concentrator - and did you remember to set ACLs on who can read from the concentrator (assuming the servers have good ACLs already for reading logs directly from prod servers)?<p>In dev, sure (assuming local disk only). In prod, not in the form documented.')
