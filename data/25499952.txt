It&#x27;s quite common to point out the systemic racism in law enforcement when it comes to many common crimes.  Why is it that people in this thread are speaking as if this can only be applied to jaywalking?  It comes off as very dishonest.  At some point, it made sense to enough people that jaywalking have a penalty that it was written into law, and it wasn&#x27;t because a bunch of people agreed that it would allow cops to punish more black people.  Doesn&#x27;t mean they were right, but it&#x27;s hardly different from an intent perspective than any other crime on the books.  The only difference between jaywalking and speeding(another common way to be pulled over while black&#x2F;brown) is that far fewer people consider it reasonable.<p>Is it just because jaywalking is hardly a crime, thus its only conceivable utility is in discrimination?  I&#x27;m just trying to understand what you&#x27;re getting at.')
