Here are a bunch of things that I would consider high priority to implement if I were making this myself, many of which you have maybe thought of:<p>- Undo!  I accidentally clobbered my carefully planned roads while dragging to fill the area adjacent to the road with grass!<p>- Make it a more intelligent about laying roads when dragging (auto-choose the correct road piece to connect to adjacent road properly) to reduce the tedium of having to choose the tiles manually<p>- Likewise when flood-filling with something like the concrete-with-railings, it should flood fill the middle with non-railing pieces and the perimeter with the railing on the  outside.<p>- selection mode, drag to select area, copy-paste<p>It was not clear what the brush menu did, the dialogs with numbers and no explanation were intimidating and nothing interesting happened when I accepted the numbers.')
