Everything was really constrained, and it was super exciting when something broke through a constraint.<p>But now, I think it&#x27;s even cooler, there is just so much we can do with all the computing devices available to us.  We are connected with so much human creativity these days that it really is overwhelming.  Things like raytracing and VR etc are still pushing at edges that makes things exciting, then there are things like raspberry pis, microbits, arduinos, etc are super cool, I still think top end graphics cards are cool.    I think because there really is so much cool stuff, it starts to get hard to appreciate it.')
