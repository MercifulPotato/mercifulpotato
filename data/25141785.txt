Tailwind just felt wrong, and with 15+ years of experience, I&#x27;ve come to trust my intuition. After watching several videos, and reading all the canonical articles on Tailwind, I still wasn&#x27;t convinced this was anything more than a fad full of bad practices.<p>But the one thing I&#x27;ll let trump my intuition is curiosity. So I used Tailwind on a medium-sized project for a couple months and was blown away by the productivity and maintainability. It took using it for a couple weeks to &quot;get it&quot;. I had a positive ROI on this project, even considering the learning curve!<p>If you still think &quot;Tailwind feels wrong, what am I missing?&quot; I&#x27;d suggest reflecting on the following:<p>1) You probably haven&#x27;t actually delved into Tailwind on a non-trivial project. I understand learning a new framework isn&#x27;t a trivial undertaking, but it&#x27;s the only thing standing in your way of discovering your &quot;truth&quot;.<p>2) If you feel Tailwind is too much like inline styles, think of the difference between the infinite possibilities of strings defining a &quot;type&quot; vs. a discrete enum type. Tailwind classes are the enum type values.<p>3) If you&#x27;re struggling to abstract reusable higher-level classes&#x2F;components, the problem might actually be with inconsistent and non-modular design, not CSS tooling. If every page or section is a &quot;unique work of art&quot; then you may have poor UX&#x2F;design.')
