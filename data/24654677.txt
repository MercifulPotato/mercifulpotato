The historical concept of Hamilton is fiction created by historians affected by their own biases. History is interpretation. It isn&#x27;t fact. It isn&#x27;t science.<p>&gt; That nuance is going to be hard for a lot of people to understand.<p>That&#x27;s true for any &quot;history&quot;. Nevermind that almost no historical document&#x2F;artefact&#x2F;etc is the &quot;original&quot;, but the &quot;history&quot; we know is ultimately manufactured fiction. There are facts and then there is history ( which is what is colored in between the facts by historians ).<p>There is Hamilton the actual person, then there is the historical adaptation of Hamilton, the play adaptation, movie adaptation, documentary adaptation, etc which are all fiction.')
