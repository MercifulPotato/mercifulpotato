They can help you publish, including, vitally, providing feedback on the work that you&#x27;ve done and how it fits into the current state of the art in the discipline. And they can advocate for you and get you into a grad program at their schools. Honestly just find a few that have research areas that match what you&#x27;re doing and email or call them.')
