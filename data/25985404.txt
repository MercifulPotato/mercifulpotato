But that is not what you are saying.<p>Don’t use it for relational data. Don’t use it as your primary data store.<p>At the enterprise I work at, I’ve had success delivering features where data science would have some job that aggregates production data and dumps it to kafka. Then we’ll map it and dump it in mongo. Stick a .net core microservice on top for retrieval. Works great, has none of the problems mentioned in that article. Of course, this might not make sense if you’re not big enough to where you need kafka, kubernetes, etc<p>But “Never use it” is certainly not good advice.')
