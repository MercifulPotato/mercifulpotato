How many people do you know that have been speaking English for years but still miss articles (&#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;the&#x27;)? It is still very easy to understand these people. We could say the same about tones, diction, and accents. Plenty of people that don&#x27;t sound native can easily be understood. You&#x27;d actually be surprised how much you can butcher a language and still be able to communicate (this is really helpful to language learners!). There&#x27;s so much fuzziness here that it I haven&#x27;t seen any compiler (plugin, shell, etc) anywhere near this level of fuzziness.<p>Tldr: Compilers you need to be fairly precise, natural languages you barely need to be in the ball park.')
