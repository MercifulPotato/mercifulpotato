Maybe having come from Canada is a contributor to that.<p>I&#x27;m guessing he&#x27;s being highlighted as an unusual and inspirational role model case for an American kid (if he were American).  Football, Baltimore, black.  That example growing-up environment does not exactly favor a kid to be encouraged to pursue intellectual strengths unless you have an incredible teacher or parents for example.  At worst, you are even harrassed for trying to escape your environment, and called a class traitor for thinking you&#x27;re better than everyone else.   This is a big problem.')
