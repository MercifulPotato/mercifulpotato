The generations of people who owned slaves raised the generations of people that enforced segregation, and those generations raised the people today who enforce racial discrimination and oppose racial justice.<p>And like you said, this isn&#x27;t far-back history, segregation in the US was <i>recent</i>. People have this flowery view that racism just went away and that slavery just suddenly stopped mattering. But the effects are still very much with us today. A few generations isn&#x27;t enough to eliminate a culturally pervasive, harmful ideology.')
