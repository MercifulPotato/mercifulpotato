The entire position is a pre-emptive move to stop government from stepping in to regulate the company.  If you fire the person the second they talk about something they feel you&#x27;re doing wrong, it kind of defeats the entire purpose (IMO).<p>You literally hired this person to the e-brake on your AI program and then fire them when they tell you it&#x27;s time to stop.<p>I&#x27;m not saying I agree or disagree with this particular firing, but there&#x27;s a very good reason for the company to employ someone who publicly disagrees with the way a particular department is being run or a decision they&#x27;ve made.<p>Candidly: this would be another example of why unions exist.  Just because you publicly disagree with the company doesn&#x27;t mean they should have carte blanche to fire you.')
