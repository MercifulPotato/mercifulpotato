It only costs 50$ (pay once, no subscription, free updates ; also there is a promotion of 25$ currently). You get all the advanced features that photoshop can offer, like non destructive layers, smart inpainting, RAW development, smart brushes, export layers, and so on.<p>Affinity photo is compatible with their other softwares like Affinity Designer (alternative to Illustrator) and Affinity Publisher (alternative to InDesign).')
