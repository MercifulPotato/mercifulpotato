We aren&#x27;t trying hard enough to solve death.<p>Here&#x27;s a reverse salient &#x2F; step function improvement:<p>Clone monoclonal decephalized humans and grow them like plants for blood, organs, and basic research. Remove their heads before birth with developmental gene cutoff of neural crest development, or for the easier path, surgically decapitate them before they have brains.<p>Grow them in transgenic pig uteruses, then hook them up to respirators and gastric feeder tubes. Electronically stimulate their hearts. Inject them with hormones. Grow these clones into adulthood and keep them in vast warehouses.<p>They don&#x27;t have brains, so they&#x27;re not persons. (I&#x27;m not looking to debate this with anyone who disagrees.)<p>Suddenly we have the best experimental platform for researching every non-brain disorder. We can do studies experimentally rather than population summary statistics and identify all the negative environmental and dietary inputs.<p>Infinite insulin, infinite blood, infinite organs. Nobody dies waiting for a transplant. Bonus: the clones don&#x27;t express surface HLAs and epitopes that trigger immune responses that require lifelong immune suppression.<p>We can put young blood and young organs into people. Replace thymuses, the leading cause of immune system decline.<p>Today&#x27;s approaches in biology are punch card slow. We&#x27;re doing double blind clean room science because we&#x27;re too afraid. The field is content with running gels, and that&#x27;s why I stopped pursing it academically and am trying to forge my way with money. We have to try harder, bolder things.<p>The field needs an injection of the engineering mindset. This isn&#x27;t the only thing that needs to change, but it&#x27;s a start.<p>The human body is a machine. We can duplicate and clone these machines for spare parts and basic research.<p>Spin off the tech and do the same for cows and pigs, and suddenly you have ethical meat that isn&#x27;t fake.<p>If I ever have a big exit, I&#x27;m throwing my weight into this problem.<p>I have no doubt we could reduce deaths by cancer and heart disease if we had this platform. I also think we&#x27;d drastically increase health span.<p>If you want a longer life for yourself and your loved ones, clone humans.<p>The company that does this will be the biggest company in all biotech. Every other company will license your supply, and hospitals will be buying from you constantly. It&#x27;s got a worldwide market, too.<p>If we don&#x27;t do it, China will.')
