The &#x27;left&#x27; wing of the US is comparable to the moderately centre of the UK (maybe a bit to the right actually). They can&#x27;t think as one group or groups yet because they are just beginning to actually get a grip of the fundamentals.<p>Adding in, before US folks bite this comment. Please understand that Socialism is not universal healthcare, it is not the right to reliable and inexpensive housing and it is not feeding the children of your country before they starve. These are basic human rights. When you parade around wanting to defend free speech, why not defend these basic human principles? You cant speak if you are unable to due to rent prices going up and not being able to feed your family. Or going to the doctors or university costs you your whole life.')
