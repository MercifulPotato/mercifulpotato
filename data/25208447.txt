You linked a single-core one, and Zen 3 isn&#x27;t using 10x the power in that single-threaded comparison, either.<p>Also the 27W TDP i7-1185G7 is keeping up with the also around 25w TDP M1 in spec2017 single-threaded. M1 is still faster, but more in the realm of a typical generational improvement.')
