Electric bikes offer a completely different appeal, they&#x27;re svelte, light, and quiet. The first electric dirt bike I ever saw marketed, the Zero, was advertised as a special-ops vehicle for quiet night-time operations--the stealth was one of the biggest appeals! The same goes for riding on trails out in nature, no loud ICE is a huge plus in that context.')
