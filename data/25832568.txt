A sufficiently &quot;russian&quot; reader will be able to see immediately the general case from these very complete examples.  Noether&#x27;s theorem is only missing in name, not in content.<p>&gt; The typesetting is also a crime against humanity - they should be done similarly to the Feynman lectures, so typed up in LaTeX rather than whatever they are now<p>The typeseting of the french edition of L&amp;L is extraordinarily beautiful.  I&#x27;m not sure that is is possible to reach this typographical elegance with freely available LaTeX packages.  On the other hand, the re-typed Feynman lectures are a disgrace, and an objectively worsening in quality from the first editions.')
