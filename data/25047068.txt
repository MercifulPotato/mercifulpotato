Item(by='hnracer', descendants=None, kids=[25048781], score=None, time=1605022456, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25045967, text='&gt; The idea that Islam is just destined to be violent and chaotic<p>I agree with you on this point, and this isn&#x27;t my claim. My only claim is that the doctrine plays some non-trivial causal role in the entire picture, in that it provides motive in addition to the geopolitical context. I also agree with you that without the spark of geopolitical circumstance, the doctrine itself may not be a <i>sufficient condition</i> for war&#x2F;terrorism etc. It does however acts as a significant magnifier.<p>Consider this thought experiment: If the Quran (or Bible for that matter) were instead absolute pacifistic in stance: explicitly condemning all political violence and terrorism, all war except that which is strictly defensive, and explicitly outlines a delineation between doctrine &amp; state -- would we see more or less conflict, war, terrorism, etc?<p>These are not impotent documents that play zero role in motivating (or at least, failing to attenuate) specific behavior as a direct outcome of the prescriptions outlined in the text. To an extent they&#x27;re used as a post hoc justification, but they also play a motivating role (especially if we take the words of Islamist terrorists at face value).<p>We have evidence of this causal role (doctrine to behavior) by looking at governance in some Muslim majority countries that adopt Sharia, e.g. in Iran. Without this specific doctrine, their system of governance would in a literal sense be entirely different. If the Quran prescribes that the state should be secular, I believe that would have had quite a large causal impact on the Arabic world.<p>Another example of the causal role of doctrine was when Christians cherry-picked parts of the bible in support of slavery. If the Bible was less self-contradictory in this instance, it&#x27;s easy to see that it would&#x27;ve been easier to eliminate slavery faster than it happened.<p>It&#x27;s also interesting that the only time that the doctrine to action causal path is contested is in the cast of Islamist terrorism. Why does this get contested but everyone accepts a causal role when it comes to white supremacist terrorism, Japanese motives in WW2, and Nazi motives in WW2 (partly driven by anti-semitic beliefs&#x2F;propaganda, in addition to the more pragmatic Lebensraum motive and a  wounded national ego after Treaty of Versailles &amp; WW1 loss)?')
