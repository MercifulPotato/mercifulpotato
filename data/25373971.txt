Item(by='495636483', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607610342, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25372084, text='I like the term &quot;Yak shaving&quot;, however the story told was quite anticlimactic. Yak at a zoo? Really?<p>Why not go all the way to Tibet. (Acknowledging the exclusive western perspective here. I fail to think of an analogy for the west...)<p>There is an opportunity missed pointing out the ignored complexity of related implied conditionals (like flying across the globe), which were consequently not exploded onto the described stack. That is, within the narrative. Missed, because the scope of conditional complexity is pretty much arbitrary (point in the reader&#x27;s resonance); &quot;importance&quot; is mostly a matter of subjective perception merely experienced as rational thoughts. Every egosyntonic thought is experienced as rational.<p>Internal task prioritization is part of executive functioning and e.g. broken in ADHD (everything feels important). However, it&#x27;s perceived as consistent with the internal model of reality and not foreign (aka egosyntonic; &quot;rational&quot;) no matter the expression and functional applicability.<p>There is the problem. It&#x27;s not a question of better thinking or simple rules for analysing a problem, it&#x27;s a problem asking for an hypervisor, who cares about time management&#x2F;energy expenditure, not reasonability. For some people an instance can be internalized, or even just works out-of-the-box; for others it needs to be externalized.')
