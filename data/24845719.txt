None of those features have a performance cost, if used according to some simple guidelines.<p>In fact, multiple dispatch is essential to get good performance, abstract types have a cost if explicitly used inside struct definitions, but that&#x27;s why you use parametric types, and abstract types do not have a cost in function signatures.<p>Macros are expanded at compile-time, and at least have no runtime cost, in fact they are often used for <i>improved</i> performance.<p>I think there&#x27;s some fundamental misunderstanding going on here, but I&#x27;m not sure what it is. Or do you mean to say that if it is <i>possible</i> to write slow code in a language, then only a subset of that language has good performance? If that is the case, I don&#x27;t know how to respond.')
