If features a lot of the same people than folklore.org, to the point one could consider it an Apple &quot;side story&quot;, though there are also future Googlers and people who built Android.<p>Here&#x27;s the trailer: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uTdyb-RWNKo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uTdyb-RWNKo</a><p>I found it interesting. There is a bit of hagiography going on, though (and note the trailer seems way more antagonistic towards Sculley than the documentary actually is.)<p>One thing I found striking is that none of these people seem to need or care about money. They say so explicitly, &quot;we didn&#x27;t care about the money&quot;, and that it was all about the vision and passion. Yet somehow they managed to remain clothed and well fed. If that&#x27;s not the definition of privilege, I don&#x27;t know what is!')
