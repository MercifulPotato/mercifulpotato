In my case a couple Git\nrepos.<p>It worked fine at first but after a while it got really\nconfused, to a point where Nextcloud randomly decided that the\nolder version on the server was actually the more recent one,\nand synced that folder back onto my local, updated repository.\nAnd I was the only person touching those folders, the Nextcloud\nserver was only used as a backup during that period.<p>It&#x27;s got a couple neat features, but problems like this are\nreally not excusable. When the one core feature breaks in\neveryday situations for users doing version control it&#x27;s not a\ngood look.')
