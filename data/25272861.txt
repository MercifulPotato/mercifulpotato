(don&#x27;t remember which one is fastest, but it&#x27;s the fastest one) Encoding with the fastest available profile just happens to run at 30fps, so it&#x27;s still not enough to for realtime encoding even via CPU, if you account for the fact that CPU will start throttling soon after you start loading all 4 cores at once to the max.<p>So I recorded the above by saving raw frames. :)<p>Video image quality sucks of course. (that frame counter is all white uniform background in reality)')
