The reason nobody uses Usenet is that unmoderated newsgroups were taken over by nazis and trolls, and moderated newsgroups have no particular advantage over forums as far as &quot;free speech&quot; goes.<p>(Though I take issue with the idea that moderation somehow implies less free speech.  It is hard to express an idea when you are buried under a pile of off-topic trolling and nazi conspiracy theories.)')
