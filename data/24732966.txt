To get a sense of the cost ceiling per person, look at the least cost-effective way to rent a monthly desk which is to do it as an individual in a co-working space.<p>Here&#x27;s one price list for coworking space in Campbell (Silicon Valley)\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1iljwYScQ4d5F4rUcQN-9XH0D8E2h71cn&#x2F;view" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1iljwYScQ4d5F4rUcQN-9XH0D8E2...</a><p>An open office desk is $325&#x2F;month, up to a dedicated cubicle for $725&#x2F;month.<p>So for a junior engineer at $150K salary, that&#x27;s between 2.6% to 5.8% of their base comp in office space cost.<p>Now, of course, a company renting tens of thousands of square feet at a time gets better rates due to scale, so the percentage is less than those examples.')
