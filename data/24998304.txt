Cases which don&#x27;t run in local law conflicting EU regulations can&#x27;t end up there.<p>EU regulations don&#x27;t cover everything and do often have large margins of interpretation. They are generally not laws but regulations about making laws.<p>So there is a good chance your case will never have a chance to end up there even if it continues to escalate.<p>Edit: also the ECJ does work different in the results they produce then you think, e.g. they can rule that a certain court action&#x2F;law&#x2F;etc. is in beach if regulations and anull it to some degree, but that didn&#x27;t mean they can e.g. force gurillamail to be rehosted. At most they could &quot;annul&quot; a france court discussion that the takedown for given reasons was legal. Which seems similar but is a massive difference as they then could argue that the takedown was still legal due to other reasons and still win (or just delay it further).')
