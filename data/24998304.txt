Cases which don&#x27;t run in local law conflicting EU regulations can&#x27;t end up there.<p>EU regulations don&#x27;t cover everything and do often have large margins of interpretation. They are generally not laws but regulations about making laws.<p>So there is a good chance your case will never have a chance to end up there even if it continues to escalate.')
