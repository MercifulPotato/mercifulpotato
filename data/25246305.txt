There&#x27;s already a great big slab of metal visible at the base of the camera with what looks like an easy access path from the processor. If these easy DIY heat sinks catch on, someone&#x27;s bound to make a longer heat sink, bend the end over in a vise, and tuck it in alongside that existing mass of metal to incorporate it into the heat sink mass. The copper alone doubled the time to overheat, adding that much mass should do substantially more, and almost certainly provide a heat path to tripod mounts.')
