All of these prices which I cited for France&#x2F;Germany are for those who don&#x27;t have any health insurance. So reduction of cost by 8-10 times should be commended.<p>But for a poor Indian, 7$ is still a substantial amount of money. For a middle class Indian, it&#x27;s quite affordable though.')
