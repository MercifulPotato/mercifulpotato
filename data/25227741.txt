Nelson Mandela. We honor our leaders and always have.<p>Only if we don&#x27;t study our history, and have a very low bar. Ignoring, for a second, the question of leadership-vs-leaderlessness (which is important of course), let&#x27;s remember that:<p>1. While Lincoln led the US to a civil war which abolished formal slavery, his own opinion on black people was quite horrid:<p>&gt; I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races â€¦ I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of Negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races from living together on terms of social and political equality.<p>and indeed, the US took very little action to rectify the historical injustice.<p>2. Churchill was a staunch imperialist in terms of his public career, and is hated by the peoples of the middle east for his involvement in the continued occupation and the  continued support and sometimes setup of oppressive puppet governments in British areas of control. At home, he was a tool of the rich in terms of state spending on welfare and other issues. In fact, even when it comes to Nazi Germany, Churchill supported non-intervention in Spain, where a significant British intervention against the Fascists would have had significant effect on later events.<p>3. Mandela is perhaps the most worthy of respect, but it must be remembered that the ANC essentially gave up on ending material, economic white supremacy in South Africa to end formal, legal apartheid. Whites, to this day, control almost all of the land and wealth. And the worst thing about it is that it is now a black government which enforces local white and foreign-multinational property rights against the landless and the poor.')
