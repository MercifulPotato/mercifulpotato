Every stock has a margin requirement, you post cash with the clearing house as a percentage of order flow. When a particular equity becomes highly volatile, the amount of margin you need to post goes up. In GME&#x27;s case, to 100 percent. So when somebody on Robinhood uses instant deposit, Robinhood has no access to your funds for a couple days, but when you buy GME, they need to put up 100 percent collateral on your behalf when they submit your order request. They simply didn&#x27;t have the liquidity to cover all of that.')
