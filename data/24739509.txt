If you really want to make a dent, you collect the evidence and plea for help from a stronger one. (EU, UN, ICJ...)<p>Unless the objective is to provoke a violent reaction and use the bruises to mobilize help in sympathy (problem is who “gets to suffer the bruise”... you, or a random protestor caught in a retaliatory strike)')
