The Human Genome Project was a one time push to establish the capabilities of human genome sequencing, but the field has seen a lot of refinement since then, to apply it both to individuals and to construct a better human reference genome.<p>&gt; New protein sequences don&#x27;t continually get created?<p>As others have said, there are new proteins being engineered by humans. Apart from that there are a lot of organisms that haven&#x27;t been sequenced yet (not even counting niche organisms that haven&#x27;t been discovered yet). Especially in the plant world, sequencing advancements with nanopore sequencing only recently made it economical (and possible) to sequence a lot of the plant genomes that are many times larger than the human one.<p>So Alphafold might be comparable to the Human Genome Project in specific ways.')
