I can only imagine how stressful this must be for you.<p>It must have taken quite some courage to speak up, but that&#x27;s a very good, positive step. It sounds like you may want to seek help, as you&#x27;ve identified you may be depressed.<p>I really encourage you to take that step to speak to someone, and seek some assistance.<p>I know you said you have no one to rely on support, depression can make you feel very alone and isolated. Try to speak to friends or family. I know it can be hard. Give it a try, you may be surprised.<p>Also remember, there are organisations out there that can help. I don&#x27;t know where you are geographically, but I strongly suggest, if you are able to, to go to your local GP if you have one, and tell them how you are feeling. Explore your options for what works best for you.<p>If you don&#x27;t have a GP, see if your workplace has an EAP program that you can call anonymously.<p>If they don&#x27;t, do some research locally and have a look at support groups dealing with depression. (I&#x27;m based in the UK and can recommend some organisations, and if you need some assistance, I&#x27;m happy to explore some options for where you are; I&#x27;m sure lots of people on here could help, too.)<p>You are not alone, and people will be happy to help, and listen. Take that step.<p>You mentioned politics and election stress. Have you considered turning off the news, and disconnecting from Reddit etc.?<p>I&#x27;d also ask, do you do any exercise? Perhaps try going for a walk in a local park regularly, try doing jogging if possible? Try find an activity that suits you, physical exercise is a very good way of alleviating stress and depression. I know it&#x27;s hard and daunting, just try some small steps at first.<p>You&#x27;ve taken a good step sharing. Take another, and another. Good luck. If I can help at all, let me know.')
