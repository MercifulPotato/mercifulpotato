Ant was at least predictable, though left a lot to be desired. Gradle has always been a tangle of DSL that nobody understands, but just gets copied from random examples and Github repos without any understanding of how or why it works.<p>Maven is still the best build system I&#x27;ve used in any language or ecosystem. It is predictable, stable, has a great community of plugins, and uses XML as it was meant to be used, which is far better than the JSON &#x2F; DSL monstrosities I see with newer, &quot;cooler&quot; build tools.')
