I present hnuser123456&#x27;s function:<p>f(n)=n (n Knuth up arrows) n<p>Coming back to Rayo, my number is instead f(10^100) rather than Rayo(10^100), and given the series of lower bounds presented in that article, this should easily dwarf that, unless Rayo&#x27;s will end up growing Knuth arrows faster than linear. I&#x27;m not smart enough to evaluate that though. If it would, wonder if this would beat it:<p>f(n)=n (n Knuth up arrows) n (n Knuth up arrows) n<p>Or n copies of n Knuth up arrows...')
