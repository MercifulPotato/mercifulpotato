The second `let` allocates a new memory location in the activation record; all future mentions of the variable name will refer to the new location.  The old location still exists, and may have references to it already;  references that will continue pointing at the old allocation and will not see anything that happens to the new one.  If the old value has a `Drop` implementation, it will run after the second allocationâ€™s `drop()`.  The two `let` bindings can even have completely different types.')
