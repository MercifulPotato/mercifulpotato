We Europeans tend to like European cars and especially German. Tesla has gained positive traction as it filled a technology vacuum (that they helped create), but it is illusionary to believe that it is the superior choice for most customers once the mainstream manufacturers enter the market full throttle.\nI recently decided to buy a BMW 330e (PEV) at a similar price point of a Tesla model 3 here in Denmark. That surprised even myself as I intended to go for the 3 after many years of wanting a pure electric. I simply couldn’t make the price point match the overall quality of the vehicle. Purely anecdotally, but I believe that many less-fanatic with new tech may choose similarly.')
