I clicked this and THEN smacked enter, and I got a search results page!<p>Of course there are no results in my area (and no way to tell how large a radius it considers &quot;my area&quot;; should I try again with a zip a few miles away? a few dozen miles away?), but now I know there&#x27;s a secret-knock to get into the site.')
