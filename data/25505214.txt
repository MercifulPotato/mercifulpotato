You&#x27;re missing out on a lot of sensor improvements over the years that give things like better low light performance - handy when using a camera for video indoors. It&#x27;s also, unfortunately, close to the best webcam out there. Apple really don&#x27;t seem to have brought the camera improvements from their iPhone range to their MacBooks, apparently their built-in webcams are as bad as everyone else&#x27;s.')
