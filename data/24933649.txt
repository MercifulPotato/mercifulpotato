Stop making that assumption, and see how many ways there are for you to reach a similarly empty universe.<p>&gt;It&#x27;s not optimism; its simple observation of what we have already on Earth in existing life forms.<p>I wish you&#x27;d observe that none of Earth&#x27;s lifeforms have colonies on other planets. Goldfish didn&#x27;t colonize other worlds, is that then a strong argument that Goldfish don&#x27;t exist?<p>What you&#x27;re saying makes no sense: just because animals can colonize a single planet over many generations does not mean they will be able to colonize an entire galaxy in even less time.')
