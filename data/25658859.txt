Once you go through and understand a few hundred coding challenges, things start to repeat themselves and then it just takes practice and consistency.<p>Personally, I find coding challenges fun and even quite enjoyable at times, so I don’t see why it’s a waste of time to get good at them. At the very least, I learned a lot about Java doing them than I would‘ve learned if I did a side project where I‘d need to use some framework or library that’s based on Java.<p>Edit: grammar')
