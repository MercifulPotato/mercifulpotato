Item(by='fakedang', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606512432, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25227855, text='In our home in a Southern Indian state, we have multiple locks, glass shards on the compound walls, a regular police patrol every 2 hours in the night and a watchman for the entire community. We&#x27;re currently in the process of getting a new security camera system and some of our neighbours have gone as far as to get fingerprint enabled locks. But all that doesn&#x27;t stop us from falling victim to petty theft, largely by hired help. A former maid was caught stealing cutlery (not even silverware), another one caught stealing a bunch of forex, and yet another stealing a bunch of cosmetics. Calling a repair person means watching over him while he works so as to ensure that he doesn&#x27;t pilfer parts away - imagine having a few screws stolen here and there from your cupboard, or your bolt lock being stolen. It&#x27;s funny in a way I guess.<p>Some folks, like one of my wealthier uncles, even hires Gurkhas with khukris and guns to guard their house. But his house is right on the highway, so some caution might be adequate.')
