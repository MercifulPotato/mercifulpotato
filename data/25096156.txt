This information is sent out in clear text on your network.<p>Wow, that is bad from a privacy perspective!<p>Since certificate revocation is rare, it makes more sense to simply periodically update a list of revoked certificates instead of repeatedly checking each certificate. That would solve the privacy issue while still allowing certificates to be revoked.<p>OCSP seems like a bad idea for web browsing for similar reasons.')
