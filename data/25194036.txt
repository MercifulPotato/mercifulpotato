I used Red Hat Linuxâ€”not the most minimal distro but I had no idea what I was doing. So when I wanted to print something and couldn&#x27;t install the printing packages, I grabbed the paperback printer manual which described all the low-level commands the printer supported, studied it to find the commands I&#x27;d need and then wrote a simple program that took an image and sent it to the printer. It couldn&#x27;t have been longer than a few hundred lines.<p>The printers back then were simple and came with real reference manuals that documented how to communicate with the printer, so you could really write a simple printing program&#x2F;driver without being a UNIX legend (I am not).')
