Any time I see an ad for something promising to be high quality I am usually disappointed by the actual quality.  Conversely when a free thing is linked on HN and upvoted to the front page it is very likely to actually be high quality.<p>Therefore my biased assumption for links on HN is that P(high_quality | asks_for_money) &lt; P(high_quality | totally_free)<p>I haven&#x27;t recorded enough information to know how badly biased my intuition is.')
