They had their man so they found his crimes.<p>Obviously nobody is going to feel sorry for him, but only getting charged with something because you became a political target over something else entirely is exactly the problem in general. Registering your car in a lower tax state may not be legal but it&#x27;s not exactly uncommon, and plenty of people probably don&#x27;t even realize it&#x27;s illegal.')
