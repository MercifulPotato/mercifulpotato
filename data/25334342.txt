(Or, worse, not being sure what HTML or CSS you should alter or throw away when its corresponding CSS or HTML ends up in the garbage).<p>Separate content and presentation is a great final outcome, but when a project is in flux as it&#x27;s being built, it&#x27;s a burden.<p>EDIT:  Moreover, it&#x27;s not just that the &quot;ship has sailed long ago&quot;; the ship was attacked and sunk.  Frameworks that combine CSS and HTML aren&#x27;t doing so out of neglect; they&#x27;re aggressively rejecting the separate looks&#x2F;content paradigm.')
