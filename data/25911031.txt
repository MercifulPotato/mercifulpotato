Use the code in your project, give the source of your project to anyone you give the binaries to, job done.<p>I&#x27;d encourage you to read the GOLs and some of the legal commentary about them, if you haven&#x27;t already. &quot;Clean&quot; is a value judgment, but as one who routinely handles both open source and commercial license agreements, I&#x27;d never refer to GPL as particularly &quot;clean&quot;, and I doubt I have any colleagues who would.<p>The summary you give is not complete, overall. And it omits a lot of details that can prove important.')
