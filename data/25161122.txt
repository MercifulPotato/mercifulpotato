Increasing telomere length does not reverse aging. In some animals telomere length increases with age.<p>Decrasing senolytic effect as a biomarker is double edged sword.  In general, cell destruction selectively induces death of senescent cells and improves health in humans. Slowing down the effect might increase cancer rate and even shorten expected lifespan. There is no way to know until someone does long term study.')
