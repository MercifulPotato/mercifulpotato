I write in a modular, layered fashion, and try to fork off as many components as possible into standalone projects.<p>I&#x27;m very, very careful about including third-party dependencies. I think that these are the only ones that I use, throughout my projects:<p><pre><code>    SOAPEngine (Paid)\n    ffmpeg\n    VLCLib\n    SwiftKeychain\n</code></pre>\nThe first, I downloaded and installed directly into my repo (no live link), the two video libs, I use Carthage to include from their home repos, and the last, SPM (also from the home repo). No real registries. I am not a fan of CocoaPods. I use Homebrew for some dev utils on my computer, but the above list is what ships.<p>I may have one more, somewhere, but I can&#x27;t remember, and I&#x27;m too lazy to look. We can rest assured that it was not lightly added.')
