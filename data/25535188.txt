Maybe not as well, but I do remember noticing in the original Animal Crossing that there was some correlation between the sounds and the text. Even if it was just the timing and intonation, it could definitely be understood that the lines were actually being spoken in some form. I don&#x27;t think it was TTS because it was too accurate in a really subtle way.<p>Or maybe it was and they tweaked it well enough to work. It&#x27;s been a while, my memory could be off. I don&#x27;t know if it would have been prohibitive on the GameCube to have audio of every line (there were a lot), but I wouldn&#x27;t put it past them to have done so.')
