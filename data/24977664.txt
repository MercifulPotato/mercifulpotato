An example of where this might be useful: You send an email to a friend revealing something sensitive about yourself. A hacker hacks your friend&#x27;s email and leaks it out. Without plausible deniability, everyone can verify cryptographically that you did in fact say that sensitive stuff (assuming your own email didn&#x27;t get hacked). With this technique, people cannot verify whether or not you said it, the email might be a fraud and so people are less likely to believe the sensitive thing about you.')
