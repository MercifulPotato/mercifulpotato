You can (and should) show advertisement without infringing the privacy of your users.<p>I see two potential outcomes:<p>1) Ad-supported apps will serve ads without hoarding personal data, e.g., a weight tracking app will show weight-loss ads to everyone.<p>2) We will see more paid apps.<p>Just as investors don&#x27;t invest in companies doing financial fraud, I&#x27;m hoping investors will also do more due diligence on the privacy posture of their portfolio.')
