If you want to hear their voices, read &quot;Slave Testimony,&quot; edited by John Blassingame. It&#x27;s stunning in length and detail. Not all suffered the same slavery we know today.<p>This passage is by an enslaved (interviewed by the American Freedmen&#x27;s Inquiry Commission) in Kentucky, 1963, named Charlotte\n&quot;I belong to Gen. Thos. Strange. I have two boys. I pay a dollar a week to him, and support myself and children, and pay my house rent. I have been hiring myself for over fifteen years; I get along very well, and keep the hire paid up. You couldn&#x27;t pay me to live at home, if I could help myself. My master doesn&#x27;t supply me with anything -- not even a little medicine -- no more than if I didn&#x27;t belong to him. Each of my children pays him $2.00 a week. They work in tobacconist shops. I support them. One of my boys is thirteen years old and the other seventeen. They get $2 a week pay. If the boys make more than $2 a week a piece I get what is over; if they don&#x27;t make that, I have to make it good to him. He has got to have it Saturday night, sure. I have not had good health. Sometimes I am ailing, but I always keep up enough to try to make my wages. I have only one room, and pay three dollars a month for it. I live by washing.&quot;')
