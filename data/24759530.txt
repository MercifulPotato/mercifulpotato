Let&#x27;s be frank: recruiters are bottom-of-the-totem-pole, lowest-common-denominator, bottom-feeders.</i><p>My friend, this isn&#x27;t personal, but a fact: you&#x27;re privileged.<p>I sense you&#x27;ve never been in a position where you have $3,000 in the bank, your wife is depending on you to get through college, and you <i>have</i> to get a job or you lose your apartment.<p>Out here dropping stories about Evan Spiegel; gimme a break. Most people don&#x27;t know any CEOs, PMs, or hiring managers.<p>The funny part is, I agree with your premise. You are indeed presenting the best way of opening doors. It&#x27;s worked for me, and has opened many doors.<p>But only when I was in a better position. Till then, it was one of the worst things I could have done. Focusing on playing the hiring game would have put me in a much stronger position.<p>The comment you made is slightly out of touch. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that, but I think you&#x27;ll maybe look back on it in 10 years or so with a wince.<p>In the situation I described above, where you absolutely need that job, all the people you mention have a good chance of forgetting about you due to day-to-day politics. Guess who won&#x27;t? That recruiter. Because they get a cut of your salary.')
