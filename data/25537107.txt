You are probably sitting alone in an empty office, or truck, and might be feeling a little depressed about that.  Dont.  You arent alone.  Lots of great jobs require at least someone on shift at all times.  You stand beside the cops, nurses, doctors, linesmen, soldiers, pilots, air traffic controllers, road safety crews, and countless others.  And dont forget all those people who might not be &quot;at work&quot; but certainly arent at home, all the drivers and sailors stuck wherever their craft have parked for the day.  We make the holidays possible for those lucky enough to take time off.  As my boss just emailed me: we are what keeps those holiday lights lit.<p>Ill see you all again on january 1st.')
