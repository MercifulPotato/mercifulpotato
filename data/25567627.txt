People pay thousands of dollars for a Macbook because the hardware and the software feel very high-end. The UI&#x2F;UX is generally seamless. Stuff &quot;just works&quot;. There are regular updates. Any software written for MacOS will work on any other Mac, because the hardware&#x2F;software integration is so tightly controlled. Is it perfect? No. Are there things Linux does better? Sure. But taking the entire Apple ecosystem into account, it feels cohesive and thoughtful, and it feels like it&#x27;s worth the money.<p>Contrast that with Linux. With many Linux distros, it doesn&#x27;t &quot;just work.&quot; The OS itself can change very often. The software ecosystem is fragmented. You have to use apt or yum or some other package manager. Sometimes you need five different package managers to install the software you want! On top of that, you can&#x27;t necessarily run all Linux software on every distro or any hardware. There&#x27;s little to no UX&#x2F;UI consistency. As someone else pointed out, Qt vs GTK apps can and do look totally different and there are no style guides or any enforcement mechanisms to make sure that users enjoy the experience. It&#x27;s the wild west, which is good in many ways, but in the context of making a device feel like a premium device, a wild west methodology fails that criteria pretty hard.<p>In other words, Linux is fantastic for computer nerds like us who like tinkering with things and don&#x27;t mind rolling up our sleeves and getting our hands dirty. But it is no way, shape, or form a &quot;premium&quot; experience.')
