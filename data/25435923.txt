I&#x27;ve had 0 crashes. Very few glitches, and if, then they were cosmetic i.e. didn&#x27;t cause any gameplay problems†.<p>The visuals are absolutely amazing. Combat is very nice. The skill tree is interesting. Night city is beautifully immersive and the story is thrilling. I&#x27;m not much of a gamer, but I feel that I&#x27;ll sink a large amount of time into this game. As of now, I can&#x27;t stop thinking about the game when I&#x27;m away from it.<p>† Although I almost had a heart attack as one time a bad guy that I had taken down just got up and sat back down on the bench he was sitting on before. He was still &quot;dead&quot; but just chilling on the bench. Hidden zombie mode?')
