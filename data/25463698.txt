Like how could you make this many bad calls to get your game to the point that one of the main platform holders has yanked the game off the store and issue refunds. CDPR rushed it out the door to get that end of fiscal year revenue (unless I&#x27;m mistaken) and satisfy impatient investors, only to lose a lot of good will with their fan base, miss out on game of the year awards and recognition, and to be a meme generator for people to poke fun at the game. Yikes, that&#x27;s a series of unfortunate events and some really bad management. Someone should get the chop over there.')
