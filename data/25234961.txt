ARMv8.4-RCpc would be enough, and I believe M1 supports these too.<p>(FWIW, Rosetta itself does “cheat”: the translated code and the runtime shares an address space, and memory accesses are not checked, so it’s possible to write an “Intel” binary that is aware of the runtime and can read emulator state.)')
