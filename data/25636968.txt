I don&#x27;t know why, but it makes the house feel less empty all day.<p>I think the world is split into people who really need a background soundtrack of some sort and those who hate it.<p>Back when I sometimes had a roommate on group (non-work) trips, one of the things that drove me craziest was someone who just <i>had</i> to turn on the TV as soon as they walked into a room.<p>The funny thing is that I&#x27;m pretty much fine with ambient people sound. I just don&#x27;t like background TV and, for the most part, I don&#x27;t even turn on music when I&#x27;m working.')
