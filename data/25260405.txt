(there actually is a way to catch panics because that&#x27;s how the stacktrace printing is implemented, but you usually only use it if you&#x27;re making a custom allocator or runtime or some other voodoo magic)<p>So if you want your &quot;exception&quot; to be able to be handled by the caller, you <i>have</i> to indicate it otherwise, usually with enums.')
