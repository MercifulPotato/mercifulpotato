But do you really think, upon more than a cursory examination, that you&#x27;ll see Sundar Pichai and Mark Zuckerberg actively arguing for an end to capitalism as we know it?<p>I mean they&#x27;re anti-union.<p>I&#x27;m also not clear about the equivocation you&#x27;re making. Being anti-capitalist or &quot;anti-American-police&quot;, even if we take those at face value, while certainly extreme in the modern American political sphere, aren&#x27;t on a global scale, nor is it advocating for political violence (which we&#x27;ve seen not only advocation for, by both the Trump and his supporters), but actual real-world attempts at smaller-scale violent coups[0].<p>This runs into the philosophical questions of what &quot;extremism&quot; is, and whether or not it&#x27;s socially constructed, and I think an important takeaway is that there are tons of reasonable, &quot;objective&quot; measures, by which abstract anti-capitalist sentiment is fine, and calls for defunding the police are fine, while false claims of election fraud are not. A platform choosing an independent, objective measure by which to judge extremism and then having one group go off the deep end doesn&#x27;t make the platform biased against that group, it makes that group more extreme by the objective measures.<p>Even if a person doesn&#x27;t understand Critical Race Theory, or is afraid of the &quot;socialism&quot; boogeyman or whatever, people advocating for socialism, modern anarchism, or critical approaches in politics[1] aren&#x27;t usually doing so violently, and those that do are usually deplatformed as well.<p>Like in your followup to another user you get into the weeds on CRT, and your conclusion was &quot;You make it about race rather than accountability and the problem will not be fixed.&quot; Which okay, that&#x27;s a fair view. Ultimately I disagree. I think a rising tide lifts all boats, and among white-middle class people police apologia is so strong that you&#x27;re never going to get popular support. So gathering support among minorities is the best you can do (and I&#x27;ll add, reasonable levels of support amongst Republicans and white people as well, Black Lives Matter is, if I&#x27;m reading the polling correctly, more popular than Joe Biden). But even ignoring all of that, so what? Does that mean that a site should remove that content? Does it at all compare to right wing content that is removed?<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gretchen_Whitmer_kidnapping_plot" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gretchen_Whitmer_kidnapping_pl...</a><p>[1]: which are really just a lighter version of the modern anarchism take and, I should add, should be super popular on HN because they resemble libertarianism a surprising amount')
