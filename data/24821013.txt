Any server can ban any other server breaking its rules.<p>Yes, a federated system will inevitably be abused by malicious actors because of its inherent openness. But if it&#x27;s closed the way it is now, then it is abused by the company that owns each platform. If I had to choose, I&#x27;d absolutely pick spam over ads, tracking, and dark patterns.
