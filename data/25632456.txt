You collected a datum about the bug: it caused a variable to have a value that it should not have had. Now you know something about it that you maybe didn&#x27;t know before.<p>When you say &quot;Great! You fixed the bug, right?&quot; it sounds like a paraphrase of a passage in my essay that I had some misgivings about when I wrote it. But I thought, surely nobody&#x27;s going to think I really mean the problem is definitely solved? Surely, people will realize its a bit of hyperbole.<p>Maybe not. Maybe I should have instead written it more soberly. Maybe I should have just said &quot;Now you&#x27;ve collected a bit of data about the nature of the bug.&quot;')
