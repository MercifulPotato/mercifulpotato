The gamble is that you&#x27;re very good at this, and so you&#x27;ll deliver better performance with HTTP&#x2F;2 than the client could have got from HTTP&#x2F;3, but even if you actually are right by a slim margin you&#x27;re likely to suffer the same pushback from users as if you were wrong. The only scenarios where this is a smart bet are where competitors allow HTTP&#x2F;3 and have <i>noticeably</i> worse performance.<p>If it&#x27;s close, regardless of which way, you&#x27;ll get beaten up for disabling HTTP&#x2F;3, maybe that&#x27;s unjust but that&#x27;s how it is.')
