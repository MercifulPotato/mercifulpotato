Recenlty I was looking at one of my old CS textbooks (Mitchell&#x27;s Machine Learning), and I quickly realised  I have forgotten most of my maths, I found much of it impenitrable, despite having no problem with it when I was at university.<p>It&#x27;s been 18 years since I&#x27;ve had to do any maths beyond the basics, that was just some trig to do coordinate conversions. Most of the code I&#x27;ve written since uni has been information systems, not mathmatical in nature. I&#x27;d love to try my hand at interesting problems, a bit of ML, stats, probability, perhaps simulation or signal processing, and some electronics. But I feel like a carpenter who&#x27;s forgotten how to use his saw.<p>I&#x27;d really like to regain what I&#x27;ve lost, and perhaps advance a bit more from A-level (that&#x27;s the 16-18 qualification in the UK). I know I can learn it, I did before.<p>What are good resources for re-learning maths? I have two small kids so I&#x27;d like to find something structured that I can do a little at a time in the evenings, a good book with exercises or an online course would be great.')
