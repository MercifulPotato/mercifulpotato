(GPA is too low) While disappointing, it is understandable, way too much happened at my uni stay that honestly glad I was just able to graduate.<p>I took a look at their Masters&#x2F;PhD programs and under their Research section the topics they consider that is noteworthy for them, I&#x27;ve actually worked on in the past. While I&#x27;m not sure how my previous work would compare to what they currently are researching, it does make me interested in a few questions.<p>1) Can a genuine piece of work or research be used to demonstrate enough knowledge that the GPA requirement no longer matters? I know this is probably a case by case basis, but is it even possible?<p>2) Can I, without the oversight of any academic institution (here being only Universities, and not Academic Foundations and the like), submit&#x2F;publish genuine research papers? And to where? Would it be less important than those coming from Universities?<p>I&#x27;m sure there are a few things I over looked when considering if this is even remotely possible. And I&#x27;m speaking solely from a Computer Science perspective, I know for a fact Universities would be needed for more involved sciences to ensure that ethics are properly followed.<p>Thanks for reading. And I&#x27;m sorry if this has a simple answer that I&#x27;m just not seeing, I am curious about it though.')
