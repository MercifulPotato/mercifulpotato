Works councils[1] are usually per company, while unions are not.<p>Neither maps precisely onto the conventional American definition of a &quot;Union&quot;[*], nor onto the AWU, which is a members-only union. I&#x27;m not sure how many Google employees in europe are <i>Unionized</i>, but I know works councils exist in multiple nations.<p>[*]: My understanding is that a works council is government mandated, and a small group of employees can set one up, they have some formal negotiating power like a NLRA union, but don&#x27;t represent all employees, and have a limited set of things they can negotiate about (for example they can deal with work conditions, but I don&#x27;t think they can negotiate pay or strike). EU trade unions are big national organizations, one per industry that do lobbying and counter corporations. Conventional US NLRB unions have a monopoly on negotiations with the company, but require 50%+ membership. Members only unions have no formal legal power beyond non-retaliation, but can still negotiate with a company (about anything).<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Trade_unions_in_Europe" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Trade_unions_in_Europe</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Works_council" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Works_council</a>')
