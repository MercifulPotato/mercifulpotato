I&#x27;m unsure if this is overly cynical, but I don&#x27;t expect politicians today became career politicians by worrying about safety more than protecting their political status. Further, I suspect media would look for any definition possible to blame politicians for deaths so politicians feel it necessary to be blameless before allowing interesting, progressive ideas to materialize.')
