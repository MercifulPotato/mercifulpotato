It doesn&#x27;t automatically cure cancer and inject the drug but that by itself is an amazing tool that if available to everyone will revolutionize biology experimentation.<p>I will definitely blame the protein structure field in multiple levels though. It was always frustrating to me to open up Nature or Science and see it filled with papers about structure - like they are innovating so much that half of the top science magazines every week have papers in that field, yet it&#x27;s not going anywhere? Or is it simply just a bunch of professors tooting their own horns about ostensible progress in a field that&#x27;s archaic by decades if not years? The overall protein structure field internalised some dogmas in self defeating ways to everyone&#x27;s detriment and finally events like this (and Cryo em, maybe) will jolt them out or make them fully irrelevant so we can move on. it&#x27;s only doubly ironic that this came from a team in a company with minimal academic ties showing how toxic that entire system is. I only feel pity for the graduate students still trying to crystallize proteins in this day and age.')
