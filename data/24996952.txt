It has made a world of a difference to me - I push for low income students to learn music, and offering a free quality program is invaluable.<p>Does anyone know any way to export to&#x2F;from LilyPond?<p>MuseScore is miles ahead of things like Frescobaldi with everything it does, but I really would like to compose Lily-style, and all my attempts to use the two together have not been successful (there was a plugin that was discontinued, etc).<p>As an aside, the typical user of Lily is more likely a programmer, so it would widen your base of possible contributors if you added import support')
