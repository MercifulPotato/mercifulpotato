I currently track my workouts with the Strong ios app but I’ve been thinking lately about a few things it lacks. One example is missed reps (which Traindown looks like it supports!)<p>I’m a weightlifter that used to be a powerlifter and have also done more bodybuilding-style programs previously too. One thing common in weightlifting programs that I’m yet to find any tools that support natively are complexes. These are typically notated like “Exercise+Exercise” or “Exercise Exercise”, with the set&#x2F;rep notation normally being “3x2+1”.<p>For a concrete example, a program might have a complex like “Snatch Deadlift + Hang Snatch + Snatch” for “3x2+1+1”, which translates to “perform 3 sets, where one set is 2x deadlifts, 1x hang snatch, and 1x snatch”. I suppose from a data perspective it’s like nesting sets within a set.<p>I looked through the guide and the spec, but couldn’t figure out how I would represent complexes in this notation. Any ideas?')
