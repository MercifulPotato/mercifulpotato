If they even had a website it was built by the owner&#x27;s nephew or maybe used some wix template, then if it does exist you&#x27;re going all over the place to find contact information, opening hours are probably missing, menu might be anything from another page to a download of a photographed PDF.<p>I like the fact that I can go to a social network profile and there&#x27;s a big button with contact information in the same place for all businesses.')
