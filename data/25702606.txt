I&#x27;m personally okay with Twitter&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;etc. temporarily&#x2F;permanently banning Trump&#x27;s accounts for numerous reasons (not the least incitement to riot), but I feel very uncomfortable de-platforming all of his supporters. Sure the ones actively making threats or other illegal actions, but I don&#x27;t like the automatic removal of all of their discussion.<p>I&#x27;m definitely very conflicted about the whole thing though. I don&#x27;t really see an obviously right way forward.')
