Certain YouTube videos are licensed only for streaming playback by the YouTube site or app. There&#x27;s JavaScript on the YouTube site that descrambles the URL of the content. Going to the YouTube site and playing back a video from there is fine. However, if you were to write, say, a Node version of youtube-dl that downloads and &#x27;eval&#x27;s the descrambling code from the site, and use that to download a video for uses not licensed or authorized by the rightsholder, that too would be circumvention under the DMCA and thus illegal.<p>There&#x27;s really is no way around this. YouTube videos are protected by technological copyright restrictions. ANY attempt to get around those restrictions is a crime.<p>Even if this were not the case, you would be committing copyright infringement by downloading the videos for unauthorized use anyway. The DMCA just gives legal teeth to technological attempts to prevent casual infringement.')
