I get 300Mbps speeds on my devices. I&#x27;d say Wifi 6 does seem to have a steadier and more reliable wifi connection even from my older Wifi 5 devices.<p>The advantage for me is, I have multiple things using the internet, and if they all get 300Mbps it&#x27;s pretty good.<p>Haven&#x27;t had a chance to try a WiFi 6 to Wifi 6 connection yet.')
