You can definitely add a constant to the Hamiltonian without changing the local physics, but I was referring to the stress-energy tensor (i.e. energy density), not the Hamiltonian (total energy). The stress tensor can be locally negative but still integrate to a positive or zero value of total energy.<p>So let&#x27;s talk about energy density, I&#x27;ll call it T. I need two facts:<p>1. The Reeh-Schlieder theorem implies that any operator that the vacuum state of QFT is &quot;separating&quot;, meaning that the only operator A that satisfies A|0&gt; = 0 is the trivial solution A = 0. (Here |0&gt; means vacuum.)<p>2. The energy density operator has zero expectation value in the vacuum state, &lt;0|T|0&gt; = 0. Why? Explicitly: it has to be constant because of translational symmetry, and it has to because 0 is the only value that is constant and integrates to 0 total energy.<p>From fact 1, we know that T|0&gt; is not 0 in any nontrivial theory (otherwise T = 0 identically, and no state has energy density at all). From fact 2, it follows that T|0&gt; is orthogonal to |0&gt;. Therefore |0&gt; and T|0&gt; span a 2D subspace of the Hilbert space.<p>Now write down the matrix T in that space. It looks like<p>[0, b*]<p>[b, c ]<p>where b is nonzero because of the way the subspace is defined, and c is real because T is Hermitian. Such a matrix is never positive definite, therefore there exists a state with negative expectation value in this subspace. Explicitly, one of the eigenvalues of this matrix is c - sqrt(|b|^2 + c^2) which is negative because b is nonzero. The corresponding eigenvector therefore has negative energy density.<p>(Source for this argument: [0])<p>An example of such a state is the Casimir state, see [1].<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1803.04993" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1803.04993</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Casimir_effect" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Casimir_effect</a>')
