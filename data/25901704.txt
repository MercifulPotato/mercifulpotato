Intel unable to improve their node and manufacturing has nothing to do with Tick Tock cycles.<p>&gt;There is no guarantee that TSMC might get stuck at a node in future for Intel to catch up.<p>They did. 3nm is no longer using GAAFET. And they have a plan B with 3nm using FinFET.<p>We judge a company by its past, and present experience. TSMC has always been an open, transparent and conservative company. Much like ARM, they are not there to take the spotlight. They were suppose to be in the background helping companies, it was only in recent 5 years Main Stream Media decided to hype it. Mostly because of Apple.')
