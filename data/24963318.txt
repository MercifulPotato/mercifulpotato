It glides smoothly on paper. It doesn&#x27;t leak on an airplane. It&#x27;s inexpensive and comes in many colors. I find I have to hold it almost perfectly vertically.  Just out of FOMO I would be interested in knowing if there&#x27;s anything better.  From time to time I try something else but have never found one better.')
