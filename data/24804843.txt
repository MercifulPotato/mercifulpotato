People don’t even <i>try</i> to read.  Ask two questions in an e-mail, and get an answer to the first question, only.  Every time.<p>You have to adapt.  Ask the single most important question <i>as the first sentence</i>.  Don’t write a lot of text after the question either – it would only make people feel they can put off reading it, and therefore put off answering the e-mail.  Don’t ask an easy question later in the same e-email (people would answer that question only, and ignore the rest of the text).  And so on.')
