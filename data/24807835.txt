This is not possible with a wifi hotspot because in Hotspot mode you cannot use your wifi in parallel.<p>I do use that with a mobile router that supports Android&#x27;s usb-cdc-ethernet adapter to forward hotel wifis when i only have one code for a single device (mac address). Or when the wifi gadget you want to use doesnt work with the captive portal. Fast and hassle free.')
