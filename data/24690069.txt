That&#x27;s been a core &#x27;feature&#x27; of FB forever. The other part is - when you made the purchase, the retailer just fed your data to FB for their ad targeting. This covers the vast majority of FB &#x27;spookily&#x27; figuring out someone still collects Beanie Babies cases.<p>Edit: You can also go into your FB ad &#x27;privacy&#x27; settings and turn off some of the targeting stuff, for instance &#x27;Ad based on data from partners&#x27;. You can also dig around there for a log of partners FB thinks you&#x27;ve &#x27;interacted&#x27; with. Turning this stuff off gets rid of the spookiest ads and things like retirement facilities ads because you set your age to 103 when you created the account.')
