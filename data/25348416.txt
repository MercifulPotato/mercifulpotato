Item(by='criley2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607448407, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25345267, text='&gt;Apple is my hero in that regard, where you actually pay for the product experience instead for being part of some deeply troubling subculture where passionately debating about very expensive cables and gadgets without ever being able to pass a blind test on the claims is the norm, almost like cargo cult.<p>The lack of self-perception here is astonishing.<p>FYI, for those of us outside of the cult-of-Apple who watch how Apple sells phones with a bill of materials of $300 for $900+ to people who see them as a status symbol and a community of high-end influencers, we view Apple exactly as you describe here<p>The way you describe Apple as &quot;selling an EXPERIENCE&quot; instead of selling headphones perfectly demonstrates how the Apple cult transcends a product market and speaks emotionally to the Apple cult. You aren&#x27;t buying headphones, you&#x27;re buying into the Apple Experience(TM).<p>And finally I want to take a small laugh at the fact that you describe &quot;THEM&quot; as a creepy subculture and cargo cult, while in the same breath calling the Apple corporation &quot;Your Hero&quot;!! Cargo Cult is a great way to describe how we view you and your hero Apple.')
