We&#x27;ve never deliberately sold it that way, and goodness knows the React team has said &quot;React is the only official state management tool for React&quot;.  Redux got popular because it solved the problems people were dealing with when it came out, better than the existing tools in the ecosystem, at a time when React was taking off.  We&#x27;ve done our best to clarify in the docs when it does actually make sense to use Redux.<p>Redux Toolkit is still Redux. You&#x27;re still writing reducers, creating a store, dispatching actions, and updating the UI based on state. RTK just allows you to do so with less code. So, the &quot;Essentials&quot; tutorial starts by introducing those terms, concepts, and data flow, because you need to understand those regardless of how you&#x27;re writing Redux logic.<p>While Redux _is_ normally used with React, it&#x27;s also UI-agnostic, hence the separation from React-Redux, and using it with other UI frameworks is a valid use case that we support.  We had some long debates about whether to add these additional APIs into the Redux core [0] [1], and concluded that there was too much inertia around the existing Redux ecosystem to build those into the core `redux` package.  As it is, even though RTK isn&#x27;t required, we&#x27;ve had folks say they didn&#x27;t like some of the opinions we&#x27;ve built into RTK (like using Immer for writing reducers).  So, combining all three of those packages into a single super-package is not feasible at this point.<p>I&#x27;ve tossed around the idea of trying to merge the Redux core, React-Redux, and RTK docs into one site, but that would likely require merging all three libs into a monorepo.  Not impossible, but not something that&#x27;s likely to happen any time soon, if only because my own time is very limited and I have a lot of other docs work I need to focus on [2].<p>Which specific docs page are you referring to?  You said &quot;intermediate&quot; and &quot;advanced&quot; - sounds like you&#x27;re referring to the RTK docs site tutorials [3]?  FWIW, I wrote those a year ago, and at the time the main Redux docs were frankly very out of date.  I&#x27;ve spent much of this year rewriting the Redux core tutorials, as listed above, and those Redux tutorials are where I would direct anyone who&#x27;s new to Redux or really wants to know about RTK.  We do also have an open issue to discuss what tutorial content should be on the RTK docs site [4], and tbh I&#x27;m really not sure _what_ tutorial content should actually be on the RTK site now that the &quot;Essentials&quot; and &quot;Fundamentals&quot; tutorials exist in the core docs.<p>You&#x27;re right that the actual Redux core itself isn&#x27;t very complicated, but the biggest issue is trying to teach people to &quot;think in Redux&quot;.  In fact, it&#x27;s kind of _because_ the core is so small that there&#x27;s a lot of documentation needed - so much of this is actually in the patterns around how to use Redux effectively.<p>Anyway, if you can point to some more concrete concerns or have specific suggestions on how we can improve things, I&#x27;m very interested - please feel free to comment over in the issues.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;reduxjs&#x2F;redux&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3321" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;reduxjs&#x2F;redux&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3321</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.isquaredsoftware.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;redux-starter-kit-1.0&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.isquaredsoftware.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;redux-starter-kit-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;reduxjs&#x2F;redux&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3592" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;reduxjs&#x2F;redux&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3592</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redux-toolkit.js.org&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;intermediate-tutorial" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redux-toolkit.js.org&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;intermediate-tutorial</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;reduxjs&#x2F;redux-toolkit&#x2F;issues&#x2F;371" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;reduxjs&#x2F;redux-toolkit&#x2F;issues&#x2F;371</a>')
