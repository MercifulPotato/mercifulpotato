Item(by='nicoburns', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603822515, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24909455, text='&gt; react apps often have dozens of additional packages. And the churn on these packages is significant.<p>IMO that&#x27;s just poor engineering and not an inherent problem with React. The app I inherited at my current job had many such packages. And we have indeed had to update&#x2F;replace some of them. However most of them were implementing functionality which could be trivially replicated in &quot;plain react&quot; so we&#x27;ve mostly replaced them with simple internal components and are not anticipating having the same problem in future.')
