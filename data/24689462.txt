Though you could reasonably play some games on the Jetson Nano, Nvidia markets the jetson series as embeddable machine learning systems. While there may be complaints of how hot the jetson gets or its performance with Ubuntu, the jetson is not intended to be used as a personal computer. Itâ€™s cheaper than dirt machine learning access. I highly recommend it as a way to get started in AI or CUDA with the smallest price barrier possible.')
