The modern browser has many apis with which to make remote calls such as fetch, web sockets, and web rct. They can also fall back to classic methods like jsonp, crafty css skullduggery, and iframes.<p>The reason why this css thing is not a major problem is that the js could retrieve this data just as easily using one of the other methods I listed. JS retrieving data from an external API is generally not a problem unless its used for tracking purposes or as part of an cross site scripting attack.<p>At worst, this gives online tracking companies yet another tool in their toolbox. I am sure the boffins down at ublock are already working on detecting and mitigating this behaviour.<p>I can’t really see it being used for cross site attacks unless some whackadoodle site decided to try and send secreted authenticated data via CSS payloads.')
