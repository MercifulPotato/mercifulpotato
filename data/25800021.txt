This is vulnerable to eavesdropping and easy for Signal to detect and warn the user about.  Chinese people have been asking them to do this for over a year, telling them that they know of people who have been detained by the government after using Signal, thinking it was secure.  Signal have constantly ignored and dodged this.  Just lately, their attitude seems to be that somebody needs to prove it is being actively exploited before they will look into it.<p>Until I saw their behaviour on this, I was recommending Signal to people.  Now I can’t help but feel it’s security cosplay.  They pride themselves on strong encryption, but won’t lift a finger when people unwittingly use Signal in an insecure context and are being extraordinarily evasive about it.<p>More info: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.signalusers.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;signal-should-warn-users-who-are-likely-using-insecure-ime-apps&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.signalusers.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;signal-should-warn-users...</a>')
