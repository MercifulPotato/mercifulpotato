I only use mmap because it simplifies my code (I write experimental code).<p>But the OP and commenters are mostly concerned about the extra copy of read().<p>For video memory, DMABUF has been used to avoid extra copying. The idea is that the hardware directly DMAs into a buffer mapped in the userspace instead of copying into a kernel buffer and then copying into userspace. A system call is still involved, but no extra copying of data.<p>I wonder if anyone has actually implemented a disk I&#x2F;O interface using DMABUF. There are a couple of low-level disk interfaces. But I don&#x27;t know if any of them uses DMABUF.')
