I have a rockpro64 that I was trying to use as a router to my mobile hotspot. The board would freeze up randomly (daily&#x2F;weekly) until I stopped using the WiFi entirely.<p>There are exactly two kernels that I have gotten to work and they are both within a few minor revs of each other. This was an issue because I wanted to use newer firewall primitives which weren’t available in that kernel release.<p>I purchased a tinkerboard and the situation got much worse. Just getting it to boot with a display took a few days of tinkering (lives up to its name) because my hdmi display wasn’t quite what it expected. Once I finally did boot and login, I tried updating ala apt-get and then rebooted. It never came back even with some putzing so I threw it on the junk pile.<p>Also: I pinged tinkerboard support initially to get tips on why it might not be booting. Going on almost a year now and I’ve had no response.')
