Kids, like everyone else (eg cops), are acting out cultural norms, being mostly defined by mass media.<p>Entertainment media mostly consists of easy-to-write fight scenes where the main characters dispose of some endless supply of nameless &quot;bad guys&quot;. A few hits or shots, that one is gone, move on to the next one. No scenes showing henchman #17 hugging his kids goodbye that morning, or henchman #31&#x27;s parents grieving. Just purely transactional force-of-will violence - sound familiar?<p>Furthermore, news media then glorifies shooting events when they do happen, showering the perpetrator with attention and making sure they go down in infamy - it&#x27;s actually a quite precocious way to get one&#x27;s 15 minutes of fame.<p>And of course there&#x27;s that other uncomfortable issue of why school environments cause kids to want to kill their peers in the first place!<p>But there&#x27;s no straightforward approaches to those, and they&#x27;re held in place by entrenched incentives (lazy writing, clickbait advertising, ass-covering school administrators), while the people speaking up for the inanimate objects are easy to write off.')
