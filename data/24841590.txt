The largest free gun classifieds on the web. Buy guns, sell guns, trade guns.&quot;<p>One could argue that the transaction isn&#x27;t happening &quot;on Facebook&quot; since it&#x27;s going through Armslist, but I don&#x27;t find that convincing. If take payment via Venmo does that mean it&#x27;s &quot;not on Facebook&quot; if everything else about the sale was?<p>Anyway, I fault Facebook for plenty and generally avoid it now, but I don&#x27;t fault them for this policy. Private sales can get into sketchy territory really quick and I wouldn&#x27;t want to mess with that on a public platform I created unless I was willing to invest in the nuance there which has basically no value proposition for Facebook.')
