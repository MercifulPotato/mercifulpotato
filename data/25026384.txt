Item(by='lkbm', descendants=None, kids=[25026415, 25026543], score=None, time=1604849834, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25026141, text='I think there&#x27;s some merit to &quot;this site uses cookies to track you as you visit different sites&quot;. There&#x27;s none whatsoever to &quot;this site uses cookies to remember your login information&quot;.<p>The law seems to make no distinction. As a user, I view every cookie notice as pointless and annoying -- obviously you use cookies, and obviously I&#x27;m okay with it. If the notice were specifically about cross-site tracking, that would be a meaningful notice, and opting out would make sense. Session cookies, though? You&#x27;re warning me about <i>session</i> cookies?<p>If I could set a blanket &quot;I accept cookies&quot; in my browser settings and have those notices all go away,. I would in a heartbeat.<p>And, in fact, I DO have a blanket &quot;I accept cookies&quot; setting in my browser. Sadly, I&#x27;m still forced to manually opt-in on each stupid website.<p>Ideally, we would distinguish between different &quot;types&quot; of cookies (and I believe the law requires you do this), and we would have settings specifically for these in browsers (which we sort of do in a limited fashion), and we would simply make it a setting defaulted to &quot;ask&quot;. show notice only if the user has manually changed the setting from &quot;ask&quot; to &quot;accept&quot; for the types of cookies used on a site. Boom, useful and non-annoying cookie notices.<p>Until we do that, it&#x27;s a bad system, and a useless law.')
