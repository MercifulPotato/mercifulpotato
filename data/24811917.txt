I had a group at work of a core team.  One guy who, in retrospect held me by the hand and led me along stupidvising as I learned a new system.  He gave me endless attention and tutoring, celebrated wins and helped redirect when I messed up without ever getting upset.  When I came back to work after having gained, he was weird and cold and blunt, and was way more demanding and curt in his feedback.<p>What really opened my eyes was when I lost again, suddenly I had my patient and thoughtful &quot;mentor&quot; back.  It was disheartening, to be honest... just a feeling of sadness for humanity on how many opportunities the unattractive don&#x27;t have offered to them on silver platters.')
