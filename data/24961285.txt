There are millions if not billions of people using iPhones. There are millions of apps in the App store. If for example, Ubuntu made a phone that was handed out to billion+ people, I expect worse if not complete catastrophe.<p>I know it is weird to say a closed door&#x27;s company is more trustworthy than an open one, I support out-in-open development of things like OpenSSH and cryptolibs; I just don&#x27;t see it in a <i>relative</i> sense. All other options IMO are worse. Pine64 and Ubuntu would sell out instantly if I had a few million dollars to throw at them. Amazon essentially has Canonical out on a leash - Amazon integration in Ubuntu is absolutely cancerous. I imagine the entire Ad-tech industry of the size of a Aircraft carrier and Pine64&#x2F;Ubuntu the size of a toy boat, they would buy people out left and right to get access to large number of users if Pine64 gets traction.<p>Instead of harping on the negatives, if Pine64 guys can get huge amounts of funding (and employ smart people), have bounties for security bugs, and can win my trust with custom silicon and hardware encryption, prove themselves to be against Ad-tech industry, put customer privacy first, etc; I am onboard!')
