Out to dinner, maybe?  Or even to a protest rally?<p>While the <i>protestors</i> didn&#x27;t storm the Capitol or bring tools to restrain people and destroy property, some segment of the rioters&#x2F;insurrectionists did so.<p>As I mentioned, taking hostage and murdering the Vice President, the Speaker of the House and perhaps many members of Congress probably wouldn&#x27;t have destroyed our government, but it certainly could be considered a coup attempt and definitely would be insurrection.')
