Item(by='xoa', descendants=None, kids=[25490807], score=None, time=1608507818, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25490487, text='&gt;<i>when authoritarian countries wake up and realize they can simply force Apple to migrate user data into servers they own in exchange for market access</i><p>China is the only authoritarian country with enough leverage over Apple to force them to do that sort of thing. There it&#x27;s not just an enormous market, but also an utterly critical part of Apple&#x27;s supply chains. Every other authoritarian country is small fry in comparison, and if they demanded such a thing Apple would tell them to get stuffed. Apple has not just commercial reasons, but political ones as well. While Trump is enamored with authoritarians, the incoming Biden Administration is not, nor is much of Congress or the general public. The EU would also like to at least pretend to care overall. Particularly right now at a time of scrutiny, Apple has every reason to not merely deny such a demand but to do so loudly and publicly.<p>And seriously, it&#x27;s not like authoritarians are all stupid (unfortunately) and need to &quot;wake up&quot;. They&#x27;re all aware what China has demanded and gotten away with. If they thought they could too, they would. But they wouldn&#x27;t, so they don&#x27;t.')
