The self-correcting force of consumer inflation on price discovery has been time-delayed buffered and confusing price signals for a long time for select industries by acommodative consumer debt issuance. Without that effect upon price discovery, I suspect the number one reason bankruptcies occur to consumers to trade categories every few years as the inflation works its way through different key industries and their customers. Which is why US personal bankruptcy has been quite consistently caused by medical bills for decades [1].<p>When&#x2F;If this inflation wave takes root in the consumer sector, it first has to overcome the deflationary secular bias that has plagued developed world economies for a few decades. I suspect this is because price discovery in wages has been quite robust, but in goods and services it is obfuscated by many means (consumer debt issuance is only one of many mechanisms), and the end effect is people are functionally broke.<p>If it breaks that deflationary bias, then it will break a great many households who cannot bear inflation while their wages stay functionally unresponsive to the same inflation. If that happens, then I expect the deflationary bias to turn into a depression.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.debt.org&#x2F;bankruptcy&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.debt.org&#x2F;bankruptcy&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;</a>')
