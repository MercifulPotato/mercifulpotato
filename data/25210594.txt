There were rather a lot of articles about how Apple were &quot;tracking you everywhere you went&quot; and so on.<p>The reason it&#x27;s similar – they are both dumb, technically bad, and privacy-compromising decisions, and in both cases much of the public discussion about it has been a little hysterical and off-base.<p>Apple should 100% be criticised for this particular failure. It&#x27;s <i>obviously</i> a bad implementation from a technical and usability point of view; the privacy implications are bad, and this features should not have been able to make it out as-is.<p>But I&#x27;ve legitimately seen people describe this as &quot;Apple&#x27;s telemetry&quot; which is just <i>obvious nonsense</i> and distracts from the actual problem – how did such a bad implementation of a useful feature end up in a major commercial product, and how are they going to make sure it doesn&#x27;t happen again?')
