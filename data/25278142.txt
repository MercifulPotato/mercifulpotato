Officially, the term &quot;low-level language&quot; still only refers to programming languages whose structure corresponds directly to that of the intended an instruction set architecture, i.e. machine code and assembly languages. Everything else is a &quot;high-level language&quot;, according to the academic definition. That includes C, C++, FORTRAN, COBOL, Java, Python, Typescript and Swift.<p>Of course, we all know that there&#x27;s a pretty marked difference in programming in a language like C vs a language like Python, for example. So often people use &quot;higher-level&quot; or &quot;lower-level&quot; to express this comparison. I wouldn&#x27;t even argue that those are bad terms to express that difference, but over time people have conflated &quot;C is a lower-level language than Python&quot; with &quot;C is a low level language&quot;, which brings us to where we are now where &quot;high-level language&quot; and &quot;low-level language&quot; have, as you said, fuzzy definitions in colloquial usage.')
