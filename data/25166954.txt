Furthermore what relevance does it even have when something is &#x27;deeply immoral&#x27; (according to you)? \nWill they be punished by Zeus or Karma or neither? Since assuming it&#x27;s perfectly legal and morally good in their locality, they couldn&#x27;t care less about what you think of it.<p>What is self evident to you might be self evidently wrong to others, let your arguments speak instead of appealing to your local culture. this is an international forum and one shouldn&#x27;t just assume that everybody thinks and values the exact same things. maybe start off by explaining why your moral framework is supposedly &#x27;absolute&#x27; and not just some arbitrary choice you made that is convenient to you and how it&#x27;s supposedly better or more valid than the moral framework of the people you lazily vilified as &#x27;crazy&#x27; just because they oppose you on certain issues.')
