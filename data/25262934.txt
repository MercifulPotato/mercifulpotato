Item(by='prcrthr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606804086, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25258436, text='I had a friend who solved the structure of 2 or 3 new proteins pretty much by himself his senior year of college. I also had an acquaintance who was a PhD student in the same lab, who said (jokingly) that she hated him because she had spent 5 years on a single protein and got way worse results than he did. I got the sense from talking to them that the process of figuring out how to get a protein to crystallize is basically just trial and error over and overâ€”my friend himself said he basically got very lucky several times in a row (though he is also a brilliant biochemist).<p>Anyway that anecdote is pretty much the entire sum of my protein crystallography knowledge, but perhaps it explains how your experience and GP&#x27;s statement can both be true?')
