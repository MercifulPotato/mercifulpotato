I made an entirely custom, split hand-wired setup for about $150 (build[1], layout[2]). Most of the cost was ordering one-off laser-cut steel and acrylic plates off the web. If you don&#x27;t mind waiting a month for parts from Aliexpress and have access to a laser cutter and a soldering iron, you could make a complete split, hand-wired keyboard for about $50.<p>The most difficult thing for most folks is often building the QMK software[3,4] configured for their setup. But hacking a bit of C and flashing an Arduino is probably not that bad for most HN readers!<p>It&#x27;s awesome to have an entirely custom keyboard. The split design has been great for my posture and shoulders. But the real killer is the kind of customization you get from QMK. We customize everything else about our computers, why not our primary interface to it? I love having the navigation keys and numpad right underneath my fingers using layers, having the modifiers in sane locations, and thumb keys to make your thumbs first-class-typing-citizens (e.g., Space, Shift, Backspace, Enter all within easy reach!).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;ErgoMechKeyboards&#x2F;comments&#x2F;j0hhah&#x2F;othello_theme_top_plates_denzel_left_keanu_right&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;ErgoMechKeyboards&#x2F;comments&#x2F;j0hhah&#x2F;o...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;KeyboardLayouts&#x2F;comments&#x2F;j475mv&#x2F;40_layout_with_palm_keys&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;KeyboardLayouts&#x2F;comments&#x2F;j475mv&#x2F;40_...</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qmk.fm&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qmk.fm&#x2F;</a>\n[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;qmk&#x2F;qmk_firmware" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;qmk&#x2F;qmk_firmware</a>')
