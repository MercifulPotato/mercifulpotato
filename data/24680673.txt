Or why make it free to use forever ? Why not release it under a license that states usage is only permitted as long as the author allows it, i.e. for a limited trial period ?<p>I am specifically making the argument that by doing this you don’t care about the freedoms that the GPL was intended to preserve. Being “open source” without having the other freedoms is desirable to some but I believe not in the spirit of the GPL, so what you really have is a project you claim under one license but you are distributing it on the side with principles that directly oppose it.<p>&gt; If some people want to build a free world, fine, I agree with that idea in principle and I will provide my work to them for free.<p>Well, what I’m saying is that the two principles seem directly opposed. To me it feels like you’re operating what you call a humanitarian blood bank where 100% of donations go to people need-blind, but if you add $5 on top of your “donation” you’ll instead sell it on the black market and give me 50% of the price it fetched (let’s assume this was not illegal). If your mission is “I want to help everyone” then this directly undermines that; but if you’re OK with “but my sales on the side help me fund the entire thing so that the actual donations can exist” that’s just another perspective (and possibly a valid one) but it’s not fair to characterize yourself as purely only thinking about running it as a service to <i>only</i> get blood to the people who need it.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s a more positive approach than GPL, in that it&#x27;s not actively &quot;hurting&quot; people that don&#x27;t want to join the open source community<p>The GPL wants to hurt people who don’t join the open source community. Like, it actively is designed around that because it believes members of the community who do not participate violate the freedoms of the open source community, and it tries to get people to do this by leveraging one of the few things the open source community has: the projects themselves. Again, whether that is an accurate representation is up to you, but using the license as a stick to prod companies into paying you so they can do the very thing the license was designed to prevent just seems ironic and that’s what I was getting at.')
