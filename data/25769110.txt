Oddly enough, another fact is that this didn&#x27;t come out until Ehrlichman was dead for seventeen years. Stake your reputation on such things if you like, but I think there&#x27;s better material to use to make the point. Ehrlichman had a lot to answer for, but I&#x27;m not willing to pile on in this case based on something someone remembers from twenty years prior.')
