I also got about half way through Thinking Forth, also by Leo Brodie but it is much more about project planning and management than Forth.<p>Janet: I am already familiar with Lisps and Janet borrows a bit from Clojure syntax with its table and array syntax.  It wasn&#x27;t much of a stretch to pick up.  I used Janet to build some small command line tools.  Nifty Lisp that I plan to use more in the future.')
