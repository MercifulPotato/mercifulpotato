And you do make a claim:<p>&gt; <i>This information is incorrect.</i><p>... without any further explanation as to why that claim would be more correct than the claim by the person you disagree with.<p>Or put in other words: there is nothing in the comment that would be of any substantial help to a third person reading along who doesn&#x27;t know anything about Gecko or Servo. Even if they were to believe that you were right they wouldn&#x27;t know what the correct information is!')
