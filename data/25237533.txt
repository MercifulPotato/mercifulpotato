You&#x27;re all (mostly) sheep. Sheep in your condemnation of this celebration of individuality, sheep in the illogic of it, given that you&#x27;ve merrily discarded and excluded individuality for the thrill of &quot;collective righteousness&quot;, now, in collective unison you&#x27;ve come to proclaim, either or any of:<p>- I am individual, I peace<p>- I am sheep-dividual hybrid but that smart, I peace<p>- PG is wrong on principle, therefore sheep good, I peace<p>You are all (commenters against, here) the first morons to leap at passing criticism on anything divergent from your groupthink, embracing this culture of &quot;criticism&quot; as a sacred ritual, but when passed against you, it is the end of the world.<p>This must evoke the deep unresolved insecurity at the sheep: they know they surrendered that tiny individual voice inside, and they know, on some level, that&#x27;s wrong, but they need to cover that up with everything they&#x27;ve got, to justify and feed their sense of safety in the comfort of the herd.<p>Good luck to you, sheep all!<p>Keep telling yourself, inside, individual good, bad me give it up, and outside, individual bad, good me sheep member. I think you all should accept your duality and just get on with it, and not feel threatened by seeing the realization in other individuals of a mirror (to you) of your own unrealized individuality. Or just accept your whole sheepness, if that&#x27;s what you are. Accept this paradox and just fully give up your baggage about not being individual &quot;enough&quot;, and embrace the collective. Then you will not be so threatened and insecure when someone talks of individuality, you will know, the superiority, of the hoard! &quot;Your individuality shall be merged into our own.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t care that y&#x27;all sheep. I want you to be sheep. Get out of my way. Stay outta my way. Get away from  me. You&#x27;re disgusting with your crazy illogical groupthink. You&#x27;ll never understand the free thinkers, so don&#x27;t try to impose just stay away. I want you to be secure in your collectivism. Because then you won&#x27;t be so prone to attack the individuals that cross your paths. Be secure. Be confident. I don&#x27;t care that it seems wrong or illogical to me. There&#x27;s value in the collective. IF YOU ARE SHEEP, FUCKING EMBRACE IT. Yes, sheep are cowards, but there&#x27;s literally gathousands of you, so just fucking EMBRACE IT. Surrender to your sheepness, and find, please, your own version of transcendent bliss, so we can all of us get back to being ourselves without interfering in others through triggered projected insecurities sparked from difference. Just be your fucking sheepself, and enjoy it.<p>You see me outside the herd? Just ignore. Go back to eating grass, and get full belly and feel good. OK?')
