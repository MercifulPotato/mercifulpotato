Ten pages a day\n  2. Do all the exercises, and redo all the ones you get wrong.\n  3. Add anki cards for all the key terms, ideas, formulas, etc. The best textbooks include a summary the end of every chapter that you can double check your notes &#x2F; anki against. Prefer cloze markup to question &#x2F; answer cards -- more cards per &quot;fact&quot; but longer retention.\n  4. Double check your cards against a source like Wikipedia for completeness &#x2F; accuracy, since sometimes there&#x27;s an author bias to content with.\n</code></pre>\nThis takes about an hour a day for #1 and #2, and an hour a week for #3&#x2F;4 plus a few minutes a day extra in the Anki review queue. For this book, you&#x27;re looking at about 2 months start to finish.')
