I don&#x27;t support naked shorting, it should probably be illegal (if it is not already) and it looks that was part of the reason this happened. Everyone has been suspecting for a while (especially here) that a lot of volatility in stocks like TSLA etc was due to Robinhood.<p>As of 5:33 EST, I&#x27;m on CNN right now and the main headline &quot;Inside the Reddit army that&#x27;s crushing Wall Street&quot; (And the reddit army isnt crushing Wall Street, it&#x27;s crushing a few hedge funds that happened to hold short positions in a few stocks.\n) , so now a lot portion of America (and the world) is paying attention.<p>Hedge funds blow up all the time. Enron blew up, basically all of the Investment Banks blew up in 2008, LTCM blew up. Why is this such a big deal?')
