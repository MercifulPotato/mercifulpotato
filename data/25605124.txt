I imagine that I&#x27;m reading the private translation not only of the literature&#x27;s leading scholar but, by unique coincidence of history, the leading fantasy writer. What an opportunity. The language is at times florid, though I imagine that&#x27;s the original. Through Tolkien&#x27;s Beowulf you can hear the voice the Lord of the Rings author, or perhaps it&#x27;s that you can hear Beowulf coming through in the Lord of the Rings.')
