Item(by='lostapathy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608588204, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25500095, text='No, that&#x27;s not how it works.<p>Most health insurance plans have a few services that are copay-limited even before you hit your deductible.  i.e., the $40 for an office visit to your primary care doctor, $90 to see a specialist, and in my case $500 for the ER visit.  Imaging and procedures are my problem from the start, up to the deductible though ... apparently unless they happen in the ER.<p>Like I said way up-thread, the way it&#x27;s structured puts the incentives in the wrong place for me.  Had my two visits for ER and scans been in the opposite order, I would have been out of pocket the same total.<p>Anyway - I&#x27;m done arguing with you.  I know how my plan works and what I&#x27;ve paid this year, whether you believe me or not.')
