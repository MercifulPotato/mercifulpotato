He has been talking to these people using coded language and rhetorical devices for years. Lots of gross rhetoric at every rally, for years and it&#x27;s all recorded for people to go back and pour over now.<p>Then there was the great idea to hold a rally down the road from the capital building on that very day, actively invite a bunch of extremist groups you&#x27;ve been courting for years, whip those people up using inflammatory rhetoric and your greatest hits about the the election being stolen, tell them &quot;Because you&#x27;ll never take back our country with weakness, because you have to show strength and you have to be strong&quot;, and then invite them to walk down to the capital building with you..<p>And let&#x27;s tweet this during the assault on congress for good measure: <i>Mike Pence didnâ€™t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure it mattered if Trump <i>meant</i> for this to happen. He&#x27;s toxic, and he&#x27;s dangerous.')
