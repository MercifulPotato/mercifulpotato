Why would they lie about it?  It&#x27;s evidence they can, not evidence they cannot.<p>For making the car stop working remotely, this situation doesn&#x27;t give any direct evidence either way.  It&#x27;s not evidence they can, but it&#x27;s also not evidence they cannot.<p>And considering how these devices are <i>usually</i> designed, if they can flip the car one way they can probably flip the car the other way.  So it very likely can remotely make the car stop working.<p>&gt; But, it appears your perspective is that if remote control operation exists, so it can be hacked.<p>Is that wrong?  Even if the system itself is magically perfect, surely Ferrari itself can be hacked.  I can&#x27;t imagine someone credibly claiming otherwise.  So I take it as a fact that a hacker can send commands to your car.  Whether those commands can shut it down... I&#x27;ll just say that if it even resembles competitor systems then it&#x27;s a strong yes.')
