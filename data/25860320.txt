Though, of course this is limited by my own anecdotal research and personal experience.<p>What I wonder than, is if sensitive isolated microphones could be tried for this purpose? We already know that sounds (ie yelling at the drive) can vibrate the platter enough to cause performance degradation. If there were internal mics in each HDD recording sound as the HDD spins and correlate that to HDD activity, could that be correlated with failure rate?')
