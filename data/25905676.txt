Item(by='unabst', descendants=None, kids=[25906258], score=None, time=1611594341, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25905191, text='One-ness is a shape of a thing, much like triangle-ness or circle-ness. Shapes are physical, but they can be copied, unlike the things themselves. And when meaning is associated with a shape, that meaning can then be copied and read. So we can take &quot;one-ness&quot; which is physically measurable and identifiable, associate a new shape such as &quot;1&quot;, and now we have a shape with meaning detached from its origin that we can copy, read, and communicate. The source is still reality, and this physical mechanism is what makes communication possible. Gather enough of these symbols and you have a language. Combine these symbols and you have a statement. Have anything that reads and reacts to  statements and you have consequences. From DNA to protein, from grocery list to grocery bag, from tweet to insurrection.<p>Any combination of words can form a statement. So someone comes along and says let&#x27;s agree on grammar. Then someone comes along and says let&#x27;s confirm with nature whether statements actually align with nature before we call it a fact. This is modern science and the scientific truth. Scientifically, nature is the single source of truth and is all true. False only exists in the gap between a statement and  nature.')
