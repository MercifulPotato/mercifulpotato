With the benefit of hindsight, this was incitement, potentially criminal.<p>Now the tricky part: from Parler&#x27;s perspective, content that at one minute is &quot;free speech&quot; is suddenly illegal, or at the very least ToS breaking, in a matter of hours.  Were they given a reasonable amount of time to remove the content (and what good would that even do, after the fact)?  Did Amazon make Parler a political target, and arbitrarily apply a rule to them that they did not apply to other customers (Twitter)?  Likely, imho.  Does any of it even matter if &quot;businesses can do what they want&quot;?')
