I&#x27;m looking to visualize hundreds of graph relationships and am hoping to not use JS. Admittedly though this example looks fairly performant, all the other ones i&#x27;ve seen are super laggy.<p>Ultimately i think i just want to find a decent way to use CSS to replicate this style - but i&#x27;ve not seen any CSS gurus manage to produce that.<p>Though, WebGL might be the best way regardless.')
