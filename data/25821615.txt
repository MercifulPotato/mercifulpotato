I just think that it will take worse restrictions of speech &amp; privacy issues for a complete change in a new direction. Big tech is already pressured to backdoor all encrypted communication (and frankly I think big tech themselves don&#x27;t care for privacy, quite the opposite).<p>So since (IMHO) it&#x27;ll take worse things to come for people to take a stand, let it get worse quicker so it gets better quicker.<p>edit to make my point clearer:<p>Letting corporations play the role of &quot;benevolent&quot; leaders on speech &amp; privacy issues _is_ the problem. Trying to pressure them one way or the other _isn&#x27;t_ the answer. So let them overreach even more, let them anger more people than the ones on Parler, let them show their true face. Let it become an issue for as many people as possible. For it is societies that should find answers collectively on what is tolerable for one to say&#x2F;publish, how much privacy especially since the information age matters etc. The internet and the huge platforms that the capitalist system has helped create should belong to the people, and what happens there should be a decision for the people to make.')
