I have been testing prom-migrator, migrating and ingesting 7 million+ samples a second, and till now, I have seen Promscale&#x27;s memory usage to be the most efficient, along with a better CPU performance. I have tested Promscale, VictoriaMetrics, Thanos, M3, Cortex, and Promscale continues to lead in efficiency and performance. Also, the added advantage of native SQL support is a big bonus.')
