I&#x27;m wondering however how Java Memory Model implementation performs on ARM.<p>JMM offers pretty strong guarantees via the fundamental happens-before relationships in program behaviour. It&#x27;s relatively easy to implement on x86&#x27;s strong TSO, but ARM is extremely problematic to offer the same guarantees on.<p>Can&#x27;t wait to run some concurrency benchmarks on this platform.')
