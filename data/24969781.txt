With the arrest of Julian, and the downfall of Wikileaks. We are now left with much less reputable places to disseminate that information.  \nI take issue with the article, because it attacks and delegitimizes independent investigative effort. Unfortunately that effort is now done in the dregs of the internet in places like 4chan, and now disseminated by less reputable people like Rudy Juliani.<p>&quot;Lizard&quot; people is modern abstraction for evil&#x2F;corrupt people. Similar to angels and demons.\nWe call the earth round, when in fact its a little oval, and has mountains that protrude out. Abstractions can be true on some level of resolution, but in fact be false in the absolute sense. The article doesn&#x27;t really invalidate the sentiment that some people in government are corrupt. Which is probably the right sentiment to hold, even if arrived through the wrong fact.')
