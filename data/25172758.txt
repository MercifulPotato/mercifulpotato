Sure, SQL can be used to express domain models.<p>Let me raise a few questions for you:<p>- Let&#x27;s say we want to change the database from postgres to Oracle in the future. How do I go about doing it?<p>- How about complex logic that needs to be done in a declarative language such as SQL? SQL was not developed to write logic. You could do a lot of things in it. It is turing complete but doesn&#x27;t mean you <i>should</i>.<p>- How do you debug SQL views?<p>- How about version control and updating views, with traceability?<p>- Do you think SQL is more readable <i>for logic</i> code than say Python? Surely, basic logic can be represented in SQL. But IMO it suffers readability.<p>- How about CPU&#x2F;memory consumption and how do you manage to vertically scale?<p>You&#x27;re trying to use a tool (views), not for its intented purpose. It was not meant for sticking your company&#x27;s entire domain model.<p>This is a completely wrong approach especially in enterprise environment. Might be ok with a small project.')
