Hell, even figuring out <i>what flags apt-get install accepts</i> is an ordeal (--help? you must be joking?), let alone the nightmare it is every time you need it to do a serious job.<p>Not sure if these qualify as &quot;technical&quot; to you, but they&#x27;re important. (Unless they don&#x27;t and you consider anything nontechnical to be unimportant.)')
