I wouldn’t be caught dead with an Android or a Windows thingy in my hand.\nAlso a small dev. Here is the thing. Apple offers no revenue promise when I publish my app on iOS. If I don’t figure out how to market my app, it will just sit there and rot.\nBut as soon as someone buys my app, I have to pay 15% to Apple. What for?\nIt did NOT help me get my customer. If my app gets featured then may be I ll pay for the purchase bump. But what if I don’t want to be featured if it’s not worth the cut.\nI am paying plain and simple because Apple has the key to my customers phone.  Where I come from, that shit is called extortion.')
