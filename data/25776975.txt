My memory of the main problem was that the confidence interval of the false positive rate of the test used included values higher than the <i>entire</i> positive rate of the sampled people. I.e. they didn&#x27;t have enough data to rule out the claim that <i>no one</i> had COVID antibodies, let alone to justify that such a shockingly high percentage of the population could have had them already. Here&#x27;s a random overview of the critiques that I found on google just now:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;undark.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;24&#x2F;john-ioannidis-covid-19-death-rate-critics&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;undark.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;24&#x2F;john-ioannidis-covid-19-death-...</a><p>Anyway, I&#x27;m sure better data exists at this point. The CDC survey data you linked to looks very interesting and seems to (with caveats) put the percent-immune at 16% or less as of a few months ago. It&#x27;s sort of a middle ground with what the article here was claiming - 100 million immune Americans still seems to high but not by <i>that</i> much so given how cases have continued since the last serological survey results.')
