Item(by='bradlys', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611858529, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25945750, text='&gt; BMW had those annoying turn signal stalks that would always be in the neutral position even if you had the turn signal on. I&#x27;m not sure if anyone liked them. I know at least a couple of BMW owners who didn&#x27;t know how you were supposed to cancel the signal without being explicitly told about it by someone.<p>Own a BMW with those stalks. Don&#x27;t mind them actually. There&#x27;s an adjustment period. I figured it out quickly enough but I will say some people could get confused. I don&#x27;t like the loud click&#x2F;adjustment of the stalk moving while I&#x27;m finishing a turn. This only became more apparent when I started driving rental cars after owning the BMW. The BMW method does solve that. (All movement of the stalk occurs when you&#x27;re touching the stalk - never on its own. A good reason for its design I&#x27;d say)<p>That said - the F1 style steering wheel here - while exciting to look at... and very racecar... Is uh, very likely to be wildly impractical for a road car with a typical steering rack&#x2F;ratio.')
