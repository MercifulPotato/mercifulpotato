I assume the author just did a fairly casual reading and didn&#x27;t work through many problems.<p>Even still, this is a full month of study just for the interview process, and little of this sticks unless you practice it. This basically says to me that big companies just want to hire new grads or people who have copious amounts of free time to waste on studying, or perhaps enough wealth and freedom to take several months off (someone I knew with several children and a dependent wife took 3 months off to prep for interviews and got multiple offers! But this is only possible if you are already wealthy because of the high risk involved and lack of income).<p>I&#x27;m not saying I haven&#x27;t done an extensive amount of prep - I own 3 of the 4 mentioned books plus CTCI, though I&#x27;ve only read the latter and DDIA, and I just did advent of code 2020 - but I&#x27;m a man with a remote job and no children and it&#x27;s still a pain for me to stay at my current level of being moderately competent at algorithms. And then, of course, you&#x27;ll get into BigTech and spend time fiddling with frontend components or configuring infrastructure or gluing apis together and you&#x27;ll never need any of this again - with the exception of the content of DDIA, which would be a <i>much better</i> focus for senior engineering interviews and you end up learning&#x2F;using a lot of this in practice.')
