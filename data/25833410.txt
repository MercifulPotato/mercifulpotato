But I didn&#x27;t have any role models. So it was really about figuring out how intelligent I am and comparing myself to people.<p>One of my more stable jobs was working as a gas station clerk. The gas station I worked at was one of the few in a more affluent, medical-oriented district. Lots of doctors, nurses etc. Most of them treated me like crap. And just listening to the way they talked to me I was like... these people really aren&#x27;t that smarter than me.<p>So I was like what do smart people do? I have 0 family connections--I was the first person in my family to graduate high school--so I figured I&#x27;d go to college. That&#x27;s what smart people do, right?<p>Went to community college (my high school GPA wouldn&#x27;t have gotten me into any school with any sort of selection), and succeeded. Graduated with honors, etc. Then transferred to my state&#x27;s flagship university. Studied something not related to computers.<p>Got out of school during the Great Recession. Struggled to find a job. Had a couple of other shitty, albiet generally better-paying jobs. Met someone who worked at a FAANG. We were talking and having a reasonably intellectual conversation about what they do, networking and the like. Asked them where they went to school. They said they never went to college; they just taught themselves.<p>I was like, really? You can do that? If they can, I can. I have a degree from very selective public university. Graduated with multiple sorts of honors. If I learned one thing, it&#x27;s how to learn.<p>So I just started teaching myself Linux. Then networking. Then a bit of coding. Got a job helping a start-up-ish company migrate onto AWS. I was underpaid, but underpaid in that world is twice the salary (at least) than either of my parents made in a year collectively. Learned every day. A year later, a recruiter from AWS reached out. That was a couple of years ago now.<p>---<p>Your description of bouncing is spot-in. I was a mixture of 2&amp;3. I learned to fight because I had no self-control. I had to learn it, eventually, out of self preservation. But my form of self-control was &#x27;shut off your emotions until you feel dead inside. Then at least you&#x27;re not a wrathful rage monster.&#x27; Not the most healthy strategy, but it&#x27;s kept me out of trouble. I&#x27;ve gotten better, but still haven&#x27;t shed a single tear in over 15 years.<p>---<p>&gt; &#x27;&quot;I had to pull my alcoholic mom out of a ditch&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m fighting with people all the time&quot;. These two things feel disconnected...&#x27;<p>Yeah. They&#x27;re really, really not disconnected. Someone who grows up in that life has no stabilizing influence. They never learn how to deal with problems or actually plan.<p>Also, a neglectful parent means that you probably got abused. By your parent, an associate of your parent, or both. Predators are really effective at looking at a family and finding a situation into which they can insert you. Then you got to deal with that trauma.<p>You&#x27;re also more than likely to grow up in poverty, which comes with it a whole different set of bad habits and impulses.')
