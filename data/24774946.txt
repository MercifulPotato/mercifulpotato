Herd immunity for covid-19 requires ballpark ~70-90% of the population to be immune, assuming no distancing. In New Zealand, less than 0.04% of the population has had covid-19, and they have no vaccine. Yet they also have essentially no new cases.<p>Taking what you&#x27;re saying to it&#x27;s logical extreme, you&#x27;re arguing that no medical intervention can reduce infections of a disease.')
