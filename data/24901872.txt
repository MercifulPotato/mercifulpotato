The goal is not to gather and disseminate information as fast as possible. They&#x27;re more interested in telling a coherent story around a news event. So they might hold off while they verify or find supporting information. Who was the child? What was the outcome? Was anyone hurt?<p>There were multiple occasions when the organisation had  information about a breaking news event but held off rushing to publish while, I assume, they verified information. One story that stuck in my mind was the murder of a woman and her children by her estranged husband. First reported as a car fire, and then later confirmed as a murder suicide. Ultimately no information was withheld, but care was taken to make sure the event was not turned into salacious clickbait by publishing rumours or rushing to be first.<p>This seemed counterintuitive to me, but at the same time, what do we gain by having that kind of news arrive more quickly? It&#x27;s not actionable information.')
