It was already common to find colored lights on PC cases, peripherals, and components.  With RGB, you can match colors across those parts more easily.<p>At least... that&#x27;s the idea.  In practice, it&#x27;s actually quite cumbersome to configure everything thanks to a lack of hardware&#x2F;software control standards.  As a result, I usually  don&#x27;t bother with RGB.  Hopefully this app helps to resolve that issue.')
