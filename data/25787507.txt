Item(by='VRay', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610690183, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25785765, text='This raw &quot;sexual attraction&quot; stat you&#x27;re going on about is basically the only thing that comes through on a dating app for hookups, but it&#x27;s WAY less important when you meet someone in person and kick off an actual relationship.  Especially if you meet them at a group outing with mutual friends.<p>Instead of being a sweaty, nervous wreck desperately trying to hold an awkward conversation, you could just be a cool dude hanging out with his friends, playing Fortnite or hacking firmware or making pizza.  Your date can see what actually makes you cool and fun, instead of just seeing some fake persona you&#x27;ve constructed.. and if she doesn&#x27;t like it, forget about her.<p>People tried to tell me this when I was a kid&#x2F;younger man, and I just assumed they were all a bunch of ignorant old fools.  I didn&#x27;t figure it out on my own until I was in my 30s, and then I was married before I knew it.<p>I do my best to try and pass this advice on whenever I can, even though I know that most guys who had the same issue as me won&#x27;t heed it.  Shockingly, I explained this to my greasy 12 year old nephew when he was complaining about women.. at the time he basically told me to piss off, but a few months later he had a girlfriend, haha.')
