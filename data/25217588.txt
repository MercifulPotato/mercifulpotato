I agree, for the US it <i>may</i> be on the lower end of the scale (given the ridiculous costs of housing and healthcare), but Europe or Asia? Way more than enough.<p>&gt; The issue is whether someone with the expertise to do this would benefit the company and their own career more doing something other than a tech support role.<p>At least in my experience it is <i>definitely</i> good for people to spend time directly with customers. I agree it may not be worthwile for a chip developer or a documentation writer to spend their full time on doing support - but a set amount of time, say four or eight hours a week? That&#x27;s direct, unfiltered input from the customers where the documentation is either missing, unclear or buggy.<p>Generic questions (&quot;which combination of chips to choose if I have an USB-C female receptacle and want to provide bidirectional PD, bidirectional DisplayPort and USB3.2 over it&quot;) &#x2F; 1:1 tutoring like &quot;how do I best route a PCI-E differential lane pair&quot;, &quot;how to properly calculate trace widths for said lanes given fab house X&#x27;s stack specifications&quot; can be directed to less specialist &#x2F; sales staff or to a partner PCB design house.')
