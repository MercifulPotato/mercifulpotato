Half the interview is technical, the other half is about structured communication and synthesizing &quot;so whats&quot; for a CIO-level audience.<p>I&#x27;d actually question whether working on communication skills is the right move? If you find it intrinsically valuable (i.e., it&#x27;s a personal growth goal to be less introverted and a better communicator) then please listen to the rest of this thread, but if it&#x27;s about career opportunity it&#x27;s typically a <i>much better investment</i> to highly-leverage your strengths and outsource&#x2F;partner where you have gaps. We could talk all day about the number of tech companies that are pairings of the uber-geek tech genius and the slick salesperson translator -- it&#x27;s fine to team-up with people who have skills that complement skills you lack, and you are typically able to accomplish much more together.')
