No identifiable evidence of coaching on behalf of the agency recruiters was observed,&quot; the document states. &quot;Investigative actions to prove&#x2F;disprove this hypothesis are ongoing.&quot;<p>While some of Amazon&#x27;s other activities listed here are concerning or worse, I can&#x27;t see anything surprising or improper about the actual Pinkerton episode.')
