During the Cold War, you could say &quot;Soviet&quot; instead of &quot;Russian&quot; to clearly demarcate between the nation and the nationality. We don&#x27;t have a modern equivalent for the PRC, and that&#x27;s because someone wants it that way. It&#x27;d be trivial for a new term to be pushed through media, but it&#x27;s not being done, even though we clearly need one.')
