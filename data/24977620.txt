And it’s not exactly cheap by any stretch of the imagination, but for me it was at the ‘sweet spot’ between size and cost, as stuff bigger than this gets expensive fast.<p>Note that I haven’t actually received the display yet and can’t vouch for its quality or usability.  But for what it’s worth, that’s the one I ordered.')
