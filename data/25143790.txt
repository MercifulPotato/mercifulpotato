If you replace it with an appropriate LED - and that&#x27;s critical, there are so many &quot;superb&quot; LED installations recently: yes, it pulls less, yes, it&#x27;s more whiteish, no, you can&#x27;t see s... Take two steps away from the very narrow cone and you are standing in total darkness, somebody can mug you and the person looking from the window in the building right next to you would see nothing.\nSo, if you replace it with a proper LED, you save let&#x27;s say 400 W per lamppost plus any extra the original design left for voltage losses, impedance loop, etc.<p>Now, this is all fancy schmancy when you install one charger per street and one car uses it occasionally, but when making bold claims like &quot;all electric within few years&quot;, you take 4 lampposts x 400 W for 20 cars and you can charge each car with 0.08 kW. That may not be even enough for standby consumption (battery lifesupport - cooling&#x2F;heating).<p>So, back to the original question - does London have some kind of special supernetwork running through streets with megawatts to spare, or is it just capitalising of having just few percent of cars charging from it. What&#x27;s the plan to get to 100 % load within 10 years?')
