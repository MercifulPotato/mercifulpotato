I wonder how bad will it get before something more meaningful is done?<p>Equifax survived leaking all that data.  That still amazes me.  Roughly 1 in 3 Americans had their PII leaked and they suffered minimal fines.  Minimal in the fact that they certainly haven&#x27;t been impacted operationally.  If the laws can&#x27;t punish that level of breach, they aren&#x27;t going to punish the small potato sized ones either.')
