They are almost as much art as text. It is clearly out of scope for this paper to be able to &quot;redraw&quot; the sound effects in English, plus, some (I&#x27;d guess most, but importantly, not all) might want to see the original anyway and have a note somewhere for it&#x27;s translation. I also think it&#x27;s out of scope to find a suitable place to put this note - you don&#x27;t want text to cover up interesting art.')
