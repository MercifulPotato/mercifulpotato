One small nitpick though:<p>&gt; If it’s conventional bacon, you’re baking in carcinogenic nitrates. But even organic bacon is not good for an initial seasoning because it’s filled with salt.<p>Both conventional and organic bacon contain carcinogenic nitrates - organic just contains nitrates from a natural source (celery).  By definition, all bacon has nitrates.')
