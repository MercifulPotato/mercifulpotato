Let&#x27;s say someone near a fan is infected with Covid and sneezes.  The airflow from the fan would then immediately push covid-containing particles around the space and closer to other people than if there were no airflow at all.  Is it really possible that their magic &quot;ion&quot; particles would counteract this negative aspect?  I&#x27;m extremely skeptical.<p>It seems like a much better solution would be to point the fan outside and have actual air filtration systems at inlets to the space.')
