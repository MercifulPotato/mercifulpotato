They can please a difficult family member who generally complains about everything, or make great food suggestions based off what you say you like. There&#x27;s a lot of stuff a server can do to go out of their way to stand out. Are you saying you&#x27;ve never had a server where you thought to yourself after you leave &quot;wow, that guy was great.&quot;? (also I think some places aren&#x27;t allowed to, or can&#x27;t put pitchers on tables, so just ask for 2 waters for yourself if you drink a lot of water and don&#x27;t want to be bugged)')
