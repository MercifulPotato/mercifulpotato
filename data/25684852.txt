I feel like many clinicians do not understand the breadth of machine learning approaches. There is just so much to know! from robust statistics, non-parametric methods, to kernel methods. Deep learning and deep generative models are by no means the only tools at our disposal.<p>I absolutely agree with you though. Applied machine learning practitioners have been over selling their accomplishments -- which I believe is detrimental to progress in the field.<p>I would highly encourage you to collaborate with ML researchers who have spent a decade or more working on hard problems. From the other side, I can tell you I gained a lot discussing ideas with domain experts (neurologists, radiologists, functional neurosurgeons). They have insights that I could never have picked up by self teaching.')
