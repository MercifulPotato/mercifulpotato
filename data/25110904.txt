One thing I said that in any way, even the slightest, showed any kind of hate, racial or otherwise towards gypsy culture.<p>You can&#x27;t.  Because there isn&#x27;t anything.<p>And if what I said in the post you replied to isn&#x27;t enough, have a look at the rest of my comments in this thread.  I&#x27;m against racism, not for it.<p><i>&quot;Lynchings, pogroms, and gas chambers&quot; - are you serious?! What world do you live in?&quot;</i><p>Yes, I&#x27;m serious.  Wake up to the 20th fucking century.  That is the real world, and we&#x27;re not so very far away from it.  Might be going back to it some time soon, given the way right wing nationalism, xenophobia, and racism has been gaining ground all over the world.<p>Gypsies, by the way, were themselves victims in the Holocaust.  If you are as much a fan of gypsies and gypsy culture as you appear to be, that should be of concern to you, as they, like every other minority and persecuted group are under threat from racism and xenophobia.')
