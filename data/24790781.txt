Today, we may say that a painting &quot;speaks&quot; to us--perhaps these statues did so literally to the people of their time.<p>If that is true, then defacing these statues would be a viable strategy to inhibit their ability to trigger these hallucinations or visitations. Rivals of a religion would easily be able to cut off believers from a direct experience of their god.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.julianjaynes.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;about-jaynes-theory&#x2F;overview&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.julianjaynes.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;about-jaynes-theory&#x2F;overv...</a>')
