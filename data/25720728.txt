But I&#x27;ll leave you with a few parting thoughts anyway...<p>&gt; You have got to be kidding me - some people shoving riot police is comparable to burning people alive in metal cages?<p>I didn&#x27;t make that comparison and I don&#x27;t think most people would have interpreted my remarks as having done that.  You&#x27;re putting words in my mouth.  You made this statement in your previous post:<p>&quot;The Trump riot was basically people taking stupid selfies. They were very violent to the building. But I&#x27;ve not seen any violence toward other people.&quot;<p>The linked video of rioters shoving police was intended to show you that it was terribly wrong and somewhat careless to think that what happened was the same as &quot;taking stupid selfies.&quot;<p>&gt; Why are we switching to other groups suddenly?<p>My point was that it&#x27;s reasonable to say that these are not &quot;other groups.&quot;  It&#x27;s already been shown I think pretty widely by many reputable news organizations that some of Trump&#x27;s most ardent supporters are members of hard core white supremacist groups.  The link to the article about Jesse Washington&#x27;s lynching was intended to show you that it&#x27;s also reasonable to think that such groups are capable of violence that is on the same level as burning people in metal cages.  That kind of violence exists in the US&#x27;s own history of hate motivated crimes.  The rioters that broke into capitol had erected a make shift gallows outside of the building.  They were also heard chanting and saying things like &quot;Hang Mike Pence&quot; and &quot;Heads on a Pike.&quot;  Just let that sink in for a bit.  What do you think would have happened if, say, they had run across AOC in the hallways given that she&#x27;s been consistently demonized for the past two years?  They were carrying signs saying &quot;Nancy Pelosi is Satan.&quot;  What would have happened if they had found her?  Why is anyone still giving these people the benefit of the doubt?<p>&gt; A story about his father is somehow relevant?<p>Yes, because it appears that Trump&#x27;s father may have been a member of the KKK.<p>&gt; Look, I will say it again, what they did at the capitol was abhorrent. But your comparison with Al Qaeda is indescribably worse.<p>Worse than what?  The attack on the capitol?  If that&#x27;s what you meant, that&#x27;s not a very serious comment.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m utterly stunned to be having this conversation with you - it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m living in some kind of alternate reality world.  Aee you serious? Do you have even the remotest idea just how disgusting your comparison is?<p>Yes, I&#x27;m quite serious.  Don&#x27;t think that throwing insults at me is going to change my mind.<p>With all that being said, I think this conversation has outgrown its usefulness and I won&#x27;t be making any further replies.')
