Item(by='banana_giraffe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604168762, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24952589, text='Ok, I&#x27;ve been disconnected from this discussion for a while, but I can&#x27;t pass this comment by.<p>&gt; But you say you have chosen NOT to hear. If you want to live in ignorance and pain, by all means, help yourself.<p>I do not want to live in pain.  I continue to try things.  I&#x27;ve lived with this condition longer than you might guess, and I have a few lifetimes of things left to try.  I know some things that will help, so I do that for now, but I have no end of things to try in the future.<p>Stop assuming you know what&#x27;s in my backlog.  Stop assuming you know I&#x27;ve given up.  It&#x27;s all just tiring.  If I had a lack of ideas, I&#x27;d ask for help.  If my doctors aren&#x27;t helping, I&#x27;d fire them, I have fired doctors that don&#x27;t help me.  And I&#x27;m not opposed to firing all doctors and finding other sources, but for now the doctors are doing good for me, and the provide avenues that aren&#x27;t available via other means.  For now, they&#x27;re helping, they&#x27;re communicating with me, and working with me as I test things.  I hope to one day get to the point of no pain at all, but I also need to be able to get to a place of managing the pain I do have, since it&#x27;s possible, indeed probable with my condition, that that&#x27;s the best I can hope for.<p>And in case it&#x27;s not clear, I&#x27;m not exactly speaking directly to you.  I&#x27;m speaking to the mythical person conglomerate that you fall into of people that talk to me like this.  So many people seem to assume they know more about my condition with so much less information, including cases like this with basically no information.  Please stop assuming you know more about my condition than me.')
