Most things that are discussed are things that you did not witness or have no expertise in.<p>To be able have some chance at telling the truth you need to listen to arguments presented by <i>BOTH</i> sides and decide which arguments you think are logically stronger. That ability to tell truth is compromised when you are not allowed to listen to one of the sides.<p>I personally believe people should be allowed to say whatever they want and be responsible for what they say according to the law. There are existing laws that can be used to determine whether something is incitement, libel, fraud, etc. and those should be used to prosecute in a court of law.<p>This rather than preemptively remove the possibility of committing a crime by deciding to block an account by a private company.')
