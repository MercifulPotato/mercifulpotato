It is always so low overhead to get going due to being agentless and using YAML. As I&#x27;ve got more experience with config management though, I find myself enjoying other philosophies like Puppet and Chef more. I think once scale gets large, having a consistent execution environment (via an agent) and more expressive language (like Ruby or Puppet DSC over YAML) outweighs the benefits of accessibility Ansible provides.<p>When I want to get something done quickly and easily though, it&#x27;s the first thing I reach for.')
