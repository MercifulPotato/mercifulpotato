Also one of those two cops committed suicide. I&#x27;m more fearful of a McVeigh style attack down the line than I am an immediate response. Outside of the literal neo-Nazis (which I believe came up with the term &#x27;ACAB&#x27; and I&#x27;ve always found ironic for the other side using it) most radicals don&#x27;t want to directly engage cops.
