Average next gen console purchase estimated coming with 3 games, which would put you at a 50% discount at year one. That’s a big discount to amortize over the rest of the years.<p>2. PS4 had a software attach rate at 10 games per console. That’s in the neighborhood at least.<p>For me it’s worth it because I don’t have to weigh an economic decision. I just download the game and figure out if I do like it and want to continue. So it’s a complex product to evaluate for sure. I also have to rerun my math because $5&#x2F;month on pc was absolutely a no-brainer.')
