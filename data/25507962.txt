It surely depends on the plastic type for sure.  The reason we used polypropylene beakers in our lab is because it is one of the most benign and unreactive substances on earth.  Other plastics may not be as benign as that but on the whole that is one of the great things about plastic and why it builds up in oceans etc.  Nothing can degrade it so the bacteria in your gut are probably just meh about it.  I canâ€™t think of a way it could cause a problem to have little bits of it in your digestive system along with all the other substances we eat.<p>Plasticizers that leach out from the micro plastics maybe, but I have to think that there are so many things we should be more concerned about in our food.  The dose of plasticizer from the macro plastics we store and transport all our food in seems like it would be a much bigger issue.  BPA and other xenoestrogens should have leached out of micro plastics long before they get micro right?')
