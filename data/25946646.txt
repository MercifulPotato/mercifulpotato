This just seems so outrageous&quot;<p>You are a mall owner and 25 000 people are stampeding through your mall causing a ruckus which will in the end create no value for anyone.<p>This is speculative mania with no basis in any kind of market reality, people are actively acting against the best interests of the participants, especially the companies themselves.<p>The lack of understanding here is what is &#x27;shocking&#x27;.<p>BlackBerry, Robin Hood, Citadel, NASDAQ - nobody wants to be part of this.<p>It&#x27;s ridiculous that people think they are somehow &#x27;doing good&#x27; or even have some kind of inalienable right to own shares in a company on whatever terms.<p>This is a &#x27;market riot&#x27; nobody wants to be involved but the rioters.<p>CFOs are all very nervous right now and I wouldn&#x27;t doubt if some of the target companies have asked for protection.')
