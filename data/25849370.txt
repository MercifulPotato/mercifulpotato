Learn the basic movements and UI interactions. Do NOT use the arrow keys. Your future self will thank you tremendously.<p>1. Search DuckDuckGo for &quot;vim cheatsheet&quot; and find one that provides a good summary of commands thats organized to your liking.<p>2. Print it out and post it somewhere easily accessible to your working space.<p>3. Each-ish day, review the cheatsheet a bit and pick one one new kind of command that looks useful. Try to integrate that command into your workflow throughout the day. It&#x27;ll be clumsy at first, but after you do it a few times you&#x27;ll be surprised at how much faster this gets.<p>Focus on movement and editing first. Take note of sequences that seem to take a lot of work, as almost guaranteed there is a faster way you can integrate in later.<p>Once you&#x27;ve got a small core built up, do another review and research more specialized topics:<p>- .vimrc, colors, and customization<p>- plugins<p>- buffers, windows, etc for quick workspace organization<p>- macros ... and macros within macros!<p>- visual blocks<p>- various useful commands for advanced editing (e.g. regex based find in replace in an entire doc or visual block is epic)<p>Give yourself time and try not to be too loud when you have your first &quot;A ha!&quot; moment when you randomly try a completely new key combo that you think <i>should</i> work and it actually does exactly what you hoped.')
