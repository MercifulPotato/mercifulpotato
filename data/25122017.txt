Item(by='emn13', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605608244, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25118723, text='Yeah, these claims are FUD. Yes, there are theoretical concerns; as with all new things, there is no complete certainty. But we should be absolutely clear that immunity usually reduces transmission. That that&#x27;s at least very common is trivially observable in the real world too; no need for fancy statistics: just note that anything we have effective vaccines for has dramatically reduces spread in societies using those vaccines broadly.<p>Additionally, vaccine transmission reduction worries can be conflated with direct vaccine risk worries. There are risks to <i>untested</i> vaccine <i>candidates</i>, and some can even cause more severe illness. That&#x27;s why we test, surely? And though I can&#x27;t find the citation off the top of my head, there are even cases where a vaccine might enhance spread <i>in extremely peculiar</i> circumstances; I found a paper documenting such effect when vaccinating animals vs. an otherwise generally fatal disease; the vaccine simply delayed the inevitable and that delay caused a measurable <i>increase</i> in spread - but <i>that&#x27;s not at all like covid 19</i>, which is not usually fatal.  These theoretical concerns do not appear likely to be a factor this time, and most remaining doubt will clear up once phase 3 trials are complete: in particular, you&#x27;ll know before you&#x27;re vaccinated.<p>Whether the vaccines will reduce spread is obviously we don&#x27;t <i>know</i> for absolutely sure; but reduced transmission does appear to be the most likely outcome.  We should definitely act and plan as if it will (while measuring and hedging to detect if we&#x27;re wrong). If new data appears that undermines this assumption, <i>then</i> we should adapt - but that&#x27;s not likely.  Much more likely is that the exact details of how much spread is reduced is unknown (so a 90% effective vaccine might reduce spread by less than 90%; or even by more; and we don&#x27;t know <i>those</i> numbers).<p>So for example, when a paper like this <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lancet&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS0140-6736(20)31976-0&#x2F;fulltext" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lancet&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS0140-6...</a> points out the limitations of currently knowledge, you should interpret that as just that - a limitation of current knowledge, <i>not</i> that it&#x27;s very <i>likely</i> that a vaccine will leave spread mostly unaffected.<p>The final nail in the coffin for this FUD is that it&#x27;s not actionable. Attempts to vaccinate - with the hope of reducing transmission - won&#x27;t be ill-advised in retrospect in the unlikely event it turns out not to; it still reduces severity safely.  So in terms of policy after phase 3 trials are complete and before mass-rollout: who cares?  At worst vaccines will reduce disease impact with a good <i>chance</i> to reduce spread too. But if people start thinking the vaccine is likely useless, uptake could drop, which is throwing away such a great chance.  This is classic FUD: doubt that&#x27;s simply undermining rational action, without cause.')
