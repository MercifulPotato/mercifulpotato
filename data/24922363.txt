I accept Wayland brings benefits for some people, but I couldn&#x27;t care less. Since I don&#x27;t care about the benefits it brings, it needs to be entirely painless.<p>Until the switch is more painless than holding on to Xorg, there will be a good chunk of users with no incentive to make the move.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;d also say that the fact that so many of the tools need to change, rather than e.g. get support added to them to support Wayland compositors is a huge indictment of the whole thing. It seems like <i>no</i> thought was put into planning for transition.')
