It&#x27;s the silliest of silly ideas - not just practically, but conceptually, because real problems don&#x27;t have hard algorithmic edges. Which is why they&#x27;re so hard.<p>Don&#x27;t forget there&#x27;s a difference between a formal (user) specification and a functional specification.<p>A functional specification says that when you select &quot;Edit -&gt; Cut&quot; the user can expect certain things to happen. A formal specification defines how the symbolic entities involved in implementing the operation should operate.<p>This isn&#x27;t too hard for &quot;Edit -&gt; Cut&quot;, but it&#x27;s not tractable at all for &quot;Translate this poetry into another language without mistakes or ambiguities.&quot;<p>So in fact he&#x27;s just as guilty of resorting to metaphor as anyone else in computing. Only in this case the metaphor is the algorithmic perfection and consistency of a mathematical proof.<p>This is fine in the classroom and in certain applications where formal methods can help, but not so much in the average developer room.<p>It also highlights that ultimately computers aren&#x27;t about manipulating symbols, but about manipulating <i>conceptual metaphors represented by symbol sets.</i><p>But I expect he&#x27;d have dismissed that idea as too dangerously novel.')
