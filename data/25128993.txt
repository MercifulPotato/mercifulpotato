There is a history of liberal voters moving to more moderate places for the low cost of living and high quality of life. Over time those voters elect politicians that enact policies that make the new place a lot like the old place they left: high taxes, high cost of living, higher crime.<p>Believe it or not, there was a time when California was a purple state, and it had a low(er) cost of living and very high quality of life. This was a long time ago, but still.<p>If you do decide to move somewhere, please try and be respectful of the folks who already live there and have made it a desirable place to live in the first place. And while you&#x27;re at it, ask yourself why you want to make a place you&#x27;re moving to more like a place that you left because you didn&#x27;t want to live there anymore.')
