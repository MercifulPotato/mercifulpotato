The corrupt have no commitments to anyone but themselves.<p>Becoming passionate about something is generally a result of the interpretation of facts, not the cause. It&#x27;s very difficult to become passionate about plastic pollution without any knowledge of plastic pollution. The only people that can maintain this fantasy libertarian opinion without enthusiasm are people who support plastic pollution because it makes them money, and pay people to come up with arguments to continue doing it - hence all people without a financial stake are hopelessly biased activists.<p>If they&#x27;re not making money, what could they possibly be getting out of it? They&#x27;re obviously insane and feeding their own egos through heroism, and therefore can&#x27;t be believed.')
