I&#x27;ve always found it boring. Most often it doesn&#x27;t lead to growth or betterment. I prefer creation and understanding to it.<p>There is much to explore, plenty of new things to invent, plenty of stories to share.<p>Our elites have successfully failed. They cornered themselves into zero-sum games where they pocket all the wins. You don&#x27;t have a choice anymore but to compete or die.<p>Every creation gets corrupted to bring the level down to tic-tac-toe. Hopefully creators can still see the stars when they die in the gutter.')
