Ironically heavy-handed parents trying to create conformity can create rebels. Soft and understanding parents can create conformists unless they properly emphasize independent thinking. Personally I try to avoid telling children what exactly to do (and listening to them, essentially treating them like adults, this is explained in the book &quot;How to Talk so Kids Will Listen&quot;). This is usually possible if you are not in a hurry and willing to think creatively.<p>I consider myself to be an independent thinker and I struggle with the many down-sides. I am happy to keep working on my own inspirations but can easily lose motivation on ideas that are not my own or otherwise curious. I think this demonstrates a potentially strong relation between the individualization of curiosity with resistance to being told what to think.')
