Sometimes good food involves suffering. I&#x27;m glad we&#x27;re at the top of the food chain. I&#x27;m not about to give up my steak, I&#x27;m not about to give up my cheese, I&#x27;m certainly not about to give up my foie gras.<p>I don&#x27;t think we should go out of our way to hurt animals (for example intensive chicken production where you have overcrowded operations where chickens stay in the dark, etc, should be outlawed), but if I want to eat it I&#x27;ll eat it. The cow need not consent, because it&#x27;s my food.<p>Fundamentally it&#x27;s simply not a moral issue to me, it&#x27;s a gastronomic one. I believe most people agree with me. Vegans are so incredibly out of touch.<p>PETA: People Eating Tasty Animals.')
