It also seems to include some facility for building the account itself (e.g. logging, vpc endpoints, etc) that today is just generally done with homespun IaC tooling and automation.<p>Probably useless for smaller organizations, but if you&#x27;re a central technology team trying to engineer a safe cloud platform for your business units to develop, deploy and operate on, any improvement over what AWS provides to date would be welcome.')
