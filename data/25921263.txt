The only problem I’ve had was when I set it up on my router and my IKEA smart lights stopped responding after some 30 min or so. Turns out the gateway phones home and those calls were blocked, so for some reason or another the gateway just stopped responding to commands. Restarting it or resetting the network made it fly again, but only for the set time before it phoned home again. I was very disappointed by that, after having read some article here on HN arguing that IKEA had actually done IoT sort of right. Oh well.<p>Obviously not a NextDNS specific issue, it’d happen with anything that blocks the call, but just putting it out there for the next sucker that tries to google why their IKEA gateway suddenly stops responding.')
