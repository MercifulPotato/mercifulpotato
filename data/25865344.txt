Just like it&#x27;s pretty infeasible for everyone to always use cash all the time, it would be pretty infeasible for everyone to always use Bitcoin-on-the-blockchain to buy a cup of coffee.<p>What Bitcoin allows you to do is build a financial system comprised of products that look like Venmo, credit cards, banks, etc on top of a currency system that&#x27;s 1) censorship resistant (unlike ACH), and 2) independent of central bank monetary policy (unlike most fiat currencies).<p>The degree to which you care about (2) is obviously based on your political leanings, but (1) basically turns paper-money in-person transactions into something that can happen between strangers over the Internet unencumbered. Most crypto bulls hope that the vast majority of people use instant bank-driven payments, just based on the blockchain at the lowest layer, rather than USD-over-ACH.<p>And to be clear, I&#x27;m not really a crypto bull and I don&#x27;t really have a horse in the race. But this is the steel-man argument for crypto.')
