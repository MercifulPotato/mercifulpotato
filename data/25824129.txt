Item(by='PragmaticPulp', descendants=None, kids=[25824160], score=None, time=1610990876, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25824096, text='&gt; I have come across a number of teams where designers jump on a PR because it links a particular build they need to test.<p>Sounds great, right until the designers start misinterpreting things in the PR build and reporting bugs up their command chain, giving a bad impression of the developers.<p>Vetting doesn&#x27;t mean it goes through a full Q&amp;A release cycle. It just means that the team is ready to say &quot;This build is good to go for testing, but beware that X, Y, and Z features are broken&quot;.<p>Honestly, letting designers have ad-hoc access to builds worked well for me at small companies where designers and devs were in the same room. It completely fell apart at larger or remote companies where the risk of misunderstandings and politics outweighed any benefit.')
