We adopted English, the language from the British. The standard colonial oppression arguments already start from why use a foreign Language.<p>They used zebra crossing (even though there are no Zebras in the UK either, I think), so we used it. Now the new argument is that the cultural imperialism of the US is forcing us to change the term again. Sure, the term &quot;cross-walk&quot; sort of makes more sense than zebra crossing, but not enough that you don&#x27;t need it defined for you the first time you encounter it. So, it is not such a precise and great term, as you almost say, that one can ignore the cultural imperialism argument.<p>Both arguments (colonialism and cultural imperialism) are distinct and can be treated separately.')
