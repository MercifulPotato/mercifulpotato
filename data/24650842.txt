If that&#x27;s true, you can&#x27;t possibly do this at scale like you&#x27;d need for coronavirus things or global warming. I&#x27;m sure we all have delusions about something at some level. That&#x27;s why trust in public institutions is critical and those institutions need to be above reproach in their conduct. That doesn&#x27;t mean no bad conduct but an evidence-based belief that bad conduct is identified and punished. That could explain why American society has been crumbling. It&#x27;s taken a beating on the trust aspect by abuses from those in power for a long time. More importantly there haven&#x27;t really been meaningful reforms to address that abuse which has eroded the trust that was built up for so long. The &quot;small government&quot; movement has taken a long time but it&#x27;s finally winning in America because it identified trust as the weak point &amp; systematically kept attacking it &amp; used media to amplify the fight. A countermovement did not form in time so here we are with so many decades of damage. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s possible to rebuild that at this point.')
