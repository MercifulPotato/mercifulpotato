Very rarely would someone get bumped 10 plus years ago but in the last few years it was common practice. The planes were stuffed full where even the very back rows typically left open for flight attendants were filled.<p>I used to take at least one trip every week for 20 years and it wasn&#x27;t so bad. After 911 it became worse but the flight was still ok. The last 3-4 years have been absolutely terrible. Even 1st&#x2F;Business class was a joke and always oversold. I developed anxiety every time I had to fly simply because of the nightmare of getting through the lines (TSA&#x2F;Customs&#x2F;DHS), fighting the crowds, no where to even sit, dirty planes, etc. Flying became like riding in a cattle car.<p>I still fly about once a month and ever since the pandemic it&#x27;s a lot more pleasant. My last flight had over 100 empty seats and absolutely no lines or people at the airport. Reminded my of a flight I once took to YYZ from DFW on a 727 in 91. I  and two more guys were the only passengers on the whole plane, 2 in coach and the other in 1st. Three of us on the whole plane. Felt like a Rock Star on my own private jet....<p>I&#x27;m confident that flying will become miserable again. In another year I expect everything will be back to shit&#x2F;normal.')
