I do have more experience and, with it, a better sense of what matters and what doesn&#x27;t, so I waste less time on the stuff that doesn&#x27;t.<p>That is, however, a more subjective attribute and, thus, I don&#x27;t blame large companies for not being able to evaluate it.  They are inherently volume-based and thus focused on more obvious and measurable attributes that directly (though imperfectly) map to developer productivity.<p>As the kids say: it is what it is.  If you want to make increasing amounts of money for a long time, become a banker or a doctor.  I like writing code.')
