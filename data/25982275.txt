That is, utility will jump significantly after reaching a certain net worth.<p>Another explanation that is consistent with gambling behavior is that people have inaccurate <i>risk</i> functions; that they overestimate positive upside and underestimate downside.<p>I am not familiar with the economic literature. But I believe that there is more evidence to support the second hypothesis. Behavioral economics has showed that humans are notoriously unable to estimate risk accurately. I have not seen as much evidence that humans have discontinuous utility functions.<p>Behavioral economics also tells us that humans are also terrible at estimating their actual utility functions. So I also donâ€™t trust the original poster who <i>claims</i> that they have a discontinuous utility function. The only way to test that is to observe actual human behavior.')
