Once it is dead it is dead forever.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case. I think you&#x27;re giving humanity too much credit. If humanity kills itself from overpopulation and overconsumption, the earth will do just fine without us. Even if we harm it as badly as we did with something like the Chernobyl disaster (look how it has bounced back there).<p>We&#x27;ve only really existed as a species for a tiny amount of time in the earths 4.5b year history and billions of years from now we may not be here, but the earth probably will be.')
