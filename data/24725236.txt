They’re squishing the widespread (and somewhat bipartisan) support for the Black Lives Matter movement, a <i>protest</i> movement against police abuse, into the phrase “political activism”, which isn’t entirely untrue.<p>The problem is that “political activism” also encompasses the ongoing american culture war, which indeed does not belong at work in any capacity.  Reasonable people don’t want to engage with the culture war at work, and, increasingly, ever.<p>They want you to think the latter when they mean the former, and support them.  The problem is that the “activism” they’re complaining about isn’t the culture war, it’s the fact that there was a widespread social movement to protest racist police abuse, and Coinbase management didn’t feel it important enough for them to participate.  Many of their staff took an issue with that, which has absolutely nothing to do with the sort of “who are you voting for?” thing that springs to mind when you think of “political activism at work”.<p>Don’t get me wrong, advocating for human rights is indeed political activism, which is why their technique is so effective.<p>It’s intentionally designed to deceive you.')
