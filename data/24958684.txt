Out of the remaining 64 bits, 16 bits are reserved to be FFFE. The remaining 48 bits used to be your MAC, and with privacy extensions are random.<p>I don&#x27;t know how SLAAC works if the gateway&#x27;s subnet is smaller than a &#x2F;64. But I doubt any ISP would give you anything smaller than a &#x2F;64; it&#x27;ll create problems on their end with no benefit due to larger routing tables (which is the reason NDP exists for routing within a subnet in the first place).<p>It&#x27;s not &quot;collide and fix it up later&quot;. IIRC NDP is used to check for anything using the new address at the moment, and if it isn&#x27;t then the device starts using it. NDP is already a core part of IPv6 (it&#x27;s the only way to route within a subnet) so I don&#x27;t think you have to worry about perf.')
