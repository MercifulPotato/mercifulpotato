As a result, we informed the site yesterday that they have 24 hours to move the domain to another registrar, as they have violated our terms of service,&quot; GoDaddy told the Washington Examiner.</i><p>FWIW, ar15.com is hosted on AWS. GoDaddy was just the domain registrar. I gather ar15.com was temporarily removed from the GTLD name servers because they didn&#x27;t move to a new registrar quickly enough.')
