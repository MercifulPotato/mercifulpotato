But I never use VLC myself to watch video files, simply because VLC is, and have always been, for years, consistently slower when seeking in all the commonly used file formats which I encounter.  It’s not exactly <i>slow</i>, it’s just… noticeably not as fast.  It is especially bothersome when skipping through a video to skim it, which I often do.  I currently use mpv (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mpv.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mpv.io&#x2F;</a>), which is much faster at skipping, even though mpv does not have a GUI to speak of.')
