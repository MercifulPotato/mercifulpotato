That&#x27;s pretty much the exact realisation I had at the mid point in this timeline - see the &quot;Rebrand&quot; section for the details.<p>So at that point I pivoted Bannerbear to be able to generate any kind of image, for any purpose.<p>New use cases are things like, generating ad variations, generating instagram posts, generating dynamic in-app images (e.g. in the welcome email for Bannerbear you get a personalized image header which is generated on-the-fly by Bannerbear) and these use cases are a lot more valuable to the end users.')
