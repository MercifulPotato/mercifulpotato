My prediction: all the use cases you&#x27;re using it for are not the ones that it&#x27;s designed for (i.e. which pay AWS&#x27;s bills). And historically, unintended&#x2F;illegible customers have a way of being caught out as the vendor shifts between strategies.<p>Certainly, I hope you can be the remora to this shark for a long time to come. Just be aware of the benefits <i>and drawbacks</i> of the position you&#x27;re taking.')
