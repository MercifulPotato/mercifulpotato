But after that, when do you talk about it?<p>Context: my company is remote-first. I&#x27;m having zero symptoms or tired-ness, and I don&#x27;t think it will affect my work except for the few days I need to give birth and recover.<p>I don&#x27;t want to &#x27;hide&#x27; it, but I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s super relevant to my work. I have a great relationship with my board and I&#x27;m sure at 6&#x2F;7 months I would probably just be super excited and mention it in that manner. Thoughts?')
