Item(by='philsnow', descendants=None, kids=[25796697], score=None, time=1610740242, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25794278, text='&gt; 20s are the prime dating years, it feels like a year was taken out where I aged but my life hasn&#x27;t moved.<p>So yeah there are people who are choosing to go on dates, gather, party, etc.  Those people are very visible.  I get it, there can be FOMO.  Why should you sacrifice when they&#x27;re having fun?<p>Does it help to consider that there are lots of people (dare I say a majority) your age who are making the same sacrifice you are?  If&#x2F;when things return to the old normal, you&#x27;ll have some sense of solidarity and shared maturity with them.  Selflessness is a good quality in a potential spouse.<p>(Of course, unlike the &quot;I voted&quot; sticker, there&#x27;s no &quot;I stayed home&quot; sticker, so in two years you&#x27;re not going to be able to tell who did what now.)<p>&gt; To make things worse, the whole staying at your home thing has made the desire of having a relationship even more strong as the alone periods do hit you hard.<p>I get this.  My wife passed away 9 months before the pandemic hit full swing and I&#x27;m lonely af.  I don&#x27;t get to see adult friends really at all anymore.<p>&gt; Though to put things in perspective, a lot of people had it way worse than just their dating life&#x2F;travel being disrupted.<p>Exactly this.  Every time you choose not to go to a party or whatever, you could be averting the death of a family member (yours or a friend&#x27;s, or friend-of-friend&#x27;s, etc).')
