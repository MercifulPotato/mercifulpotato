This is part 3 of my Python behind the scenes series. The goal of the post is to get familiar with the CPython source code and to see what happens at the very start of the execution of a Python program. We&#x27;ll look at the project structure, compile CPython and step through the source code starting with the main() function until we reach the evaluation loop, a place where Python bytecode gets executed.<p>The format is a bit unusual for the series since it contains a lot of code, but it should give a good idea of what CPython is. As always, I&#x27;d be glad to hear your thoughts on this one. I&#x27;m here to answer your questions as well.')
