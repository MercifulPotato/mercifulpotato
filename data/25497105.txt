But data to support explanations of that sort is hard to come by.<p>What I object to is the belief that all explanations that can in principle be put in terms of cause, must in practice be put in terms of cause--otherwise they&#x27;re useless (which, I think, motivated a lot of unnecessary handwaving in the bbc article, and probably in the ones that it references too).<p>Researchers should contribute useful data so that others can reference it to make decisions.  That data becomes less useful when they have incentives to skew things so that they can meet the awkwardly high bar of &quot;supports a causal argument&quot; just to be worthy of publication.<p>It ought to be ok to say: &quot;these things go together.
