And since it would not just be hitting the poor, undeveloped countries.<p>If the price of food goes up dramatically because of a shortage, this affects poor countries the most. They won&#x27;t be able to afford food at those prices.<p>If the country is a net exporter of food, which is not that common for poor counties, they could implement export restrictions, effectively subsidising local food prices. But where that doesn&#x27;t happen, rich countries will effectively be buying food from them while they starve.<p>Most of the food exporters are rich countries. They will export less or not at all due to lower production.<p>Poor counties will get the worst end of it, as usual.')
