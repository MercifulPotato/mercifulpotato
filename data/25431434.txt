We use JUCE as an abstraction layer over the audio APIs.<p>&gt; And really doesn&#x27;t have the ability to mark threads as real-time that will stick.<p>Yeah, we found this is the cause of a lot of real-time audio issues on Android. If you use systrace you can see that your audio thread is hopping from core to core. We get around this by manually setting the affinity of the audio thread to a certain core (working out which core to use requires some guess work sadly, there&#x27;s meant to be a way to ask for the &quot;best&quot; core but it doesn&#x27;t really seem to work).')
