If you work in the toilet hardware industry, buy&#x2F;sell stocks related to that industry.<p>A lot of success in investment seems to me to gravitate around what the general populace thinks is valuable or should be valuable. I often find that can sometimes drastically differ than assessments I form based entirely on niche expertise I have in a domain. It&#x27;s a lot more about asessing perception, ability to manage consumer&#x2F;investment perceptions, and momentum of perception than it is about assessing functional advantage.<p>When I make an assessment in an area with niche expertise, I often realize I need to then think <i>a lot more</i> about how other people will perceive and assess the same information. Usually my assessment of others&#x27; perception better predicts success than my personal assessment, anecdotally speaking.<p>The good news is, from my niche expertise domains, I usually have a fairly good sample of interactions with those outside the domain to sample their misperceptions and find what it is people think vs what is actually going on. What I fail at is then predicting the irrational decisions that follow after because that distribution seems to be almost random.<p>Because of this, I stick with indexes which are a sort indirect popularity listing.')
