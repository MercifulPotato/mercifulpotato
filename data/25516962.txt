Just like any other member of society, a scientist may want to contribute to a (for-profit or non-profit) organization of their choice, be it for material or spiritual rewards. However, I think it&#x27;s important not to get science and marketing confused.<p>So, I think a more precise title would be &quot;Google told its scientists to strike a positive tone when they use academic papers as a marketing tool&quot;.')
