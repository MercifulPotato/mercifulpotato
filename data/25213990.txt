Item(by='cdubzzz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606336424, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25213420, text='&gt; I do think they would be surprised if that rest request failing meant that the program couldn&#x27;t launch.<p>I fully agree. The only point I was aiming to make with my original comment was that the mere act of a program connecting to the Internet “unexpectedly” is by no means abnormal.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s kind of why I was thinking of Linux as cheating on some level. Windows&#x2F;Mac programs basically can&#x27;t do the same thing, since they don&#x27;t have the same infrastructure.<p>MacOS, at least, is definitely headed in that direction with its App Store and the move to Apple silicon.')
