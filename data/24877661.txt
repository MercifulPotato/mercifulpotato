An academic syllabus might claim &quot;Roth IRA implies X&quot; then the law changes and it is no longer true.<p>2) The schools would be opening themselves up to legal liability if they accidental offer financial advice that goes bad (eg, invest in shares -&gt; first time in history share market collapse -&gt; angry people blame school).<p>No conspiracy, they just can&#x27;t teach a moving target and the liability issues are - when you think through them - enough to be very troubling.')
