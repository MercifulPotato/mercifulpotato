As the article mentions, many customers were afraid of AWS because they feared Amazon snooping in their retail intel. Because MS doesn&#x27;t have a big e-store presence, they were not a retail threat. And Azure integrates better with existing Windows networks. Compatibility is still a key here, not raw merit. AWS is technically better.<p>That being said, Satya has been a steady hand and has made it fairly easy to keep running legacy software rather than pulling the carpet out, like VB-classic (desktop) did. Google, on the other hand, changes products like a teen changes fashion.<p>The VB-Classic fiasco under Ballmer sent panic through the industry, making customers realize they can no longer bet the farm on any MS tech, which they had been doing. Dot-Net was not backward compatible. COBOL still lives largely because co&#x27;s don&#x27;t or can&#x27;t F with it. That&#x27;s a lesson to not be ignored. (The need for a network GUI standard with similar properties is still out there.)<p>Businesses hate upgrading just for the sake of upgrading. Satya seems to understand this, making transitions gentler and more gradual.')
