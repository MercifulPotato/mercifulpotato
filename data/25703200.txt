Sums, tabulations, even &quot;exploding dice&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s still a lot to do, every time I add a feature I think of two possible new ones.  I&#x27;ve got to say, SVG is *really* nice.  I think many developers would have the first instinct to do this in an HTML Canvas tag, but SVG does so much heavy lifting for you.')
