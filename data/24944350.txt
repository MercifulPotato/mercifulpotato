And another 60,000 wolves in Canada.  In comparison, all of Scandinavia has maybe 400 or so.  IOW, US+Canada has 200x the wolf population in 17x the land area (human population density is roughly the same).  While apx 80,000 wolves does not seem enough to be considered &quot;thriving&quot; IMO, they&#x27;re in no danger of extinction anymore.  So while some care should be taken to maintain populations, it seems reasonable to take them off the endangered list.<p>There are also 10&#x27;s of thousand mountain lions, 10&#x27;s of thousand bears, and millions of alligators in the USA.  The USA&#x2F;Canada is not exactly lacking in dangerous apex predators.')
