Apple is touting silence now, but had the thermals of intel MacBooks been better they could be way less of hairdryers too. Apple could have also introduced better power controls for Intel Macs (now everybody runs Turbo Boost switcher).<p>iMac Pro has shown that they can do better with same enclosure, I wonder if they could have done something with MacBooks too. They would probably have to sacrifice a few millimetres of thinness but I think the decreased noise and throttling would be more noticeable.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t believe there was any master plan behind this. They just originally prioritised thinness and battery size over everything else. With M1 they can have their cake and eat it too.<p>Edit: Also they could have ditched Intel for AMD a generation or two ago and also improve on performance per watt.')
