I think Amazon and all the &quot;I provide your software as a service&quot; providers eat into that and hinder that future.<p>Yes, GPLv3 was meant to fight Tivoization, but it never anticipated providers providing services on an OSS product without contributing significantly, <i>in combination with</i> the companies that develop the OSS hoping to make money off the same hosted service that the former undercuts.<p>Basically, monetization strategies for OSS are few, and one that is beneficial for both the company and the consumer is providing hosted services. A third company that doesn&#x27;t have to develop the software is usually a good enough competitor, but since the developer has the obvious support&#x2F;knowledge advantage, they can still compete. This breaks down when Amazon comes in with its lock-in advantage and sucsk all the money away from the developer.<p>This is why we&#x27;re seeing these new licenses, because there&#x27;s no way currently to be &quot;OSS except Amazon&quot;. I think we do need to figure out some way.')
