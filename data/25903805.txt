Making it criminal to be poor is against human rights.<p>Lol, you&#x27;re taking a very ungenuine shortcut.  \nLegal residents who also happen to be poor do not resort to begging because they receive help through the appropriate welfare programs.  \nThe the overwhelming large majority of people affected by this law are foreigners who take advantage of Schengen to come to a rich country only for begging. These people have no legitimity of being here and earn no sympathy from me.')
