She was a world expert on essential fats as well as a physicist.  Her work directly followed on that of Otto Warburg, and it is said she cured many many people of Cancer.  Having tried her &quot;Budwig Protocol&quot; myself at a time when my energy levels were so low that I had to quit my job and focus only on recovering my health, I can attest that it truly works for delivering more oxygen and thus energy and vitality to one&#x27;s cells.  Today I am healthy and feel much better than I did 5 years ago.')
