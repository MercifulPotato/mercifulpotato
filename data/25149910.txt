This led to me taking up to 9 hours of math credits in a semester. The reason I declared my math minor was because I was interested in going for a PhD in economics and my econ professors all recommended that I try to take as many math classes as possible to prepare. Reader, I was not a &#x27;numbers person&#x27; at all.<p>However, in all of my math classes, I asked questions all. the. time. when I didn&#x27;t understand. I would go to office hours and the teachers were seriously so helpful. This was the only way I survived. I learned that you don&#x27;t have to be a &#x27;numbers person&#x27; at all to be good at math. You just have to understand what&#x27;s going on under the hood, and this may require lots of questions and outside help. But most importantly, you just have to practice. I ended up graduating with nearly a 4.0 for my math minor.')
