Hearing is logarithmic in frequency, i.e. the perceived difference in pitch between 100 Hz and 200 Hz is the same as between 10,000 Hz and 20,000 Hz - an octave.<p>Tube amps have output transformers. It&#x27;s difficult to design wideband power transformers (heck, designing <i>any</i> transformer is difficult), so most of them have reduced output in the top octave. (AKA &quot;high frequency rolloff&quot;.)<p>One reason for the bad reputation of transistor amps is this: -<p>Many early transistor amps (and some still today) were prone to oscillation at MHz frequencies under some circumstances. The oscillation itself is inaudible but it affects the linearity control of the amplifier (negative feedback). Amplifiers were oscillating at MHz frequencies for a millisecond or two and losing control, which had a noticeable effect on the sound.<p>The oscillation wasn&#x27;t picked up by the designers (of the early transistor amplifiers), because who needs a 100MHz oscilloscope for designing audio circuits that only go up to 20kHz? That&#x27;s just silly. (Until, of course, it isn&#x27;t.) And in those days, 100MHz scopes were expensive.<p>There are other reasons. For example, tube amps withstand some overload; transistor ones don&#x27;t. Exceed the output transistors&#x27; second breakdown rating for a tenth of a second, and suddenly you have no sound. Your new speakers you just brought home from the store killed your amp. &quot;But they&#x27;re 8 ohms, same as the old ones!&quot; (Another long story there.)<p>It took a while to figure out all this stuff and how to protect against it, and in the meantime, reputations were made and lost. Tube good, transistor bad.')
