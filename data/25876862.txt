The emphasis is on &quot;neutralize,&quot; because the underlying strategy is based on the premise that there is no truth, only power, and for an opponent to be neutral, or do nothing, means there is no resistance to your agenda.<p>When &quot;everything is political,&quot; it is sufficient to isolate an opponent from a conversation because in that view, all power comes from attention and approval of others, because they have been trained to be psychologically actuated by shame. It&#x27;s why, &quot;not a good look,&quot; has become a standard put down, even among some men. This idea of litigating for power is why many people don&#x27;t like lawyers, and when half the middle class is educated to act like the seediest of  prosecutors, you get that thing that&#x27;s wrong with someone you just can&#x27;t put your finger on. I have some actual friends like this, and we find a way, but part of why there is so much hostility in the culture is because one side never thought they would need a new bare-metal up critical framework to conceive of how awful we&#x27;ve educated some people to become. One of the SSC rules was &quot;be charitable,&quot; which is the value that the weak-man style of argument throws out. It&#x27;s basically being uncharitable. So glad to see Alexander articles on HN lately.')
