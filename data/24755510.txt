The given answer is that it wasn&#x27;t Moses. But as well as that, it wasn&#x27;t &quot;2 of each kind&quot; either:<p>&quot;Take with you seven pairs of every kind of clean animal, a male and its mate, and one pair of every kind of unclean animal, a male and its mate, and also seven pairs of every kind of bird, male and female, to keep their various kinds alive throughout the earth.&quot; -- Genesis 7:2-3<p>For whatever reason we are taught as children that it was 2 of every animal, but really it was 1 or 7 <i>pairs</i>, depending on whether they were clean, not clean, or birds. The song singing &quot;2 by 2&quot; is essentially correct, but deciding that means there were only 2 sheep is not correct. Spoiler: There were 14 sheep.<p>That makes 2 information processing errors. In terms of coding, it&#x27;s not easy to tell what errors the identity issue would cause since that would be implementation specific. But the second issue would clearly trigger a buffer overflow.')
