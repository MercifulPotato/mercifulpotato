OpenBSD&#x27;s niche is being so secure it (almost) hurts. Curating that is worthwhile in a Research OS sense: How many knobs can we tweak on a POSIX system to increase security while explicitly and loudly not caring about much of anything else? Keeping everyone who doesn&#x27;t share that vision out is part of the plan.<p>They can be the security pioneers, and the rest of us can see where they get scalped so we don&#x27;t repeat their errors.')
