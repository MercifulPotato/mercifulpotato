William Shockley chose that area to start a company partly because his ailing mother lived there.[1]<p>Another contributing reason was a Navy Research center was in the Bay area so the military was an eager buyer of the latest semiconductor technology.<p>The seeds of a few players starts a &quot;business cluster&quot;.[2]  Similar phenomenon as movie industry concentrated in Los Angeles.  Country music in Nashville.  Finance&#x2F;fashion&#x2F;publishing in New York.<p>I don&#x27;t think COVID in combination with better telecommuting technology like Zoom will disperse business clusters as some think.  It definitely will enable more remote collaboration but the concentration of business clusters will still remain.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;William_Shockley#Shockley_Semiconductor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;William_Shockley#Shockley_Semi...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Business_cluster" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Business_cluster</a>')
