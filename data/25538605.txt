They run heat exchangers between the in-bound municipal water and loops that go to the office buildings.<p>So it helps with some eco-effects (ie: there’s no dumping of the heated water), but everyone’s municipal water is a bit warmer in summer. I don’t think the effects of that have been calculated. Can offset water heating a bit; but other office towers use that water for their a&#x2F;c cooling needs.<p>They deepened the water intake too, so it definitely means colder tap water in winter too, which residents mostly have to heat up inefficiently.')
