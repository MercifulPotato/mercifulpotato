A lot of people feel that dynamic + fp is just the right thing. It&#x27;s not an omission, since putting in static typing restricts, complicates and remolds a language a lot.<p>[1] Yes, there&#x27;s optional type declarations in CL, as an add-on feature. But I&#x27;d guess most CL programs don&#x27;t elect to use them.')
