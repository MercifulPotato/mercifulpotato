It was much cheaper to make your own competitive search engine that it is to compete with Google today].<p>It might also have been easy when new paradigms were taking off, and old companies couldn&#x27;t work with them (e.g. switch from mainframes to PC), living a spot open. Now big companies can diversify more easily, predict future trends (like Google adopted to a mobile world, and will adapt to VR or whatever comes next).<p>Now the technologies are more involved (even in &quot;non tech&quot; companies) and the stakes higher. Even if you can just design your advanced product and order units from a generic chinese manufacturer, you wont get the same economies of scale, preferential treatment, distribution, etc, as a large company.<p>And if some wanabbe company gets threatening enough, a bigger company can just buy it. Especially since going to the stock market as opposed to being self-owned means all companies are up for sale.')
