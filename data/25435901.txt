People want the current American president censored because he&#x27;s spewing lies and falsehoods about every time he opens his mouth. His lies and propaganda have cost over 300000 American lives, and has caused a major deterioration of US&#x27; international reputation.<p>Again, no other country on earth (that I&#x27;m aware of) subscribes to the notion of unrestricted free speech. Speech that is intended to deceive, mislead, defame and&#x2F;or slander others has legal consequences in Europe.<p>Even under US&#x27; rules, calling people out on false and&#x2F;or hateful speech, and ostracizing them is <i>exactly</i> the &quot;market of ideas&quot; responding to such speech and suppressing it. You may say what you want, but if your speech is repugnant, we the public are fully entitled to ask you to go talk elsewhere (or not at all). It isn&#x27;t censorship, it is that we all think you&#x27;re an ass.<p>Note that actual censorship is already reality for most individuals in the US. For most, what they&#x27;re allowed to say publicly is beholden to a corporation not minding what they say. If that corporation doesn&#x27;t like what you said, you get fired and there goes your ability to earn your keep. And without a job, house, food, and healthcare are gone.<p>As mentioned earlier, unrestricted free speech is only a luxury for the rich and powerful to get away with lying for their own benefit without any checks and balances. I think we, the public, deserve a better.')
