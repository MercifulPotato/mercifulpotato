The article is based on % change which is of course ridiculous because the % increase of a small population isn&#x27;t at all interesting. And GP also has a ridiculous claim. So I&#x27;m offering a stake in the ground to determine if Julia is on the track that GP claims. If GP wants to come back and discuss where the stake should be, it will be an interesting conversation.')
