Abuses and crimes should always be persecuted. I have read lots of posts on Parler, and ALL grounds for violent speech, radicalisation and terrorism apply to lots of them. I&#x27;ve read posts inviting people to hang and quarter democrats on the streets in front of their families, as well as posts inviting armed sedition against the institutions. Those who use this kind of language MUST be made accountable of their words, just like we&#x27;d make ISIS supporters accountable of their words. It&#x27;s not that just because they&#x27;re white and Christian dudes that look like us we can condone them a bit more. And if a platform refuses to limit this language, then the whole platform must be taken down.<p>2. Your freedom ends where my beings. You may be free of saying whatever you want, but if that ends up doxxing information about me that I didn&#x27;t want to reveal, or it ends up spreading misinformation about me that ends up in death threats, then you are NOT free to do that.<p>Parler has failed to guarantee both the non-negotiable freedoms when it comes to building a sustainable free speech framework, therefore it must be taken down. I really fail to see any contradiction in this.<p>And keep in mind that the anarco-liberalist vision of free speech is something that has arisen only in the past couple of decades. The founding fathers of the liberal school thought (including Popper and Hayek), those who had REALLY seen how things in Europe ended up when unlimited freedom of speech is guaranteed also to fascist jerks, were well-aware that unconstrained freedom with no framework to contain fundamentalism is a threat to a tolerant society. &quot;Being intolerant with the intolerant is a civic duty for a tolerant society that wants to preserve its values&quot; (Popper)')
