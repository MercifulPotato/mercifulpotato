Ie., a prettier &quot;black box&quot; but still the same core method as a black box. In principle doesn&#x27;t even need to be any more work, it&#x27;d be easy enough to throw together a simple &quot;pixelate erase&quot; script that&#x27;d take a selection, apply average solid color and random text over it, then pixelate the result all in one automatated step.<p>The problem is if some people think <i>any</i> modification of the original information is ever good enough. Anything based on the original could leak information, so need to erase and then apply any desired aesthetics afterward.')
