He remained in a job where he knew his employers were taking the absolute piss out him long enough that he turned toxic himself.<p>What? Do you realize you&#x27;re attacking the guy for breaking out of the toxic relationship? And do you realize you&#x27;re attacking the guy for refusing further abusive requests directed at him by the same guys with a long track record of abuse?<p>Let&#x27;s try to be serious: there is exactly zero issues to point at Gust&#x27;s actions. He was subjected to abuse, he packed his bags and left, and when subjected to further abuse after his resignation he simply rejected it. End of story.<p>And using profanity does not make someone as bad a participant than employers abusing their employees as described in the article.')
