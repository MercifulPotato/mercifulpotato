People actually queue, instead of creating a melee at every counter. You&#x27;re never worrying about people cutting you in lines. Cars stop at zebra crossings to let pedestrians cross. <i>No one</i> honks! They nod and smile &quot;bonjour!&quot; as they cross you on the street. There is no pollution here. The food is great, the coffee is even better, the $5 wine at your local grocery store is some of the best in the world. The employees you&#x27;ll work with have some basic dignity and shame. If they don&#x27;t know something, they&#x27;ll admit it. They won&#x27;t grossly lie on their resumes. You&#x27;ll never hear the words &quot;do the needful&quot; or &quot;prepone&quot; or, my most hated &quot;kindly revert back&quot;! There is a basic amount of honesty here. You don&#x27;t spend all your time worrying if the guy you&#x27;re doing business with is fleecing you. You <i>will</i> find information about businesses online.<p>This place is as close to paradise as it gets on planet Earth.<p>Life, and especially youth, passes by in an instance. I highly advocate keeping this fact in mind in the face of do-gooders who judge you for your choices. The million small and large quality of life improvements lead to exactly that. A vastly higher quality of life.')
