It may have been a different strain, or the antibody tests are garbage (or both), since they reported negative. There&#x27;s no doubt I (and a number of friends and family) had it. The symptoms are pretty specific. If I didn&#x27;t have it, then that&#x27;s even worse, as it means there&#x27;s a bug out there, with the exact same symptoms, in addition to COVID-19.<p>Scary bug. I could def see what I had killing people. I had no idea what it was, back then. I just thought I was getting pneumonia, and it broke, just as I was ready to go to hospital. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t do that, as I would have just infected a whole bunch of vulnerable people.<p>Since then, I&#x27;ve had a persistent &quot;throat-clearing&quot; thing. Lots of &quot;harUMPHf.&quot; My sense of taste never fully recovered, either (that was the weirdest part of it. I&#x27;ve never had that happen before).<p>I&#x27;m really grateful that it wasn&#x27;t worse. I know some folks that died from it.')
