If your point is that even experimental methods can&#x27;t truly reach 100% (due either to underlying motion in the protein, or can&#x27;t determine the structure), that&#x27;s more or less what Moult is saying (they more or less arbitrarily define ~1A resoution and GDT of 90 as the &quot;threshold at which the problem is solved&quot;).')
