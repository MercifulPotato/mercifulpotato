There&#x27;s a whole big subset of the population that barely manages to stick with school at baseline.  Educational interruption in other circumstances has been shown to have bad outcomes.  We&#x27;re trying to do better this time, but the school system as a whole is overtaxed.<p>I&#x27;m a middle school teacher.  Even with best practices for remote education, I&#x27;ve seen all kinds of negative impacts.  It&#x27;s going to take a whole lot of support to get these kids to anywhere near a normal curriculum.')
