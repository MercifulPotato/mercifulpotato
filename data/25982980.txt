The new extension, ECH, will need significant testing and development until it can reach the same level of support again.<p>The concept is the clear and obvious way forward in web security; what&#x27;s the point in encrypting DNS when the SNI is still readable. I&#x27;m also glad that eSNI has been dropped because of the obvious flaws found in it rather than continuing attempts to secure an inherently flawed protocol. However, this does mean that deployment will take longer than previously estimated, which is kind of a bummer.')
