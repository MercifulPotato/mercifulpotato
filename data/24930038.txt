It basically had its genesis in some higher up hearing that Google does this thing, so we probably should too. That then later turned into a bunch of random DevOps&#x2F;Sys Admins drafted into the new org reading the Google SRE book. It was a shamelessly cargo cult approach.<p>After a year all we really had was hundreds of Confluence pages specifying policy for this and that, a bunch of ceremony added around releases, and arbitrary SLA&#x2F;SLOs defined. Almost zero actual technical work was accomplished. They then started filling the team with new grads who had neither devops or sysadmin experience, kind of cementing the perception that it was a non-technical role.<p>Either way I’m not a fan of the entire concept after being subjected to that suffering!')
