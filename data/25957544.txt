That&#x27;s not where the difficulty comes from. It&#x27;s more about optimisation: their entity system minimises memory use (and caches misses), many things are special cased for speed…<p>Think about the sheer scale of a 10 rocket per minute megabase. The amount of inserters, robots, belts, factories, the pollution involved, the number of biters attacking the base constantly… The number of entities on such a base is <i>enormous</i>, yet they still manage to compute it all in real time at 60 ticks per seconds. That feat of engineering is just as impressive as a 3D physics engine — perhaps even a 3D <i>rendering</i> engine.<p><i>(Of course, a AAA game is more than just a physics&#x2F;rendering engine.)</i>')
