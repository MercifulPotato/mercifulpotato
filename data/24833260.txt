When Lex asks basic questions, they are the sort of things I want to hear about.<p>Sure there&#x27;s room for a more in-depth&#x2F;challenging conversation but I don&#x27;t think that Lex&#x27;s podcast is the place for that. Theres probably a handful of people who would be able to challenge Chris properly (Maybe a conversation with another LLVM contributor or someone on the Swift team would be interesting).<p>Loved the podcast Chris, thanks for giving your time and hope you keep doing stuff like this!')
