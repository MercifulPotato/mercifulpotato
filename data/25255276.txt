What&#x27;s the big difference between the way Java does it and the way Rust does it?<p>In Java, unchecked exceptions are similar to Rust&#x27;s panics. Sure your less inclined to catch panics than you might be to catching unchecked exceptions, but you can do it in either. Though perhaps Java&#x27;s Error is closer to a rust panic.<p>Checked exceptions are just like the Result type IMO. The discoverability of the error surface is the same, you just don&#x27;t get the nice pattern matching and sum types to handle&#x2F;represent it.<p>What I&#x27;m getting at is that I&#x27;m a fan of the way Rust does error handling, but I don&#x27;t get _why_ it feels different to the way Java does it. On the surface they&#x27;re the same, but I loathe the Java approach. Maybe it&#x27;s just whatever the opposite of rose-tinted glasses is.')
