In practice this happens twice, as a poisoned pre-certificate to obtain proof of logging from public log servers, and then the real certificate with the proofs baked inside it.<p>* Signatures by their OCSP signer periodically on an OCSP response for each certificate saying it&#x27;s still trustworthy for a fixed period. Again this will be inside an HSM.<p>* Signature verification on a subscriber&#x27;s CSR. To &quot;complete the circuit&quot; it&#x27;s helpful that Let&#x27;s Encrypt actually confirms you know the private key corresponding to the public key you wanted a certificate for, the signature on your CSR does this. Some people don&#x27;t think this is necessary, but I believe Let&#x27;s Encrypt do it anyway.<p>You&#x27;re correct that none of this happens on the database servers. I guess it&#x27;s possible their servers use TLS to secure the MariaDB connections, in which case a small amount of either ECDSA or RSA computation happens each time such a connection is set up or torn down like at any outfit using TLS, but those database connections are cached in a sane system so that wouldn&#x27;t be very often.')
