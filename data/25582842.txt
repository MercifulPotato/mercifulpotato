I&#x27;m going to go get the vaccine as soon as I can because what&#x27;s the alternative? I want to go to concerts and travel again. If I don&#x27;t get the vaccine my choices are: \n1) not care and probably get COVID-19, which has a chance of developing the same autoimmune issues that have been discussed\n2) hide in my room for another unspecified length of time.<p>It is at this point that I remind myself of all the other dangerous things that I do: driving, motorcycling, rock climbing, skiing, etc.<p>The risk of long term side effects is worth the benefit of spinning up the global economy again.')
