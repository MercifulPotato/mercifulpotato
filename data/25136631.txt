They are acting like an affiliate I said. It is close enough.<p>&gt; Right. But that&#x27;s just facilitating a transaction, which is usually not a 30% cut.<p>Yes it is a 30% cut. We have already established it is on other stores.<p>&gt; Again, standard and reasonable are different things. And again, the problem is you can&#x27;t choose the type of relationship.<p>You can choose not to do business with Apple.<p>&gt; People get pressured into unreasonable rates all the time...<p>These aren&#x27;t unreasonable rates though. If they were unreasonable people would not publish there. End of. I don&#x27;t understand how people can say something is unreasonable when there are lots of people using it and making money just fine. So for a lot of people they obviously think it is reasonable.<p>&gt; Again, standard and reasonable are different things. And again, the problem is you can&#x27;t choose the type of relationship.<p>You can. You can not deal with the app store.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s always going to be viable for someone to publish. Even with a 90% fee. But surely we can agree that 90% would not be reasonable, even if it was standard?<p>No we cannot agree. Firstly 90% is not viable to anyone, nobody would agree to that and people wouldn&#x27;t publish on the app store. So to start your premise is completely absurd.<p>Pretend for a moment Apple did raise it tomorrow to 90% cut to them. The vast majority of would just pull their apps and Apple would have to lower the rate again. Every company chooses 30% because it is what everyone else does because it is more or less fair to both parties. Now if another player releases a new phone with a store and they have a better market rate and a decent market share then Apple will lower their rates (like Nintendo did).')
