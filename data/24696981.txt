Visualizations help to understand and troubleshoot a system, but for the actual changes or additions I see more potential in NLP to communicate intent to the computer that it then turns into code rather than different GUIs. 3D GUIs I reckon would be similar to visual programming languages in a sense that they are really useful for certain use cases and to interact with a lower level system, but don&#x27;t universally replace the environments we currently have.<p>Where I think 3D has much more potential, is using something like google glass or full on VR headset to augment what is seen in the &quot;real world&quot; in professional settings.<p>E.g. a couple years back I had a conversation with my sister who is anesthetist (at the time in the heart surgery department if I remember correctly) about them experimenting with robotically-assisted and remote surgery. If you only see what you are working on trough a camera where depth perception can be problematic, I could see it beneficial to have real time overlays to outline shapes or other augmentations to what you are seeing.<p>Also there might be interesting things in manufacturing, like showing you if you are within tolerances during assembly or have some algorithms&#x2F;AI running over it to highlight aspects that seem out of the normal.<p>But in either case it might well be more distraction that actually useful for those people.')
