I train Westside style lately coming back to it after 15 years.<p>I use the metadata to capture partial ranges and accommodating resistance. For example<p><pre><code>    Bench:\n      # grip: index on smooth\n      # pin height: 16 inches off bench\n      # chains: 100lbs\n      135 5r\n      225 3r\n       ...\n</code></pre>\nAnd on and on. I have added pieces to the language over the two years Iâ€™ve been using it and I hope to write a better guide (maybe short book) on how you can capture different kinds of training.<p>Thanks for looking!')
