And it is... in the stock market, which doesn&#x27;t figure into the consumer price index.<p>The CPI, meanwhile, has been stable, or even under the Fed&#x27;s target. Presumably because those are basics, and you don&#x27;t really need to buy much more of the basics just because you have more money. (The people with newfound stock wealth, that is; the people without it don&#x27;t have any more money to spend in the first place.)<p>It&#x27;s still a little unclear to me why the S&amp;P 500 has remained in the &quot;inflated but not insane&quot; through most of the past decade -- though for the past week or so it&#x27;s trending back to &quot;insane&quot; (a P&#x2F;E ratio well above 20). That means that earnings were coming from somewhere, and if not from core consumer products, then presumably from other things that the stock-market-wealthy were buying from each other, at presumably inflating prices, or at least quantities.')
