But now I think he wants to put a PC inside every body in the world. This man is not a doctor, and neither is his money being used for our good. Only the good he thinks is. But he is a sociopath so his good is warped and nefarious. \nNot once has clean living or healthy lifestyle been advised from the gates foundation, only corporate profit making items like toxin vaccines and GMO foods.\nThis man should be shot at the bottom of a fast filling hole.')
