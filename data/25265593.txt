To do so, you&#x27;d need to control 51% of the staked ETH. Not only is this a lot of money but it would probably cause ETH&#x27;s value to drop. There&#x27;s very little incentive to destroy the value of a currency you have a majority stake in. There are stronger incentives to keep the network secure and healthy.<p>The keypoint seems to be that if your attack fails your stake gets destroyed so besides the positive incentives (a good stable network working for all) this system also relies on punishing failed attacks.')
