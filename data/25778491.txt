In the modern world war is increasingly an outmoded way of handling conflicts.  The number of wars, casualties in wars, and so on are a tiny fraction of what they have been historically.  The idea that war is the basis of peace is held strongly by those who study wars, but a thorough analysis puts and social inequality and disasters such as famines as being both the current drivers of war and in many cases avoidable.  At this time trade wars and competitions like the space race have a bigger effect on society than open conflict.')
