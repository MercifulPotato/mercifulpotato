I want to help the team members make better estimates and want any changes, usually delays, to be communicated clearly and understood by the upper management on a regular basis.<p>Sometimes I feel like I&#x27;m the only person obsessing over it, but there are signs at my company that we need clear communication of these. For example, there&#x27;s a tendency to underestimate, especially for projects that do not seem as difficult as they actually are.<p>How much does the upper management of your organization care about good estimates, and how well do they work with unexpected changes?<p>If you have a template for reporting these estimate changes, from individual team members to the team lead&#x2F;PM, and then the team lead&#x2F;PM to upper management, can you share it? If not, what do your reports usually look like?')
