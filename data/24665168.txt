There are a lot of jobs, maybe not easy well paying ones, but lots of jobs that would have you earning $30k or $40k a year without particularly specialized skills. The problem is that those are not nearly enough to cover <i>costs</i>, specifically in housing.<p>And the reason housing is so insane is that the homeowners cartel has manufactured a supply shortage AND with more or less permanently low interest rates (because due to the massive amount of government debt we have to keep them low) the real estate market prices out people who don’t want to take on insane amounts of debt.')
