Item(by='ajuc', descendants=None, kids=[25254726], score=None, time=1606748921, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25253712, text='Well, I&#x27;m in my mid 30s and I only have a fraction of your net worth, but I&#x27;ve decided a few years ago that I&#x27;ll be splitting my time +- 2 years of working, 9 gap months (spring-autumn), etc. I have a lot of health problems that will probably kill me before retirement one way or another so I don&#x27;t feel like saving till I&#x27;m 45.<p>It helps a lot that I work remotely in IT and live in Poland which is a very cheap country and I&#x27;m very low maintenance (for example my ideal vacations is biking and playing D&amp;D on the internet which is all I did in 2019 ;) ). I have 0 interest in cars and drive 1997 Fiat Punto in which a replacement engine costs less than my daily salary :) I know because we&#x27;ve burned it once by accident :)<p>I don&#x27;t think money have to be the main focus, as long a your have a sustainable plan with big margin of safety. I could live for 10 years out of my savings easily, that&#x27;s enough freedom for me if the alternative is delaying the freedom till I&#x27;m old. It would probably be a little different with kids, but we don&#x27;t want to have kids with my wife, so that&#x27;s not an issue.')
