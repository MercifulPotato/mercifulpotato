Item(by='dataflow', descendants=None, kids=[25954087], score=None, time=1611894986, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25953895, text='&gt; A user can&#x27;t be expected to know where the line is between &quot;working as intended&quot; and &quot;misbehaving&quot;.<p>Sure they can. RH even blasted out messages through the app telling people exactly what is going on, and what they can and cannot do. Nothing I&#x27;m aware of confusing about it, certainly nothing that caused people to give this rating. I don&#x27;t think people are dumb enough to not understand the difference between &quot;this app is broken&quot; and &quot;I was forbidden from trading GME&quot; with all the indications that were shown on the UI.')
