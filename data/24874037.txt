So simply getting congress to pass a resolution approving it (which in theory would solve the &quot;consent of congress&quot;) wouldn&#x27;t fly like it would with an interstate compact dealing with something more mundane and less political like water rights, or mutual deal on air pollution between several neighboring states.<p>Disclaimer: IANAL, this is not legal advice etc.')
