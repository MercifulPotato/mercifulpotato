Well, that pushes commits authored by every single person who ever committed to that other repository. Do I have to make all of them re-push only their own commits in order? Can robots not mirror repositories anymore? What about commits authored by people without github accounts?<p>There&#x27;s also the obvious issues of me merging a coworker&#x27;s commit into my branch, or cherry-picking, or rebasing a third-party contributor&#x27;s commits to update them before merge.<p>I think the case of &quot;push an existing repo with N authors to a new repo&quot; is a really compelling reason though for why that sort of &quot;you can only push commits with your email&quot; thing would not work.')
