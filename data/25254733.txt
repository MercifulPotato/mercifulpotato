He plays these really baffling chess variants (like all pawns + queen vs IM opponent) in hyperbullet (30 secs) or bullet (1 min) like in one of his streams he went on for minutes about how he hates 3+1 because it&#x27;s &quot;too serious&quot;. As someone who exclusively plays 15+10 or 30+20, his streams really just feel like watching a video game stream to me, since it&#x27;s impossible to understand &quot;the chess&quot; at that speed for a mere mortal like me.<p>For chess, I prefer watching e.g. agadmator&#x27;s YT channel. I stop, think, roll back pretty frequently. I can rarely solve his puzzles (&quot;feel free to stop the video...&quot; parts) but without stopping and thinking for a min, I can&#x27;t even understand the position lol.')
