The app also does all the work for you - it changes your background automatically, depending on the interval you choose (it even has a “surprise me” option). On other thing, too - it works on all platforms so you don’t have to worry about it being one-platform specific.<p>But, you can check it all out yourselves if you download it, we are looking for new users and feedback.')
