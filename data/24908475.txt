However, if you&#x27;ve decided to post, consider \n    Permission Only signs when:\n\n    Your primary goal is to know who is using your property;\n    You welcome hunters, but have had issues with other users;\n    You&#x27;ve made the decision to post, but want to show you support hunting and use \n    hunting as a tool on your property; and\n    You want to continue to allow other public access without written permission, such \n    as hiking and cross country skiing.</code></pre>')
