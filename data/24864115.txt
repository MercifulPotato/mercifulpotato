No need for cleaning solutions, flushing, etc. Simply heat the thing up for a few hours.<p>As for duration, that&#x27;s a function of temperature and desired safety margin. The higher temp you go to sanitize, the faster you can sanitize, but if they&#x27;re heating the ice cream mix as well, there&#x27;s likely a limit to how high they can get without damaging&#x2F;altering the mix. So the other variable is time, and that&#x27;s probably what leads to the multi-hour sanitize cycle.')
