Being early adopter, have 5GB storage. All \nI need is a peace of mind that I don&#x27;t loose important stuff if my computer breaks down or temporarily becomes unavailable. I don&#x27;t need any other feature. If I had to pay about $10 per year, I would just use it happily. But their minimum plan is &gt;$100. I occasionally use file-requests feature. If it was like pay as you go type, that would be good too. I think reasonable low tier pricing will get them consistent long term revenue.')
