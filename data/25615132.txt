Item(by='majewsky', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609612624, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25613255, text='SRS is really good for learning small, compartmentalized knowledge items. Its usefulness degrades quickly when you move from knowledge to concepts. I&#x27;m currently learning Japanese and using several SRS tools to do so. The ones that work the best are for characters and vocabulary. I also use one for grammar, which is okay-ish but doesn&#x27;t translate as well to the SRS format.<p>So in the context of programming languages, SRS might work if you need to memorize method names or method signatures (though I don&#x27;t see why that is needed in the age of autocompletion and instant lookups from inside the text editor), but not so much for fundamental language concepts (like &quot;how do lifetimes interact with the borrow checker&quot;).')
