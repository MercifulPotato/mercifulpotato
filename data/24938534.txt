I would pay more than cable prices for those two features.<p>I don&#x27;t except to pay one company and get all companies&#x27; products - in any context. You don&#x27;t get Whoppers at McDonald&#x27;s, Ford doesn&#x27;t sell Toyotas. Intermediaries create their own islands of exclusivity (you can only get X on Door Dash and Y on Uber Eats).<p>What I&#x27;m worried about is streaming services not letting me pay to not have to watch commercials.<p>Last thought - if you think there&#x27;s &quot;nothing good&quot; on platform Z you may be burning through content way too fast. I don&#x27;t think we can or should put out endless hours of  great new TV content aligned to each person&#x27;s tastes.')
