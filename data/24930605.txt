I spend most of my day staring at terminal windows, and it is where I prefer to work, so a CLI password manager was the natural choice.<p>As for why I replaced pass(1) with it, I now have a team that I need to share passwords with, and 1Password offers a perfect user experience for everyone. I will probably move to a self-hosted solution at some point, but for now, 1Password is perfect â€” we do use the Enterprise edition though, so your experience may be different.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.sr.ht&#x2F;~jamesponddotco&#x2F;dotfiles&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;.local&#x2F;bin&#x2F;1p" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.sr.ht&#x2F;~jamesponddotco&#x2F;dotfiles&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;.loca...</a>')
