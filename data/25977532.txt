While the people are indeed friendlier than today (and much more eloquent), they don&#x27;t seem happier. They don&#x27;t seem less stressed. The general problems are the same. I watched a bit from 1961 about the growing problem of extreme weather events (they discussed whether the atomic bomb was responsible). Another bit from 1962 reported youth crime at an all time high and blamed alcohol, sex and movies. They showed 15 years old tricking themselves into student clubs in Heidelberg to consume alcohol and drugs. A few weeks ago, I watched a bit about the Hong Kong flu pandemic in 1969 (40.000 deaths in Germany alone) where they discussed countermeasures like quarantine and closing schools.<p>Also, a national TV station here shows &quot;News from 20 years ago&quot;, where they just show the entire evening news from exactly 20 years ago. I have been watching this for years now, often while I am walking around the room. Just from the audio, it is often very hard to decide whether the news is from today or from the 90ies. The topics are often the same: politicians accusing each other of X, party Y announcing they now do X, violent conflicts in X, latest election polls, fear of war in Y.<p>When I watch these bits, I often think of these lines from the Joan Baez song &quot;Hello in There&quot; [0]:<p><pre><code>  Me and Loretta, we don&#x27;t talk much more\n  She sits and stares through the back door screen\n  All the news just repeats itself\n  Like some forgotten dream that we&#x27;ve both seen\n</code></pre>\n[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=k41y5Pd5NU0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=k41y5Pd5NU0</a>')
