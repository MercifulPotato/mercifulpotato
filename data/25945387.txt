There is nothing new under the sun.  There have been several identical losses in FOSS.  The bigger they are the better when this happens because there is enough volume and momentum to force a new FOSS branch.  If it is a &quot;tiny&quot; FOSS piece, there are not enough champions to fight.<p>&gt; So AWS was directly competing with Elastic, but *<i>not taking the same responsibility for the open source project or investing in it as heavily as Elastic was*</i>.<p>Eh?  AWS could have killed ELK in 5 minutes. They chose to branch, and contribute it back.  Several of the fixes and improvements are from AWS.  Did the author want an IBM&#x2F;CentOS takeover? Or, deny AWS to use Elastic but pretend to be FOSS?')
