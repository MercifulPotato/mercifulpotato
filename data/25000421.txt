Without pricing and reliability numbers, it&#x27;s impossible to know which that might be.<p>The closest vehicle in Tesla&#x27;s garage to this is the Tesla Cybertruck which looks bizarre, but is about $20,000 less than the nearest announced competitor. If Tesla launched a butt ugly Cybervan which was similarly functional and cost effective, you can bet it would be popular with the class of buyer who are shopping for e-Vans.<p>Right now I&#x27;m eyeballing the Cybertruck personally, <i>in spite</i> of it&#x27;s appearance. Spending $20k to get a more traditional looking truck just doesn&#x27;t make sense to me. The only concern I have is whether those high truck bed walls will screw things up.')
