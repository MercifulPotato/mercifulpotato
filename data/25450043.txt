One was happily reflective and talked about what a journey life had been, the other was upset and remorseful, talking about how much time he had wasted.<p>I wonder if the contents of your life are secondary to your semi-hardwired emotional state. I am naturally somewhat anxious and hate wasting a day; conversely, I have friends who seem totally content after 9 months of unemployment and video games. Maybe it does not matter what you achieve, boxes you check, friends or relationships you make along the way. At the end if you are an unhappy person it will not be enough, and if you are \n naturally content it will all seem ok.')
