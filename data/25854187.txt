Let me try to break it down with reference to the context of the article:<p>&gt; <i>Changing these dangerous dynamics...</i><p>The &quot;these dynamics&quot; Mitchell speaks about are, the rampant use of the internet to:<p>1. Foment violence and hate.<p>2. Reinforce white supremacy.<p>3. Politicians (or anyone playing politics, really) exploiting the architecture of the internet to spread lies &#x2F; hate &#x2F; what-have-you.<p>&gt; <i>temporary silencing or permanent removal of bad actors</i><p>These, presumably, include:<p>1. Terrorists organizations like the Proud Boys.<p>2. Divisive, regressive, repressive figures like Donald Trump.<p>3. Institutions hell-bent on inciting hate, spreading disinformation, facilitating abuse, inculcating disharmony, encouraging violence, sowing mistrust, aiding conspiracies...<p>&gt; <i>Additional precise and specific actions must also be taken</i><p>Absolutely.<p>I see this policy stance as being no different to wanting the education system to <i>not</i> purport Racism; this isn&#x27;t curtailing freedom of speech or any other freedom. It is purely an exercise in needing to do more than just deplatforming Racists: Not actively seek to create new ones!')
