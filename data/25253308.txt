Cleaning the lens didn&#x27;t help. The Internet told me it was possible to use a screwdriver to turn something in the console to increase power to the laser (iirc).

You know what they say about the one thing worse than an electronic engineer with a C compiler.<p>I recall that when replacing it, the electronics exchange place I went to would only sell a used PS2 when bundled with a controller, you couldn&#x27;t buy the console on its own. I did the obvious thing: I sold them a controller for store credit, then bought a PS2 bundled with a controller.')
