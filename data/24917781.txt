Self-driving cars are absolutely not in that category.<p>&quot;If your errors are irreversible and you can&#x27;t average them out, and your application is in open domain where there will never be a shortage of out of distribution samples, you are royally screwed. That is why I&#x27;m so skeptical of self driving cars, since that is exactly the application described.&quot;<p>For me it&#x27;s obvious the real issue are the edge cases - of course a self-driving car does fine in 99%+ of cases, but those small % of outlier cases are the ones where people potentially die. I suspect an entirely different approach is required to supplement&#x2F;supplant the deep learning one and fully autonomous vehicles are still quite some way off.<p>I do like all of the driver assist advantages coming out of this work however! I don&#x27;t think you can underestimate the value of having technology that works _with_ a driver until the point where self-driving cars become viable.<p>[0]:<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.piekniewski.info&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;08&#x2F;ai-the-no-bullshit-approach&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.piekniewski.info&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;08&#x2F;ai-the-no-bullshit-...</a>')
