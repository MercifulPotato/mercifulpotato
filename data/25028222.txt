People should vote.<p>The counter-meme is something I’ve seen a lot lately in both left and right wing circles. This idea being that if you’re not an activist, you’re the enemy. It is bullshit, and depressing to see on HN.<p>Does the person dying of cancer have time to care about politics? What about the person with crippling chronic disease?<p>What about the person who is just trying to make ends meet and comes home every day exhausted?<p>What about the person taking care of a relative, or recovering from an opioid addiction?<p>Being an activist is a luxury for people with a surfeit of money and free time.<p>Edit: the rapid downvoting of this post is actually a great example of how badly this idea has infested the meme-space. HN consists primarily of unbelievably privileged people, to whom the idea that someone might not want or be able to tie huge aspects of their identity to their politics seems to be unacceptable or at least controversial.')
