Working with decade-old legacy code is what you get paid huge amounts for and the reason you want to start from scratch in your free time.<p>I agree that this is not good overall, but it&#x27;s going to be very hard to convince people to work on not-fun things for free. Some might see it more akin to volunteer work, but the amount of people willing to do this are far outnumbered by the people simply doing things for fun. Too be fair, it is at least pretty great in so far as that they&#x27;re doing open-source work :)')
