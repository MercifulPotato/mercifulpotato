Instead, they have a critical mass of software that is inside their RDF and actively updates to every breaking change they roll out. They have the &quot;luxury&quot; of not having to care if they break random bits of old software* in the process.<p>(* software that may be niche, may not have large individual user bases, but which might actually not have modern up-to-date drop-in replacements)')
