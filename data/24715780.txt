I now understand your point and you&#x27;re right. Once you bring human and cultural values into the equation the proportions won&#x27;t work perfectly, perhaps not even close to what the mathematical reasoning suggests.<p>My idea is that in a world of loud opinions and poor reasoning, we should be able to understand if there are bottlenecks that have nothing to do with culture or interests and more with how society creates equal opportunities for its citizens. Any competent and ethical politician should understand that, regardless if they are right or left. If that was the case policy making will orbit around controlling systemic variables that put minorities in disadvantage and not so much on the emotional vitriol that comes from both sides when talking about diversity and racial equality.<p>I would hope that a company like Microsoft is willing to create objectives around diversity, not for the optics but rather because they actually have identified said bottlenecks in their own system and understand objectively why this is problematic.<p>At the end of the day I think the problem is that people always want to pin the problem on someone else, when it&#x27;s more than clear discrimination happens as a result of an uneducated, siloed sub-societies that are designed to keep social, economical, racial and cultural boundaries. We should design societies in such a way that when a silo is created it can be immediately be disolved to restore the balance.')
