At my gig we&#x27;ve embraced GCP&#x27;s managed cloud services, and I do not want to go back to 2015. The operating cost savings (no devops people!) and the low cost makes engineering systems for cloud-agnosticism very expensive. If Apple provided a range of managed services that met clients&#x27; needs, they could find a lot of success. Would they beat AWS? Highly doubtful, but Apple already provides a lot of cloud data services to Apple developers and consumers as part of iCloud.<p>I&#x27;m hopeful with respect to Apple dogfooding its silicon in the data center because it may feed back into robust ongoing support for Unix&#x2F;Posix on their publicly-facing platforms.')
