If that&#x27;s the case, it doesn&#x27;t matter what network your phone is on; command and control is done via the web.<p>Now, in terms of infecting each other, sure. But the point is to keep my data devices and such separate from my IoT devices. Yes, the whole IoT infrastructure may get infected and need a purge, but my goal is to keep infection of those from getting, say, my banking information. And yes, it assumes that the command and control app is reasonably secure, but that&#x27;s a whole different issue (and one reason why I would rely on Amazon or Alexa as a hub, and not some random no name company).')
