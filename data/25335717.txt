You can bet people withdraw with the 10% penalty all the time to spend that money on whatever they want, not college.<p>The gains are tax-free iff spent on qualified expenses.<p>Non-qualified distributions from a 529 pay ordinary income taxes on the realized gains <i>on top of the 10% penalty</i>. As a tax avoidance scheme, this one is pretty terrible.')
