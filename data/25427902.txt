At everything?<p>I can point out things I&#x27;m clearly above average at, and things I&#x27;m clearly below average at.  I can also point out areas where I have no idea, like driving.<p>If I start assuming I&#x27;m below average as a baseline, when I <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> assuming I was above average as a baseline, I&#x27;m pretty sure that will make me less accurate.<p>Thinking about things as just practice is good advice but I don&#x27;t see how it has any connection at all to whether my skill level is above or below average.')
