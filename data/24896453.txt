(e.g. pharmaceutical target screening)  Is this a task which in principle could be done to near-perfect accuracy (did the patient in the case study die?) vs one which could not be (did they like the movie a lot,  moderately,  somewhat,  almost, ?)  How well can you do with simple heuristics?<p>You can follow the traces to the literature and find the answers to those questions and you will find that people are sanguine about fundamental issues such as &quot;does this track of development converge on an asymptote of 99.8% accuracy or an asymptote of 75% accuracy.&quot;<p>Folks who know how to take a predictor and hook it up to a Kelly better make better money working for banks or trading on their own account than Google pays.')
