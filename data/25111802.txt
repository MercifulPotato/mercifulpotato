What vaccines do truly exhibit long term side effects?<p>Dengvaxia also comes to mind. Weird corner cases that only show up after an accelerated phase 3 trial when you start vaccinating way more than 30k people.<p>Same goes for the Guillain-Barr√© syndrome cases which are estimated at about 1 in 100.000 persons vaccinated. If the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines are able to cause any trouble that is as common as that, we would very likely have no idea right now based on the data that exists.')
