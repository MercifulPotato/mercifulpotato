Unfortunately, this part of the argument is fairly subjective.  Is $2&#x2F;mo&#x2F;person on vitamin D worth it?  ...maybe, but do we really know that yet?  Would that $2 be better spent on something else that would have more definitive long-term benefits?<p>Ultimately, I don&#x27;t see the logic in encouraging people to <i>prioritize</i> self-medication with vitamin D.  Of all the issues about which we could raise awareness, that seems like one of the most misguided and short-sighted: it&#x27;s focused on the pandemic of today, not the healthcare of tomorrow.  Of course, it&#x27;s possible to raise awareness about multiple issues, but to me this <i>feels</i> like one of the most out-of-touch with reality.  As a concrete, one-step-up example, what about vitamin C?  I would assume you&#x27;re more likely to get scurvy than rickets as a working-class Westerner, though I haven&#x27;t checked the numbers.')
