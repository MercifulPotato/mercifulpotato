In order for the claim to matter practically, the reactions he&#x27;s talking about have to replenish uranium to extraction-viable concentration at the same rate it&#x27;s extracted. It sounds like our Forbes writer is suggesting the process accelerates at least linearly with the extraction rate, and that&#x27;d be cool, but forgive me if I don&#x27;t take it for granted without further focus on why that&#x27;s a reasonable expectation.')
