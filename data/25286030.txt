However, OP might be talking to and about different people here. People who don&#x27;t know probabilities well exist, and some of them play the lottery. In fact, I think there&#x27;s a lot of them.<p>I think all OP is saying that it&#x27;s better for people to understand probability better, and then decide to play the lottery, like the people that you&#x27;re talking to.')
