Item(by='memsom', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607432950, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25343679, text='Okay I googled it - and it does make sense.<p>Apparently &quot;halvanden&quot; means one and a half (halv = half,  andan = 2nd, but for this &quot;2&quot;.)<p>So, 50 is actually &quot;halvtredsindstyve&quot;, which is ((3 - 0.5) * 20)... okay.. this is completely messed up! Only the Danes... only the Danes... making their language even less intelligible. ;-)<p>For the record, 60 is tredsindstyve, which is 3 * 20.. at least that makes some sense. The issue comes that 70 is halvfjerdsindstyve ((4 - 0.5) * 20) and 80 is firsindstyve (4 * 20), but fjerd and fir look like different words! They inbuilt extra confusion to make it even harder! 90 is halvfemsindstyve ((5 - 0.5) * 20).<p>It all makes some sense if you understand what is going on. Buy why?!?')
