I visited your main landing page on my phone and was not able to read anything but the larger headlines without zooming in. In my opinion this adds friction and increases bounce rate a lot. Depending on your traffic, it could be well worth it to add some CSS media queries to make this layout more responsive. I think plenty of people check websites out on mobile first, then come back later if the service is useful for them.')
