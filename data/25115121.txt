You should check out the OCaml manual: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocaml.org&#x2F;releases&#x2F;4.11&#x2F;htmlman&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocaml.org&#x2F;releases&#x2F;4.11&#x2F;htmlman&#x2F;</a><p>It is a complete and up-to-date manual of the entire OCaml distribution, including executables, language, runtime, and standard library. It&#x27;s rare to find modern industry-driven languages with this level of coherent documentation.<p>But regarding third-party library documentation, that is indeed spotty. Some people publish it, some don&#x27;t. I have to reluctantly conclude it&#x27;s due to a lack of tooling which automates the tedious processes.')
