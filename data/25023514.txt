I hardly see how 14 unarmed black men (most of not all instigating&#x2F;resisting) killed by police in the entire US in 2019 represents the biggest problem for black people. My mom works in the public school system and wholly agrees. The last thing black families need is &quot;defunding&quot; the police. And all these lockdowns over a virus with a 99%+ survival rate? It&#x27;s not just &quot;fear and anger&quot; for us, in the word&#x27;s of the left... facts matter.')
