We take temperature and precipitation readings from a coarse scale Global Climate Model grid and map them to a fine scale local grid. Letâ€™s say the global grid is 50x25 and the local grid is 1000x500. For each grid cell in the local grid, we want to know to which grid cell in the global grid it corresponds.<p>Climate scientist here. Colour me a little confused. We have a GCM which is (typically) on a structured grid, i.e. with latitudes &amp; longitudes on a pixel-like grid. Finding the GCM (coarse) grid cell for a given latitude&#x2F;longitude of the downscaled (fine) grid is an integer operation, i.e. invert lat = lat0 + i x delta_lat and lon = lon0 + j x delta_lon. Must be missing something here. Even if there is a strange projection, you can map it such that the deltas are uniform.')
