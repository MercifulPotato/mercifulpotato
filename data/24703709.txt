Eddie was very good, as are many other folks, but he was also a guitar hero and most really good players are not.  The world of &quot;guitar heroes&quot; got one smaller and I don&#x27;t know who is filling it up going forward.   It was the CEO of Fender that not long ago lamented that John Mayer (maybe one of the best contemporary guitar players around, he is very talented) doesn&#x27;t sell guitars the same way as youth aren&#x27;t trying to emulate him like they did some of those other guys like Van Halen.   That and someone had to sort of do that stuff &quot;first.&quot;  It&#x27;s going to be hard to reinvent tapping or impress the world by touching a drill to the strings again,  I don&#x27;t see it happening any time soon.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m wrong and a whole new world of of guitar techniques will be discovered running it though a DJ turntable and scratching and cutting or something.  I don&#x27;t know.   Maybe it&#x27;s also just a quality of our time,  hardcore blues fans have sort of lamented the dying off of the greats for a long time.')
