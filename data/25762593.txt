It is a relatively clean and straightforward instruction set, designed to be easily and efficiently implemented.<p>There&#x27;s not anything that is super crazy revolutionary, in contrast to the (still vaporware) Mill CPU architecture.<p>&gt; <i>Is it likely to evolve faster because it is open or more modern?</i><p>They have a good extension mechanism that allows relatively clean additions to the instruction set.  Some of the recent ones like the vector extension aren&#x27;t finalized yet.  Anyone can propose their own extension.  Historically, ARM might work with their most important customers to implement an extension, but good luck getting their attention if you&#x27;re not already paying them millions per year.')
