Smaller countries can serve as experiments that we can look to and use as driving forces for larger bodies to adopt, like the US or EU. Similar to how in the US we&#x27;ve seen states make things legal before the federal (e.g. same sex marriage, marijuana reform, etc), it is much cheaper and easier to do the experiment on a smaller scale first than convince a wide background of politically diverse forces to unite. I think the small groups doing things first is <i>extremely</i> helpful. So for that I say thank you, because your example will help my country take steps forward.')
