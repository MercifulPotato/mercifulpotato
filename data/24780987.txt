This energy can be in the form of heat, magnetic field, electric current, or mechanical strain.   If you keep the HTS colder you can accommodate more of the other forms of energy.   I do not know if sound would disrupt superconductivity but since sound is a form of energy it is very likely.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41598-019-50266-1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41598-019-50266-1</a>')
