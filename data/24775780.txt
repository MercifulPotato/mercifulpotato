Affinity&#x27;s products hit a good price sweet spot of being affordable, and they&#x27;re well supported.<p>I actually ended up more heavily switching to Krita though, just because I could install it on machines that weren&#x27;t &quot;mine&quot; without worrying about the license, and it was enough for my purposes in most cases.')
