Item(by='throwaway894345', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606859653, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25268891, text='&gt; We can nitpick on these architectural details, but my response was largely that there are other architectural alternatives that could be more ideal; especially in response to a comment that seems to dismiss the value of pricing at finer time intervals.<p>Not trying to nitpick anything; just curious what was meant by &quot;underpowered&quot;. Seems like there&#x27;s still a breadth of compute-intensive use cases that are more appropriate for lambda--e.g., cost is more sensitive than latency and I have too low a volume of requests for a dedicated EC2 instance to make economic sense. This has been where I&#x27;ve spent most of my career, but no doubt there are many use cases where this doesn&#x27;t hold.')
