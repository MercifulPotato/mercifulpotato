Learn how gems&#x2F;bundler works and you&#x27;re set.<p>Also, ruby can be a (in my experience) superior replacement for awk.<p>Brief example, -n is loop over current line as $_, -l is clean up line endings<p><pre><code>  cat .zsh_history | ruby -nle &#x27;BEGIN{$x=[]}; $x &lt;&lt; $_.encode(&quot;UTF-8&quot;, invalid: :replace, replace: &quot;&quot;); END{$x.sort_by{ _1.count(&quot;|&quot;) }}&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nI was trying to find some longer pipelines from my command history. encode is stripping out a bunch of invalid utf-8, otherwise it would have just been $x&lt;&lt;$_<p>or, pick a random line from stdin:<p><pre><code>  ls | ruby -e &#x27;puts ARGF.to_a.sample&#x27;</code></pre>')
