Natural immunity for SARS-COV-1 was observed even 10 years after infection in some trials. Immunity against other coronaviruses also lasts longer than 2-3 months and actually there is strong indication that natural T-Cell immunity might last people much much longer and be sufficient on its own like it is also with other coronaviruses.<p>The only thing which is estimated to disappear after 3-6 months are antibodies in your bloodstream.')
