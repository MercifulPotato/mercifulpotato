Americans are willing to compromise on [price] or [interior] or [performance] or [practicality], but not all four.<p>Americans who drop $40,000+ (in 2020 dollars) aren&#x27;t the kind of buyers who are willing to drive a vehicle that looks, feels, and performs like a sub $15,000 car, and is less practical than one.  You don&#x27;t need an SUV to be successful either, look at the Model 3, S, Prius, etc.<p>Americans are perfectly willing to buy economical cars... at an economical price.
