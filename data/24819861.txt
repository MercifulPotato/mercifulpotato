Bloated admin costing money? or competition costing money? The article attributes it to both.<p>So why shouldn&#x27;t the gov. workers get paid? Singapore does that (but they actually have a functional gov.).<p>But paying gov&#x2F;school&#x2F;college workers well has got to be a good thing! Incentivizing them&#x2F;others to strive to do a better job&#x2F;game whatever metric to get that job, which cannot be entirely corrupt.<p>There&#x27;s a nurse in there well.<p>California does not seem to be in trouble because of these people who are highly paid.<p>California is grasping to find a patsy to blame.')
