Item(by='buran77', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609947255, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25658201, text='No, my comments (direct response to OP&#x27;s &quot;why are we pretending what US is doing is different form what China is doing&quot;) can be summarized as &quot;pretending China and the US are different is just un&#x2F;mis&#x2F;disinformed or hypocritical&quot;. They are both superpowers and they both resort to <i>any</i> measures within their grasp to maintain or increase that power. Pretending otherwise is just euphemistically &quot;double standards&quot;.<p>The EU only appeared in the discussion as a reference or &quot;witness&quot;, just like the Chinese people are used as reference for what their leadership is doing. You turning the discussion towards some EU blame for whatever isn&#x27;t only a meritless distraction from the topic, it&#x27;s also akin to blaming the Chinese people for not overthrowing the CCP. They are 1.3bn people, surely they have &quot;massive leverage&quot;.<p>I reiterate, you have no interest in reading or understanding any of my comments. The extent to which you perverted and rewrote my words just to fit whatever narrative you&#x27;re more easily able to support really makes for low quality discussion. I have more than adequately made and supported my point and will politely withdraw.')
