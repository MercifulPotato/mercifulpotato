Also, if you&#x27;re only do those kinds of numbers a few weeks a year, you could have an electric car for 50 weeks of the year and then hire a diesel one for the longer stints?<p>That being said, it&#x27;ll only be a couple more generations of tech before we&#x27;re getting fast charge in the 15-20 minute ranges. By the time you&#x27;ve done a full-tank fill, used the toilets, picked up a few Rom bars in the shop and paid - you probably wont lose much time.<p>(I&#x27;m still a car lover, but change is coming, and it&#x27;d be hard to argue with it in a few more years).')
