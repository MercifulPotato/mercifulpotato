There&#x27;s lots of screenshots of the Grindr profile grid posted online. I&#x27;d be surprised if you could find one including a profile photo that looks much like this one.<p>But really the point isn&#x27;t that no gay man has ever posed for a photo like this. (I&#x27;m sure some straight men have too.) The point is that the photo is used to make a joke about how ridiculous Scott would look if he was gay. He couldn&#x27;t just have a normal dating profile photo.')
