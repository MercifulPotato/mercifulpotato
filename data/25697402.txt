They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!&quot;<p>&quot;To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.&quot;<p>To claim that the second set of Tweets incites violence more than the first is absurd. Yes, context matters, but it also matters for the Ayatollah tweets. When the leader of Iran advocates &quot;armed resistance&quot; to the state of Israel, we know exactly what that means.')
