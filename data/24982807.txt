The thumbnail for the Facebook or Twitter story. The saturated red and blue colors have an almost astrological meaning to people, it&#x27;s got nothing to do with information.<p>Maps people struggle with this, they&#x27;re always using maps to try to visualize a piece of data when almost always a short table would be better.<p>Data graphics people are themselves a subset of a family of wonks that spend 50% of their day rehashing the same tired stories, and the other 50% lamenting how innumerate people are.<p>Did you ever consider that maybe the reason the maps are stupid is because they&#x27;re stupid as a whole, not because there&#x27;s something wrong with the reader or the designer?')
