Which is generally going to be the benefits&#x2F;results rather than the features&#x2F;artifacts.<p>&gt; On the other hand, it&#x27;s very easy to talk about benefits that no one really cares about. Or to talk about them in such a way that they don&#x27;t see how it applies to them, or why it might be important or impactful in their lives.<p>Can&#x27;t disagree with that, but it seems to me that&#x27;s a more general point about precision in communication than the benefit&#x2F;feature dichotomy.<p>Note that &quot;a benefit no one cares about&quot; is almost by definition not a benefit. If you&#x27;re talking about an aspect of the product the person you&#x27;re talking to doesn&#x27;t find valuable, it&#x27;s not a benefit. But that doesn&#x27;t mean you should talk about features. It means you don&#x27;t understand where they find value.<p>&gt; With regards to funnels, you&#x27;re 100% correct of course. But they&#x27;re not always available, and many different groups of people with different needs, interests, and beliefs can (and do) end up on the same funnel path. You can keep breaking your funnel into every more refined steps, to be as specific as possible, but then you run into the issue of people giving up because you&#x27;ve asked too much of them before asking for the sale.<p>&gt; For example, the landing pages for those M1 Macs. What would you do to make sure you know more about your audience before telling them about the product? Are you going to put a series of questionnaires ahead of the content? The content there has to work for pretty much everybody.<p>Sure. In practice, some benefits will work better than others overall, or will account for most of the persuasive power of a given product. Once you&#x27;ve found that, optimizing for subsegments may or may not be the rational choice.<p>Note that a lot of that stuff done through marketing automation is invisible to a lot of people. Apple, to the best of my knowledge, doesn&#x27;t do a lot of it, but they could easily target their users based on all the information they collect on them over time without asking for information directly.')
