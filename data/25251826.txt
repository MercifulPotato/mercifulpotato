After the fast, my body fat was 10% and I didn&#x27;t like it, as I looked skinny.<p>If you want to stay at the low body fat, you can just reduce the food intake after the 2 week and not bulk up again. The fact is I did lose 15 kilos in two weeks and that is effective.<p>You could also use less extreme fast and make it gradual, but the mechanism of losing body fat became very systematic  to me.')
