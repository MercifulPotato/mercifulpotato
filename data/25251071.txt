My mind is blown whenever I hear people say they&#x27;re struggling to pay for things or life is too expensive. The main thing I&#x27;ve noticed is most of these people are going to bars&#x2F;izakaya several times a week, and it&#x27;s easy to spend $50+ for a small meal and some beers there. I know people in Tokyo making far less than Western wages but still living very comfortably.<p>But in-city rent in Japan doesn&#x27;t even approach a typical 500k population city in the US , unless you&#x27;re insisting on living in the middle of the most in demand parts of Shibuya or something.')
