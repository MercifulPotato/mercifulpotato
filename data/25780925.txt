The article is not even alleging that any of them committed insurrection, or even entered the Capitol.<p>&gt; While there’s no evidence yet that Fuentes entered the Capitol — in fact, he explicitly denies entering the building — he was present at the initial rally and seen outside the Capitol as the rioting began.<p>Nothing would make me happier than seeing Fuentes convicted and imprisoned, but no amount of hyperbole and false claims will make that happen.')
