However, 28 of them(17%), don&#x27;t use the app at all. The price is $9&#x2F;month. What are your numbers? Is that good&#x2F;bad&#x2F;normal?<p>Also i&#x27;m thinking if i should mail them or not. I think it would be nice thing to do but on the other hand i kinda don&#x27;t want to of course..<p>I could ask them why aren&#x27;t they using it so i would get some insight out of it but i have plenty of other feedback so that isn&#x27;t so necessary for me now. What would you do?')
