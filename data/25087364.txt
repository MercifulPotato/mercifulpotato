They are out of Minnesota and most people ignore that as a corporate center.  Most of what they do isn&#x27;t under the name Cargill.  They actually resemble an old conglomerate more than a focused company.  Heck, most employees don&#x27;t know what all they do, and you really don&#x27;t interact with that many other divisions.<p>Also, realistically and in comparison to other companies, you really have to stretch to call them public enemy one.  There is really no danger of Cargill impacting your life like one of the big tech companies.  There are other strong players in everyone of their markets.')
