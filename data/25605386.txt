My point isn&#x27;t it can&#x27;t be done at all my point is your &quot;just add this one line&quot; is a strawman detracting from the fact it is additional effort to add accessibility support to an overall project and this effort is a real world reason projects like this one don&#x27;t have accessible UI, not because the dev is a screw up.<p>&gt; The assumption that the developer is uninformed about accessibility is the kind assumption, not the mean one. The alternative implication, that they knew about accessibility but chose to use inaccessible markup instead, is a much worse reading of the situation.<p>My argument is it&#x27;s NOT unkind to only build what you need in a project you decide to share freely. It&#x27;s kind to share anything at all, regardless how incomplete it is. It may not even function at all for anyone, it comes with no guarantees other than you have the right to modify it as you please.<p>&gt; There&#x27;s a fundamental difference here between us then... I am completely unapologetic about the idea that most developers on the web should be thinking about accessibility, and that it is reasonable to mention accessibility on public projects submitted into public spaces.<p>I&#x27;d agree with the first part but with a slight twist on the reasoning. I think it&#x27;s fine to mention on something like this as long as it&#x27;s without trying to blame, shame, or demand something of the developer.<p>.<p>To review the original comment (since I think we&#x27;ve detracted quite far from it now):<p>&gt; The &quot;Create New Project&quot; dialog has serious accessibility problems when used with a screen reader. The buttons are clickable divs, not actual HTML buttons or even marked up with proper ARIA. I haven&#x27;t yet ventured any further into the app.\n&gt; \n&gt; Given that the app is a WebAssembly development environment, my first guess was that it was built in WebAssembly itself, with a custom UI framework. But in fact, it&#x27;s plain React, using its own home-grown components for basic things like buttons.<p>The first paragraph is spot on with what you&#x27;re talking about and I think perfectly acceptable and even helpful to those that might not know about ARIA or how to approach the problem. Albeit the second paragraph ideally could have used some helpful examples on how to make it so rather than lamenting the developer did it the way they did I think it&#x27;s alright, I never really commented on it.<p>&gt; It breaks my heart that when this project was started in 2017, some 20 years after web accessibility advocacy had started in earnest, the developer was still uninformed enough about accessibility that they would create a custom button component with no ARIA support. I suppose we could also blame the web platform for making it hard enough to customize the look of a standard button that the developer would reach for the div tag. What do we do about this?<p>Is when the question is posed that I responded about. This is what goes from &quot;educating and promoting&quot; to &quot;shaming for not being as moral as I&#x27;d like&quot;, literally looking to place moral blame on free and open code being shared for not being good enough for the author and asking what we do about this. When I responded:<p>&gt; Why assume ignorance&#x2F;difficulty when the reality is not everyone is going to focus on adding&#x2F;maintaining accessibility when they haven&#x27;t even built out their beta MIT licensed side project? It&#x27;d certainly be nice if everything just automagically worked about accessible UI but we&#x27;re not there yet (getting anything to automagically work in UI is a pain still).\n&gt; \n&gt; As far as what we can do about it I suppose outside of somehow translating thoughts into perfect UI automatically we can try to add coverage to these projects as we can prioritize it. After all that&#x27;s why they are being built in the open with an open license, so others can help add functionality.<p>None of my comment was saying we shouldn&#x27;t promote accessibility or mention accessibility issues. It did call out that the initial question ignored the most tangible problem - implementing accessibility is NOT done for free (regardless how much you want to convince me it&#x27;s just one line it&#x27;s still not free anyways) and that&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t make it on the top of the todo list for an incomplete open source project.<p>.<p>&gt; and that it is reasonable to mention accessibility on public projects submitted into public spaces.<p>Reasonable to mention absolutely, and probably helpful to all. As mentioned that&#x27;s not all this thread has been about though.<p>&gt; I want to encourage people to think that very basic accessibility accommodations are the standard normal thing that developers should think about. In my mind, this is the kinder option, because the alternative is stricter laws and more restrictive technology and frameworks that make it harder to do creative things.<p>I definitely agree on the encouragement side of things, even for projects like this. I&#x27;m even in support of stricter accessibility laws for commercial and government software. I&#x27;m just not in support, kind methods or not, of either blaming, shaming, or restricting people from sharing free and open code or making demands they do certain things when they write it on their own accord. If you see something about an free open source project you don&#x27;t think was done the best way it&#x27;s great to try to talk about how it could be done better, it&#x27;s even greater if you can help make it the way you think it should be. If you think the developer was in the wrong or you need to talk about blame or they should be shamed for it then yeah, I think that&#x27;s our fundamental disagreement. I see it as something they haven&#x27;t been able to focus on not something that makes them a bad developer because they didn&#x27;t do their free work well enough for my moral standard. Just like I said, I don&#x27;t expect developers to have a multi-lingual UI either but it&#x27;d be great if someone wanted to come by a project and help make it happen so more people can use it.<p>.<p>Anyways I think unless you have a particular question or say I was particularly far off on understanding something here I&#x27;ve said about as much as I can say about it and don&#x27;t intend to drag it out more for minor details. I do appreciate your time and thoughts on this, sincerely, and will definitely read any message you respond with even if I don&#x27;t respond. Cheers and happy new year')
