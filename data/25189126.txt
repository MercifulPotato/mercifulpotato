It&#x27;s access vs. quality vs. cost.<p>Canada&#x27;s HAQ index in 2015 was 87.6 vs. 81.3 for the US. However, Canada spent about $27B US on R&amp;D vs. $495B for the US. On a per capita basis, the US outspends most the world on medical R&amp;D. That drives the US total healthcare costs up while helping to drive down the healthcare quality costs elsewhere. To a certain extent, the US subsidizes the healthcare costs through much of the world, effectively allowing them to optimize for a 2 parameter model while the U.S. must still deal with a 3 parameter model.')
