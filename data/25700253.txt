My point is that it’s nonsense to suggest that existing languages are “just fine.”<p>But many security bugs in C or C++ come down to sloppy types, sloppy pointers, or sloppy concurrency, all of which are almost impossible to do in Haskell. Haskell is not a replacement for C or C++ but its ideas are (and should be) influencing systems programmers.<p>I don’t actually like Haskell. But there is a reason why major organizations are considering Rust over C and C++: those languages are simply not sufficient for writing secure and robust software in the 21st century, and Rust has taken many of the “best parts” of Haskell to improve systems programming.')
