As some random internet person to another, there&#x27;s not much I can do (that I haven&#x27;t already done on my website) to try to convince you that I&#x27;ll do my best to avoid grotty&#x2F;slimy UX patterns: I&#x27;ll make sure there&#x27;s a warning email sent a couple days before any charges are applied, and easy cancellation via the website. The fact that much of the functionality remains when subscriptions lapse mean you only need to pay when you feel like you&#x27;d glean value.<p>&gt; pinky promises of continued access to your own media<p>Well, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s self-hosted. There&#x27;s no trust you need to apply to the app: you can even use PhotoStructure with a read-only bind-mount to your assets directory to make sure it isn&#x27;t doing anything nefarious.<p>No pinkies needed.')
