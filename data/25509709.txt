If he knew it was flashable he would&#x27;ve outright said it to answer the question. But he did not.<p>&gt; Concerning the RAM, I do not see any problem with that, since there is no proprietary code running after the booting. As FSF says, it can simply be considered as a part of &quot;hardware&quot; which is necessary for the start of the system.<p>Incorrect. The code is loaded in the DDR PHY. It then runs continuously. It is required for normal operation. This is because LPDDR requires continuous runtime re-training at its higher performance modes. What only runs on boot is the (dumb as hell) code they wrote to run on the Cortex-M4 as a workaround, because the FSF&#x27;s ridiculous requirements forbid you not just from <i>running</i> proprietary code on the main CPU, but from <i>touching</i> proprietary code on the main CPU.<p>So Purism built code that runs on cpu A to run code they built that runs on cpu B to load a blob from external read-only memory C into cpu D, just so they could claim cpu A never got digital cooties from touching the blob.<p>Please appreciate the stupidity of this entire ordeal.<p>cpu B code: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;source.puri.sm&#x2F;Librem5&#x2F;Cortex_M4&#x2F;-&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;ddr_loader.c" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;source.puri.sm&#x2F;Librem5&#x2F;Cortex_M4&#x2F;-&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;ddr_l...</a><p>&gt; read only<p>Means it can&#x27;t be modified without the user knowing, and it also can&#x27;t be modified with the user knowing.<p>Unless the Librem 5 literally has a DIP switch for &quot;enable flashing RAM code&quot;, read only means read only, period. It means the write protect pin is tied to protected, or a set-only protect bit in the SPI flash config was flipped.')
