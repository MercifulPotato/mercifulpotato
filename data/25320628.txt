But a lot of PM requests aren&#x27;t even close to fiddling. If your product is a streaming video service, adding DVR capabilities is something a PM might request. No amount of non-technical fiddling will enable that functionality. But a well-designed architecture with isolated functional components will make the work of adding such a feature far less painful than a poorly designed one would.')
