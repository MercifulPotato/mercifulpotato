Otherwise, the range of heights would be much narrower, and humans would probably be much taller (we&#x27;re barely taller than gorillas), with much less variation between cultures. I&#x27;d say either it&#x27;s unlikely that there was that much genetic pressure on height, <i>or</i> that most of evolution height wasn&#x27;t genetic (but limiting factor was something else, e.g. food - so only well-fed people could grow as tall as their genetic potential).')
