Speed up the animations across the board. There&#x27;s no way to disable it, and I have to sit there and wait continuously for content to fade in as I scroll. This applies to your abstract demo animation too. It&#x27;s slow.<p>&quot;Featured on ProductHunt&quot; and &quot;Used by these teams!&quot; both don&#x27;t convey what you think they do to me: what I see is it&#x27;s used by teams I&#x27;ve never heard of and is featured on a site that I no longer give much credibility to. Those bits are above the fold and add to my annoyance that I have to scroll further down to understand your value proposition.<p>I may not be your target demographic. I loathe experimenting with new, unproven products, especially with something as important as task &#x2F; project management, and I&#x27;m very tired of CRUD start-ups competing solely on UX with buzzwords.<p>If I am your demographic, give A&#x2F;Bing my suggestions a shot:<p>- Reduce drastically (or remove the animations) the delay in your animations<p>- Move your signaling to below the fold into its own section further down the page (both featured on Product Hunt and who&#x27;s using you)<p>- Quickly give me an idea of what the tool does and how it&#x27;s different above the fold both in text and via a demo')
