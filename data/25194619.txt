You wrote a fine article. You should be proud of it. I was wrong about which article should have replaced the blogspam link that originally graced HN, and your sibling comment to this one (&quot;Hi there, ...&quot;) did a great job of explaining why with patience and politeness. The mods clearly agreed and made the right call.<p>This comment I&#x27;m replying to, though... you don&#x27;t need to do this. If it had been the only reply you posted, I would have come away from our exchange with a very different opinion of you, and that would&#x27;ve been a bit unfair. Just something to think about for the future.')
