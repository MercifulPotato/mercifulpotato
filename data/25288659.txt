Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=[25288789], score=None, time=1607002615, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25288509, text='&gt; GitHub apparently follows this process exactly--without any deviation. GitHub does zero investigation to determine who is in the right--even in a case as obvious as this. Mr-Steal-Your-Script&#x27;s user name alone should be enough to let GitHub know who owns the code. During this entire process, GitHub communicated with me entirely by computer-generated responses. I never had an opportunity to explain the situation to an actual human being. So, if I wish to pursue this matter further, it seems that I have no choice but to hire a lawyer.<p>So GitHub follows the legal process set out for hosting services? Umm, yeah. No shit. They&#x27;re doing exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to.<p>&gt; I do not even have the option of suing Mr-Steal-Your-Script to pay my lawyer&#x27;s fees, because he is anonymous. As blatant as his theft was, I have to assume that he has covered his tracks well enough to remain anonymous.<p>GitHub should have provided you with his counter-notice including contact information. If they&#x27;ve accepted a clearly invalid counter-notice then you can sue them.<p>Otherwise, yeah, this guy has posted a copy of your code, and the only way to take it down is to sue him. That&#x27;s how copyright infringement usually works - it&#x27;d be the same if he were hosting it in ISP-provided webspace, or his own personal site, or printed it out on a physical billboard he owns. I don&#x27;t know why you see this as being about &quot;the Corporate Internet&quot; at all.')
