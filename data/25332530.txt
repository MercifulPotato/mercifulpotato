Item(by='frfl', descendants=None, kids=[25336678], score=None, time=1607352254, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25330538, text='&gt; Writing Mediocre Architecture Documents<p>Would you be willing to share this slide deck?<p>My question in regard to this is how do you write an architectural doc if you&#x27;re exploring the problem space? If it takes 5h to explore, experiment and find the solution. And it takes 0.5h to write the doc. And 0.5h to make the change after you know the solution and have reverted the experimental&#x2F;exploratory changes?<p>At that point is the doc necessary as a precursor to the change. By that I mean, do you send it out for feedback first and wait OR do you send it out&#x2F;add that as a comment on you PR and push up the final change?<p>Additionally how do you know you&#x27;re going to get feedback at all from sending out the doc? In my experience people are always busy with their own work and sending them a big chunk of text...well I wouldn&#x27;t expect a response quickly compared to a short 1-2 line question')
