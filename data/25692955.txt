He&#x27;s POTUS after-all. People saying Twitter should just shut him down because he incites, are, in my view, correct. Mentally however, I could never quite square the argument; I kept returning to `he&#x27;s POTUS`. Social networks deserve much criticism, but those <i>only</i> criticizing social networks overlook the fact that there is a legislative body that has always been empowered to remove him, whose duty in fact is to be a check on him. The primary blame for him retaining his power must primarily lay at their feet, specifically those of the President&#x27;s party. They thought they could ride the bull but they have finally been thrown off of it. Now they are seeking to distance themselves from the bull. I am sorry, but they should not be able to. Had they been forthright with their supporters and stuck to their views of Trump before he was president, we might have avoided all of this.<p>In a better world, Congress would have acted and those who were trying to cynically benefit from Trump should have had the fortitude to call him out immediately and removed him.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree that Twitter should have acted sooner. As others have pointed out, their timing is much too late. They acted after Trump has been legislatively defanged. Still, Trump is dangerous, we&#x27;re just fortunate he&#x27;s an incompetent buffoon who is disinterest in the actual minutiae of the job. He should resign immediately. He won&#x27;t. He should be removed by his cabinet or Congress as soon as possible.')
