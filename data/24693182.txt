But that also means you can&#x27;t just assume autopilot will help you - it could very well be that having autopilot will end up making people to fall asleep at the wheel more often, and therefore increase the chance of accidents or severity of the accidents. We know for a fact that it does involve some trade off (see those people misusing autopilot and getting into accidents), and we simply don&#x27;t know autopilot provides better safety overall.<p>There has been enough indirect evidence to suggest advanced driver assist without a significant driver monitoring is dangerous (Google&#x27;s report of their employees doing other things, the fatal accident of Uber&#x27;s self-driving vehicle, various fatal and non-fatal accidents of Tesla autopilot due to misuse), but there&#x27;s been no systematic study and we don&#x27;t have enough public data to suggest it&#x27;s one way or another.')
