I mean, the most common use case for a cryptocurrency like Monero is to dodge government taxes and make illegal transactions.<p>God bless the developers and cryptographers who are continuing on the good fight. And good luck to them too, because as their technology gains influence and threatens to usurp todays power, they will face resistance. Maybe the original authors of the protocols saw this coming, which is why they used fake identities like Satoshi Nakamoto, or Nicolas van Saberhagen.<p>I&#x27;m less worried about it becoming illegal (what are you going to do, ban math?), and more worried about the networks themselves getting compromised.')
