There are many, many more details about data structure layout that vary between architectures (and even compilers of the same architecture, especially once you delve outside of C).<p>VST2 is probably doable - what I use to run Windows VST2s on Linux is something similar with an out of process wrapper - but I can see VST3 with its C++ API being a major, major pain in the ass. And even then there are downsides. Running plug-ins out of process has significant context switching overhead. It&#x27;s fine for one or two or half a dozen, but compare running 50 plug-ins in process and out of process and you&#x27;ll notice a massive performance difference. You can fight that with larger buffer sizes, but that adds latency.')
