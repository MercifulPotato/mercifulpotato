You aren&#x27;t asking questions, citing sources, or even making good new points. Beyond that, you&#x27;re really uninformed.<p>Here&#x27;s an example where you could have done even a little token searching; the title of this article is &quot;Workers on Corporate Boards? Germanyâ€™s Had Them for Decades&quot; [1].<p>Another example is when you write:<p>&gt; Addressing symptoms not causes. Reduce tax avoidance by simplifying the tax code. It&#x27;s that simple.<p>It truly is not that simple. There&#x27;s a reason tax codes are complicated and broadly speaking, it&#x27;s that you have to choose winners and losers to simplify them and that&#x27;s politically and policy-wise very, very difficult.<p>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d like to dispute that, but the way you&#x27;ll dispute it is with normative, opaque statements like &quot;it&#x27;s that simple&quot; or &quot;terrible idea&quot; which will take you 8 minutes. The way I&#x27;ll engage is by searching the internet and citing a post, and asking good questions to keep the conversation going. That will take an hour.<p>I&#x27;m not gonna do that, and I think this breakdown makes it clear why. I think you should keep in mind what you&#x27;re asking of people you&#x27;re having a discussion with, either implicitly or explicitly, and how your responses indicate what you&#x27;re expecting to get out of a discussion. From where I sit, you&#x27;re not looking to learn anything or to inform me of something, you&#x27;re looking to win an argument. Sometimes that&#x27;s productive but it&#x27;s surprisingly rare, and besides that, I&#x27;m not interested. I haven&#x27;t learned anything from you over the 3-4 threads you&#x27;ve chased me down on, but I do feel a little worse about humanity, and I get enough of that already.<p>And overall, I&#x27;d urge you to take a moment to consider the damage you do by logging onto public forums and spreading your ill-informed, normative opinions around. It greatly reduces the signal to noise ratio, and because it takes a lot of time to respond to things like this, it effectively DoS&#x27;s productive conversations. I love a good internet argument as much as the next mega-arrogant software engineer but, we need to keep in mind the effect that has.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;06&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;warren-workers-boards.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;06&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;warren-workers-bo...</a>')
