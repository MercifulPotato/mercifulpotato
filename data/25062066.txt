It was nice - quad core, 2GB memory. But honestly, only for some workloads.<p>In my experience memory is a much bigger bottleneck than CPU, net IO or disk iops.<p>At the moment my favorite home lab cluster is a bunch of old laptops. They&#x27;re quad cores too but I&#x27;ve dropped 16 GB of memory in each. It&#x27;s doing a lot better. Right now the cluster is using 21GB of memory.<p>I&#x27;m able to run everything I&#x27;ve wanted as well as the occasional experiment to try something out.<p>If I could leave you with something - get more memory than you think you will need. That&#x27;s been my experience anyway.')
