Which might be correct, industrial scale solar PV energy is cheap and will get a lot cheaper over the next decade.<p>But of course electric cars benefit from cheap electricity even more than hydrogen cars do.<p>&gt;  In fact, on a cost per range basis, the latest Mirai is already cheaper than competing battery electric cars.<p>Sure, if you use grey hydrogen created from natural gas rather than green hydrogen created from water and electricity.   Grey hydrogen is far from carbon-free.<p>&gt;  It&#x27;s batteries that will have trouble keeping up on cost<p>That&#x27;s a strong claim, given that battery prices have historically dropped 80% per decade and show no signs of slowing down.<p>&gt;  These companies might too be dead within a decade or so.<p>The lack of hydrogen filling stations is the biggest roadblock for this among many big roadblocks.')
