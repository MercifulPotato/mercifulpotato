I doubt people would be having as much &quot;lockdown fatigue&quot; since they would literally see the bodies piling up in their communities. Instead you have a disease that only mildly affects the majority, putting only small minorities in real danger, which doesn&#x27;t jive with the &quot;sky is falling&quot; stories the media&#x2F;government peddles.<p>I don&#x27;t know about you, but living in NYC, we did &quot;literally see the bodies piling up&quot; in March and April.<p>While the number of deaths was small compared to the overall population of NYC, the fact that morgues were so overwhelmed that refrigerated trucks were required to hold the excess corpses told me that this was a dangerous disease and needed to be taken seriously.<p>Out of curiosity, if 200,000+ deaths in the US doesn&#x27;t constitute something serious and worthy of attention and efforts to mitigate&#x2F;minimize the impact of COVID-19, how many deaths would make you change your mind?  1,000,000?  5,000,000?')
