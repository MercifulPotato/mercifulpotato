I&#x27;ve seen stats claiming it doubles every 5 years.<p>The worst part about this is that the world doesn&#x27;t need so many developers. It also doesn&#x27;t need so many marketers and data scientists either.\nThe jobs are being created artificially as part of the Federal Reserve Bank&#x27;s job creation mandate and financed by fiat money printing.<p>The economy of the past decade is a complete farce. When will people wake up and realize what&#x27;s going on?\nSoon it will take 100 developers to do the same work which used to only require 1 developer and the outcome will be worse.<p>I think the strategy is to create a large population of developers who are incapable of creating real value outside of their extremely narrow niche...\nThus making them (and the society that they are an increasingly large part of) totally dependent on corporations and allowing corporations to control and shape our politics and society and suppress our free speech.<p>I&#x27;m a developer so it&#x27;s not in my interest to say this. I wish it were not the case. Nowadays people only get into this industry for money. Nobody cares about coding.')
