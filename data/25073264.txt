Item(by='zepto', descendants=None, kids=[25073668], score=None, time=1605206842, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25072731, text='It’s very quite simple - Mgchev is careful to validate <i>only</i> Jeff’s <i>feelings</i>, and absolutely nothing else about what he says.<p>Indeed he goes on to make this clear: “The only thing I&#x27;m saying is that it is not correct to generalize”<p>This invalidates everything about Jeff’s piece except for his <i>feelings</i>, since <i>the entire piece is an argument that there is a systematic problem with the team</i> that <i>other people have experienced too</i>.  There are tweets and quotes to support this.<p>Jeff <i>does</i> generalize, and he <i>does</i> reference other people who had similar experiences. Jeff’s entire reason for writing the piece is to generalize.  He doesn’t say ‘I’m sure this is just me’.  He argues quite the opposite.<p>If it is ‘not correct to generalize’ - as Mgechev says, then Jeff must be wrong about there being a problem with the team, therefore Mgechev does not believe Jeff.<p>You’ll notice that Mgechev repeats this ‘not correct to generalize’ here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25072705" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25072705</a><p>Mgechev also says they “can&#x27;t relate to his experience”.  They also make no reference to (or validate) any of the other people who apparently had similar experiences or views of the team.<p>It’s pretty reasonable to conclude that Mgechev doesn’t think there is a problem with the team and wants to convey that to us.')
