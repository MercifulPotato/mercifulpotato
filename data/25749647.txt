This provides for a high degree of epressiveness and flexibility which is hard to achieve with database accounting tools that are typically data-oriented.<p>The basic instructions are open account, close account, and update account (transaction). In addition, a lot of PTA tools support some form of higher-order directives: directives that generate other directives.<p>For example, the availability of prices might trigger the insertion of valuation transactions based on the change of value for a balance position, when processing the balance.<p>Or declarative accrual transactions for a given date might insert &quot;virtual&quot; transactions at specific other dates.<p>The PTA &#x2F; language-centric view allows to reason about those very easily, as abstractions which result in AST rewrites.')
