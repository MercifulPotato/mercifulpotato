How much more accountable do you want? Every single voter in America had the opportunity to express their opinion and together they chose to keep him in office.<p>Corporations absolutely are held to account. The US is holding hearings on the tech giants at the moment. Apple is in court over the App Store. Microsoft got smacked down over anti-trust. Banks and google have been fined billions of dollars.<p>Theres a reasonable case that these sanctions were not sufficient, but that&#x27;s just an opinion. Other people&#x27;s opinions differ.
