We used CodeWarrior Pro for my Pascal class at a local community college that I took during high school, because my high school was so small, I literally ran out of classes to take by senior year, so I had to take a programming course at a CC that was 10 miles away. Had to get a waiver to leave school before noon to go to the class because state policy was that students can&#x27;t be released from school before noon, and because all my classes (all 3 of them) were over by 11:30.')
