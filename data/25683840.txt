The limits on money spend was also a problem, I remember getting a new HVAC system in the house and having to split payment over two different days. Rather embarrassing for me to the installer voicing concerns, annoying that I can&#x27;t spend my own money when I obviously have it. Finally lack of paper checks you wouldn&#x27;t think would be a problem these days but a couple times of year it still came up and I was forced to use another bank and transfer funds.<p>It was an interesting experiment but after I moved to USAA (or any other real bank) in comparison all my troubles just disappeared.')
