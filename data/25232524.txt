The Zen3 desktop counterparts are also still on 7nm. There&#x27;s a good chance it&#x27;ll be 2022 before we see AMD chips on 5nm unfortunately, almost certainly for mobile chips.<p>Having said that, the 5800U might not be too far off the M1 in raw performance even on the older process. AMD&#x27;s improvements on the same node for Zen3 are pretty good!')
