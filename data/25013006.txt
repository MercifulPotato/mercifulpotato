The subtext to this piece is that this is really about coping with the fact that grad students and postdocs in the US rarely get much parental leave. My institution offers two paid weeks off following childbirth. There’s FMLA but few grad student and postdocs can afford to take unpaid leave. Postdoc parents get very little support and everybody who does it has to find their own way to manage. On top of that is the fact that gaps in your training, if you manage to get leave, hurt your chances of getting a job because it is so uncommon to actually get time off.<p>I chose to do this because I did not find it to be miserable, although it definitely wouldn’t work for everybody.<p>In my field (biology), it is typical to postdoc for 3-6 years so I’m actually on the early side. That postdocs take so long is definitely something that needs to be addressed, though.')
