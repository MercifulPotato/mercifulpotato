This pseudo-scientific nonsense has no place on HN.<p>One of the key design features of 5G is to drop transmit power (instead having more sites, with lower range per site).<p>Because signal strength drops off with the square of distance to the tower (<i>technically</i> the cube, but because they transmit a flat beam the relevant part of the graph is square), this results in dramatically less transmit radiation vs 4G.<p>However, <i>all of this</i> is moot, because the radio frequency used isn&#x27;t a frequency that could ionize anything even if the transmit power weren&#x27;t negligible.')
