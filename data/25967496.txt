In my early days (pre-Google) my peers would only answer a question if they agreed completely with what I was doing and how. I would have to explain what I was working on from the beginning and every design decision and who had approved them and after all that if they didn’t like the project I was working on or thought it should be done a different way then silence. Books could be helpful but they generally lagged the state of the art by 3-5 years at that time. Between the two it made it very difficult to do anything cutting edge, so I made it my goal to learn as much as possible so that I would never again be limited in what I could do by others. Through the decades this has paid off immensely. Today I do “cheat” and look at Stack Overflow and Google pretty frequently, but if the internet goes out or I’m asked to give an impromptu explanation or overview of something in a meeting, I can carry on and speak with authority.')
