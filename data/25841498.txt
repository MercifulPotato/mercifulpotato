I was lucky because I had four other room mates to keep me company but even with that it was tough. I also wasn&#x27;t really enjoying what I was working on at my previous company (adtech) and needed a change.<p>I ended up moving to Taiwan a few weeks ago. Zero COVID here, and was surprisingly easy to immigrate (coming from someone who was dealing with the US immigration system as a Canadian). Working at a fun startup back on the consumer product side instead. Went to a bar for the first time in a year last week and was able to just sit in a coffee shop with 10 other people this morning. I&#x27;m still teaching myself to read&#x2F;speak Chinese but it&#x27;s totally worth it.<p>Anyone with experience with TypeScript&#x2F;React interested in tagging along to Taiwan, send me an email (my email is in my hacker news profile). I&#x27;m actively hiring engineers now. We&#x27;re a distributed team across many different countries but a few of us hang out in Taipei together at a coworking space. It&#x27;s the best of both worlds, I&#x27;m able to WFH when I feel like it but still go to a public space to be around people')
