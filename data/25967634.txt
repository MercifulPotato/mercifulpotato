I was not able to write code on a blank piece of paper&#x2F;plastic. It turns out I have delegated part of the coding activities to tools like IDE and Google.<p>I made a conscious decision to fix this.<p>I have switched from Java to Go, effectively lowering the level of abstraction. Then from IDE to Vim, getting rid of autocomplete. \nI turned off syntax highlighting, allowing my brain to parse and interpret code more effectively. Last but not least was starting to use embedded documentation `go doc {{ package }}` via terminal and reading language sources to learn how internals work.<p>It was hard at the beginning, and my productivity dropped for some time. Later, when new neural connections were created in my brain, things started to improve.<p>Some of the benefits that I enjoy now are a better understanding of the code, improved knowledge of language libraries and interfaces.<p>I have tested this approach by coding in planes and trains without access to the Internet, and it works well.<p>Did it fix my problem with whiteboards? I do not know, but I am happy with the new skills.')
