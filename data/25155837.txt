The question of whether it&#x27;s an achievable or practical goal to pursue needs to be answered before that is made the objective, and the lifting of lockdown restrictions is made conditioned on the goal being reached.<p>Anyone advocating that as the goal for society needs to present a plan that has a high chance of succeeding without an unreasonable burden being placed on society. I think maybe the development and mass-deployment of rapid tests for the virus could achieve that, but ironically we don&#x27;t see much emphasis on this strategy by lockdown advocates. It&#x27;s almost as if the opposition to the lockdown is all the proof needed to convince some of its advocates that it&#x27;s the right strategy.<p>On a side note, we now we see that the lockdown advocates have simply switched their rationale for the lockdown, from &quot;flatten the curve&quot;, to &quot;eliminate the virus from the population&quot;, once the curve was flattened.
