They need to show Alphabet that they can deploy self driving at scale. Unfortunately, they only solved the problem when the car is supervised by a remote driver. Which is more expensive than hiring a human to drive a stock car. So they keep saying they&#x27;re expanding the service without actually deploying at scale in the hope of postponing the inevitable moment at which Alphabet&#x27;s board will realize that it&#x27;s been taken for a ride.')
