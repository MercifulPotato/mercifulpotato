The value at stake can potentially grow into hundreds of billions, much more than any PoW chain can hope to accumulate in mining revenues in its entire existence.<p>Last but not least, there&#x27;s no way to delete PoW attacker&#x27;s gpus, but hostile stake is always going to be slashed. Asic pow chain can be forked - once - to a gpu pow, but that&#x27;s it, and after that there&#x27;s no recourse to sustained attacks. This property virtually guarantees that no attack against PoS with slashing is ever going to happen.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vitalik.ca&#x2F;general&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;06&#x2F;pos2020.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vitalik.ca&#x2F;general&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;06&#x2F;pos2020.html</a>')
