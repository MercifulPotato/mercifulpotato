Other EVs technically could use the Supercharger network, though many of them wouldn&#x27;t be able to charge at the SC&#x27;s maximum rate. Tesla has decided to keep it exclusive for now.<p>There are actually other charging networks that have more powerful chargers than Tesla; for example, while the V3 SCs max out at 250 kW, Electrify America&#x27;s most powerful chargers max out at 350 kW.')
