The first is that the seroprevalence data is based on blood donors, which is not a random sample. It looks like they tried to control for that in the cited study, but I don&#x27;t see an exact breakdown.<p>Secondly, Manaus is apparently a hospital the serves a pretty vast rural area, so the hospitalizations may be catching a lot of people that would have fallen outside of the immediate area covered by the seroprevalence survey.')
