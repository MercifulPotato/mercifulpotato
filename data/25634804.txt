Just because they could perhaps get a better salary, doesn&#x27;t mean they are forced to go for it. I suspect such cases are also rarer than one might think. I would expect most people to occasionally check their market value.<p>&quot;greed&quot; is just a negative way to frame it. Ultimately, striving for optimal outcomes is what stabilizes systems and makes them healthier and more efficient. Competition is the only known way to ensure fair prices. Every other approach can and will be gamed (corruption), but you can not fake prices.<p>It&#x27;s also all nice to talk about being social, but I think many employees are less happy in reality when they find they have to compensate for their unproductive colleagues and even get less pay. That gets people riled up quickly in the real world.')
