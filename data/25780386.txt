Your body is still absorbing a shitload of energy.  It&#x27;s like being hit with a baseball bat.  You have to be a large, strong person to maintain physical capabilities after being hit.<p>Also body armor is extremely fickle; it must be worn and fitted correctly.  It is akin to a well-tailored Italian suit.  If you gain a few pounds, it won&#x27;t fit right.  Bad fit = bad protection.  Also, they don&#x27;t protect the lower abdomen and groin areas -- which is a serious risk when a shooter is aiming for center mass, bullets fall as they travel.')
