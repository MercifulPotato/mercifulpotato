Compared to e.g. wxPython (Phoenix), which is built using PyQt&#x27;s tooling, the latter is full of jank, like whether something is a property seems to be random (SetIcon(icon) -&gt; property, SetIcons(iconbundle) -&gt; not a property, just one funny example). Some things ARE properties, but they&#x27;re not writeable, even if there actually is a SetXXX method. Some things convert types automatically, some don&#x27;t. In a bunch of cases there is weirdness, like what you return from a OnGetAttr needs to be protected from Python GC, otherwise it is silently (!?) ignored. Add the jank of wxWidgets itself, and PyQt&#x2F;PySide look even better.')
