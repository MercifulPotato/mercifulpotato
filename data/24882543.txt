The simple reason? There isn&#x27;t a mass exodus of Uighurs as we&#x27;ve seen in previous history of mass genocides (Jews during ww2, Khmer Rouge and recently the Rohingya). Yes, there are small pockets of them here and there that claim torture and abuse, but most of them either keep on changing their stories or that they are funded by the US government, so I don&#x27;t see a difference in this story here.<p>Let&#x27;s also not forget that Xinjiang shares a land border with Afghanistan, where the US has bombed Uighur terrorists. Would you guys suggest bombing Uighurs being the better solution here?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;u-s-targets-chinese-uighur-militants-well-taliban-fighters-afghanistan-n845876" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;u-s-targets-chinese-uighu...</a>')
