I&#x27;ve heard the use of Lithium as a tritium breeder (which is important, assuming we&#x27;re committed to duterium-tritium fusion), but never as a liquid.  it makes sense though because in that case you don&#x27;t have to completely disassemble the tokamak and replace the neutron blanket every few years(?).
