I didn&#x27;t have a sip of acohol for 6+ years. I will now occasionally have a beer, maybe 6 or so drinks per year?<p>- 9 month leave of absence from school and work, moving back in with my very, very loving and kind parents.<p>- Being showered with love and affection daily for years by close friends and family.<p>--------------------------<p>Things that probably helped:<p>- Talk therapy 3x a week for about a year, and weekly for about a year after that.<p>- A heroic dose of psylocibin, about 5 years into my recovery.<p>- Extreme amounts of exercise (real boxing)<p>--------------------------<p>Things that were also included in treatment that probably didn&#x27;t help but who knows:<p>- I was on some SSRI (forget which) for about a year.<p>- Three weeks of an <i>involuntary</i> stay at a run-down mental health clinic. This mostly had a positive impact on my understanding of politics and liberty, less so on curing depression IMHO.')
