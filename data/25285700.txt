Item(by='visarga', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606973055, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25276722, text='&gt; there will be a smaller subset of people able to pay for renovations by 2030 because their jobs will have been automated<p>That&#x27;s assuming new jobs are not going to replace the old ones. Human society has a tendency to use up all the available capacity by scaling up its goals. Do you think we&#x27;ll stop inflating our expectations?<p>Even if our expectations don&#x27;t drive up demand for new jobs, the government can. The transition to full automation, not to mention the global warming crisis, are hard work and require lots of jobs.<p>The premise of the article supports this idea - the decline in jobs happens mostly in companies that avoid automation because they lose out on quality, price or are less innovative.<p>In the extreme case that companies automate almost all jobs, then we&#x27;re left with billions of people with no ability to earn an income. But they have lots of free time and unfulfilled needs. So they will use that sweet automation to solve most of their needs by working for themselves and being less reliant on external help.<p>There&#x27;s always work to do when there are people, especially when they are forced to be self reliant. Of course I don&#x27;t wish self reliance to look like North Korea, hopefully we can do this in a humane way.')
