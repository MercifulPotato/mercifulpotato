Arguments like yours are intended to deliberately question numbers that have always been computed like this.  Not all journalists are formally credentialed, in fact most of the best footage of the summer protests was captured by amateur press with their phones.<p>The lines aren&#x27;t ambiguous: if you call yourself a journalist, don&#x27;t take part in a protest, and make a reasonable attempt to label yourself as press, then you are press.<p>And that&#x27;s a good thing for all of us.  Note that lots of the footage of vandalism that made the rounds in right wing circles was <i>also</i> captured by amateurs (c.f. Andy Ngo, who while a very polarizing figure did a lot of highly consumed press work with nothing but a phone and a twitter account).')
