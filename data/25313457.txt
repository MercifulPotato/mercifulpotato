Jealous partners, stalkers and the likes could install this tool on an unknowing victim’s phone with relative ease.</i><p>...<p>This hit home: (The absolutely otherwise fantastic) NextDNS (and anything that&#x27;s similar to it) comes pretty close to a spying app, too (300,000 DNS requests per month conveniently stored for a long time, for free). I know a handful people who I introduced NextDNS to as a privacy enhancing service ended up using it to encroach upon privacy by configuring it on unsuspecting user&#x27;s Android and iPhones (doesn&#x27;t even require <i>jailbreak</i> or <i>root</i> and runs forever in the &quot;background&quot;).')
