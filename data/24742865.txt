The reason for it&#x27;s existence is I was tired of opening Spotify to search a link to a song I&#x27;m trying to show someone, since nobody I know uses YouTube Music, and I really don&#x27;t want to use Spotify.<p>Right now it only supports converting Youtube Music links to Spotify, as that is my use case, but the framework is there for other streaming platforms that expose APIs. I made it because I&#x27;m envisioning a tool built on top of it that can port playlists between services, perhaps even in real time - so that collaborative playlists across platforms becomes possible.<p>The biggest challenge I&#x27;m facing right now is the fact that YouTube Music does not have any public API at all as far as I can tell, limiting me to the YouTube Data API, which is not ideal. Spotify seems to have a lovely API though!<p>It&#x27;s very early stages, but if the idea interests you, let me know what you think!<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kn100&#x2F;conjugate&#x2F;')
