Each shipper contains a GPS-enabled thermal sensor to track the location and temperature of each vaccine shipment. Once thawed, the vaccine vial can be stored for up to 5 days at refrigerated (2 - 8oC) conditions.<p>I read somewhere they already have 20 million doses ready to shipped once they get the approval. Wonder what is the capacity of each of these specially designed shippers and how the logistics of the eventual vaccination are going to be handled?<p>But this is surely an interesting problem to solve and I look forward to how they tackle it.')
