Not that I want to send more of my data to Google, but this is totally unacceptable.<p>Especially during COVID, I&#x27;m trying to make sure that as much of my money goes to the restaurant as possible when I call in a takeout order. It would be one thing if Yelp showed me an advertisement and I clicked through and placed an order. But when I&#x27;m using Yelp just to look up a phone number, there&#x27;s absolutely no reason for a commission.')
