Item(by='xur17', descendants=None, kids=[25050495], score=None, time=1605031229, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25048508, text='&gt; HN&#x27;s always seemed like a fairly equalizing place to me. As long as you can form a constructive, useful comment, your post will sit right next to people who make insane amounts of money, and be regarded equally based on its own merits.<p>I wonder what causes this - perhaps it&#x27;s the lack of emphasis on the poster&#x27;s name (small text, light grey vs profile picture, bold name, etc)?')
