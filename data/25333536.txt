So much so that it&#x27;s intended value can&#x27;t be realized, or even be detrimental to the end goal. But I think we&#x27;d agree that anyone who simply says says &quot;Running won&#x27;t help you lose weight because it doesn&#x27;t work, try this instead&quot; is not seeking to help you, just sell you.')
