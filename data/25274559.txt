It&#x27;s my own very, very private way of keeping people in my life. I don&#x27;t see it as not genuine or fake.<p>I agree with you, I do something like this on a much smaller scale to try and keep up with who I have and haven&#x27;t spoken to recently. I have a lot going on and time seems to slip past me, I can easily go weeks without talking to people and it feel like no time at all. Making a deliberate effort to maintain those relationships doesn&#x27;t seem like its fake to me.')
