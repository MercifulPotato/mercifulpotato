For all the on-the-Earth problems, you&#x27;d have to analyze them in an accelerating reference frame. That means Newton&#x27;s laws and the equations of motion don&#x27;t apply. You&#x27;d have to use special linear acceleration equations. An inertial reference frame is simpler and more general. Gravity fits that OK if you consider it to be a force distributed in proportion to mass.')
