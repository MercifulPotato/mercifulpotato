When I was younger I was nearly invisible to women. I ended a LTR of 7 years at 30 and the tables had turned significantly. I&#x27;m a similar build to when I was 22, I&#x27;m at best average attractiveness, now I&#x27;m bald too and yet online dating is like shooting fish in a barrel. I could line up more dates then I actually have free time to go on. I literally spend less than 3 weeks on any dating app as I&#x27;ll tend to meet someone in that time who I have some sort of casual relationship with for a period of time and I tend to be monogamous even in casual relationships.')
