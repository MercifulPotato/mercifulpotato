Item(by='hipparchus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608999837, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25528264, text='My issue with such a statement is that it most likely inevitably picks from a very specific subset of shows: that is, american and british shows (although the latter may even be quite a small subset of all british shows, if you are american), maybe with one or two other-anglospheric-country shows mixed in (probably a couple canadian shows, and maybe if we&#x27;re lucky, one or two australian), and ignores the huge swathes of international tv production. That&#x27;s without even going into the problem of age (most likely, your subset is composed mostly of shows of the &gt; 1980s at best, probably a significant subset would be &gt; 2000s). I don&#x27;t mean to say that this is a &quot;bad&quot; subset, that is, I concede that it&#x27;s inevitable that it contains great, and in some cases, sublime shows: we&#x27;ve gotten better at media production over the decades, and the financial and talent pools of the americans are nearly unparalleled. Yet I can&#x27;t help but feel like the americano-centrism of the &quot;Best shows of all times&quot; list is worthy of criticism  (I have similar criticisms for most &quot;best album &#x2F; songs of all time&quot; lists), given that I&#x27;ve seen shows of extremely high quality from both european and russian media. (Of course, I myself am guilty of this, with respect to shows from asia and the middle east, for instance, which I&#x27;ve seen nothing of. It seems as though most westerners will consume media of the following categories: either american, or from their country, with at most a handful of what could be considered for them, a &quot;foreign&quot; show.) as I feel like tv in general seems to be a medium in which americans don&#x27;t tend to really stray beyond looking at what&#x27;s produced by their country, unlike say, films, where, perhaps because of the more &quot;high-class&quot; sentiment that comes with being a cinephile, there&#x27;s a stronger push to look beyond the borders in an effort to stay informed and &quot;cultured&quot; about films around the world.')
