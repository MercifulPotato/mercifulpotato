I saw there are service tokens, but I think there might be a bit of chicken and egg issue, where I need to pass secret tokens to access the system to pass secrets with.<p>An enterprise (self hosted) offering is probably what my admittedly niche uses would require. Just kind of spit-balling some ideas really, to see where things are headed.<p>Any concept of separation of duties?
