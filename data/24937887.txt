It is.</i><p>Twitter is the most important journalistic tool? Not e-mail? Not end-to-end encrypted chat services? The entertainment website made up of mostly celebrity gossip, memes and culture war propaganda? I think you&#x27;re the one living in a cave my friend, a cave built, owned and operated by twitter. Just because it&#x27;s popular with many journalists doesn&#x27;t mean its important. There&#x27;s no doubt there are some amazing journalists who use twitter at some points during their day, but the overwhelming sum of what goes on twitter can hardly be considered &quot;journalism&quot;.<p>&gt; <i>There&#x27;s literally no way to get more accurate news faster, by following sources you trust.</i><p>That&#x27;s your opinion, not a fact. There are many people who would say using twitter as your primary news source is a terrible idea.  News on the internet is a billion dollar business, twitter is just one of many  innumerable sources of real-time news on the internet.')
