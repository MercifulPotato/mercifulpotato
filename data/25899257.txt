My feeling is that closing indoor dining may have been a good idea, but closing outdoor dining and telling people they couldn&#x27;t meet their friends (distanced) in public likely just caused people to have unsafe indoor gatherings in their homes, which is worse.<p>I of course have no hard evidence for this either, but outdoor dining was open for months before the holiday surge without a significant uptick in case rates.  That would imply that the surge was driven by the holidays, with people traveling when they shouldn&#x27;t, and hosting people outside their household for holiday dinners.  Neither of those things has anything to do with outdoor dining.<p>But Newsom had to be seen to be &quot;doing something&quot;, so here we are.<p>&gt; <i>But it should have come with a complete shut down of rent obligations as well.</i><p>I&#x27;m sympathetic to this idea, but landlords need to eat, too.')
