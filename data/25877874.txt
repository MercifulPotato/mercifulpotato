Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25878203], score=None, time=1611359386, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25875406, text='&gt; Open Source Software, at the very least, IS Communism, Marxism, Socialism – in practice…<p>I don’t think that’s true. Socialism tends to focus on socializing control of the means of production, defined specifically as the <i>physical</i> instruments that enable but (though they experience wear) are not consumed in production. Its true that Free Software ideology behind the (A)GPL can be seen as an analog to anarcho- (rather than state-) socialist ideology focussed not on the physical means of production (and whose advocates often have extremely high regard for physical property rights whether or not in means of production) but on software.<p>But “is analogous to a form of X different than what most people discussing X have in mind, with substantial changes in focal domain” is not the same thing as “is X in practice”.<p>&gt; There’s a time and a place for everything” (You know, like that old song by “The Byrds”: “Turn!, Turn!, Turn!”)<p>Well, first recorded by the Limelighters, written (and also recorded early on) by Pete Seeger, and lyrics mostly attributed to King Solomon, but in any case a couple thousand years before the Byrds.<p>&gt; Have innumerably benefitted and helped and advanced our Capitalist economy…<p>Even at the legal level, modern developed economies universally are variants of what has been called “the modern mixed economy”, which is a blend of capitalist and socialist elements (pure “capitalism” having fallen out of favor in the early-mid-20th Century.)<p>Its mostly still called “capitalism” because Soviet Communism became (and anchored “Socialism”, in many places, by extension as) a boogeyman lots of places not long <i>before</i> that, so identifying as “capitalist” against “socialists” and especially “communists” was common even among people who <i>substantively</i> opposed capitalism and advocated for reforms drawn directly out of socialist (and sometimes specifically Marxist Communist) ideology.')
