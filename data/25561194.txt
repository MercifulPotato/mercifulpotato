Click here to respond to Sam and help her out!”<p>In that context, you can <i>easily</i> see why people reply with such otherwise useless “answers.” When someone personally asks you a question you don’t know the answer to, responding with “sorry, I bought it for my husband as a gift and I don’t know,” is not just perfectly valid, it’s also the polite thing to do.  But that answer is posted to the website in the genera Q&amp;A as of you had viewed the question and then instead of passing on a question you had no answer for, you chose to reply with a useless answer.')
