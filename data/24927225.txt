It feels productive to think about productivity but oftentimes you&#x27;re confusing movement for progress. I&#x27;ll give two specific pieces of advice for people who are thinking about switching from methodology &#x2F; app A to methodology &#x2F; app B.<p>1. You might find something that B does that is just so difficult to accomplish in A, so you want to switch. But before you do, you should spend a week living with the difficult path to do that thing in A. You will likely find that learning the muscle memory to do that thing in A was actually the difficult part, and once you&#x27;ve overcome that hurdle it isn&#x27;t difficult any more.<p>2. You might switch to B and feel that &quot;now, everything is so organized!&quot; However, it&#x27;s very likely that you could have &quot;switched&quot; from A to A and you&#x27;d feel the same way. What I mean by this is that by switching, you&#x27;ve forced yourself to revisit all of your notes. If you forced yourself to revisit your notes without switching, you&#x27;d see the same effect.')
