The final NERVA prototype was as close to a functional NTR as ever built, and it massed 40,000 lbs while only generated 55,000 lbs of thrust, with a maximum ISP of 710 seconds.<p>A SpaceX Raptor only has a Mac ISP of 380 seconds, but masses only 3,000 lbs, and produces 500,000 lbs of thrust. Add another 50,000 lbs dead mass to the NTR for shielding and cooling, and you see why Raptor will get humans to Mars well before any NTR and just as quickly.')
