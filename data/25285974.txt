FATCA requires that if a bank wants to do business with US persons (including citizens regardless of residence) they have to regularly comb their database of clients to look for flags that they may be Americans and report this directly to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). If this doesn&#x27;t line up with your FBARs they may just take half your money.<p>FATCA is the reason American citizens <i>can&#x27;t</i> open bank accounts in many parts of the world -- local laws forbid the banks from transferring the data necessary to comply with FATCA; and if the banks chose to serve US persons anyways, the US government would cut the banks off from the entire US financial system.<p>This is not only a solved problem, but there&#x27;s <i>strong</i> precedent.<p>You wanna play in the big market? You play by their rules. Even if you don&#x27;t chances are your bank does. And even if they don&#x27;t, chances are their correspondent or custodial banks do. All roads lead back to DC for American citizens - and anyone one America&#x27;s shit list.<p>... and before you consider renunciation, there&#x27;s an exit tax to be paid in the amount of the capital gains due on all of your assets as though you disposed of them on your last day as a US citizen. And you better believe they&#x27;ll be checking for your tax compliance on your crypto accounts on the way out. Of course tax evasion is an extraditable offence, too, which really limits your choices.<p>America has a big carrot and a whole lot of sticks, and it&#x27;s willing to use both to get what it wants.')
