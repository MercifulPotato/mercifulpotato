Or, to put it another way, instead of trying to teach people JSON, why not teach programmers something new?<p>One thing we picked up on quickly when talking to doctors and nurses in the field is that most of them come up with their own short-hand dialects for scribbling notes (for later data entry, sometimes). Why not make it easy to scan these microDSLs as is, and even define them formally and cheaply, at the last mile that then compile into a more common tongue for ingestion into bigger EMRs? Epic I guess has something somewhat along those lines, but not taken to the extreme.')
