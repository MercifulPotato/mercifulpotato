If they are going to censor news they don&#x27;t like, they&#x27;d be better off just censoring it rather than putting on the patently false charade of pretending they have a standard which is being violated.  A simple, &quot;we reserve the right to remove any and all content posted&quot; would suffice, instead of pretending to be impartial arbiters of truth.')
