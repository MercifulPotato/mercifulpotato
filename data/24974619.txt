Item(by='yellowapple', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604359123, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24974371, text='&gt; is all that going to support hundreds of thousands of ex-casino employees in Clark County?<p>Per the article, and per the above reasoning, the manufacturing and warehousing sectors probably won&#x27;t, barring some massive surge in demand that the LA metro area can&#x27;t handle.<p>Energy, however, very well could.  Solar farms and geothermal plants ain&#x27;t exactly maintenance-free and 100% automated, after all.  Neither are the substations and power lines and other electrical infrastructure getting that power where it needs to be, nor are the roads and trucks getting equipment and parts to those solar farms and geothermal plants.<p>Plus, with a glut in green energy, other industries get a windfall, too.  Electric cars become a lot more viable if literally every parking space is electrified and even the most podunk run-down corners of the state have fast-charging capability.  Datacenters get more computing power per dollar as electricity costs go down.  Manufacturing and warehousing get even more boosts from being able to run power-hungry equipment more affordably.  All this would come without contributing to anthropogenic climate change, and without taking up space that might otherwise be used for farms or forests (good luck having much of either in the Great Basin).')
