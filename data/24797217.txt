She says please and thank you to Alexa. When Alexa fails to find an answer to her query, she gets angry at her and rudely tells it to &quot;shut up&quot;. Then apologises for her behavior. She tries to have contextual conversations with it. It seems like the line between a human and a machine is getting blurred for some people. What implications do you think this is it going to have on the next generation who grow up in a house with these devices?')
