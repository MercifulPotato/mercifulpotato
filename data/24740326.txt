Item(by='kennywinker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602349860, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24740259, text='&gt; The privacy of consumers who might eventually buy some of the stuff stuffed with their trackers.<p>I don&#x27;t share your concern here. CBC is a reputable org. They can just turn off the trackers if the items appear to be getting re-sold to an end-consumer. Even then, I don&#x27;t think it would be a privacy violation for a journalist to go and talk to them and say &quot;hey did you know this was a returned item?&quot; etc.<p>If the kids toy made it into the hands of a kid without that tracker being noticed, I&#x27;d have deeper concerns. I.e. what&#x27;s stopping someone from putting razorblades or some toxic checmical in a kids toy and returning it? Someone needs to check over returned items for basic quality, and should DEFINITELY notice the massive tracker.')
