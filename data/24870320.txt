I&#x27;m not a busy body nor a control freak. I would always prefer to work in the office. It is a <i>preference</i>, stop presenting it as right&#x2F;wrong.<p>Here is why I <i>prefer</i> an office. It gives me a hard separation between work and home. It forces me to be on a schedule (which I prefer). I have a short 20 minute commute so it is a time to listen to podcasts I otherwise wouldn&#x27;t make time for. I like the camaraderie of a team, wfh feels lonely to me. I enjoy grabbing lunch with co-workers and then we often play a game before going back to work. These things work for me and enrich my life.')
