This means that if there ever cam a point where even 25% of the population lived in a fully-rented state of being, a significant portion of the population will have been made into serfs and lords.  Of course, we do already have a large degree of this dynamic.  It&#x27;s quite different from the vision of the future we had hundreds of years ago; the one where we imagined everyone being able to develop their own independent fiefdoms within a society.')
