Such a thing would need a full-generational study. You cannot just &quot;I tried a diet for 1 month and X and Y happened&quot;.<p>1 month is nothing. At least 6 months are needed, 2 years in major changes can still be happening.<p>Also god forbid you trust the offical food pyramid, so many of these &quot;stupid bro science&quot; advices can have a lot more truth to them than the &quot;offical advices&quot; because they were tested via skin-in-the-game.')
