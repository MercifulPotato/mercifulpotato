We don&#x27;t have a vision of the future any more.<p>Here&#x27;s a well-known vision of the future: Futurama.[1] No, not the cartoon. The 1939 World&#x27;s Fair exhibit. Yes, it&#x27;s General Motors&#x27; view. Note the expectation of unlimited progress. Most of what you see there as the future was achieved.<p>GM tried again at the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair.[2] There was still optimism, but what we see there - huge moon bases and undersea cities - didn&#x27;t happen.<p>The big moment of disillusionment was the end of the US moon program in 1972. Going into space was just too expensive. That was about the time when science fiction turned dystopian. &quot;Silent Running&quot;, the first &quot;dirty future&quot; movie, came out in 1972, and set the pattern for most later SF films. Crystal spires out, grunge in.<p>For about a century and a half, manufacturing and transportation changed the world and led to the future.\nThen what?<p>Well, we got computers, and that carried us for another half century.<p>What&#x27;s next? There&#x27;s nothing obvious in the near term. Eventually biology may be figured out to the level that organisms can be designed and engineered. But that&#x27;s not close. Fusion power? Not going well.<p>We have enough technology and resources to provide a good standard of living for everyone on the planet. Nobody seems to have a scalable political system able to make that happen. This isn&#x27;t a technology problem.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;329901114" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;329901114</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;2-5aK0H05jk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;2-5aK0H05jk</a>')
