This technology had much higher error rates than traditional sequencing (~15%) and the use cases where I want to analyze something out in the field so badly are not numerous.  Collecting samples and sending them to your centralized sequencing facility is going to remain the most cost vs quality effective option.  Additionally, sequencing is a huge overkill for a diagnostic test, especially when with the cost and complexity of analysis being so high.<p>Anyone have an idea of a market or research project where this thing is a first-choice tool?<p>Edit:\nI stand corrected, seems some people are trying to use it in front-line clinical tests with post-analysis accuracy roughly on par with Illumina machines.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41587-019-0156-5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41587-019-0156-5</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41591-020-1105-z" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41591-020-1105-z</a>')
