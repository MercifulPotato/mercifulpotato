Is that such a bad thing though?<p>Yes.<p>&gt; I think its ok to expect tooling to be easy so we can spend our times on actually writing code.<p>I have never seen someone use a git GUI alternative as quickly and effectively as a competent CLI user. Especially if you&#x27;re dealing with anything of reasonable complexity, but still, even for simple stuff. I can hit F1 for my quake-like terminal and type out `git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m &#x27;Adds [...]&#x27;`, or a `git stash`, etc. faster than someone can reach over to the mouse and even open the GUI (let alone actually committing).<p>That&#x27;s not to say that I don&#x27;t use Sublime Merge but it&#x27;s only for complex visualization situations of weird branching etc. But... it&#x27;s worth noting that most of the time I can get that hammered out on my GitLab instance.<p>So, if you&#x27;re looking for efficiency and want to &quot;spend time actually writing code&quot; I attest your argument that a GUI would speed anything up <i>only</i> if you refuse to learn the CLI.<p>&gt; To me it&#x27;s the same thing as expecting auto completion and line by line debugging from our IDEs<p>I work in Sublime all day long and actually actively turn features like this off because they slow me down. Also this is not to say I don&#x27;t often jump into Intellij for heavier IDE stuff (step-through debugging) but that&#x27;s like 1-2 times a week max. Otherwise, get out of my way and just let me get the code onto the page, I know 100% what I&#x27;m doing&#x2F;writing and my docs are immaculate and accurate.<p>---<p>Overall we probably work in very different ways, with very different development philosophies - which is 100% fine =)')
