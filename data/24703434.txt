If the worker was able to work remotely in the US using Zoom, why can&#x27;t they do the same job remotely in the same time zone in Canada using the same remote working tools? This might be a once in lifetime opportunity for Canada to grow their tech sector, especially if Trump gets re-elected and puts further restrictions.<p>There is already a small industry in Canada where a company takes a few % of the billing rate in order to sponsor and hold a Canadian visa for people who lost their H1B visas due to increased and inconsistent rejections over the past few years, but whose employer is willing to allow them to work from Canada. This moves a lot of money to Canada.<p>Also, some tech companies have been outright moving jobs to Canada because they can hire from a global workforce and Canada has been welcoming them. This is going to intensify.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;27&#x2F;799402801&#x2F;canada-wins-u-s-loses-in-global-fight-for-high-tech-workers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;27&#x2F;799402801&#x2F;canada-wins-u-s-los...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;best-countries&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-07-20&#x2F;how-canadas-tech-sector-benefits-from-us-visa-policy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;best-countries&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-07-...</a><p>There is a reason this regulation didn&#x27;t follow the normal rule-making and public comment period.
