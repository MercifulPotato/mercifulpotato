Instigate wars in other countries? If anything we should send to refugees to the US because they&#x27;re to blame for it all.<p>It&#x27;s not just the US, you said it yourself - France, Russia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the EU (agricultural subsidies make it impossible for local African farmers to compete with cheap, subsidised surpluses from the EU), Germany (weapon deals), China, and many others depending on region.<p>It&#x27;s easy to point the finger to just the US, but in reality it&#x27;s been European colonialism that started most of the mess in the first place. Just compare the borders in Africa and the Middle East to the borders in Europe and you might get an idea why peace and prosperity might be a long ways away.<p>&gt; Most criminals are criminals because of the circumstances. Circumstances can be improved but they&#x27;d rather spend 5.5 billion (the one after the million) € on Eurofighters than make away with poverty.<p>The EU alone has a population of 440M. 5.5Bn is just 12.5€&#x2F;person. Say 1 in 1000 people within the EU can be considered poor, that&#x27;s still just 12500€ per poor person. That might be great for a year in many places, but then you&#x27;d have the same problem again next year. And the year after that, and the year after that...<p>Circumstances can be improved, but it doesn&#x27;t start with money. The first step needs to be the disbandment of ghettos - way too many migrant families are segregated into their own streets, city blocks and quarters. Their children are stigmatised from birth and discrimination starts at an early age.<p>These people don&#x27;t need money - they need a perspective, a fair chance, and acceptance. As long as football fans throw racial slurs even at their own players and as long as your country of birth, ethnic- and social background determines your future more than your skills, personality and hard work, being a terrorist or criminal has more appeal than being a productive part of society.')
