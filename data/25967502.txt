You can look at the same thing from two different sides, and describe it in completely different ways.<p>So before you can &quot;outsmart evil&quot; you really need to define &quot;what evil is&quot;. You may look at Wall Street and decide they are &quot;evil&quot; (because they make money?) - whereas someone else might look at it and see a working mechanism that allows &quot;companies of people&quot; to raise funds, and ultimately share their capitalistic profits. It provides a mechanism for pensions to be invested, and generate returns, so that, um, pensions can exist.<p>And if there are ten people in the room you may get ten different opinions on what exactly is wrong - some of them wildly contradictory.<p>There is no &quot;good&quot; side, or &quot;evil&quot; side to Silicon Valley. There are lots of companies which are striving to achieve their goals - and for some of them (not necessarily all) those goals are to maximize profit. Whether that is evil, or good, or the reverse is evil or good, depends on your particular perspective.<p>So it may be better for you to reframe your question with a specific goal of yours in mind. Which action do you find &quot;evil&quot;? And perhaps more to the point, why are you trying to set the goals for such a nebulous entity as &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; (or &quot;Wall Street&quot;)? Surely they are free to set their own goals?<p>If you agree with the goals of a specific company you can support them, if you disagree with those goals you are free to take your support elsewhere.')
