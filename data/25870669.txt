(The improvements they made to the basic ES clustering, indexing, sharding, Lucene integration, etc. are very valuable, and I&#x27;m not discounting them, but their added value is drastically reduced compared to the features. Just like AWS&#x27; added value for businesses is a lot more important than having yet another cool x-pack feature.)<p>AWS is the bigger fish :|')
