I have to click on 2D to look directly top-down. This would be the natural result if I simply tilted the camera all the way downward, but instead it maxes out at some arbitrary angle. (Same the other way, I want to look at the horizon, but I guess there are bandwidth issues involved.)<p>- Scroll zoom is waaay to slow. I have a mouse with an inertial wheel, so I can just let &#x27;er rip, but this must be frustrating with a regular mouse wheel.<p>- +&#x2F;- keys don&#x27;t zoom, like I&#x27;d expect them to.')
