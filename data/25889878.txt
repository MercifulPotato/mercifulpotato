If you&#x27;ve never used Wordpress&#x27; Gutenberg editor (or others based on the same model such as Medium or Squarespace), you should try it. The ability to not only change formatting but page structure and layout in a guided, template-driven way is simply not comparable to editing a Markdown file.<p>I&#x27;m pretty ambivalent on Wordpress&#x27; technical merits and its plugin ecosystem is a terrible attractive nuisance for the uninitiated, but if you want to give content authors a robust tool for publishing, there&#x27;s not much else like it.')
