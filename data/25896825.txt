When that happens late in the dinner after coffee and liquor, people usually move around and form little groups.<p>Streams are like shared conversations involving the entire table - one person at a time talks, everybody listens and replies. Sometimes people try to talk over each other, sometimes it&#x27;s mostly two or three people talking and the others are nodding along for a while. But it&#x27;s what makes the experience a communal one, and it&#x27;s how you get to know the people in the group other than the few you directly spoke to.<p>It also acts as a moderating influence, since if two people are getting into a heated debate over some niche issue, other attendees will usually try to mediate for the sake of the event, instead of ignoring them and letting them fight among them.<p>Stream-based forums IME tended to form more robust communities where people recognized each other&#x27;s names and avatars, whereas even in smaller subreddits I might recognize a couple of very frequent commenters but nowhere near as easily or as often. On the other side, tree-based forums make it much easier to establish a rapport with the couple of people you wanted to talk to and ignore everybody else.<p>(Potential objection: nothing&#x27;s stopping a tree system from acting like a stream by having a &quot;main&quot; thread where most everybody pipes up. In theory that&#x27;s true, but in practice I find that threads simply don&#x27;t have the staying power of streams, because they fade off into the &#x27;click here for the next 20 replies&#x27; purgatory where only the participants and a few lurkers follow. Streams keep all the eyeballs in the same place.)')
