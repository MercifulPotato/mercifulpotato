In thailand I just assumed they just knew how to better prepare the ingredients. Then I went to greece and had a proper greek salad.<p>If you don&#x27;t think you like greek salad, Let me tell you.<p>A Greek salad is only going to taste good in greece. Why? because all the ingredients that make up a greek salad are local and in season around the same time. Its not a complex salad and stands entirely on the strength of the produce that makes up its parts. In greece I found it bursting with flavor. The flavors were sublime with tomatoes rich in umami intermingling with spicy olive oil and savory farmer&#x27;s cheese. Any version you get in America is going to be a pale insult,<p>In Ukraine, I gorged myself on blueberries. They tasted just like the ones I used to eat from a wild bush near my childhood house.<p>I&#x27;m currently in Turkey. Same story, grilled vegetables and kabaab give me far mroe satisfaction. the produce is JUST more filling, and satisfying.<p>American produce SUCKS.')
