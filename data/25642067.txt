Specifically:<p>“...Assange wrote that WikiLeaks would consider recommendations made by the International Security Assistance Force &quot;on the identification of innocents for this material if it is willing to provide reviewers.&quot;<p>That’s from your salon.com article.<p>So Assange would “consider” redacting (not promising anything) and only if a group from the United Nations identified “innocent” names. There’s no mention that the Pentagon has any input at all. And there’s no reason to think anyone at the ISA should know the names of undercover intelligence agents in those documents, especially the documents completely unrelated to Afghanistan... since the ISA was involved only with issues in Afghanistan.')
