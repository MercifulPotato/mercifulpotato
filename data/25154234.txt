Firefox&#x2F;Chrome still offer all of the same customization options, and you can even turn off DoH entirely.<p>What it is about is that the defaults for pretty much all OSes are bad. Maybe if we lived in a world where DoH was shipping by default enabled in Linux&#x2F;Mac&#x2F;Windows and set to something private like Cloudflare, it would make sense not to even provide browser options at all.<p>But as it stands, the current solution (while a little unintuitive and hacky) give you the best of both worlds. If you&#x27;re a normal user, you get secure defaults. If you&#x27;re a power user, you can go into Firefox and point at your own DoH provider, or turn off DoH entirely if that&#x27;s what you want. And if you&#x27;re an admin deploying Firefox on a network, you can deploy it with a custom profile that sets its internal DoH&#x2F;DNS settings to whatever you want.')
