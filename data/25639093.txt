Accepted an offer for a Java&#x2F;Spring developer, but a week later I got a better offer for a Scala engineer at Apple that had swept me off my feet. I don&#x27;t know why I still feel gross having to renege after accepting the first offer; I think its because I annoyed the recruiter. That even if the first offer had salary-matched the other offer, I&#x27;d rather be programming in Scala than Java&#x2F;Spring and that wasn&#x27;t something they could compete with.')
