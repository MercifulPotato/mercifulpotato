Other earlier Great Apes and even other animals are simply less able to implement this abstraction, and because of this they only use the abstraction for computation of their simple lives like motor skills or &quot;psychomotor states&quot;. Since we have more brainpower, we are able to implement a higher percentage of abstractability.<p>Thus, the core aspect is the program of &quot;abstractability&quot; (or it would be more common to use the word consciousness or awareness). We implement it to a higher degree than other apes, but since we both implement parts of it, of course we are going to share some aspects of it in our lives.<p>&gt; Concepts are, in my view, always psychomotor<p>Even this seems much more accurate to view the other way around: both psychomotor skills and concepts require computation and abstractability. Concepts are always based on abstraction. But psychomotor skills are also based on abstraction.<p>And again, what does &quot;political correctness&quot; have to do with a psychomotor engine of an ape that can jump between trees, hold a balance and throw things at a distance? You would need to use some serious imagination to convince people that the most occam&#x27;s razored hypothesis of that concept is based primarily(!) on mechanical skills?<p>But I guess hey, we won&#x27;t know for sure until we make AGI so who knows ;)')
