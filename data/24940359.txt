What does ownership mean? To me, it&#x27;s <i>exclusive</i> control (or right to control) some particular piece of property. This is a natural thing that occurs with physical property <i>because</i> of scarcity. But it does not occur naturally with ideas. The only way it happens with ideas is if scarcity is created artificially, e.g., by a state.<p>I&#x27;d say &quot;Against Intellectual Property&quot; by Stephan Kinsella is a good deeper dive on this. But some may find it unorthodox.')
