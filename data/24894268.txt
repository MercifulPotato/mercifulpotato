Item(by='dang', descendants=None, kids=[24903653], score=None, time=1603704399, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24880887, text='Not that I know of, but there are lots of third-party HN projects out there.<p>We&#x27;ve sometimes thought about tracking and showing the edit history of HN comments, but I think this is one place where (let&#x27;s call it) over-surveillance could lead to more harm than good. Certainly some users abuse editing, but there are also many cases where it&#x27;s important to let people save face, give them an out, and so on. HN is supposed to be a community and it&#x27;s important for communities to be forgiving. A certain degree of forgetfulness creates greater ease and freedom. No one wants to be around a superintelligent flaw-pointer-outer. So I think an edit history tracker would have unintended consequences and on balance is probably a bad idea.')
