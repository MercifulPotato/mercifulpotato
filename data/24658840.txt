People so regularly forget social technology. Social technology has almost all of the above traits. Want to get rid of Money? Good luck with that.<p>I suspect, there&#x27;s an underlying assumption that is false. Humans as individuals? An ideal, I suspect. Evolution favours not individual survival, but group survival. If we accept that Evolution can also be seen as a technological ratchet, then perhaps it becomes clear, it isn&#x27;t merely technology, but the very nature of Evolution itself.<p>If this is in fact true, it means that rebelling against Technology (mechanical) is doomed, for it is not rebelling against the holistic. And if it is just a part of broader Evolution, then there is nothing to be done.')
