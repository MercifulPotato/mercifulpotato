While I didn&#x27;t live in NYC, there was a lot of crossover between the New York crowd and the artsy people in my city so I got a lot of exposure to it.<p>The strange thing is that while I was aware of Basquiat and numerous other NYC artists of the era, I didn&#x27;t think much of them. They didn&#x27;t seem special to me because they were just what was going on at the time.<p>I have a specific memory of when the biopic came out and wondering why they made a movie about Basquiat. I had no real frame of reference. Same thing with music, which was even more of a crossover locally for me than art.<p>It&#x27;s only been in recent years I&#x27;ve been able to look back and see what was going on and why it was special. It&#x27;s mostly a matter of exposure to a lot of other art and music, gaining a lot of context and perspective.<p>Makes me wonder what I&#x27;m not appreciating enough today.')
