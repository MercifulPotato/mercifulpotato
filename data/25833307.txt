He&#x27;s claiming to extract usable information from them in a way that can be instantly used by doctors, so that they don&#x27;t have to read the studies or find an up-to-date summary of the literature by a skilled professional.<p>He even called what his software did a meta-analysis.  My understanding is limited, but a meta-analysis is difficult and laborious to do correctly.  You have to design the standards you use to include and exclude studies and examine each study to decide whether including it will improve or harm the quality of your results.  For example, maybe a method to evaluate outcomes that used to be common has been discredited.  Maybe a study was done under a principal researcher who has been caught fabricating results in other studies. Maybe a study claims to be double-blind, but when you read it carefully, it turns out that it isn&#x27;t.  Maybe a study is well-designed in every way, but it was designed for a slightly different purpose, so the data can&#x27;t be used the way you want to.<p>Factors like these result in the exclusion of a lot of studies from a meta-analysis, after painstaking examination by researchers who have the expertise to design and run the studies they&#x27;re reading.  It&#x27;s scientifically difficult and important work.  The author is bragging about not doing this work:<p>&gt; On July 2, 2018, GlacierMD powered the world&#x27;s largest depression meta-analysis, using data from 846 trials, beating Cipriani&#x27;s previous record of 522.')
