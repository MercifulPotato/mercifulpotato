Item(by='samatman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610824647, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25801344, text='<p><pre><code>    #[no_mangle] extern &quot;C&quot;\n</code></pre>\nAll due respect to Rust, which is a fantastic language, what this line says is &quot;here is a C function written in Rust&quot;.<p>You can of course do the same thing with C++ and with D, allowing all three to check the box for interoperability. And with Rust you get everything Rust offers: so you can write in the `extern &quot;C&quot;` dialect while getting memory-safety guarantees within the library, that&#x27;s not nothing.<p>What Zig offers is the ability to write <i>ordinary Zig</i> and call that from C.  That&#x27;s part of what it&#x27;s designed to do.<p>This is interoperability by design, rather than by configuration. It&#x27;s simply a different thing, and considered along this singular dimension, I would assert that it&#x27;s better.<p>I didn&#x27;t, and wouldn&#x27;t, say that Zig has the potential to replace Rust. I said that about C, and explained why.')
