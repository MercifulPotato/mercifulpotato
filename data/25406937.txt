They fall asleep or try to pass and don&#x27;t see you. This kind of passing is very common and major fatal accident cause in my country. If there is place to the right (assuming driving on right country) (sometimes designated safety area or a field of grass or whatever) then you have to escape and you have to accelerate to escape faster. Being only makes sense if there is enough time or it looks like they might be breaking as well. If it&#x27;s a truck for example going your way hitting the brakes is just suicide.<p>Anyway my point is that it does happen. I agree it&#x27;s rare. I would be careful when it comes to trusting UK guidelines blindly. Last time I checked they recommended push and pull steering which is to put it mildly a very bad way to control a car.')
