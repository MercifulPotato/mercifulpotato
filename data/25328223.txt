(1) if the landlord or agents turn up anyway and have keys then you&#x27;d be relying on calling police to turf them out - who may not side with you whatever the rights and wrongs, (2) it&#x27;s actually not completely certain legally that quiet enjoyment trumps other rights - as I don&#x27;t think there have been recent test cases (bear in mind that almost all tenancy agreements do include pretty broad access rights for the landlord to undertake maintenance these days) and (3) if you do refuse access unreasonably and despite a contractual right of the landlord then the landlord may be entitled to damages from you if that delay harms them financially.')
