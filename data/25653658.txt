The full report (PDF) makes for interesting reading: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ntsb.gov&#x2F;investigations&#x2F;AccidentReports&#x2F;Reports&#x2F;AAR2002.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ntsb.gov&#x2F;investigations&#x2F;AccidentReports&#x2F;Reports&#x2F;...</a><p>Some additional damning quotes:<p><i>Another check airman at Mesa said the FO’s stick and rudder skills were weak,  and he also struggled  with  basic  flight  management  system  tasks.  This  check  airman  described  the  FO’s  piloting performance as among the worst he had ever seen and noted that the FO tended to have an excuse for each of his poor performances, such as blaming his simulator partner, his instructor, or the hotel. A third check airman at Mesa said that the FO had weak situational awareness, did not realize what was going on with the airplane at times, and had difficulty staying ahead of the airplane.  She  said  the  FO  was  completely  unaware  that  he  lacked  skills,  unwilling  to  accept  feedback, and unhappy with her about his failure to upgrade to captain.</i><p><i>An instructor who taught cockpit procedures on the flight training devices at Air Wisconsin Airlines recalled  that  during  one  emergency  procedures training  scenario,  the  FO  made  abrupt  control inputs that triggered the stick shaker and overspeed alerts. The instructor said that instead of staying engaged in the scenario and addressing the problem with his training partner, the FO just  stopped  what  he  was  doing  and  turned  around  and  looked  at  the  instructor.  The  instructor  found this reaction highly unusual.</i><p>Turns out Amazon didn&#x27;t know about any of these failures, because here&#x27;s your government in action (inaction):<p><i>Ten years  ago,  Section  203  of  the  Airline  Safety  and  Federal  Aviation  Administration  Extension Act of 2010 mandated that the FAA create an electronic pilot records database (PRD),  which was intended to improve the timeliness and efficiency of the PRIA records retrieval process by  providing  hiring operators  and  DAs  with  direct  access  to  pilots’  FAA,  NDR,  and  former  employer records in a single database. By 2016, the FAA had not yet implemented the PRD, and Congress imposed an April 30, 2017, deadline, which the FAA also missed. Although the FAA has  begun  phasing  in the  use  of  the  PRD,  the  PRD  is not  yet  fully  functional;  it  contains  only  pilots’ FAA records and is available to hiring operators for use on a voluntary basis.</i>')
