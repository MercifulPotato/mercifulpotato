If a user signs up but doesn&#x27;t go through with the verification process, there&#x27;s no setting to say &quot;remove them after X days&quot;. So we have to run a batch job.<p>If I screw up one parameter, instead of deleting only unconfirmed users, I could delete all users. I have two redundant checks, first when the query is run to get the unconfirmed users, and then again checking the user&#x27;s confirmed status before deleting them. And then I check one more time further down in the code for good measure. Not because I think the result will be different, but just in case one of the lines of code is altered somehow.<p>I put BIG LOUD comments everywhere of course. But it still terrifies me.')
