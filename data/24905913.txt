I started building FEATool far too many years ago not getting anywhere in academia after too many postdocs, since it was the one thing I&#x27;m passionate about and good at and I felt was &quot;missing&quot; when I was working. But yes, it seems more and more that each user has a very specific problem that they want to solve which is very hard to generalize for. And although I still think (most if not all) software could be much more user friendly, I probably have taken on more than I can chew (I only keep going now since I feel I have no choice with the years I&#x27;ve already invested).')
