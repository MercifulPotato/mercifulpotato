I think you&#x27;ll continue to see something that looks rather similar to the mobile OS space: lots of players, but ~2 dominate the space. Unreal&#x27;s revenue cut is also a lot more prohibitive than Unity&#x27;s, so you&#x27;ll also keep seeing a healthy indie ecosystem (which translates to a community, assets, etc.) in Unity.<p>A lot of Unreal&#x27;s recent investments are incredibly impressive. Especially with better rendering and realtime raytracing. But Unity is also making some big investments, DOTS (see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unity.com&#x2F;megacity" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unity.com&#x2F;megacity</a> for example) comes to mind in particular.')
