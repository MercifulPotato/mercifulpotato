They claimed if everyone held on to the items for two weeks the price would rise and they&#x27;d all get rich.<p>Of course, the leaders would then sell their items one week in. This would cause the price of the item to drop, resulting in the other members of the clan panic-selling all of their items. The price of the item would then crash resulting in most players losing their money.<p>Eventually the game developers made the organization of such clans a bannable offense since too many casual players were losing a lot of their wealth participating in these events.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;runescapeclans.fandom.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Merchanting_Clan" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;runescapeclans.fandom.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Merchanting_Clan</a>')
