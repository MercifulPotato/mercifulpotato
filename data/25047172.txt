It makes very little sense.<p>I certainly don&#x27;t trust them, but I do use Zoom (from a\ndedicated unprivileged user, so it can&#x27;t do any harm beyond\nrecording my conversations), because my colleagues use Zoom, and\nbecause there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any working alternative.  I got\nthem to try Jitsi once, which simply didn&#x27;t work.<p>PS.
