The most moving scene for me personally was Brian bicycling by himself (S04E14) - for the longest time I would get weepy just thinking about it, and how it seemed to reflect where my own life was at the time. The music really tied it together - Wonderful Life by Colin Vearncombe.<p>The cellular aging - it&#x27;s something I discovered recently myself, when it was mentioned in passing during a talk on aging. I did some reading and I think this is it:<p>* [Brief Report: Differential Effects of Tenofovir, Abacavir, E... : JAIDS Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.lww.com&#x2F;jaids&#x2F;Fulltext&#x2F;2017&#x2F;01010&#x2F;Brief_Report__Differential_Effects_of_Tenofovir,.19.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.lww.com&#x2F;jaids&#x2F;Fulltext&#x2F;2017&#x2F;01010&#x2F;Brief_Rep...</a>)<p>* [Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate induces peripheral neuropathy and alters inflammation and mitochondrial biogenesis in the brains of mice | Scientific Reports](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41598-019-53466-x#Sec24" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41598-019-53466-x#Sec24</a>)<p>* [Pharmacogenetic Analysis of the Model‐Based Pharmacokinetics of Five Anti‐HIV Drugs: How Does This Influence the Effect of Aging? - Chen - 2018 - Clinical and Translational Science - Wiley Online Library](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1111&#x2F;cts.12525" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1111&#x2F;cts.1...</a>)<p>Accelerated cellular aging has been noticed in HIV+ patients for a while, and there is some growing evidence that at least some of it might be due to ART, including the formulations used in PrEP. I&#x27;m not aware of a study looking at accelerated aging in HIV -ve people using PrEP.<p>I suppose the risks are elevated with the daily dose regimen, and Event Driven PrEP (2+1+1) might be safer long term. Of course, Event Driven PrEP recommendations also assume fewer than two sexual encounters per week, so it&#x27;s not for the more &#x27;social&#x27; amongst us.<p>I&#x27;m unfamiliar with the pricing. How much is the out of pocket costs? Does Gilead reimburse the entire copay?')
