If people aren&#x27;t &quot;free&quot; to live in abject poverty, to have to choose between there medicines and their food, to not have air conditioning in summer or heat in winter... yeah, I don&#x27;t have a problem with removing that &quot;freedom&quot;.<p>But I have a problem with removing the freedom to be unequal on the upside.  If I want to have more than you, and I can get it by producing more than you... why not?  If I can&#x27;t get rewarded for producing more, I probably won&#x27;t produce more.  That leaves less for everyone.  Who does that help?<p>Thus those who try to prevent inequality on the upside remove freedom, and make everyone worse off.  Worse off in two ways.  First, society doesn&#x27;t get the extra that some people would have been motivated to produce.  And second, they made everyone less free.<p>Less free plus less stuff?  Sure, sign me up... not.')
