Item(by='b20000', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605759201, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25142159, text='I think one problem we have is that every year there is some new shiny language that is hot. And companies and recruiters expect you to learn that language or stack which is ridiculous. Back when I was in college in the CS program I made a decision to focus on one language and only learn that and try to become good at using that language. I know my way around a few other languages but rarely use them. Like a carpenter who uses a few tools but has one favourite tool. I think that is OK, and nobody needs to learn more tools or stacks or languages. If people expect you to do that, just move on and find a company where you can do what you want with the tools you want. There is a lot of &quot;you should be learning X or doing Y&quot; and this just creates a lot of unnecessary stress and it&#x27;s ridiculous to expect that. Lawyers only need to know a few tools, and nobody expects them to learn new tools every year. They just have to do the bare minimum to keep up. Same for a lot of other professions. I also think that recruiters and companies just use the &quot;you need to know X&quot; excuse to simply pay you less. So don&#x27;t fall for it.')
