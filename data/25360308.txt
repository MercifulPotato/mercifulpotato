And they were hella convenient to work with for compositing and collision detection because there was specialized hardware to do just that. The sprite hardware in the video unit of most game consoles could draw bitmaps with transparency just as the electron beam arrived at the affected pixels. And it would signal an interrupt when two sprites collided (and often alert the CPU via registers <i>which</i> two sprites collided).')
