All habits are constructed â€” they&#x27;re a conscious act, especially while you&#x27;re establishing them. If you&#x27;re trying to build habits, haven&#x27;t you <i>already</i> thought about why in a pretty comprehensive, introspective way?<p>It would be amazing if habits magically emerged from comprehensive introspection, but Thinking About X is not Doing X.')
