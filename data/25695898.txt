It doesn&#x27;t matter how much effort twitter makes. The simple reality is that you cant have a middle man in one-to-many communication. Its just not possible for their agenda to align perfectly with yours - or anyones. You can use twitter if you can make your agenda fit theirs (which is a moving target) and twitter can have plenty of users by adapting their agenda to its users (which are a bazillion moving targets) - good luck with that! One would have to be rather ignorant, a person docile enough to realistically anticipate any and all future contexts doesn&#x27;t exist. Twitter is trying really hard to make it work - but it cant! I remember people who build their organization on google wave, on google knol and on yahoo groups. I build a reasonably large community on yahoo 360 and we tried to move to WordPress. (you can laugh, it&#x27;s okay) I&#x27;ve used up all of my ignorance. I like RSS the way I like email and bittorrent. You can down vote me but to shut me up would require a good few days in court. We could just do discussion in stead and I might learn something.')
