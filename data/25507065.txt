You give up your equity today, but the LLC gives your a convertible note to cover your valuation conditional on some future funding event.<p>Set a specific valuation target, at which point the note will pay in cash equivalent to a certain percent of the company&#x27;s equity. That defers the issue of liquidity until if&#x2F;when the company gets sufficient funding. But it gets you out of the equity today, particularly with regards to voting shares. Which is probably what your co-founder cares about the most.')
