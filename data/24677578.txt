Item(by='arafsheikh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601804157, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24677069, text='My 2017 13&quot; is riddled with hardware issues all of which are due to the subpar thermals:<p>1. The haptic feedback on the trackpad stops working when the machine gets hot.<p>2. Once the upper part of the chassis becomes hot enough, part of the screen gets black lines and ghosting which gets worse as I continue to use it until it goes completely black (this is because the T-CON board is very close to the heatsink).<p>3. The SSD conveniently failed 1 month after the warranty ended. The official repair cost was about 50% of the cost of the machine. Luckily this was the last Macbook to have non-soldered SSD, and I got a replacement from AliExpress for $50.<p>Oddly, I&#x27;ve never run into the infamous keyboard issue.')
