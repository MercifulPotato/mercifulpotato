That&#x27;s why the left supports policies like DACA.<p>The disagreement is not about whether or not illegal immigration is a problem.  The disagreement is very much about what the right way to fix the problem is, which is well within the bounds of legitimate policy disagreement.<p>&gt; rent control doesn&#x27;t work<p>Of course it does.  Rent control keeps rents from going up.  Whether or not this is <i>desirable</i>, or whether it has undesirable ancillary effects that outweigh the benefits, is again the subject of legitimate disagreement over policy.')
