Item(by='gambiting', descendants=None, kids=[25301151, 25301915, 25301225], score=None, time=1607080176, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25300957, text='&gt;&gt;The purpose of Universities is to uphold, expand and disseminate human culture, not to prepare people for a career in the industry.<p>Like, I personally agree with you, but then I also think that we don&#x27;t have the right to define it as such. There&#x27;s plenty of people who think that the main goal of a university(at least in scientific&#x2F;engineering fields) should be to prepare people for working in the industry.<p>Equally, I see nothing wrong with courses which are specifically designed for this. I myself have finished a &quot;Games Engineering&quot; masters which boasted about close links to the industry, and over 90% hire rate in the industry after - and I got exactly what was promised. I don&#x27;t see any issue with that personally. I also have friends who had their entire PhDs funded by companies like Red Hat, because they were researching things done in collaboration with them. Also don&#x27;t have any issue here, and that made sure that my friends not only paid nothing for their PhDs, they were actually pretty well compensated throughout.<p>I think the perspective changes when you have to pay for university. My sister has a degree in film making from a British university, which she paid nealy Â£60k(!!!!) for, and her chances of employment in the industry are nearly zero. Where I&#x27;m from(Poland)_all higher education is free, and then I have no problem with degrees not correlating with employment(but then maybe on the other hand, as a Polish tax payer, maybe I would prefer that they did, otherwise why are we paying these people to study with no employment prospects afterwards. Again, I don&#x27;t really think that but I know many people do).')
