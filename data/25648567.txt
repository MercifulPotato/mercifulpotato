Works perfectly for me, and I have it configured to behave like the Windows 7 start menu.  The Windows 10 start menu being cumbersome wasn&#x27;t enough to push me to it; it was that the Windows 10 start menu had a limit to the number of items on it, and if I remember correctly didn&#x27;t show any new programs after that limit, which made it useless for opening any newly installed programs after that.')
