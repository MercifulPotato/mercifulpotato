Item(by='crispyambulance', descendants=None, kids=[24826274, 24826583], score=None, time=1603112820, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24824999, text='Of course IKEA furniture lacks durability, much of it is made of that awful MDF (particle board).<p>Simultaneously weak, heavy and extremely vulnerable to water damage, it&#x27;s only advantage is that it&#x27;s dimensionally accurate when new and amenable to automated cutting, milling and drilling at the factory. I guess it&#x27;s good with laminate coatings as well.<p>Another thing about IKEA is that if you got an old house with wide baseboards and not-quite-square walls, floors and ceilings, it&#x27;s hard to make stuff like cabinets, bookshelves and counters mount properly. IKEA appears to be optimized for modern construction.<p>Much better to just get high-quality plywood cabinets, you won&#x27;t have to worry about destroying it by using normal tools. It&#x27;s also lighter and you will swear less and be done sooner. Even better, hire a carpenter to install good stuff.')
