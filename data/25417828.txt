Meaning why aren’t services completely isolated? Isn’t it obvious that in an intertwined environment those things are bound to happen (as in “question of when, not if”)? I understand, in smaller companies that are limited in resources (access to good developers and pressure to get product to market as soon as possible) we have single points of failure all over the place. But “the smartest developers on the planet”? What is it if not short-sighted disregard for risk management theories and practices? I mean, Calendar and Youtube, say, should be completely separate services hosted in different places, their teams should not even talk to each other. Yes, they can use same software components, frameworks and technologies. Standardization is very welcome. But decentralization should be an imperative.<p>Edit: again downvotes started!
