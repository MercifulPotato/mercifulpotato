Who knew Tolstoy was a grade A hater. Tolstoy is like a hater trying to convince you that Brady is an overrated below average system quarterback who lucked out in NE.<p>I think Tolstoy missed where much of Shakespeare&#x27;s greatness lay - his use and command of the english language. Not just coining words, but how he said so much with so little. Brevity is the soul of wit. Tolstoy seemed oddly focused on the morals and realism of shakespeare&#x27;s works.<p>My guess is that it was a language barrier. No matter how &quot;fluent&quot; Tolstoy was in english, it&#x27;s hard to appreciate word play if english isn&#x27;t your native language.<p>But man, tolstoy would have loved social media. He would have fit right in. Haters for life.')
