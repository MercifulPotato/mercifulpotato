This is a good thing. It&#x27;s much less bloated (60 MB vs several GB), and compilations seem much faster.<p>TeX is <i>not</i> several GB.  It was designed for systems running under intense resource constraints, and it is <i>tiny</i>.<p>Most widely used TeX installations (TeXLive is the big one) bundle lots of the most popularly used packages by default, but that&#x27;s an option, and they can be installed on demand as needed.  Even granting the reasonable point that modern TeX is functionally useless without packages (and other essential accouterments such as PDFTeX rather than Knuth&#x27;s original code), I stripped down TeXLive to the packages I actually need (which is an easy choice in the installer, not some arcane hack), and it&#x27;s about 300 MB.')
