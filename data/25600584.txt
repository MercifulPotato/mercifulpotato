With hardware, it was a whole ritual to turn everything on, each instrument had its own smell, it put me into a mood of &quot;let&#x27;s play with this machine and see what happens&quot;.<p>When I moved to software, I finally had all the sounds I always wanted but could never afford, I finally no longer had to futz around trying to reprogram a patch I liked, I finally could send any instrument to any effects box... but there were less happy accidents. It felt a bit more like my day job, which also just involves sitting in front of a computer.<p>I think it can be like that for a lot of people, where the tactility and limitations of the gear can inspire a different approach to music-making. I imagine that aspect also plays in to the emotion that some people have that hardware instruments &quot;sound&quot; better.<p>All that said, I would never go back to hardware. As you say, it&#x27;s hard to beat the convenience of a laptop.')
