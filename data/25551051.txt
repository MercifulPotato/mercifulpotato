That was one of the first pages that was moved over, and these days I think it would be relatively trivial to add a “last” page, since the Relay connection has the concept of totalCount and we have a few tricks around first&#x2F;last cursors. Theoretically the ordering could also be flipped to view the first commit on the first page.')
