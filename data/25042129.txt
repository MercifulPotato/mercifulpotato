The person I&#x27;m replying to has never lived here so they have no idea what they&#x27;re talking about.<p>2. Group A systematically robbed and cheated Group B for centuries. Now that Group B has some political power and legal protections, Group A wants to pretend that &quot;they can&#x27;t see color.&quot;<p>Despite the fact that Group A has 10x the household wealth as Group B per capita, are more likely to be arrested for committing the same crimes, receive harsher sentences for the same convictions, are much less likely to receive callbacks for job interviews, less likely to be hired for jobs they are equally qualified for, less likely to be approved for mortgages, less likely to be rented to, their dialect is considered linguistically inferior to Group A&#x27;s, they are less likely to be picked up by a cab, and their children are even disciplined more harshly in fricking kindergarten.<p>Can you not understand how Group B isn&#x27;t thrilled with the status quo with Group A&#x27;s insistence that &quot;they can&#x27;t see color.&quot;<p>&gt;something that you&#x27;re accusing the &quot;rednecks&quot; of attempting to do.<p>1. They don&#x27;t need to change laws to take race into account, because the system already does that for them.<p>2. Every single Trump supporting &quot;redneck&quot; I know supported the Muslim ban. And nearly every single Trump supporting &quot;redneck&quot; I know supported requiring Muslims to register with the government for tracking. According to survey&#x27;s about 10% of them don&#x27;t approve of mixed race marriages. And I guarantee from personal experience that the real number is much higher than that.<p>The only reason they don&#x27;t get to enact the laws they want to, and the only reason they are afraid to publicly espouse their racist beliefs is because of the hard work of those left leaning Americans you despise.<p>Those left leaning American&#x27;s you hate so much are the only reason most non white immigrants are even allowed to be in this country in the first place. The majority of my family doesn&#x27;t even support birthright citizenship and would remove any non white citizens who&#x27;s parents haven&#x27;t been in this country more than a few generations if they could.')
