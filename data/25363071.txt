It really does get tiring. Its as if we in the US are all Sports Fans rooting for The Home Team without regard to inconvenient facts or anything that challenges the outcome desired. America is in a sad state for sure.<p>&quot;What if the tables were turned?&quot; - Is it really a &quot;What If&quot; kind of question?

Now the tables are turned and the formerly accused party is claiming the other one rigged the election.<p>4 years ago one party went with a Boogey Man kind of narrative where a nebulous and hostile foreign power used untold influences and means to change the course of the election.<p>Today one party is going with the narrative that laws were broken regarding the conduct of elections.<p>These 2 things are similar but I put forth the idea they are not exactly the same.

Im open to reading up if anyone cares to drop a relevant link or two.')
