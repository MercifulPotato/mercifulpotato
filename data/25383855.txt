They depend on AMD&#x2F;Intel to deliver. This is a massive dependency for Microsoft. Are there other large corporations have this big of a dependency?<p>I understand that Microsoft&#x27;s revenue is shifting towards cloud, services, etc. But I think Windows is still &quot;the&quot; key to a lot of those offerings. Take a massive chunk of market share from Windows and I&#x27;m pretty much sure all those services will have a hit too.<p>What are their options?')
