Sorry for the novice question but I checked the docs and FAQ and didn’t see an answer:<p>Can you explain a bit the dynamics of streaming from your own server?  How does bandwidth &#x2F; broadcast work?  Do you need enough upstream bandwidth to support (Stream bitrate * # of clients)?  Or is there a broadcast protocol that takes advantage of a CDN?  My understanding of the commercial services is that their value isn’t just in providing a server, but it’s the huge amount of bandwidth required to support N simultaneous high bitrate streams.  But maybe I have a misunderstanding.<p>Thanks!')
