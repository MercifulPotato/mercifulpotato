Item(by='natch', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611819184, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25930674, text='I have made a point of trying other networks and they definitely don&#x27;t hold a candle to the Supercharger network ease of use, simplicity, speed, coverage, etc.<p>There are some really choice UI travesties on display in some of the non-Tesla chargers.<p>* Buttons that appear on screen and pulsate enticingly, but even though it&#x27;s a touch screen, you discover later that you were supposed to press the corresponding hardware button below the screen, not the button shown on the screen, but there&#x27;s no instruction to that effect.<p>* Laggy buttons that seem to not respond, then react later and draw a new button in the same place, with a different action, just as your finger comes down and taps intending to try again with the button that just disappeared.<p>* The UI leads you through an entire flow (Electrify America) on the hardware, and then at the end it says &quot;please unplug and start over then plug in again&quot; where other stations are &quot;please plug in first and then start on the UI&quot;.<p>* Or you have an account already with a linked credit card and you swipe your phone, and the station shows on the screen that it recognizes your account, and you go through the entire flow and it says at the end: &quot;Sorry, this station can only be enabled through the app.&quot; Please use the app to start the charging. Dude, I just swiped my phone and it has the app right here and the screen told me to proceed on the charger station screen.<p>To be fair, once you get through this rigamarole a couple times and learn the quirks, most people can use the system, and these third party chargers have sometimes been really useful. But yeah one is thankful to have more options than just those bad ones.<p>By contrast, Tesla charging is you take the plug off the holder and plug it in. Done.<p>Still it&#x27;s nice to have the other chargers around. Like free slow charging at Target… if I spend 30 minutes there, I get 12 miles or so, sure, I&#x27;ll take it.<p>When choosing an EV you should look at the Venn diagram of what chargers will be available to you, and choose one that has the best options… Tesla is firmly on top in such a comparison, with essentially a superset of almost all charger types and locations open for use. Would love to see them start selling a Tesla CCS adapter too but that would be almost an embarrassment of options.')
