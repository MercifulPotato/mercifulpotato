If it gets sufficiently cold (-40 in my experience, different brands and seal materials may vary), the rubber seals on the pump can freeze to the point where they stop sealing completely and can&#x27;t hold pressure.<p>Since it&#x27;s a non-evaporating fuel (especially at -40), you won&#x27;t lose fuel, but you have to warm the seals back up before they&#x27;ll light.')
