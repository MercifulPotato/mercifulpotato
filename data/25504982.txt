Recently after George Floyd&#x27;s death and the mainstreaming of Black Lives Matter, I told my wife that I don&#x27;t have the energy to get involved - though I did participate in several marches with my kids (more for them than me or black people - because I&#x27;m convinced of the impact). I applaud those doing impactful work .... and perhaps my focus on making an impact had impact which I did not see. I hope it did.')
