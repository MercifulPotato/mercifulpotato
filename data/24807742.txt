The Assistant Treasurer is married to the partner at Deloitte who they give out their finance consulting work and she just so happened to increase the number of consultants there by 3-4x. Saw similar stuff at other departments. The people who were from or affiliated with a consulting firm would route work to those firms to cover for them. All the consultants I ever worked with were pretty useless anyways, just always felt like we were training some recent college grad.')
