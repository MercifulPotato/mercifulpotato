I am ashamed to say, but I was somewhat ignorant to issues of accessibility, and not just for those in wheelchairs.<p>A partially sighted friend asked me; &quot;do you think I&#x27;d be able to walk that trail?&quot; Despite it being somewhat technical, I didn&#x27;t fully grasp his limitations. Long story short, it was a bit of a disaster when we tried it together.<p>We&#x27;re in the middle of working on projects using panoramic imagery + computer vision + OSM to grade UK trails and their accessibility. The idea being show, don&#x27;t tell.<p>I&#x27;m going to send an email via your contact form. I would really appreciate the opportunity to ask you a few questions.')
