Overall, I think her opinions, though strong, make a lot of sense and urge one to consider our present treatment of survivors of tragedies, as a society.<p>This article was the first time I ever encountered the view that it is impertinent to ask the survivors of a tragedy to forgive because people generally want redemption and positivity. It also makes sense to me that as a society, we expect too much from survivors of tragedies; we expect them to be more moral but they have every reason to be less so.')
