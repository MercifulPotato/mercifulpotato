I tried to play TribalWars. I remember playing this game a decade ago. It was fun. Stil it. There are so many things that could be done with 2 clicks, instead of 10. But, hey, they can be! As long as you buy&#x2F;spend &quot;premium points&quot;. I deleted my account after two weeks playing 30mins per day. To grow further I would either have to spend 1h per day (then 2h, 3h, and so on) or buy the click-reducers.

There are plenty of discussions in HN about &quot;setting the correct price&quot;. That sweet spot that will yield YOU (the maker) the most profit. You don&#x27;t want 1bn customers giving you $1.
