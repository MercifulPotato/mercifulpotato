Item(by='jedberg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605891274, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25159689, text='One of my friends works for Wish, so I hate to rant on them, but I&#x27;ve never had a good experience with them.  I&#x27;ve bought two items from Wish now.<p>One of them took about six weeks to arrive, after it was promised to arrive in three.   When it arrived broken, I was told there was nothing I could do because I was outside the return window.   It was a strip of LED lights, and only the blue lights worked beyond the first section.<p>The second item was also promised in three weeks, but took nine to arrive, which was sad because it was a gift for my wife&#x27;s birthday, which came many weeks after her birthday.  The item was one of those white void photo boxes with a strip of LED lights.  It worked well enough for about three uses and then the USB connector broke right off.  So it&#x27;s now just a useless white plastic box.<p>So yeah, I&#x27;ll probably never order from them again.')
