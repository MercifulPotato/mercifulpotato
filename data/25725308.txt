I don&#x27;t accept that a country having a spy ring is a credible reason to have bad relations with them.<p>And if there are worries about division between US citizens, possibly Amazon, Apple and Google need to be probed for Russian connections. Suppressing the speech of the sitting president is going to be quite divisive and makes the democratic process look extremely unreliable.<p>There is no reason to be concerned if people have connections to Russia is the point here.
