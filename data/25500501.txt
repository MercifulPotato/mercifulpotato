It seizes on problems with two reviews, and seems premised on the idea that &quot;I know my product is flawless, so the problem for any reviews that are less than 5 stars must be with the reviewer.&quot;<p>(The case doesn&#x27;t seem very clearly made—despite the highlighted policy—for why it should be inappropriate for someone to write about their observations of someone else&#x27;s experience with the product, only why it would be inappropriate to write &quot;I hear lots of people don&#x27;t like this&quot; or similar.  Also, the complaint about reviewers leaping to judgements is surely accurate, but more a problem with (at least non-expert) reviewing in general than with this particular program.)')
