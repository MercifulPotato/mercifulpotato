Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25381643], score=None, time=1607650255, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25381181, text='&gt; Illegal immigration is very easy to solve: You have all workers register with the government, you then put big fines (and jail) for those who hire non-registered people.<p>That doesn’t solve illegal immigration, it just promotes illegal documentation forgery and illegal under-the-table employment on top of illegal immigration.<p>OTOH, illegal immigration <i>is</i> easy to solve, you first align the numerical limits of your immigration system with demand by retaining only in-total and not per-country caps, and then, if you want a more complete solution, you make those caps soft caps instead of hard caps by allowing supernumerary immigrants that would be qualified but for numerical limits to temporarily reside while waiting in line for a regular slot (or just bypass the line entirely) by paying an annual (or, for the bypass mechanism, larger one-time) impact fee to address expected social costs.<p>Now, the problem is that many people who say they want to “solve” illegal immigration <i>don’t</i> want to solve illegal immigration, they want to limit total immigration and, particularly, limit immigration of certain nationalities for which there is high immigration demand, and are using “illegality” as a cover.')
