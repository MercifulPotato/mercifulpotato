Ballpark estimate: neutrons are 50e3 times smaller, but we need 5x and of them, so dark matter is 10e3 slower at forming disks.<p>In this model, neutrons aren&#x27;t decaying: dark matter consists of &quot;stable neutrons&quot; that have a different quark structure, but are very similar to regular neutrons in all other aspects: no electric charge and a small magnetic moment.<p>I don&#x27;t think we need to explain everything before testing this hypothesis. Launching a sat to the supposed dark halo responsible for the flyby anomaly seems a relatively trivial task these days.')
