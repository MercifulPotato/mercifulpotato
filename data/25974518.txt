Recent example of local government passing laws to support groups and Organization who kill people who eat beef, another example of people of different religion marrying needs approval from state government (calling it law against love jihad). Not sure what is Stone Age medieval.<p>If you want to repeal laws in India, first study them. India has Hindu marriage act too, especially designed for Hindu undivided family with similar inconsistency.<p>In India a Muslim woman can choose special marriage act [1], where triple talaq is inapplicable. It’s not for you or majority to decide how that community should live.<p>If woman are unhappy with unjust law let them as community fight it. You don’t have to force your views or your self-righteous way for them.<p>Indeed the funny part is the woman of that very community you try to help, despise the current Indian government. If the purpose of the change was to help that community there will be some support, but indeed there is complete opposition.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Special_Marriage_Act,_1954" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Special_Marriage_Act,_1954</a>')
