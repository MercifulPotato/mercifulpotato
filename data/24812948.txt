But they can and often are taught how to behave &quot;normally&quot;–sure, it may not be their &quot;true nature&quot; or whatever to care for others, but if they&#x27;re trying their best to emulate it and end up doing the same things that a normal person would as a result what is there to judge?<p>Actually, taking a step back: your comment horrifies me. It&#x27;s coherently worded and looks similar the other comments in this thread on the surface, but you are very clearly advocating for the author and people like her to be locked up; calling this you&#x27;re calling this wife a danger to her husband, this mother of a family a menace to society. This is a woman who took the time and courage to write about how she maintains a fairly normal life with a highly stigmatized psychological condition (often eliciting the very reaction you&#x27;ve had in your comment–&quot;pure, unnatural evil&quot;) using words that I know if directed at me would make me fear for my very existence. I read comments every day that violate the Hacker News guidelines (&quot;lol the author of this post is dumb&quot;, &quot;the Clintons were behind 9&#x2F;11&quot;) and it&#x27;s usually easy to tell because they stand out as being gross violations that nobody is going to take seriously. But this…the conviction with which you say these words that I don&#x27;t think I could make any more discriminatory…is what astounds me. I am honestly struggling for words to describe how wrong your comment feels.')
