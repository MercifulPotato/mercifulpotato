Generally, this crate&#x27;s types aree re-exported from the  main framework so you can avoid adding extra dependencies to your application, but AFAIK the compiler can &quot;see through&quot; the type alias to see that the types are the same.<p>I think the older generations of web frameworks (like Iron, Nickel, and Gotham) might not have leveraaged the http crate, so your point still stands.')
