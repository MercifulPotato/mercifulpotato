I&#x27;ve recently considered what it would be like to start a company of my own.  This would require depending on many new people as well as many new people depending on me. Each new person, (say, a co-founder) is taking a risk by working with me, as my mental&#x2F;emotional issues can, and perhaps will, make me a poor decision maker and even (irrationally) emotionally abusive at times.<p>Is it even possible? If so, is it worth it? Obviously there&#x27;s a spectrum of issues here so please feel free to be vague if you&#x27;re not comfortable in sharing your specific circumstances.<p>Career programmers, too - what has been your experience with employment and mental health?<p>Just a note: I see a lot of people on these types of threads try to suggest just general mental health solutions they&#x27;ve had success with. While I&#x27;m ecstatic you may have found something which worked for you, I&#x27;m more interested in experiences from people who continue to deal with mental illness.')
