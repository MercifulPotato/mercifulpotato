My first computer used Win95 and I didn&#x27;t get into CLI until college and then seriously at work. I&#x27;m not a Unix expert, but am blown away by how much more powerful it is than Windows in many uses. I even push files to a Linux server for analysis at times as I can tear through a file with grep&#x2F;cut&#x2F;awk&#x2F;sort&#x2F;uniq and some pipes very quickly and efficiently. There are many other technologies I know, yet the simple terminal is still the best approach for many of my uses. The design has stood the test of time for a reason and the compositional approach is nice. Nobody is gatekeeping here.')
