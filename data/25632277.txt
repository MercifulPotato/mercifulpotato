In this case half the carbon in the styrofoam is released by the mealworms as CO2. If we can delay that a few decades why wouldn&#x27;t we? Also re-use doesn&#x27;t preclude eventual reduction, and by delaying it we may also be able to take advantage of more advanced reduction options. I think we need to look at these things on a case by case basis.')
