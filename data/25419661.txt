It could be this leaked password was how their supply chain got compromised, it might not be.<p>Just anecdotally I&#x27;m looking at my own release infrastructure and it would take a bit more work to get compromised binaries to our customers than a leaked secret in a public git repo - and if it <i>was</i> reported that we leaked some key or password that gave the keys of the kingdom away, it would be trivial to change it and verify that we didn&#x27;t push malware.<p>This article can explain how malware made it into a download server, maybe. But does it explain the fact the malware was signed? Maybe, but that suggests a bigger fuck up than leaking a password.')
