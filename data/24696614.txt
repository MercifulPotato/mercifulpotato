Let S be the set of members of X who are NOT m or descendants of m. Let S&#x27; be S plus all ancestors of members of S. Since X is ancestrally closed, S&#x27; is a subset of X. S&#x27; is ancestrally closed by construction. S&#x27; does not contain m, so S&#x27; is a strict subset of X. Therefore, since X is as small as possible with properties (i) and (ii), it follows that S&#x27; must be finite (otherwise S&#x27; would be a strict subset of X with properties i and ii). Thus S is finite, proving the theorem, QED.<p>Here is the paper, it has many other fun results like that: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1201.2869.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1201.2869.pdf</a>')
