Perhaps the title should reflect it&#x27;s over money laundering, not content of Epik&#x27;s clients.<p>Anyone who has read stories of or dealt with Paypal before knows they will cut off access if they even  have an inkling of illegal activity happening. Their relationship with the banks and payment processors depends on it. So it&#x27;s no surprise Epik advertising tax evasion using Paypal would get them terminated.<p>Epik doesn&#x27;t really help their case with the response letter, it&#x27;s written in a unhinged fashion without any substantiation of their claims of censorship by &quot;Paypal executives&quot;.')
