Here’s the methodology:<p>&gt; The statin study, which took place at Hammersmith Hospital, focused on 60 patients who had all come off the drugs in the past due to severe side effects.\nThey were given 12 bottles - four contained a month&#x27;s worth of statins, four a month&#x27;s worth of dummy pills and four were empty.\nEvery day for a year they would score, from zero to 100, how bad their symptoms were.\nThe study showed an average score of:\n8 in those taking no tablets\n15.4 while taking dummy pills\n16.3 while taking statins<p>&gt; The Imperial researchers said 90% of the severity of their symptoms was present when the volunteers were taking dummy pills they thought could be a statin.<p>Why is this “utter bullshit”?
