Item(by='simonh', descendants=None, kids=[25688116, 25686674], score=None, time=1610122500, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25685811, text='Ansiminic (1969) is really interesting.<p>Section 4(4) of the Foreign Compensation Act 1950 stated: “The determination by the commission of any application made to them under this Act shall not be called into question in any court of law”<p>However the House of Lords determined that the ouster clause exempting the determination from legal review did not apply, as there was no valid determination in the first place.<p>So essentially if the tribunal were to make a determination consistent with the law then yes that wouldn&#x27;t be subject to judicial review, but if they make an error of law then their determination is not valid and therefore is subject to review. Take that, parliamentary overreach!')
