It has benefits over normal audio and video calls: people can naturally cluster to have separate conversations and move between groups as in real life, there&#x27;s the body language (hands and head positions are tracked and visible to other people) that make it easier to see who is paying attention to who, and the sense of presence given by VR makes your mind feel more involved in the social situation. I really think this is something that VR legitimately does better than traditional computer interfaces.<p>So if there are development or work scenarios where VR is beneficial, the benefit could come from VR being better for realtime collaboration between people in some scenarios.')
