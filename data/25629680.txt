It is a curated list of relevant points to formulate a strong argument why one should receive the same or perhaps an even better pay for the same work carried out from a remote position.<p>I think this article would be more helpful when negotiating if it also included the arguments from the <i>employers</i> point of view and how to respond to those. The most important point being: &quot;The market price for developers in your situation&#x2F;area is X&quot;.<p>I also find the argumentation a bit inconsistent: The first section is &quot;Same value, same pay&quot;, but then later it is &quot;Higher cost, higher pay&quot;. Now what is it? Is your pay determined by the value you provide or the cost you have? Or is it a combination? If so, how do you balance it? Should &quot;Lower cost&quot; (e.g. no longer paying for commute) also lead to &quot;lower pay&quot;?')
