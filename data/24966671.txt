But the recent cut to 400 pipeline minutes on GitLab CI might make it less attractive than Travis CI, even after the current change.<p>EDIT: Travis seems to take 10 credits per minute, with 1000 free credits per month. So it seems to be the least generous tool with 100 minutes per month vs 400 (GitLab CI) and 2000 (GitHub Actions).')
