It was tedious to track and search recipes, especially those in my own diet; most of them were for Western diets and had things like flaxseed and olive oil, which were not readily available here.<p>At the same time I was working on an app to compare grocery prices in stores in the area. So I set up a system to input recipes, generate a shopping list, and compare prices or generate an algorithm which supermarkets to buy at.<p>The grocery price comparison app was a flop - gov didn&#x27;t like it and the result was that most stores were about the same prices, because some would sell different prices expensive and cheap, and some things like fruit might seem really cheap but were also low quality. I released the recipe app to Facebook, and it really took off.<p>It turned into a startup, where we&#x27;d monetize by selling ingredients for the recipes. It got lots of users, at about 3 cents per paying user, and after a year, we sold it off as a marketing channel for someone whose main focus was selling weight loss ingredients.')
