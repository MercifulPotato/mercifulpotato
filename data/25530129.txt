Since when did a table contribute to the richness of an application? Most modern sites are built with divs and remain inaccessible.<p>Tables simplify the code for simple content placement. That&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s only one of a long list of requirements to satisfy all sorts of requirements including screen reader compatibility. And if one were to use tables, it&#x27;s only one of a long list of hacks and non-hacks that would break screen readers.<p>The root of the problem is with web designers not prioritizing accessibility-friendliness in their sites to begin with, for the basic reason that it prevents them from building the site that they need to build. And &quot;what breaks or doesn&#x27;t break accessibility&quot; is not part of the spec description and is not enforced technically. We get recommendations, but it&#x27;s up to us to test everything against everything else and compromise. Not just with accessibility but with everything else as well including backwards compatibility.')
