And the battery is only engaged when accelerating or braking. The car runs mostly on the fuel cell in steady state operation.<p>Those are just assumptions. There&#x27;s no reason why you can&#x27;t you reduce them to the point where they are non-factors. It&#x27;s possible they go away completely, for instance if you use thermochemical production of hydrogen or store hydrogen in metal hydrides.<p>As I said previously, you don&#x27;t need to perfectly match batteries on efficiency. If fuel cells get close to batteries, it&#x27;s enough for them to succeed. The rest can be made up by a combination of lower upfront costs and light weighting.')
