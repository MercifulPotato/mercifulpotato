But the average case is it&#x27;s catching intentional bad actors (or even unintentional bad actors that could harm the Chrome user), and Google isn&#x27;t going to refrain from releasing the entire product because some businesses could get hit by false positives. They&#x27;d much rather release the service and then tune to minimize the false positives.<p>To my mind, one of the big questions about mega corporations in the internet service space is whether this criterion for determining what can be launched is sufficient. It&#x27;s certainly not the only criterion possible---contrast the standard for us criminal trial, which attempts to evaluate &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; (i.e. tuned to be tolerant of false negatives in the hope of minimizing false positives). But Google&#x27;s criterion is unlikely to change without outside influence, because on average, companies that use this criterion will get product to market faster than companies that play more conservatively.')
