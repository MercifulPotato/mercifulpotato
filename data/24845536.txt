It generates a slim interface from the database schema. For the simple run off the mill things you get an easy interface to get certain rows of a table or load related data, which is a huge part of what you will need when writing GraphQL resolvers. We extended the idea to generate simple wrappers for creating and updating tables as well, if anyone is interested in that I may dump the code for that in some gist.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gajus&#x2F;postloader" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gajus&#x2F;postloader</a>')
