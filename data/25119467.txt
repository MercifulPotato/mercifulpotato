The investments have yielded great dividends.<p>That said, it&#x27;s still a powder keg: there are minor bust ups between Muslim Brotherhood and Israeli soldiers etc. at the border, every example has the opportunity to blow up into something much more. Thankfully, the US has a lot of influence in Egypt and can keep things under wraps.<p>And though the US is less dependent on Oil from Saudi Arabia, it still is to some extent, moreover, keeping the oil flowing is good for the world economy, and much better in those terms than were Saudi Arabia to be taken by China or Russia etc. which is why that pact continues.<p>It will be this way for a few generations yet.')
