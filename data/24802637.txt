Managers are often involved with architecture&#x2F;design decisions, resolving internal disagreements about technical matters, improving dev processes, negotiating with PMs to translate product requirements into concrete engineering tasks, etc.<p>These are all things a senior IC should be doing as well, and as a manager these are the kinds of things you can and should start having your team replace you on if they&#x27;re up for it.<p>And then of course, some of your ICs likely do want to transition to the manager path. So you can involve them in hiring conversations, phone screens, conversations about team mandate&#x2F;goals, team structure and head count, etc.')
