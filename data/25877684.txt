If left in peace at sufficiently high altitude it would look the same in a million years.<p>My bet is the issue is most likely stresses due to vibrations under pressure and pressure changes. It is complex but also well known problem. As the astro&#x2F;kosmonauts move about the station, resupply dock, pressure changes, etc. some parts are being subject to constantly changing stresses while already being stressed due to pressure.<p>It might also be possible that there are some additional thermal stresses but I think it is less likely these are source of the problem.')
