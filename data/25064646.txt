We use Hashicorp&#x27;s Consul to push config changes to running systems, but we sync it from a repo using an internal git2consul type thing.<p>It&#x27;s nice to be able to push things into the system while it&#x27;s running without hopping through all the hoops of qa, staging, etc. We then usually move it into the applications base configs in the app repo if it&#x27;s going to stick around for more than a day or two to keep things tidy.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with a service to push config into a system at run-time, and you don&#x27;t have to throwaway the benefits of the git history.')
