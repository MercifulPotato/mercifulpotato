We all railed on Microsoft when Clippy would patronizingly pop up to try and help you write a letter but think we have improved service when we search for one thing and have it show up a number of competing products.<p>Sorry for being all over the place, I agree that we should be showing people what they ask for but also think that is as far as it need to go.
