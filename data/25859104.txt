If a meteor hits our planet, we are basically done. And even if that doesn&#x27;t happen, we can only acquire raw materials and energy from our own planet, so we may basically just tap out all our resources before we learn to acquire it from somewhere else.<p>And then there is the fact that we love blowing each other up, which may not be a common trait amongst intelligent species.')
