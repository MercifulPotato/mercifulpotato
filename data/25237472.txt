Thanks for creating it :)<p>A minor bit of feedback on the webpage: I spent a while looking for a link to an example presentation, but couldn&#x27;t find one. I eventually realised that the entire top section is an example presentation. This is so cool!! I wonder if adding some text next to the arrow (&quot;Try the demo&quot;, or similar?) might help people find it? The demo is so nice, it would be a shame if some users don&#x27;t spot it.')
