Item(by='joseluisq', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604429152, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24979578, text='&gt; Initially, I expected to go to Rust. Rust has excellent tooling, great libraries, a delightful community, etc. But after spending about a month on it, I can&#x27;t say I like writing Rust. Especially, I don&#x27;t like writing async code in Rust. I like a nice high level language, and that&#x27;s kinda what you need when you have a project as big as Dark to build. And Rust is not that. I&#x27;ll publish &quot;Why Dark didn&#x27;t choose Rust&quot; next.<p>I&#x27;m interested in the next post of the author elaborating a bit more why Rust wasn&#x27;t an option here.\nAs I understood, the author has just discarded Rust because wants a &quot;nice high level language&quot; (aside async writing) which is something relative IMO.')
