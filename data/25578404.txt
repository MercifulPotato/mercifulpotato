Who has the discipline to read each packet Visa sends you every few months and re-opt out each and every time? Out of pure attrition, I&#x27;m guessing 99% of their customers will eventually be &quot;opt-in&quot;.<p>Besides, considering that Visa, Mastercard, etc are all headed toward &quot;data and AI&quot; model, it&#x27;s not going to matter ultimately.
