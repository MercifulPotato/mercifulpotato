If so, what do you use instead of email for an open source project these days?<p>If your answer is Slack, someone like me is not going to get involved, because I find Slack disastrously clunky and I can&#x27;t archive and search it the way that happens automatically with email, nor can I get sensible notifications from it about specific things I&#x27;m interested in when someone brings them up.<p>I am subscribed to a bunch of Slack channels (e.g. for Rust &amp; Go), and it&#x27;s just so much of a pain I found I ended up not bothering to open it most days, so I just drop in occasionally to have a look.  That&#x27;s fine as long as the community doesn&#x27;t care about me of course, but presumably open source project growth is affected by that sort of thing.')
