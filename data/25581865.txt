Corn producers do not need HFCS to stay in business, they have ethanol when they need a subsidy; less than 5% of US production goes to HFCS, but the rest is basically split 50&#x2F;50 between animal feed and ethanol.<p>Sugar imports are taxed so that US producers (cane in FL &amp; LA, sugar beets in the upper midwest and upper great plains states) do not have to compete with cane sugar from Brazil and Mexico.  It is as simple as that.')
