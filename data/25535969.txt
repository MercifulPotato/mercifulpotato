You would have to prove that it is impossible to come up with a set of mechanical conventions to suit the model that doesn’t contain a contradiction. It seems unlikely that this has been attempted independently by most professional astrophysicists. So ultimately even the most learned rely on consensus more than principle, and their own depth of reasoning may have easily put themselves on the other side of Copernicus’ heresy trial. It’s pretty ridiculous, right? Like, how do you explain why ghosts only come out at night if the sun isn’t chasing them around the earth? Obviously wrong. Stupid heliocentrists.')
