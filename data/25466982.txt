I started playing chess to improve my concentration as a teenager, mostly for the purpose of improving my ability to focus on math. Then I realised that I got better at concentrating at math by... doing math problems instead of wasting my time playing chess.<p>According to Wikipedia: G. H. Hardy described proof by contradiction as &quot;one of a mathematician&#x27;s finest weapons&quot;, saying &quot;It is a far finer gambit than any chess gambit: a chess player may offer the sacrifice of a pawn or even a piece, but a mathematician offers the game.&quot;<p>You don&#x27;t even need to proof theorems in algebraic geometry to start seeing the beauty and power of mathematical thinking. Get a mental arithmetic app on your phone and spend a few months routinely practising some sums. What first appears as a dry activity will soon become a highly personal exercise in creative reasoning, of finding the best way to represent and manipulate with numbers. For example, I solve arithmetic problems visually but my friend works best by reasoning aurally (I don&#x27;t get it either, but seeing as he can multipy two 4 digit numbers in seconds it works for him). I&#x27;ll say that learning to multiplying large numbers in my head has done more for me in terms of mental training than chess has!')
