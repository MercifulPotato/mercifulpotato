It is. It&#x27;s the base standard, the others use the same 10bit dynamic colors range. The 400&#x2F;500&#x2F;600 just refer to the maximum brightness of the display, something that may be a benefit but is not related to whether or not something is &quot;true&quot; HDR. HDR10 is true HDR. All HDR600 etc are also HDR10 with the added benefit of increased brightness.')
