It&#x27;s a cultural issue if people cannot be respectful of their co-workers time.<p>It is very common that if something is important to use important modes of communication such as phone calls.<p>My team for example is very asynchronous because that is our culture. Our team is located all over the country and some people in different parts of the world.
