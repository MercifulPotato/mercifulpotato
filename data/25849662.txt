Granted, wasps will I think always be my favorites for macro photography - there&#x27;s just something about getting to see them so close and in such detail that appeals to me in a way I don&#x27;t quite know how to describe. But I didn&#x27;t have a macro lens for the last significant brood emergence here, back in 2017, and especially after the privations of 2020&#x27;s lockdowns I think I&#x27;ll really enjoy the opportunity to see cicadas in the same kind of detail.')
