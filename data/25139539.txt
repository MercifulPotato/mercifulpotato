Person B doesn&#x27;t even care about the real issues affecting Person C or even the collective as a whole, and every time these issues are talked about Person B interrupts to speak on behalf of Person C or perhaps even accusing Person A (or whomever) of racism&#x2F;sexism&#x2F;etc for bringing up these issues which distract from Person B&#x27;s personal crusade with respect to Person C&#x27;s identity. By all appearances, Person B isn&#x27;t acting in good faith, and his behavior in aggregate is causing a lot of problems and certainly isn&#x27;t advancing his purported goal of &quot;promoting a welcoming environment&quot;.')
