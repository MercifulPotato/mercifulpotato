They use approximately as much disk space as a non-NULL integer column without deduplication, and compress just as well with deduplication. Deduplication is effective because it eliminates per-tuple overhead, so you see most of the benefits even with index tuples that naturally happen to have physically small keys. You&#x27;ll still get up to a 3x decrease in storage overhead for the index provided there is low cardinality data (and not necessarily that low cardinality, ~10 or so tuples per distinct value will get you there).<p>The NULL issue is documented directly -- see the &quot;Note&quot; box here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;devel&#x2F;btree-implementation.html#BTREE-DEDUPLICATION" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;devel&#x2F;btree-implementation.h...</a>')
