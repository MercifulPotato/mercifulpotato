Git was created by Linus in the unexpected free time that this event created; and he mentioned being weary of Mercurial and having adopted this design for Git to remove any ambiguity that they were creating a BitKeeper clone.<p>Incidentally, BitKeeper did demand that its customers not work on Mercurial[1].<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20070929115009&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;article.gmane.org&#x2F;gmane.comp.version-control.mercurial.devel&#x2F;3481" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20070929115009&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;article.gm...</a>')
