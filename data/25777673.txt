Item(by='JeremyNT', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610638960, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25770878, text='&gt; How often do big companies like Apple and Intel succeed in righting a sinking ship though? You canâ€™t keep pointing to the one guy that succeeded.<p>I feel like the view of Intel as a &quot;sinking ship&quot; is an inside-basebally misread of the situation.<p>If you buy a PC or a laptop or a server today, you&#x27;re most likely getting an Intel CPU. It&#x27;s now at least <i>possible</i> to buy AMD in many market segments from major vendors - and of course many of us do - but to the broader consumer and hosting world Intel still dominates.<p>You can look ahead and extrapolate and say &quot;they can&#x27;t compete with TSMC right now, and maybe they&#x27;re going to start falling behind further.&quot; Fair analysis. But they <i>dominate</i> the <i>market</i> to an extent that&#x27;s hard to overstate.<p>Contrast this with between-Jobs-stints Apple, which was a tiny shrinking company with a niche product and no clear strategy.<p>Intel is almost in too-big-to-fail territory. They aren&#x27;t sinking, just because they now have real competition. Yes, they need to do &quot;something&quot; to maintain dominance - but why would you see their situation and conclude they <i>won&#x27;t</i>? The new CEO here is a sign that they see the trouble ahead, and they&#x27;re ready to steer around it.')
