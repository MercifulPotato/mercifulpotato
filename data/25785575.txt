Item(by='presentation', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610672829, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25771862, text='I&#x27;m working remotely for my startup I built in the USA, so I don&#x27;t know personally what it&#x27;s like at companies here per se, but as the other commenter said, wages are considerably lower on average - though I&#x27;ve heard that it&#x27;s generally higher than the wages in Europe. Seems that $40-70k is a fairly normal first job wage for a bootcamper for instance.<p>The culture at companies is extremely dependent on the company - a traditional employer might expect the prototypically Japanese extreme deference&#x2F;obedience to hierarchy, but it also seems that there are plenty of companies that &quot;get it&quot; and don&#x27;t play that game, as well as the full set of FAANGs and foreigner-run companies that follow a totally different set of rules than the old school businesses here; and it&#x27;s also subject to change considerably now that model companies like Toyota are moving to merit- instead of loyalty-based promotions, but that kind of shift takes a long time to take hold.<p>Your job options are much smaller if you don&#x27;t speak Japanese, but jobs exist, I know people who have gotten them, and they tend to be in the international- or international-style companies. Wages for foreigners strangely are generally decently higher than for locals, I hear, even if not knowing Japanese is more of a handicap than a help lol.')
