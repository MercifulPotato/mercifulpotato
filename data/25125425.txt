People who lie tend to get upvoted. People who tell the truth usually get downvoted here.<p>&gt; I’m not lying.<p>You claimed that : &quot;Media barely knew how to report tech at all, and barely knew how to explain what was at risk with Y2K. They mostly reported it as “might be a problem the clock is counting and we shall wait and see”.&quot;<p>That is objectively false.<p>&gt; My personal experience doesn’t match yours.<p>You weren&#x27;t talking about personal experience. You were talking about how the news reported it - objective reality.<p>&quot;Media barely knew how to report tech at all, and barely knew how to explain what was at risk with Y2K. They mostly reported it as “might be a problem the clock is counting and we shall wait and see”.&quot;<p>&gt; What the fuck is wrong with you?<p>No need for this. Why double down instead of admitting that you were wrong?')
