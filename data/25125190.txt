I will read each &#x27;4-6 paragraph heading section&#x27; starting at the end of the chapter and move backwards. Its like a &#x27;bottom up&#x27; approach instead of top down for me.<p>I find concepts are more easily digestible because when they are introduced I already have the &#x27;inner workings&#x27; explained.<p>Anyone else find this strategy helpful?')
