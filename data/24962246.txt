We <i>may</i> not be able to have a fluent conversation, but for most part  we&#x27;ll understand the context and will be able to speak. In fact Hindi dialects change every 100km or so I&#x27;ll say in the Hindi belt.<p>Punjabi, Gujrati, Marathi and others (picking from areas neighboring the Hindi belt) are not dialects, they are languages, even though from that list Gujrati and Marathi use Devnagri script (or very close to it).')
