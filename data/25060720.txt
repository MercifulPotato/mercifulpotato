And I assume itâ€˜s higher outside the US?<p>Imagining a mobile app, adding a 200ms delay to a screen transition that would otherwise not fetch data would not be ok. If it fetches other data, it may be fine. I would rather have the relevant values fetched in the background before they are read.<p>Because of the latency sensitivity I would probably try to hack this together on cloudflare workers+KV if I needed it. I would expect &lt;100ms latency in most cases on that.<p>I think this is a general worthwhile service,  especially the focus on CMS&#x2F;copy over feature flag tools, but low latency would be something I would look for in a feature list.')
