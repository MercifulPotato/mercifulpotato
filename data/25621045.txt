True it may be more like 200-300ms to have the entire thing be 100% complete, but all parts of the page are not of equal importance and holding up the main content while loading the rest isn&#x27;t necessary.<p>If you are doing a full BE render, it&#x27;s still totally possible to hit that 100ms mark, but indeed dramatically more difficult.')
