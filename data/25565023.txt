However it&#x27;s not a habit for me to check these pages before investigating an issue. Many have status notifications via email, slack, etc but I don&#x27;t necessarily have those open while working out of Gitlab.<p>So two questions: (1) Is this a big problem for you, and if so (2) How do you work around or solve it?')
