If you have an interest in fixing problems you should appreciate that people&#x27;s circumstances vary and so will solutions. The parent&#x27;s solution will work for many people in poverty: most poor people are young, and most young people do not have children, so moving to a cheaper locale <i>is</i> in fact viable for many homeless. Also, you don&#x27;t necessarily have to up and leave everything you know; living an hour from the city is often sufficient.')
