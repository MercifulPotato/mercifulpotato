After which we will correct her, &quot;I like her&quot;.<p>She has never heard anyone say &quot;I like she&quot; but she is re-ordering and inventing her own sentences using unspoken rules. (She may have generated that sentence from hearing &quot;where is she?&quot;) She will eventually recognize that some things don&#x27;t sound right, but she is also applying those things that sound right to newly invented sentences using those rules.<p>So in effect, we do seem to be learning rules when first learning to talk, we just are extracting those rules internally and applying them rather than working from a codified set of rules.')
