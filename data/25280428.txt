The sidewalk was completely blocked off, making it difficult for pedestrians to pass.<p>Over a year later, they finally finished construction and the updated building was revealed. They&#x27;d extended the building to take over the sidewalk completely. You&#x27;d think that, if this was intended, then they&#x27;d build a new sidewalk and narrow the car lanes a bit. But, no, pedestrians have to walk into the road to go around this school.<p>This construction was both slow <i>and</i> bad. I admit it&#x27;s not typical: the nearby Holiday Inn went from zero to operational within a few months.')
