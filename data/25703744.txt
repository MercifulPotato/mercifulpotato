And for people with highly-performance-sensitive databases, the read workload has been designed with Postgres efficiency in mind.<p>I&#x27;m hoping pgsink could be a gateway drug to get small companies up and running with a data warehouse. If your datastore of choice is Postgres, it&#x27;s a huge help to replicate everything into an analytics datastore. A similar tool has helped my company extract expensive work out of our primary database, which is super useful for scaling (nevermind the business-intelligence and data-engineering uses!).<p>The project is 90% there, about 10hrs and some testing away from being useable. Once there, I&#x27;ll be hitting up some start-up friends and seeing if they want to give it a whirl.')
