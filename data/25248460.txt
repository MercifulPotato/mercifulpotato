Item(by='robocat', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606687050, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25246898, text='I view many multi-million dollar businesses as economic failures, because too often:<p>(a) owners ignore their opportunity costs (especially prevalent for software engineers that can get a huge salary in a safe job)<p>(b) owners ignore that they need to get extreme returns to cover the large risks that they take of business failure. The standard pass-mark is a 30-times return after 10 years. If one “invests” $y00_000 savings, and one forgoes $x00_000&#x2F;yr salary by quitting work, one needs to get back say a minimum of ten million. (10_000_000 divided by 30 is $330k, which is a surprisingly easy amount to have “spent”, especially due to what one could earn in a boring 9-5 job).<p>Edit: I am ignoring other personal benefits or costs, and only considering a startup from a purely economic POV.')
