There&#x27;s still a long way to go. Jackson&#x27;s efforts with WW1 footage are wonderful, but require too much manual work to be widely applied. That&#x27;s where AI can make a huge difference.<p>People colorize famous photographs and put them on reddit all the time. I bet if they would colorize one frame from each scene in a movie, an AI could use that to colorize the whole scene.<p>Old silent movies would be much more watchable if they were:<p>1. colorized and sharpened<p>2. dubbed instead of using the dialog cards<p>3. add foley sound effects<p>4. add some decent music (not the piano music trying to duplicate the 1925 theater experience)')
