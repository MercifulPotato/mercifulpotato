Any unmoderated space will eventually attract these people.<p>Worse yet, if this behavior goes unchecked it tends to drive the good users away. Decentralized and&#x2F;or unmoderated platforms seem to have a small following of ideologists who will look past the bad content and focus on the good, but the general public isn’t terribly interested in wading through random pornography or worse content just for the sake of being on a decentralized platform.')
