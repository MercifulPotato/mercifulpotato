Item(by='DoreenMichele', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605301420, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25081952, text='It starts off with this extremely neutral and reasonable statement that says nothing about causation:<p><i>Screen time and tobacco smoking were also significantly associated with higher frequency of depressed mood.</i><p>And then goes on to say &quot;We need to limit screen time&quot; which is a baseless conclusion.<p>Smoking is known to mediate depression because of what it does to brain chemistry. One medication that gets prescribed to treat depression has such a strong track record of causing people to stop smoking as a side effect that it now gets prescribed for that purpose.<p>I will agree with commenters here objecting to the framing that &quot;You need to reduce screen time as a means to treat depression.&quot; That assumption is unwarranted and not nuanced.<p>Screen time likely goes up when you are tired and sick. Being tired and sick can help foster depression.<p>The solution in a case like that is not &quot;You need less screen time.&quot; It&#x27;s &quot;You need to get well and better rested.&quot;<p>When I&#x27;m sick and tired, I spend all my time on the computer and&#x2F;or playing games on my phone to keep myself occupied so I don&#x27;t go nuts. Taking away my screen time at such times would be a net harm (yes, I know this for a fact).<p>Granted, I have at times had to make judgment calls about <i>how</i> I spend that time to make sure it&#x27;s constructive and not a bad habit.')
