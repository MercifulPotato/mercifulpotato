Getting a turn to speak becomes very difficult if the speaker doesn&#x27;t provide a reasonable gap to break in to the conversation. You basically just need to push harder on the interruption than they push on continuing to speak. I know it sounds rude, but sometimes you need clarification if you want to have a chance at understanding what the speaker wants to say next. Sometimes you spot a flaw in what they&#x27;ve said and need to interject before they waste 10 minutes talking about something that&#x27;s not going to work. And sometimes you just need to cut someone off to stop them from rambling and repeating the same thing in 5 different ways.<p>While there are non-verbal cues that indicate that you have something to say, my experience with physical meetings is that those cues get completely overlooked anyway.')
