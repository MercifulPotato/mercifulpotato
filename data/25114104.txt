Different people gain and lose weight differently. It&#x27;s that simple. If someone was bad at math, would you say &quot;I don&#x27;t understand why people care so little about learning math&quot;? Of course not. And, the same with obesity, there are a lot of factors. I&#x27;m not saying that it is out of an individual&#x27;s control, just that it is MUCH harder for some people than others. Some thin people may never give a second thought to how much they eat, while some overweight people may think about it constantly and struggle. Also, please keep in mind that the biggest problem obese face is the attitudes of others.<p>I will be shocked if we don&#x27;t (soon) discover that there are environmental&#x2F;chemical factors causing obesity beyond just food choice. For example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;8&#x2F;24&#x2F;9194579&#x2F;obesity-animals" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;8&#x2F;24&#x2F;9194579&#x2F;obesity-animals</a>')
