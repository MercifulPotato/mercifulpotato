Said check-in closes 4 hours before takeoff, and there&#x27;s a 40 Eur fee if you do it at the airport) which the EU had to explicitly ban.<p>Your refund&#x2F;rebooking process may be outright illegal, planning on passengers being unaware of their full rights.<p>In the end, your safety record may not come into play at all: I don&#x27;t care if your planes crash or not, because I&#x27;m never, ever, boarding one again, and neither will anyone who listens to me.')
