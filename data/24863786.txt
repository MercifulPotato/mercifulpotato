We just gave up 2&#x2F;3rds of our office space and are entirely remote. We still have the office mostly as a place that &#x27;anchors&#x27; the company in a legal sense but in the future that might just become a PO box at this rate. Ironically, in November last year we just expanded and then within two months that turned out to be a bad decision. Fortunately I always keep leases short even if that is a bit more expensive per month it gives more flexibility and that has been an asset several times over the last 35 years already.')
