Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=[25130163, 25131465], score=None, time=1605647093, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25128501, text='&gt; fn - by itself not a huge deal, but the list of truncated words that are used frequently is &quot;impl&quot;, &quot;mut&quot; and &quot;pub&quot;. I save some characters (am I really in such a rush?) at the cost of reading this broken English &quot;f-n impl moot pahb&quot;. At least C doesn&#x27;t have that.<p>int and char aren&#x27;t exactly words. And let&#x27;s not forget that a type like &quot;double&quot; makes no sense whatsoever by itself. (It&#x27;s two of something, but two of what? Oh, it&#x27;s &quot;double-precision&quot; floating point! How could I miss that?)<p>Now, let&#x27;s look at C&#x27;s standard library:<p>strcmp, strpbrk, isalnum, ispunct, setjmp, SIGSEGV, SIGFPE (that&#x27;s the divide-by-zero exception, isn&#x27;t it obvious?), SIGABRT<p>Sure seems like C has its own massive issue with &quot;we can&#x27;t let a name be long&quot;<p>&gt; underscores all over the place in the standard library. Even C doesn&#x27;t have that many, mostly in the _r variants that were added.<p>va_arg, FE_DFL_ENV, int32_t, etc. Continue on into most C libraries, and underscores are pretty common because C has no other namespacing mechanism.<p>Syntax is pretty strange in any language if you&#x27;re not used to it. If you&#x27;re comfortable with C, C&#x27;s syntax and spelling quirks don&#x27;t stand out to you.')
