E.g. was it used for dithering in images or games back in the 1990&#x27;s when we were limited to 16-bit or 256-bit color? Or is this something more recently explored in academia or in some niche imaging applications?<p>No need to speak in the past tense!  It is not a &quot;niche&quot; application, either.  Think about it: gray ink is almost never used.  <i>All</i> printing into paper is done by dithering black ink into white paper.  This includes bank notes, passports, product labels, etc.  Besides dithering being used everywhere, it is a very active area of research, both in academia and in industry.  In my lab we have seen a few industrial projects concerning dithering.   It&#x27;s a vast and very beautiful subject.<p>&gt; do you have any links to examples?<p>Take a look here for a couple of examples: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;gabarro.org&#x2F;ccn&#x2F;linear_dithering.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;gabarro.org&#x2F;ccn&#x2F;linear_dithering.html</a>')
