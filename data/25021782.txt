He never said all Mexicans are rapists etc, he was speaking about border security and describing the people illegally entering the country through the Southern Border. One of many soundbites spun into a scandal by the media and used to dehumanize him.<p>His supporters understood what he meant, his detractors took the media spin hook, line, and sinker.')
