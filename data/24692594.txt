Blahyi is a particularly sensationalistic and appalling character who gained infamy in the West thanks to one of VICE News&#x27; earliest documentaries. An interesting story, yes, but also tabloidized by VICE&#x27;s characteristic edginess, and not really a major leader in the Liberian Civil War.<p>Most Americans don&#x27;t know much about Africa, let alone Liberia. Our perceptions about it are often only informed by Nicolas Cage&#x27;s <i>Lord of War</i> and the aforementioned VICE documentary, the latter which has led General Butt Naked to become somewhat of a meme.

It&#x27;s rather unfair to the country to have one of its worst villains from one of its most traumatic eras be Americans&#x27; only impression of it. An unrepresentative association that dishonors a nation.')
