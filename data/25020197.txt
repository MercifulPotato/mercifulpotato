Look forward. Look forward to when you are old; look forward beyond your lifetime; look forward to when this time in history has been forgotten by the cultural memory, to when the transitory arguments of today, this afternoon, or this year, have been forgotten; and ask yourself what kind of world you don&#x27;t want to see, even if it means you ruefully admit it makes things harder now.<p>That introspection has been lost and probably, the human race won&#x27;t survive this period if we don&#x27;t figure it out.')
