If so, the answer is, it would be easier to entirely build a new telco network and new cities than to overhaul the SS7 signalling network.  I would have to write  a book to explain the complexities (technical, bureaucratic, legal challenges).  To sum up, SS7 will probably be with us in its current state long after our great great grand-children.  It is best to just avoid using it if you can.  POTS lines, SMS Text messages currently depend on it, but SMS could be changed to use data only if all the wireless carriers could agree to block SS7 for SMS or tear down their SMS gateways.  There would need to be an agreed upon standard to re-route all the SMS messages.  Landline calls and mobile to landline and mobile carrier to mobile carrier will still use SS7 for the foreseeable future and will always be vulnerable to interception.  Mobile devices would have to solve this with some type of device validation, at least for mobile to mobile calls and home&#x2F;business systems would need to implement that validation.')
