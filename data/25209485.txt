Skill athletes spend hours per day doing what we call &quot;exercise&quot; but which they think of as low-intensity skill work, separate from their physical training.  But even then, their physiques are a reflection of professionalism.  Look at the NFL:  the linemen must burn more calories than the receivers, but the linemen are chubby and the receivers are lean.  So while they&#x27;re all eating a lot compared to a regular person, they&#x27;re not eating some random huge amount; they&#x27;re eating the right diet to support the physique they need for competition, with the support of doctors and nutritional professionals.')
