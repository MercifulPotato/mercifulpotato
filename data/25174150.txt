It&#x27;s happily running (or as happy as OpenStep ever is, its a hair sluggish next to ... basically all of its contemporaries) with full driver support and such.  Current fight is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to believe in netmasks other than 0xffff0000 so it&#x27;s been a little fussy to have connected on my network.<p>I&#x27;ve in particular been looking for some decent serial communication&#x2F;terminal emulation software that actually supports OpenStep on x86 (not just NextStep on black hardware with their various generations of mutant serial ports), I like being able to zmodem files around between vintage machines and kermit is a little cantankerous.')
