From Twilios perspective, providing Twilio&#x27;s core product to Parler isn&#x27;t any different than serving them to other platforms. They have no responsibility or liability. The lack of moderation on Parler is irrelevant when Twilio isn&#x27;t involved with moving that data.<p>For a Saas platform to abruptly cut-up a contract, immediately breaking the authentication mechanism for the site on the other end of the contract, which directly results in a serious data breach for thousands of users (the majority of which have done nothing wrong), because your employees and leadership don&#x27;t like their politics, doesn&#x27;t sound like something that a publicly traded company should engage in.<p>edit: <i>especially</i> once it became obvious that AWS was going to bring the site down just a few hours later. They had a clear route to make their ideological stand <i>and</i> cause no damage by merely waiting 12 hours more.')
