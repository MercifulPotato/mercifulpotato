It&#x27;s 2014-ish, and some LibreSSL people come to you and tell you that you&#x27;re using deprecated API and you need to upgrade for compatibility with LibreSSL.  Sure, it&#x27;s an improvement and maintains compatibility with OpenSSL, so why not.<p>Then OpenSSL 1.1 comes with some more API changes.  You end up adding #if conditions to support both OpenSSL versions.  And the next thing you realize, you&#x27;ve just broken LibreSSL because it pretends to be OpenSSL 2.0.0.<p>And when you patch it, you realize you&#x27;re adding another ticking time bomb because LibreSSL will probably support the new API at some point too and you will have to add yet another version check to the code.<p>I am not surprised that somewhere in middle of that process upstreams stop taking LibreSSL seriously.')
