It&#x27;s my first real foray into assembly coding.<p>There are a few aspects of it that I&#x27;m really enjoying:<p>- I can now actually understand the disassembled code that I see during debugging. This includes recognizing some of the assembly patterns that appear because of ABI requirements and&#x2F;or common programming idioms.<p>- I&#x27;m becoming comfortable with a programming idiom that I&#x27;ve never really used in the past: registers, flags, various kinds of memory addressing.<p>- It helps my understanding of compilers&#x27; lower levels &#x2F; backends, and the related problems: register allocation, instruction selection, etc.<p>- It provides a clear path for my first attempt at writing JIT code (using Xbyak[0]).<p>So as Richard Feynman might have said, it&#x27;s great fun!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;herumi&#x2F;xbyak" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;herumi&#x2F;xbyak</a>')
