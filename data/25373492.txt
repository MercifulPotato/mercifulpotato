From the day one, a lot of people from all over the place have been alleging the following thing. They weren&#x27;t able to come any closer than <i>at least</i> 6ft, and if they tried to challenge a ballot, the poll workers would basically scream at them and call 911 or the security. The story is consistent among everyone who&#x27;ve been saying that and the video evidence supports that. The claim has been also repeated on various hearings. I wish I had time to go through all of the thousands of pages of court documents and point you to exact claims, but I unfortunately I have a work too, so if you&#x27;re interested in that, you&#x27;d have to find it on your own. Giuliani said that they have it on sworn affidavits and I don&#x27;t really have any reason to suspect that this is not the case. You can probably find the actual affidavits on the same court cases that Braynard is a part of.<p>Here is one of the videos of poll observers being forced to stay at the 20ft distance. Keep in mind that there are 3 or 4 rows of tables, 20ft is just from the first row.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SOTWqD5fZKo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SOTWqD5fZKo</a><p>Here is just one example of people alleging what I&#x27;ve described on the election night.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=NOS0sLlR-sU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=NOS0sLlR-sU</a><p>Here is the leaked audio from the Detroit poll worker training. Normally it could be dismissed as it has the &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; vibe to it and is hard to watch, but since the story is consistent with the claims above, I found it to be believable. I don&#x27;t know why people do this kind of thing instead of just posting a full, unedited audio, but whatever. I believe there is also an interview with the dude behind the leak on a Youtube channel called &quot;Rekieta Law&quot;, if you&#x27;re interested, but I haven&#x27;t personally listened to it.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IzyLmtjy6sI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IzyLmtjy6sI</a><p>&gt; Well he does keep changing who &quot;his team&quot; is. But the all the Giuliani lawsuits have been thrown out, and all the ones he has tweeted about have been.<p>That might be true, but the vast majority of the lawsuits had nothing to do with Giuliani.<p>&gt; Citation needed. The cases I&#x27;ve read (and yes I&#x27;ve checked because of people like who do the fake lazy &quot;oh I don&#x27;t know but I&#x27;ve heard..&quot;) say the evidence doesn&#x27;t support the claims.<p>Let me correct myself, my understanding is that the Trump team waited a long time to file the lawsuits with actual evidence. Their first lawsuits weren&#x27;t even alleging any sort of fraud or irregularities, but to allow the poll observers within a 6ft distance when challenging the ballots and things like that. Can&#x27;t speak to why were they waiting so long.<p>&gt; Unfortunately this isn&#x27;t true. It&#x27;s already 100% clear what is bullshit, but some people keep claiming otherwise, and will continue to do so for the next 4 years at least.<p>Going back to your previous comment, as far as it would be indeed very annoying, I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s a fair criticism, since we&#x27;ve all heard the Russia collusion allegations for the previous four years. I&#x27;m not saying that you specifically are guilty of this, but still, you can&#x27;t criticize someone for doing that if you did the same thing.<p>Regarding the Nahshon Garrett affidavit, I searched for the `Your ballot was signature verified and counted` string on twitter, and it seems like it means that your vote was indeed counted, so it seems that what Braynard says might actually be true. Which brings me to the same question that you&#x27;ve initially asked me: is there anything that would convince <i>you</i> that some of these claims are true?')
