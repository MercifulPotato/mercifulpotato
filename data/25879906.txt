Vanilla Republican vs Vanilla Democrat = Illusion of Choice,it does not matter who wins, the media wont care  and the status quo will be maintained. Trump vs  Vanilla Democrats = Choice matters, media will align with the Democrats to maintain the status-quo. Vanilla Republicans vs Bernie Sanders, Choice matters, media will align with the Republicans to maintain the status-quo.')
