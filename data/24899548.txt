What they do is almost more insidious, they justify them. They rationalize them. They spin them as something they are not.<p>I&#x27;d rather someone be an open Nazi than to perform their mental gymnastics in public to avoid challenging their world view on something as simple as &quot;mass interment camps are bad.&quot; &quot;Well you see they aren&#x27;t interment camps...they were criminals anyways...how dare you compare a work camp to a death camp?&quot;<p>It&#x27;s sickening, all of it. Your spin of &quot;it&#x27;s not the same as the holocaust&quot; (no one said it is) and &quot;yeah but whatabout the US!&quot; is sadly par for the course.')
