I&#x27;m sure most people here had an experience trying to understand a particularly difficult concept in Math class, staring at the equations spanning many pages, full of Greek symbols, feeling hopeless, only to have it explained by someone in a really intuitive way. When this happened to me I felt a combination of joy and frustration - if only every difficult topic could be presented in such an intuitive, way I could understand everything! Conversely my previous attempts at understanding the sea of Greek symbols on the paper was wasted effort, even after cracking the problem it didn&#x27;t bring me closer to enhancing my understanding.\nThe improvement was not a factor of time investment, or increased intelligence on my part')
