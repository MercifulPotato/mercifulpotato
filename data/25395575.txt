The only thing that remains is to verify the unblinded cases the day they are announced.<p>And not just that but your approval thresholds should already be preset and preregistered, the doses already distributed to point-of-care, and nurses start administering shots the very next day.<p>Yes it’s a big waste of money if it turns out not to work. That’s the whole point.<p>Turns out the vaccine is highly effective 10 days after the first dose. We could have been doing at least a million doses a day since November 19th. Realistically even long before then.')
