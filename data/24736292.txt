Naturally, that would change if enough people started using TOTP, but for now, TOTP is enough to avoid becoming low-hanging fruit.<p>Of course, if you&#x27;re a high-value target or work for a company that&#x27;s likely to be targeted by spear-phishing campaigns, you should be using FIDO2.  (Don&#x27;t target U2F, as there are newer, backward-compatible specifications.)')
