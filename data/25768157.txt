Item(by='watwut', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610573091, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25766142, text='&gt; Wouldn&#x27;t the consequences be doing poorly on future assessments, or otherwise other visible ways of not understanding the material?<p>1.) The younger students are, the less they are able to think far into future. And they are motivated by that far away future even less. It is too distant for them. Even adults have hard time to be motivated by far away vision. Putting things off till last moment is pretty much normal human behavior.<p>2.) Not really if enough students do that. If the teachers are failing everybody, then they will have to adjust expectations. But even if they dont, this means overall less learning on students part and overall ineffective school system.<p>3.) The teachers tends and in fact should to explain things if you did not understood them during individual reading. The flipped classroom is not supposed to have unhelpful unapproachable teacher. Teacher do try to motivate people and help them learn. If teacher theoretically abdicated to this, then yes you have consequence. But, another consequence of having such teacher is that everyone learns less, including those who are disciplined enough to do everything.<p>&gt; The frustrating thing for me as a student was always either (a) when I understood the topic and was bored out of my mind sitting through explanations of it or (b) when I didn&#x27;t understand the material, and was trying to, but the other students in the class&#x2F;room who did understand and were bored were distracting or otherwise soaking up the instructor&#x27;s attention.<p>I dont see how flipped classroom would solve any of these instead of making them worst. There is still a class. The explaining part is the one where you have more of similar speed. The solving exercises is part where differences in speed show up a lot and where other students talking to teacher are preventing focus the most.')
