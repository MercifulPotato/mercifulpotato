If the Bear, Moose, Deer, etc can hear you from a decent distance, they&#x27;ll get well out of your way before you even know they&#x27;re there.<p>I&#x27;ve been camping since before I can remember (literally) and the only &quot;protection&quot; we bring is mace and bear bangers (basically tiny fireworks without the lightshow). We&#x27;ve come across bears a number of times, but <i>never</i> had to use either. Just talk loudly and make some noise, and they just wander away.<p>I think the reason so many attacks happen to hunters is because they&#x27;re trying to be stealthy and end up sneaking up on them (whether on purpose or or not), which is when they are dangerous.')
