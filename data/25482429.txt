If we scaled up New Zealand&#x27;s population to Florida&#x27;s their total COVID-19 fatalities would be about 100. But Florida&#x27;s policy approach has killed over 20 <i>thousand</i> people already, and shows no sign of stopping.<p>You list as a downside of New Zealand&#x27;s approach unemployment. Scaled up, New Zealand would have about 600k unemployed people. But Florida actually has 650k. So that seems like instead of avoid unemployment, an economy devastated by pandemic but unwilling to lockdown has shrunk anyway.<p>So so far your cost is twenty thousand extra friends and relatives dead, and your &quot;benefit&quot; is fifty thousand extra unemployed.<p>Did you actually perform a cost&#x2F;benefit analysis? I don&#x27;t think you did.')
