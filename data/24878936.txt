Item(by='Red_Leaves_Flyy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603544545, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24877819, text='&gt;All I&#x27;m saying is QAnon, if it&#x27;s not a dumb LARP by some teenager, at least doesn&#x27;t set police cruisers on fire and doesn&#x27;t kill people for wearing a hat it doesn&#x27;t like.<p>Bruh what? Qanon has incited <i>a lot</i> of violence. Getting someone to commit acts of violence on your behalf is worse than specific acts of violence by people that choose to do so without provocation. [0].<p>Anyways, comparing qanon, an anonymous conspiratorial propagandist to BLM:<p>&gt;decentralized political and social movement advocating for non-violent civil disobedience in protest against incidents of police brutality and all racially motivated violence against black people. [1]<p>...or antifa, [2]:<p>&gt;an anti-fascist action and left-wing political movement in the United States comprising an array of autonomous groups and individuals that aim to achieve their objectives through the use of both nonviolent and violent direct action rather than through policy reform.<p>...which are basically spontaneously formed groups of people supporting specific political causes...<p><pre><code>  indicates that you do not understand the complexity of events since qanons appearance. yet you speak confidently as if you did and go on to condemn countless millions that support antifa or blm for their tenuous proximal association to anarchists or looters. Such irrational comparisons indicate an emotional response to whatever you perceive antifa and blm to represent.\n</code></pre>\nAntifa and blm protests make specific demands at their demonstrations. Time and time again we see their demonstrations disrupted by radicalized agent provocateurs, opportunists, anarchists and others. Please disambiguate yourself when speaking about millions of people. It&#x27;s easy to say an opportunistic person looting target is blm. Just as easy as it is to say anyone defending qanon, or intimidating voters by playing soldier at polling places is a proud boy&#x2F;Aryan brother&#x2F;whatever racist right wing group is in the news for a hate crime that day.<p>Proud boys, kkk, Aryan Brotherhood and countless others are violent terrorist organizations that have initial ceremonies, membership lists, and responsibilities. Antifa and blm do not. Trump can&#x27;t even condemn white supremacists in the most generic of terms. On top of that he&#x27;s frequently referenced q conspiracies lending whatever credibility you attribute to trump to qanon.<p>The link between trump, qanon, and racist terrorist organizations is stronger than any links between the countless millions of people who fly antifa or blm signs.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;oct&#x2F;15&#x2F;qanon-violence-crimes-timeline" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;oct&#x2F;15&#x2F;qanon-violen...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Black_Lives_Matter" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Black_Lives_Matter</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Antifa_(United_States)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Antifa_(United_States)</a>')
