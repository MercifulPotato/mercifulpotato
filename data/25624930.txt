Clearly on Mac which is a semi open platform (at least more open than iOS) the option to not use the App Store is available. The problem with your argument imo is that it can be extended to iOS where apple has the best hardware and software but force you to use their store. And in this store they abuse developers in a similar manner to what they do here.')
