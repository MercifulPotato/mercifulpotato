Despite that, I own a chainsaw but I&#x27;m very careful how I use it (fortunately I&#x27;ve never had to drop trees the size and excellence of those ones).<p>Still, that&#x27;s an excellent video and I&#x27;ve learned from it.  One of the important points made was the speed of the fall and that the thickest part of the trunk should take the brunt of the felling load, perhaps these points could have been emphasized more.<p>In the video, you will notice in places the log bounces slightly upon impact, these bounces should be kept as small as possible as they can tear the wood if the log hits the ground too hard or in the wrong way that cause the trunk to ripple unduly.  These wood faults are known as felling shakes and they often appear as jagged lines across the grain.  It&#x27;s important to minimize this wherever possible, especially so if the wood is to be used for its structural strength and also where presentation is important (the tear just looks ugly).  Faults caused through felling are well documented in this PDF on pages 26-31 \n<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sefr.org.au&#x2F;FWP%20Damage%20Due%20to%20Mech%20Harvest.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sefr.org.au&#x2F;FWP%20Damage%20Due%20to%20Mech%20Harvest....</a><p>Incidentally, felling faults in Douglas fir&#x2F;Oregon pine aren&#x27;t as common as with some other timbers because of its long straight grain structure which imparts strength (did you notice how wonderfully &#x27;clean&#x27; and uniformly homologous the wood wasâ€”there was not a trace of core rot either).')
