I need less distraction. The latest one is MacOS Big Sur, anytime I open my MBP or actually anytime I step away and comeback it pops up a notification about my &quot;Airpods Nearby&quot; or something like that and if I don&#x27;t respond it will do it again in 10 to 15 minutes (probably lost the signal for a moment)<p>It sounds great but it&#x27;s not. Instead what happens is I see the motion at the top right of the screen and it distracts me, I lose my train of thought. I either have to manually click on it (more distraction) or wait 10-15 seconds for it to go away.<p>It the same with all the ridiculous badges in discourse. There&#x27;s a notification or an unread (3) count and it&#x27;s yet one more thing to distract me. Maybe it&#x27;s a notification of a reply but if it turns out to be a notification of a badge then I&#x27;ve just been distracted and lost my train of thought.<p>We need designers and companies to take an pledge&#x2F;oath to stop trying to distract us.  I get Facebook and Twitter may never do that but I feel like a lot of designers who would just haven&#x27;t yet got the message that they are not helping their users by distracting them.')
