Check out <i>Connections</i> with James Burke, <i>Modern Marvels</i>, and <i>Genius of the Ancient World</i>, for starters.  There&#x27;s another TV series on Netflix that talks about stuff like the development of the bicycle, and the like, but the name escapes me. :(<p>If you&#x27;re in the Bay Area, the Exploratorium and the Computer History Museum might be something you&#x27;d enjoy along these lines.')
