Item(by='AndrewBissell', descendants=None, kids=[24948649], score=None, time=1604101652, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24944483, text='I played and still love many of the LucasArts adventure games: <i>Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road</i>, <i>Day of the Tentacle</i>, <i>Full Throttle</i>, <i>Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis</i>, <i>Grim Fandango</i>. But the game which still holds the biggest emotional resonance for me all these years later is <i>Gabriel Knight II: The Beast Within</i>. Maybe there&#x27;s just something about the full motion video format that allowed me to identify more with the characters or something, but I still find myself replaying scenes from it in my head every now and then. Robert Holmes&#x27;s score added so much to it (and even the non-FMV predecessor) as well.<p>The X-Wing series were definitely hands down the best arcade flight sims though.')
