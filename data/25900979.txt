Every time you engage autopilot, it literally tells you (in bold letters) to &quot;Always Keep Your Hands on the Wheel&quot; and to &quot;Be Prepared to Take Over at Any Time&quot;. Keep abusing it and it will actually disable it for the rest of the drive. Did you know that?<p>There&#x27;s no &quot;impression&quot; being given. Like I mentioned. There will always be a small fraction of irresponsible humans that will do dumb things. No amount of engineering can fix that.<p>Case in point is this video: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;VS5zQKXHdpM?t=88" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;VS5zQKXHdpM?t=88</a> Her mom is even helping this kid film this stupid act just for clout and views.<p>Tesla owners grilled him and said what he&#x27;s doing is dangerous and irresponsible. He then deleted them all and turned off commenting. But people like to demonize Tesla owners. Which I find bizarre.')
