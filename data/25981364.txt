Even when I made the most extreme assumptions it didn&#x27;t change the answer. Just build more housing or stop building too much commercial real estate. That&#x27;s it.<p>The truth is that Californians love expensive housing. They love having lots of jobs that attract people outside their city. They also love yelling at the people they desperately tried to attract. They love homeless people and want to support their drug problems. They never put themselves into the shoe of outsiders or even developers and care about nothing except their own selfish desires. That&#x27;s what true greed looks like. It&#x27;s in plain sight and until that greed is gone nothing will change.')
