After pollination, the flowers of seedless grapes still produce an embryo, but the embryo stops developing when it is very small, and there is no fully formed seed (a process called stenospermocarpy). To grow the offspring of a cross, breeders have to dissect the immature fruit (the flower&#x27;s ovary) and remove the immature embryo. The embryo is then transferred to tissue culture media where it is grown into a plant with roots and leaves that can eventually be transferred to soil.')
