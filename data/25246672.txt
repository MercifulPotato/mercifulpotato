Instead of an environment variable for setting the search path for shared libraries, on the Amiga you would just setup `LIBS:` and an application could find its libraries by opening `LIBS:MyFoo.library`. Similar story for $PATH. Amiga has `PATH:` which &quot;contained&quot; all of the executables in your path. Unlike unix style environment variables, assigns were system wide. (Amiga was a single user system.)')
