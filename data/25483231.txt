This takes hours and hours of their time.<p>They drive buyers around neighborhoods and go with them to see houses.<p>They arrange and attend engineers&#x27; inspections of the house.<p>In the midst of this pandemic these alone are life-threatening tasks.  But even when there&#x27;s no epidemic, real estate agents have to go to strangers&#x27; homes and be there alone, and for women (who make up the majority of real estate agents) this is not always safe.<p>Then they guide and give advice to buyers and sellers.  I guess you could call this &quot;giving information for a fee&quot;, but it&#x27;s not the kind of information that you&#x27;re going to get from a database.  It includes negotiation advice, advice on what kind of offers are or are not likely to be accepted and why, what problems there are with the house and what needs to be done to fix it, etc.  Depending on the agent, that information could be the fruit of decades of experience in the business that the clients are getting.<p>They&#x27;ll also get their clients in touch with reliable professionals who can do the work that their clients require (like fixing some part of the house), etc.<p>They often read over contracts that their clients sign, explain them to them, and advise them regarding them (you&#x27;d think it&#x27;s the lawyers job to do this, but lawyers often don&#x27;t).<p>They often advertise for their sellers... for free.  That means the real estate agents pay advertising fees out of their own pockets, and they don&#x27;t get that money back until and unless the house sells.<p>They also have to put up with asshole buyers and sellers, and clients who lie to them.<p>They take calls at night and on weekends from clients that have absolutely no respect for their time.<p>...and best of all, they often do all the above (which takes a lot of time and effort) <i>completely for free</i>, as many clients will take all these services, advice, and help and then change their mind and not want to buy or sell after all, or change their mind and go with another agent... after using dozens of hours of the real estate agent&#x27;s time, for which the real estate agents don&#x27;t get paid a penny (as they only get paid if the house is sold).<p>Someone very close to me is a real estate agent, and I just constantly feel so bad for them because they&#x27;re constantly getting screwed by their clients and slaving away for absolutely no money.. occasionally they get lucky and actually eventually get paid.. usually after many months of effort, but so much time is wasted for absolutely nothing.<p>And then on top of all that, so many people hate and look down on real estate agents, so they have to put up with that too.<p>Not that it&#x27;s all bad.  Some clients are decent, and even nice people.<p>But I&#x27;d still <i>never</i>, <i>ever</i> want to be a real estate agent and put up with all that shit.  Just not even remotely worth it.')
