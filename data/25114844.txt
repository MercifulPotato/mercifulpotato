Item(by='cogman10', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605549589, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25114531, text='&gt; Basically, you want to eat the stuff our bodies are made of and avoid things it&#x27;s not made of. If it doesn&#x27;t have some function in our cellular processes, it&#x27;s garbage. Avoid processed stuff, stuff full of chemicals and additives.<p>Avoiding &quot;chemicals&quot; is impossible and needs to be stricken from nutritional parlance.  It&#x27;s a useless statement.  Everything is &quot;chemicals&quot;.<p>Beyond that, the fact is that your body can process a BUNCH of stuff.  A bunch of stuff has function in our cellular processes.  For example, Sucrose is used all over the place in our bodies.  It is even highly biologically available.  That doesn&#x27;t mean that drinking pure sugar water is healthy.<p>In fact, one thing that our body can&#x27;t process or use at the cellular level is fiber, yet you advocate that we consume it.<p>This is exactly the sort of statement I&#x27;m talking about when I talk about it being hard for people to grasp dietary health guidelines.  It is filled with pseudo-scientific nonsense.<p>Sorry to come down harshly.  If you want to disprove it, then fill free to give me a definition of &quot;chemicals&quot; or &quot;cellular processes&quot; that doesn&#x27;t make sugar water a health drink.  Please link to any sort of scientific study that uses the terms you just used.  Please avoid linking to blog posts or youtube videos of quacks.')
