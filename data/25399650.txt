The lockdown would be the equivalent of the anti-vaxxers.<p>Thereâ€™s no evidence the mortality rate has actually increased; this was just a thought experiment.<p>In prior pandemics (1918 flu), future strains were more deadly than earlier strains.<p>The nightmare scenario now is that a COVID-20 emerges with a 5% mortality rate instead of 0.5%.  If catching COVID-19 gives you immunity to COVID-20 (and all the vaccines fail), then the lockdown would increase the death toll by 10x.<p>These are all hypotheticals that looked somewhat plausible in April, and implausible today.')
