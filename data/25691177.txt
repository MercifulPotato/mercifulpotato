ESPECIALLY not the older generations. I&#x27;d argue that the majority of people may understand the blue tick, but that _very_ few understand the difference between a single check and a double check.<p>Even the ones who do understand a little about the checks probably don&#x27;t bother thinking about the difference between &quot;sent&quot; and &quot;delivered&quot;. They&#x27;d understand it if it was pointed out to them, they aren&#x27;t stupid. But they don&#x27;t care enough to realize it because they shouldn&#x27;t _need_ to understand it most of the time.<p>And even so, the checkmarks are very subtle and easy to not notice if you don&#x27;t expect to need to look at them. A user is more likely to say &quot;well it didn&#x27;t give me an error so it must have sent, I wonder why nindalf is ghosting me&quot; rather than &quot;huh, I wonder if WhatsApp actually _delivered_ the message to nindalf, let me check&quot;')
