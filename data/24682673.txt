My own therapist even doubts my diagnosis because he doesn&#x27;t believe someone with my disorder should be able to hold down a job.<p>I don&#x27;t bring it up to anyone IRL because I know what people will think of me- a danger to them, subhuman, a monster. I&#x27;m even uncomfortable to be within the spheres of supposedly accepting groups- neurodivergent advocacy groups, mental health advocacy, etc. People with less stigmatized disorders will treat me just as subhuman as a neurotypical.')
