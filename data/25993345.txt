We recently switched to FastAPI from Django rest framework at Etebase[1] and it&#x27;s been an absolute pleasure!<p>P.S, if anyone is interested, it took a bit of hacking, but we managed to get two unusual things working:<p>1. Use MsgPack instead of JSON. It works great and wasn&#x27;t too much of an effort (the existing libraries are done wrong and don&#x27;t work well).<p>2. Use the Django ORM with FastAPI. This was quite hard to do and quite manual as the Django ORM assumes the rest of the Django stack is in use.<p>Etebase is open source[2], so you can just check out how it&#x27;s done if you are interested. I&#x27;m also happy to help if anyone has questions.<p>I really hope we get a good async ORM soon. I&#x27;m currently using SQLAlchemy 1.4b1 in a side project, though the typing (and mypy plugin) are unfortunately not there.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.etebase.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.etebase.com</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;etesync&#x2F;server&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;etesync&#x2F;server&#x2F;</a>')
