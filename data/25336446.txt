There was very little you couldn&#x27;t do that was a result of the tools to build the sites. The only real constraints were imposed by what technologies were in the standards and which were implemented by browsers.<p>If you want to build a website today with what is &#x27;normal&#x27; tech, you have to learn a whole lot more and people spend tremendous amounts of time in bootstrapping code in order to produce some JavaScript and CSS that in the end provides hardly any added value compared to server-side rendered views with sprinkles of JavaScript.<p>Apps like Slack are probably an exception to the server-side rendered argument, but I think you&#x27;d be better off building those in non-web technology to begin with.<p>Either way, if you want to spend your days building layers upon layers of abstractions in order to prevent having to fetch some HTML from the server, be my guest.')
