For every step up those use cases have to be discovered, and it might just be that we haven&#x27;t discovered too many compelling common use cases for gigabit networking. Maybe they don&#x27;t exist, but I would think it&#x27;s more likely they just haven&#x27;t been discovered. At this point it seems a lot of use cases like remote work, collaborative editing, games are more obviously limited by the (often physically unavoidable) latency. Another limiting factor is that it doesn&#x27;t help much to have gigabit networking if either side limits the actual bandwidth used.')
