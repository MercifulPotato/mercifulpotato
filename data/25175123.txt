This isn&#x27;t strictly useful and to non-native english speakers the connection between the offensive meaning and the name would most likely never occur as it&#x27;s use in such is obscure (for one, this is where I first learned of it).<p>Currently there&#x27;s a large number of resources that refer to the program as GIMP which are unlikely to be updated if the name changed and thus making years worth of guides, tutorials, and so on harder to find unless you know to search for (which if you do... the name change is meaningless as you&#x27;ll still see GIMP). Harassing GIMP over the name is hardly a way to get things moving forwards and only sparks a negative environment. Should you find the name to make the software unusable then it would be better to focus your attention on the fork which changes the name rather than continuing to contribute a negative to the positive news of GIMP turning 25.')
