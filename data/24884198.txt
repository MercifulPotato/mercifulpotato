That&#x27;s why, all other things being equal, drunk drivers experience fewer injuries in auto accidents - slower reaction times mean they don&#x27;t react in time to tense up for the crash.<p>Wow, is this true? I&#x27;ve noticed that when small babies are picked up, there&#x27;s a difference in their weight, depending upon whether they want to be picked up or not. Like, by doing something with their body, they are able to make themselves lighter or heavier -- perhaps by clinging more (or less) to the person picking them up, and perhaps by tightening (or loosening) their muscles.<p>I&#x27;m a pilates instructor, if you have any sources that discuss the effect of tense muscles &amp; force, I would really appreciate it. Thanks :)')
