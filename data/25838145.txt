Item(by='toast0', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611086706, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25837895, text='&gt; Most people don&#x27;t realize this but GameStop was actually very bad for console game developers. Games were often resold, with each time no revenue going to the developer. I worked on a popular Xbox &#x2F; PS3 game that was resold like 7-9 times on average. Our marketing people figured that GameStop made a lot more money on the game than the developer.<p>I&#x27;m more willing to pay $X for a game if I know I can probably sell it for $Y when I don&#x27;t want it anymore. Digital store games don&#x27;t have the same value for me, I can&#x27;t sell the games later, and depending on the system, might have a big hassle transferring them to a different system if&#x2F;when the one I have goes south.<p>Book publishers (and authors) don&#x27;t get anything when I buy from a used bookstore, or borrow a book from a friend either. Neither does a cookware manufacturer get anything if I buy used pots and pans from a thrift shop.')
