Step one in doing that is creating an actual space station - not just an orbiting can that a few people can survive in. An actual station with regularly-scheduled flights people can utilize to go to and from the Earth - flights on a craft resembling an airplane and taking off and landing at a place more akin to an airport. Likewise, we need regularly-scheduled flights between the space station and the Moon port. This way we have a steady supply of people and material going to and from the Moon. Once we&#x27;ve gotten to the point where we can demonstrate the viability of a small village on the Moon complete with everything such a village requires, <i>then</i> we can talk about going to Mars.<p>Until then I&#x27;m calling these Mars settlement fantasies head-up-your-arse rubbish! Besides which, who knows? Perhaps after extensive experience living in space and living on the Moon we may decide there are advantages to not wasting your time clinging to rocky planets. Or vice-versa. Or we may discover pros&#x2F;cons to each and which kinds of people or more adaptable to which. As it is we can&#x27;t say anything because we have no real experience living anywhere else but on Earth.')
