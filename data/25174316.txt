Let&#x27;s say now in November everyone gets tested every day, and you have an unbelievable compliance for self quarantining on positive results.  It would never happen, but pretend it&#x27;s 99.9% of people following the rules to &quot;drive the virus towards elimination within weeks&quot;.  Great, now you think you&#x27;ve beaten it back to where it came from.<p>How does this do anything other than reset the clock back to last January just in time for next January?  As soon as everyone lowers their guard and goes back to normal, it&#x27;s going to spread again.  We need immunity from a vaccine or from it running its course to be done with this.<p>What am I missing?  Are we going to setup nationwide contact tracing this time?  Just a few visitors from other countries, and we&#x27;re at it again.')
