They are actually less audible than the disks of my NAS next to it. Admittedly, I am only using about third to half the ports and the load is only moderate most of the times but this setup has been working flawlessly for over a year now.<p>I guess it depends on your workload and the specific hardware involved but using server hardware with quiet fans in a living room environment can certainly be achieved.')
