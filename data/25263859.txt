Landlord asking four your FB account, your employer asking for your linkedin or border-guard asking to show your latest posts. And yes no one forced you to use FB, but life gets more and more inconvenient if you don&#x27;t use them. Hell, bought oculus when it was FB free, and try to use it without FB.')
