I was talking to some absolutely lovely Polish friends of mine one evening, and somehow we were discussing Christmas growing up.  Somehow it came up that many of my childhood friends celebrated Hanukah instead, and the response was a puzzled &quot;You like Jews?  Really?&quot;  After some mentions of typical stereotypes as to why that would be strange, I said that that wasn&#x27;t my experience and changed the subject.<p>From talking to other Polish people, my impression is that this is a fairly typical attitude.  I think that the reason this doesn&#x27;t show up as incidents in the news is simply that there are hardly any Jews in Poland because they were virtually completely wiped out in the Holocaust.')
