I think those are two different topics with some overlap.  Parent engagement in their child&#x27;s education is probably a big factor regardless of home&#x2F;public schooling.  The more engagement, the better the outcome is my guess.<p>From an efficiency perspective, I&#x27;d agree public schools aren&#x27;t efficient on time usage nor are they effective at helping anyone that are outliers - gifted or disadvantaged.  Those things aren&#x27;t their goal though, it is massive public education usually governed by state laws.<p>I think one of the top problems is with families that cannot have kids at home on their own for economic reasons like poor families that have to work outside the home for basic food and shelter.<p>Do you think there are practices done with effective home-schooling that can be used as a seed for larger-scale remote education?')
