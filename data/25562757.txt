Some programmers&#x27; dogs and cats probably have their own lisp implementations as well. This is great, but too often I see people omit some of the obscure but critical features that make lisp uniquely wonderful. These include read macros like #. and backreferences, gensyms, and properly escaped symbol names. If you&#x27;re going to waste everybody&#x27;s time with yet another lisp, at least do it right damnit.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JeffBezanson&#x2F;femtolisp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JeffBezanson&#x2F;femtolisp</a>')
