You are attempting to refute the claim that a human programmer can derive a program that has desired properties more effectively with mathematical reasoning than without it by offering the objection that mechanical verification has high computational complexity[1]. That is sheer nonsense. It&#x27;s like saying that because factoring products of primes is hard that it&#x27;s in no way feasible to multiply them rigorously so just use an estimate instead.<p>As an aside, the avionics for the Space Shuttle was over 250KLOC and was proved correct from the bottom up. And it functioned flawlessly. This was done before computational complexity results on program analysis were known, but that lack of knowledge was observably irrelevant to building correct software. Sadly, the hardware left a bit to be desired.<p>[1] It&#x27;s undecidable in the general case.')
