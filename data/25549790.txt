That’s it. Any claim of knowledge about impact on Rt is simply wild exaggeration of the data.<p>This is a case where if you don’t understand the field, you have no ability to judge the quality of the claim being made. People are irresponsibly reading second-hand sources, and quoting numbers out of context. Other people quote <i>those</i> sources, and before long, the snake is eating its own tail.<p>I would wager that the author of that BMJ piece never even read the presentation I quoted above (even though it’s the cited source by NERVTAG for the “genetic evidence” claim in the brief whitepaper that the authors <i>do</i> cite).<p>This stuff is almost 100% speculation.')
