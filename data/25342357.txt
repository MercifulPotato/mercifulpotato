You&#x27;re defending something like a couple of million people for killing 4510 whales, while vilifying a country of 125 million for killing 2080 whales.<p>So, (a) it makes no difference to the intelligent creatures whether they are killed in the name of &quot;science&quot; or &quot;traditional ways&quot; (b) whales have extensive ranges, so going where they live vs. waiting for them to come to you are both just as bad, and (c) there is enough scientific reason for <i>everyone</i> to stop killing whales.')
