But, as with all things, there&#x27;s &quot;the way you could do things&quot; and &quot;the way you should do things&quot;. Just because you can do manual testing doesn&#x27;t mean you should avoid automated testing. It MAY be useful to do some manual exploration to find suitable test cases, but once found, they should totally be conserved in source.<p>It may also be faster to find an issue in the REPL, using  various tracing tools (&quot;hm, this function returns the wrong thing when I feed it X, let us enable tracing on a few things and see if anything stands out&quot;, followed by &quot;aha, that other function over there is actually the problem, let me add some test cases, so we don&#x27;t have a regression there&quot;).<p>None of these are impossible without a REPL, but may require extensive modification of the source and a recompilation to get the same effect (followed, probably, by either converting your tracing to debug logs, guarded by a verbosity flag, or by painstakingly track down each print and rip it out again).')
