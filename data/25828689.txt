Burn down a federal court? Destroy the police station? Take over capitol building and occupy it for several weeks? Attack an elected official&#x27;s family at their own home because you don&#x27;t like their policies? \nYeah, that happened, but not sure how immersed in QAnon belief system (whatever it is) that was. All I know the democracy survived all that.')
