I searched for a Pakistani song as famous as national anthem (&quot;dil dil Pakistan&quot;). It couldn&#x27;t find it.<p>I was thinking it learns the tune of song and matches with that so language should not matter.<p>It worked for &quot;Desert Rose&quot; though.<p>Edit: Also worked for an Indian song.<p>Also worked for few other recent famous Pakistani songs. I guess the first song that I searched is probably not listened on YouTube as much as its known by heart.<p>It could not search for national anthem itself for the reason.')
