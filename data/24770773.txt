There are real dollar values attached to that.<p>I’m a ‘remote’ worker (I actually live close enough to work in my office but choose not to), and while I don’t get all of the in-office perks, I do get other ones the office workers don’t.  Home office allowance for things like monitors&#x2F;printers&#x2F;desks, ISP and cell phone are covered monthly, I get paid $0.54&#x2F;mi when I do have to go into the office, and I don’t have to go into the office much.<p>All in all, I figure I make out about even on a $$ standpoint, and my lifestyle is much preferable to what I’d have if I had to commute.')
