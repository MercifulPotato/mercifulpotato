Not only a thinker, he may be the single man most responsible for the fall of the USSR.<p>(2) The human institution of the Church, especially where wealthy, is highly corrupt and I say that as a devout Catholic who believes Christ established the Catholic Church as His church (tldr the human &amp; divine Church are separate things).<p>(3) One of the likely reasons that Benedict abdicated was that he did not want to be &quot;taken advantage of&quot; as he saw various Vatican higher-ups do with the aging and frail JPII.<p>(4) JPII sadly dismissed cases of allegations. One thing to keep in mind though is when he was growing up in Nazi and then Soviet occupied Poland he would see the occupying forces falsely accuse &quot;resistance&quot; figures of abuse in order to hobble their reputation.<p>(5) While JPII did make mistakes, it is also my belief that many Vatican figures still-living use him as a scapegoat to hide their own errors. They are doing their best to hide any and all investigation and purely say &quot;this is the fault of people who are now dead.&quot; They do not want any oversight. For example, why did they choose to finally release the long-awaited report on Cardinal McCarrick, the most prominent US abuser, <i>the week of the presidential election in the US</i>?
