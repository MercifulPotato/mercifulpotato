Stylo is also great in Montreal and ships.<p>But you might have a local shop (most cities seem to have at least one -- either catering to artists or catering to the wedding&#x2F;cards types).<p>The Lamy Safari is a great starter but I found the Platinum Plaisir and the cheaper Platinum Preppy to also be great introductions. The Plaisir also comes in finer tips, down to 0.3mm, which helps for those of us with angry writing :) It&#x27;s also quite a bit cheaper, and the piston refill is cheaper.<p>(although these days I just use a syringe to refill as drawing ink up any other way seems to never work right...)')
