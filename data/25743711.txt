From a physicists&#x27; perspective: to develop the language needed to describe&#x2F;express the physics you are experiencing.<p>There is certainly an element of wheel re-invention in first principles thinking, but acquiring maker&#x27;s knowledge seems like a more rewarding endeavour than acquiring only user&#x27;s knowledge.<p>This process of creating new languages&#x2F;jargon has a name in Computer Science: Meta-linguistic abstraction [1], and so the value of Philosophy (to me) is in the first paragraph of the Wikipedia article:<p>&gt;metalinguistic abstraction is the process of solving complex problems by creating a new language or vocabulary to better understand the problem space.<p>And so this I find it fascinating when you say that...<p>&gt;there are certain symmetry groups that seem to apply everywhere we look<p>Because your meta-language for talking about your experiences is the language of symmetry groups.<p>Post-structuralism (and all Philosophy, really) is merely an attempt to escape the reductionist nature of that sort of language-centric thinking - it&#x27;s an attempt to drag us out of the cave of Logocentrism [2]. Mathematics is only up to isomorphism - there&#x27;s nothing in the symbolic denotation without the human connotation, so if structuralism is about symmetry (equalities) , post-structuralism is about asymmetry (inequalities).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Metalinguistic_abstraction" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Metalinguistic_abstraction</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Logocentrism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Logocentrism</a>')
