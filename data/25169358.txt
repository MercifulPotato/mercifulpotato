The longer cut is obviously a more coherent movie, but I find even the theatrical release enjoyable enough.<p>It&#x27;s harsh, dirty, somewhat chaotic, and unapologetically brutal in a way that matches, poetically, the setting.<p>I think it also helps that, despite it being released a few years beforehand, I get a strong Quake (2) vibe from the colour palette and setting of Alien 3, and that serves to further endear it to me.')
