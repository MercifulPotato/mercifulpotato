Honestly I couldn&#x27;t find a better laptop at the time with features that are important to me, but even so it is still a nightmare to use. It runs hot, can&#x27;t play HD videos on YT (Google doesn&#x27;t support hardware decoding in Chrome) and I couldn&#x27;t get NVidia drivers to work properly. I am going to buy a laptop with AMD cpu next year. I hope that if more people do it Dell will finally drop Intel. I cannot support a company that wastes money they are overcharging and not doing any research to improve their products. 5 years or so of the same CPUs just with different packaging and minor tweaks is just beyond joke.')
