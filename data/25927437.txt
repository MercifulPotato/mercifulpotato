Eg, a designer will lay out some sort of user story which typically defines &quot;flows&quot; from page to page. And they don&#x27;t expect that the work on this new &quot;flow&quot; will break the existing ones. In this case sharing code can become a liability. And this sh* happened a bunch of times where other devs trying to be clever, instead of just duplicating a UI component or page and making a few changes, they put in a bunch of params to support the new use cases (a better way of course is to extract common elements). The result as predicted was a spaghetti mess to untangle. Refactoring it is like dismantling a bomb.')
