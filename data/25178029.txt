As TFA points out, this is easy, and even the most naive and simplistic implementation beats physical signatures hands-down.<p>There&#x27;s two main problems:<p>1. Legality. Getting a court to recognise a digital signature probably isn&#x27;t that hard. It&#x27;s a bit like scanned images - if you can prove that this is the best evidence, then it&#x27;ll probably be accepted.\nHowever, getting lawyers to accept digital signatures is difficult. One of those awkward situations where there&#x27;s no consequences for them if they insist on a physical signature but lots of potential downside should they accept a digital signature.<p>2. File formats, or &quot;the standards problem&quot;. To include a digitial signature in a document, we need a file format that includes digital signatures. Every document file format has a different version of this, and every digital signature service provides a different &quot;wrapper&quot; format with a different signature.<p>This needs to be solved top-down. The SCOTUS, or the EU Court, or some organisation of similar standing, needs to say &quot;this wrapper format is the only type of signature legally accepted, and if a document is wrapped in this format, it is legally signed&quot;. Both problems vanish and we can have nice things again.')
