Fox staked out a conservative position, but claimed they were &#x27;fair and balanced&#x27;.  To suggest that other news outlets, like CNN or the Washington Post must have a liberal bent is to serve Fox&#x27;s agenda.  Articles like this show how one media outlet has managed to shift the Overton window.\nYes, there are some explicitly leftist news outlets, some, like Mother Jones, long pre-dating Fox news, and others, like MSNBC that pivoted in response to Fox.  It is wrong to claim that there are no unbiased outlets because they used the term &#x27;insurrectionists&#x27; to describe an organized group that broke into the United States Capitol with the intent to keep Congress from functioning. It&#x27;s an objectively accurate description.')
