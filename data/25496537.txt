Or worse yet, when The Right Thing™ is in the eye of the beholder, see: conservatives thinking that facebook&#x2F;youtube is censoring them, and liberals thinking they&#x27;re not doing enough.<p>&gt;That doesn&#x27;t elide the role of the state--it recognizes that, to our general detriment, we have allowed corporations to grow to the point where they are not practically regulatable by any given state due to their extranational operations.<p>But is that the case here?
