Item(by='Wowfunhappy', descendants=None, kids=[25357016], score=None, time=1607482406, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25351925, text='&gt; would a reasonable person view the combination of GPL and non-GPL code as a single piece of software?<p>I think reasonable people would disagree with each other.<p>macOS used to come with iTunes preinstalled, but you could remove it by turning off SIP and running `sudo rm -rf &#x2F;Applications&#x2F;iTunes.app` in the Terminal. I always did so, because iTunes sucks, and the rest of the OS always continued to work fine.<p>Is iTunes a part of macOS, or is iTunes a separate piece of software? Would it matter if you could remove iTunes through Finder, or without turning off SIP? Would it matter if iTunes wasn&#x27;t included with macOS, but was automatically downloaded and installed a day later? Would it matter if iTunes was created by a third party, or if macOS couldn&#x27;t output any audio without it?<p>What about Google Play Services? DirectX? ZFS? I could certainly make a case for how <i>I</i> think each of these should be classified, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s at all obvious.')
