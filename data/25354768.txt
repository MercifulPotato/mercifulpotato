Item(by='Wowfunhappy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607482406, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25351925, text='&gt; would a reasonable person view the combination of GPL and non-GPL code as a single piece of software?<p>I think reasonable people would disagree.<p>macOS used to come with iTunes preinstalled, but you could remove it by turning off SIP and running `sudo rm -rf &#x2F;Applications&#x2F;iTunes.app` in the Terminal (and I always did so, because iTunes sucks). The rest of the OS continues to work perfectly fine when you do this.<p>Is iTunes a part of macOS, or is it a separate piece of software? Would it matter if you could remove iTunes through the GUI, or without turning off SIP? Would it matter if iTunes wasn&#x27;t included with macOS, but was downloaded and installed automatically the first time the system noticed low network traffic? Would it matter if iTunes was created by a third party? Would it matter if iTunes was necessary for macOS to output any audio?<p>What about Google Play Services? DirectX? ZFS? I might argue some of these cases one way or the other, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s at all <i>obvious</i> one way or the other.')
