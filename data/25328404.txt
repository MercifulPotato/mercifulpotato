The music we hear in day-to-day is often very simple.<p>Besides structure, chords are often the same. Most of the time it&#x27;s I-IV-V, sometimes I-IV-V-vi... I even saw a video today mentioning how the I-ii-IV-V of Cure&#x27;s &quot;Just Like Heaven&quot; is an uncommon progression. For soundtracks it&#x27;s often just two chords vamping. Melody notes also rarely stray from whats sounds consonant with the current chord. Dissonance is only for passing notes. In the strong beats it&#x27;s certainly something consonant. Sometimes it&#x27;s all just a pentatonic. You also gotta emphasise that tonic everywhere. Melodies also need structure: you gotta have that AABA (or something like that) in your verse&#x2F;theme&#x2F;phrase, almost like a fractal. Broken rules only happen once or twice per song, or not at all.<p>The more good music I dissect the more impressed I am with how simple it is.')
