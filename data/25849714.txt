However I would much rather that the client was open source as well (It would make it way easier to get all my friends to Matrix with a well polished client).<p>Basically $10 a month for access to bridges that funds bridge development is great however I don&#x27;t want some of that to fund the development of a closed-source client. If the client was opened, or had work upstreamed to an open source client I would be all on board.')
