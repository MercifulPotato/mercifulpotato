Item(by='salawat', descendants=None, kids=[25197272], score=None, time=1606210249, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25196210, text='As a matter of principle, I will contest any attempt to frame the right to carry on one&#x27;s person a weapon into the same vein as a driver&#x27;s license. It is an explicitly granted right. If you look at how traffic enforcement has worked out (in spite of the fact we still play it up as a privilege), senior citizens and the disabled are still at a major disadvantage in mobility in their more enfeebled years, and no semblance of lessening of the regulations of any option to move around ever becomes apparent. It is also utilized as a significant source of revenue generation as particularly notorious small towns are well known for changing up speed limits ob chunks of major roads they straddle just for the bump in revenue.<p>It is also notable, that gun control also fell under that same set of &quot;State&#x27;s rights&quot; contributing to the original Civil War, and to hell with the well soap boxed dolts who insist that the only issue the Civil War was predicated on was Slavery.  It wasn&#x27;t. It was only indirectly so because the framework for expansion of Slavery was seen as falling under the banner of State&#x27;s rights at the time, just as much as gun control itself was also seen as falling under State&#x27;s rights. It&#x27;s not a dog-whistle, it&#x27;s what it bloody was.<p>Tangent aside, it basically boils down to the fundamental division of &quot;rural v. Urban&quot; in the United States, and to be frank, I side with the ruralites. Just because a bunch of people gather together in one place should not generate some emergent privilege that everyone loses an explicitly granted right except law enforcement.  Period. Gun control almost universally arises out of some group being uncomfortable with another group having guns, and the group that&#x27;s uncomfortable tends to be fine and dandy letting the authorities strut around with them, and would be unlikely to carry anyway; much like how pro public-transit folk seem to be more than okay with onerous vehicle regulation, but balk when the same laws or tenets are applied to them. Better to just not throw anyone under the bus at all.<p>Call me a yokel if you want. I&#x27;ve seen too much flung in the way of wrapping up other folk&#x27;s rights in my lifetime in the name of public safety with no signs of a return in sight. Until I see some loosening up, or some honest give and take, I&quot;m in the &quot;not one more inch&quot; camp.')
