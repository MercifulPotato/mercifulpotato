Would you mind sharing that process?<p>How did you find a manufacturer willing to build your product? Did you negotiate the price per unit?<p>Do they require a minimum purchase amount (ie, like 1000 units)?<p>If you do not have enough backers, are you planning on using your own money to buy up to the minimum purchase number, or cancel the entire project?<p>How do you plan on validating the build quality before settling on a specific manufacturer to build your product?')
