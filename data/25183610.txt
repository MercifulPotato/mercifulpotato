I keep having to explain this to colleagues. For some stuff, it’s just going to take time.<p>And I can also envision that certain packages might not get updated, necessitating a fork to patch them for M1.<p>I’m interested in how homebrew and others will handle that (so official package x chooses not to patch&#x2F;accept a patch for whatever reason, leading to a fork of package x with a patch applied), presumably to avoid namespace collisions&#x2F;not giving the user what they want, there could be an error message that states that an ARM64 version doesn’t officially exist but links it to the fork and gives the option to install that instead. And then there could be a flag to always allow linked-replacements if an official patch doesn’t exist.')
