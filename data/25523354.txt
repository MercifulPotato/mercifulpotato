That is, I can&#x27;t imagine a tool that a LEO would have access to that I would not. Nor can I imagine a tool they might have that I would not want to use myself.<p>That said, I think law enforcement has an intrinsic advantage in practical terms. They have the money to pay for  a subscription to known exploits packaged and made easy to attempt, and b) lots of experience using that tool (as well as just ordinary persuasion and coercion) to crack into peoples phones in the real world.')
