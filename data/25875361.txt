The candidate will ask closer to the upper end of the range but will get declined. Both company and candidate lost because divulging the upper end created unrealistic expectation by the candidate.<p>2. The candidate will or will not ask closer to the upper end and if he asks, the company declines and proposes more realistic rate. Now, both still loose because the candidate is &quot;tainted&quot; by thinking the company did not think he is worth the money and that he could get so much more.<p>The alternative is to have very narrow range but this is also suboptimal, because it is better to be flexible and once you get to know the candidate figure out where he&#x2F;she fits.<p>Asking for rate at the beginning also allows to fine-tune the recruitment process. The company should <i>NEVER</i> propose less than what the candidate stated as their minimum. That&#x27;s just a way to get an unhappy employee from day one. So, by specifying your rate you also specify minimum requirements you have to pass for the company to be interested in you. If you say you are expensive, that&#x27;s the standard you are going to be evaluated against.')
