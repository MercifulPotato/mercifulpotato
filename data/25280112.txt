It&#x27;s much harder to figure out package dependency and configuration issues when you can&#x27;t take over the keys to check out their programming environment.<p>I used repl.it for a class and it worked out nicely, where I could set up a template with data and code and the students could fork it. The one thing that made me not renew past a month is their receipts say &quot;Hacker&quot; on it as your purchase (it&#x27;s one of their pricing levels), and it was awkward getting a reimbursement from the university for that. Even handing a receipt saying that I purchased &quot;Hacker&quot; (without much context) made me hesitate.')
