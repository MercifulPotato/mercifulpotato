It was recorded by a kid on a 4 track though so the quality of the original was too bad to really understand how good it was.<p>Dave Lombardo (Slayer Drummer) and Scott Ian (Anthrax Guitarist) joined three of the original members for the re-recording. Scott Ian was a fan of it back in the day and thinks it was more musically complex than what they and most of the other big metal bands were doing at the time. And it was written by 15-17 year olds inspired by Slayer&#x27;s Reign in Blood.<p>But yes Bungle did a later album that was crazy circus metal and eventually they did a really great album of music that was less heavy (not metal at all) and more accessible called California.<p>I love all of it. Search for the 2020 version of Raging Wrath of the Easter Bunny for their new stuff. Easily the best album released this year IMO. RTJ4 was also pretty good though.<p>Bungle wasn&#x27;t really an offshoot of FNM, it was the lead singer Mike Patton&#x27;s first band. FNM is also criminally under-rated. Their only really famous song &quot;Epic&quot; isn&#x27;t really representative of the rest of their work. IMO the follow-up album Angel Dust is the best album of all time. They experiment with lots of genres and its still weird stuff though so its not gonna be everyone&#x27;s cup of tea.<p>Sample of the Re-Recording:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=3U5ZKKxqUzY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=3U5ZKKxqUzY</a>')
