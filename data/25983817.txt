Unless you want to pay $25 to wait 6 hours while your transaction is confirming, stick to venmo&#x2F;zelle&#x2F;paypal&#x2F;etc...<p>Nobody forces merchants to stick to requiring block confirmations for e.g. Bitcoin transactions.<p>They just do it because that&#x27;s the way it always has been.<p>Instead of that, for low price purchases, they could also monitor the network for how well-spread a transaction is and once it is sufficiently propagated assume that a double-spend won&#x27;t be possible anymore because miners will refuse to accept a transaction which conflicts with the one they saw much earlier.<p>And &quot;well-spread&quot; would be typically the case within <i>seconds</i> because transactions are flooded to all network nodes as they appear.')
