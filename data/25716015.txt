Federated systems are not as good as fully decentralized ones. Today I&#x27;m starting a new experiment on my own web platform called quanta.wiki (I&#x27;m a Java developer) to investigate how to make it fully decentralized where everyone at least (at first) holds a copy of their entire fiefdom. Once the &#x27;fiefdom&#x27; is not able to be shut down by targeting it&#x27;s DNS name (hosting service), we can have a social media infrastructure that cannot be censored at all, like a blockchain.')
