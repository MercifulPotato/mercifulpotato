The fact people you even entertain this though is hilarious. The entire point of capitalism is to maintain growth and that growth can only be maintained by employing people.<p>People hate on growth but what&#x27;s the alternative? Imagine being in the 15th century and saying: This is it, people will never have a full time job again, ever.<p>The 21th century wouldn&#x27;t have happened if people thought like that. The dark ages would have lasted forever.<p>The reason why we have so much underemployment is quite simple. Inflation has been way too low. Honestly, we have so much inflation to do that even the measly 2% that the Fed targets is way too little. Inflation has slowly picked up and it shows. Underemployment is shrinking in the US.')
