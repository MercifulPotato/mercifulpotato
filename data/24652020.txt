If I were to buy a laptop, I&#x27;d like to connect it and a bunch of USB devices via a single USB C cable. Easy, right?<p>Except that the monitor only supports DisplayPort 1.2. 4k60 requires a bandwidth of 12.54 Gbit&#x2F;s. DP 1.2 consists of four data lanes, each providing 4.32 GBit&#x2F;s, so my monitor requires four full lanes. DP 1.3 and up provide at least 7.48 Gbit&#x2F;s, so 4k60 would only require two lanes for that.<p>USB C consists of 4 data lanes. When using the DisplayPort alternate mode, it can assign either 1, 2, or 4 data lanes to DP. The other lanes can be used for USB. In addition to that, it also offers a single USB 2.0 lane.<p>If a dock - even an expensive one - supports a resolution of 4k60 via DP and provides USB 3 ports, will it actually work for me? It could use DP 1.2 by assigning four data links to DP , but that means USB gets downgraded to 2.0 and I don&#x27;t think any hub actually supports this. It could use DP 1.3+ and assign two data links to DP and two to USB, but if it outputs that same DP signal, it won&#x27;t provide the bandwidth my monitor needs so it must actively convert two-link DP 1.3 to four-link DP 1.2. Again, I don&#x27;t think any hub actually supports this.<p>The hardware I need can definitely exist. It&#x27;s a pretty normal thing to ask for. A lot of docks, even the expensive ones, will claim to support what I need, but as far as I can tell not a single dock actually can. Because USB C has so many protocol options, figuring out what is supported has become nearly impossible.')
