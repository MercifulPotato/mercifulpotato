You always hear of the price going up, yet few hard-nosed hedge funds would follow a collectible investment strategy.<p>I&#x27;ve read that as the number of people interested in a given kind of collectible shrinks, the market gets increasingly illiquid, but the nominal values don&#x27;t change much - people don&#x27;t want to sell at a loss, so when the value is much lower than the last posted trade, trades just don&#x27;t happen.')
