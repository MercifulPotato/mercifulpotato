I love the syntax highlighting debate.<p>I dropped syntax highlighting a few years ago. My thoughts on it are not &quot;colors are childish&quot; and &quot;books are black on white and we read those just fine.&quot; I don&#x27;t like the computer trying to convey what is important in my text files to me via color. What I think is important and what the computer thinks is important is often different. Then why don&#x27;t I configure my syntax highlighter to agree with me? It&#x27;s just another configuration file to keep in sync on the computers I use, and :syntax off is right there... It&#x27;s the nuclear option for being annoyed that comments are shown in light gray.')
