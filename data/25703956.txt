And iOS?<p>Once I sat down and read the Cmake basics, yes, it was easy enough to get OpenCV working with basicallly the code you posted, except I couldn&#x27;t find a way to include the contrib modules in an Android version, it would always complain Aruco wasn&#x27;t there.<p>Until I went and compiled OpenCV myself, and <i>that</i> was the part that was a massive pain in my ass - CMake failing to include architecture information in the library files unless you specify it on the command line <i>before</i> running Cmake GUI, even tho it <i>is</i> an option in the GUI. Tho perhaps that&#x27;s more of a failing of the OpenCV build script than Cmake itself?<p>I did just recompile OpenCV myself, so I did get there in the end and it&#x27;s all working now, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be tweaking all parts of this project for months to come so if there&#x27;s an easier&#x2F;proper way, I&#x27;m happy to learn.<p>It also needs to be statically linked.<p>Note: I&#x27;m not a real programmer, I don&#x27;t know enough to have even been able to get an entry level job in the industry yet, I&#x27;m an idiot that doesn&#x27;t belong on this website. I&#x27;m just trying to learn as I go.')
