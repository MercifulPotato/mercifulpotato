I suspect that&#x27;s not a major consideration for most people, however.<p>In the UK we have already tried &quot;permanent DST&quot; (if that&#x27;s what you want to call it): we were on UTC+1 through three winters: 1968-1971. From what I&#x27;ve heard, the Scots hated it and, according to Wikipedia, &quot;on a free vote, the House of Commons voted by 366 to 81 votes to end the experiment&quot;.<p>I think Ireland joined in the experiment back then. There&#x27;s a similar problem to the problem with Brexit: it would annoy some people if Northern Ireland were to have a different time from Ireland, and it would annoy some people if Northern Ireleand were to have a different time from the rest of the UK. I think all-year UTC would make a lot more sense and be generally more acceptable for the British Isles (UK + Ireland) than all-year UTC+1.<p>I also think Spain should consider switching to UTC. Some poeple claim they only switched to UTC+1 in the first place because of Franco&#x27;s friendship with Hitler.')
