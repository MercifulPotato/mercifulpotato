When I was like 16 we were interested in lock picking simply for the challenge. It didnâ€™t take long with some filed down and bent mini flat head screw drivers from the dollar store and me and my teen friends learned to open pad locks. We had no skill just mostly raked across the pins and a lot of locks that is all it takes. It quickly made me realize locks are mostly for honest people.')
