This is an ongoing series of blog posts, this has been done for various civilizations from various works.<p>2. The first post in the <i>Dothraki</i> series specifically talks at great length about how strongly we should criticize such &quot;incorrect&quot; civilizations in fiction. <i>Ice &amp; Fire</i> is particularly worth criticizing because both the books and the TV show are often (incorrectly) said to resemble real history, so people might think there actually were or are societies like the Dothraki.<p>3.
