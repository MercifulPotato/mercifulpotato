But please don&#x27;t do it this way. Instead, please follow the site guidelines and be kind.<p>HN threads are conversations, and it&#x27;s natural in a conversation for someone to connect a topic to something they were working on recently. That&#x27;s not shifting discussion to something unrelated. I can see how one could interpret it just as an excuse for spamming one&#x27;s project, but such an interpretation is just a guess, and if you apply the site guideline &quot;<i>Assume good faith</i>&quot;, you&#x27;d guess the opposite.
