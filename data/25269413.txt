Item(by='ogre_codes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606854101, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25268515, text='&gt; But marketing isn&#x27;t really known for being technically accurate, why would Apple&#x27;s be any exception?<p>The comments and emphasis about the benefits on unified memory come right out of Johny Srouji&#x27;s mouth. Granted, everything Apple execs say is vetted by marketing and legal, but I can&#x27;t see Srouji emphasizing a made-up marketing point as a weird red herring either.<p>As I mentioned above, someone on HN has &quot;debunked&quot; every single optimization Apple says they&#x27;ve done. But the numbers don&#x27;t lie. Somewhere along the way, some of the &quot;debunking&quot; is full of shit. I&#x27;m guessing <i>most</i> of it is.<p>The simplest explanation is that Apple is being forthright here and people don&#x27;t understand what they&#x27;ve done or how those optimizations work.')
