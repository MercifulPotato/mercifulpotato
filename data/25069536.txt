I get it, the writer&#x2F;editor wants to make the title punchy, and $4 billion is certainly punchier than say 4%. However, FT is in some way supposed to cater for professionals and I would expect better from them.<p>For actual informed use, the dollar numbers is largely meaningless. For a $100 billion fund, losing $4 billion is painful, but not the end of the world. For a $10 billion fund, it is likely game over.')
