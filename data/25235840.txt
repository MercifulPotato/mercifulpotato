This ore is somehow useful to someone, even if its value is structural: the shingles on an academic roof or a heavyweight desk. What a summarizer attempts to do is use a generic refinement process that will grind up the ore and then separate the components of interest such as Iron, Uranium, or Gold.<p>Anyone thinking that all of metallurgy reduces to simply throwing the slab into a machine and have it spew out the precious metals will find, instead, more complexity than they bargained for, and have more questions on machines or methods to resolve. Gold, Iron, Uranium, all have different extraction process.<p>I believe this approach may give some insight in what problems to solve instead with AI: focus on those discoveries that have helped advance &quot;metallurgy&quot;, those of discovering and understanding the structure of the mineral ore and contents (scientific papers) and their relation with current technologies at the time, not on the philosopher&#x27;s stone of &#x27;summarizing&#x27; process more akin to a hammer that makes everything seem like a nail.')
