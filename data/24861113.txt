And for enterprise JavaScript development, the standard editor is Visual Studio Code.<p>The reason why is because using anything else creates unnecessary friction between me and the rest of the team. This applies to other tools as well; for example, the default way to bench-test a running web service is to &quot;use Postman&quot;. I could use curl, and that would be easier for me, especially from a scripting standpoint, but everybody else&#x27;s vocabulary is in terms of Postman, so I&#x27;m forcing myself to use that.')
