It’s essentially a massive job creator that we don’t really talk about as a massive job creator. It’s always framed with national security in mind.<p>We often talk about the human cost of war, but as I’ve gotten older and seen the never-ending military presence in the Middle East, I can’t help but wonder how much of that is driven by this political desire to provide these kinds of jobs to thousands of young men and women that don’t have many opportunities back home.<p>Of course, it’s not really talked about this way, but I remember first thinking about it watching Ken Burns Vietnam war series. It wasn’t the rich kids that died in that war either, it was the children of the working class.<p>Military is just as much of a domestic political tool as it is a force to shape geopolitics globally, and it’s deeply effective in communities that are reliant on military presence.')
