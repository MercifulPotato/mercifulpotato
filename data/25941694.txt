It&#x27;s a part of the survielence economy and has been weaponized in countless ways, Zuck may not be the one building it any more, he has many of you do that for him.<p>But it stands to reason that of those 3 you listed you have a very clear &#x27;orge&#x27; in the bunch.<p>What good has he done for Society over all exactly?<p>Even with unfathomable wealth all he seems to be responsible for is creating a greater divide and discord amongst people and that help promote absurd conspiracies and crate time-wasting habits especially so in developing countries as his platform is what most associate with what the &#x27;internet&#x27; as they cannot afford to browse anything else once they have access to it via FB enabled smart phones.<p>I&#x27;m glad SpaceX had his satellite blow up on the launch pad!<p>God only knows what horrible things would be possible had it actually made it into orbit.<p>As for Mark Cuban, I&#x27;m on the fence but his talk and backing of Andrew Yang makes me think he isn&#x27;t an ogre, but Zuckerburg certainly is, willing or not at this point.')
