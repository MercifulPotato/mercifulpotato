Which is of course why their sales people would answer every question with, &quot;Yep, it does that.&quot; Nevermind that some of the things getting promised were not actually possible.<p>I remember one in particular that would push incredibly tight deadlines for huge features, got frustrated at the pace and hired another dev team, and didn&#x27;t change the way they set deadlines. This of course fixed nothing. Then the other team they hired pushed a huge change to the repo, almost every file in the codebase was touched. Nearly 70% of which was whitespace changes and the other 30% was unfinished code that did not compile. We later found evidence that they hadn&#x27;t even run the code before pushing the changes. The client demanded that we merge it, were told it would break the build, got mad when we merged it and the build broke, then tried to use that (and a whole bunch of almost hilarious and similarly-effective arguments) against us in a lawsuit which they lost, and then lost the countersuit.<p>So yeah, that was a fun time for my liver, to say the least. Especially since the C-levels decided to focus the entire company&#x27;s output on that lawsuit while the engineering team sat around mostly twiddling their thumbs.')
