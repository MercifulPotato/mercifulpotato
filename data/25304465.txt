They&#x27;re not. But it is a trend that some would be more than happy to pretend doesn&#x27;t exist because they haven&#x27;t had a reason to tune their cognitive receivers into the broadcast frequency people like me are sensitive to and have been bombarded with for far longer, with far worse outcomes.<p>And I will speak out about it.<p>Every time.<p>Downvotes be damned.')
