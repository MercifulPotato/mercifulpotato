The main reason for Linux distributions to exists is to provide a development and running environment where:<p>- API&#x2F;ABIs do not change for the whole lifetime of the distribution. No new features, no new bugs, no new vulnerabilities, so that your production code can run reliably for 5+ years.<p>- Vulnerabilities are fixed with minimally invasive patches.<p>- Vulnerabilities are fixed in reasonable times even if the upstream development stopped.  Patches are well tested against the set of packages in the distribution.<p>You simply cannot have these 3 features together if a distribution ships 10 different version of each library.<p>It&#x27;s already a ton of work to maintain packages in stable distributions.')
