Nobody is going to pay a tow truck for preemtively moving a car, they might arrest them for taking without consent.<p>If a car really needs a tow for safety purposes, the police will organise that based on their pre-existing contracts and paid for a known price (by the insurance company, or the car owner)<p>If the car is abandoned the council will eventually shift it and claim the cost back as littering<p>If the car is safe though it&#x27;s upto the owner to contact their insurance company and arrange for them to come out and shift it.<p>Multiple companies racing to the scene sounds like something from the 1800s with fire brigades sabotaging each other.')
