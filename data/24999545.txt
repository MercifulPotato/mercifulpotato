Just like any system, don&#x27;t install plugins&#x2F;copy+paste config that you don&#x27;t understand or can&#x27;t maintain. I&#x27;ve been able to open tsx files with linting&#x2F;highlighting&#x2F;testing plugins and everything works as expected.<p>On the flip side, if you want easy configuration, then yes, vim&#x2F;emacs&#x2F;similar are not necessarily the right choices for you, but I don&#x27;t think that means they are generally bad options.')
