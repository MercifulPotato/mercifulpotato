First computer that I could physically touch was a PDP-8&#x2F;M with an ASR-33 teletype with paper tape reader and punch.<p>In my mid-50s, I started listening to Alan Watts and learning about ancient Indian religions &#x2F; philosophies. My world-view today is some kind of cross between Zen Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta. I&#x27;m a free will skeptic, as well.<p>While I&#x27;m not paralyzed by it, I&#x27;ve come to think that we can&#x27;t know how any decision we make is going to turn out. We can&#x27;t know with certainty if doing X is going to be good or bad for us in the long run. All we have are our own estimates of probabilities, and I&#x27;m not sure how well we can estimate them, either, honestly.<p>I also don&#x27;t know who &quot;I&quot; am, or where I begin or end. In infancy and childhood, I think we come to accept a belief that &quot;we&quot; are individuals, each residing in our physical bodies. Yet I understand the Universe to be a single thing (a quantum field? a simulation?) and so the idea of us being individuals seems a bit off to me. I think we are far more connected and interdependent than we usually recognize.<p>One good outcome of my world view is that I don&#x27;t really worry about passing away. A less pleasant outcome is that my world view is so out of the ordinary that I don&#x27;t often connect with people that I can talk about this with in any serious way.')
