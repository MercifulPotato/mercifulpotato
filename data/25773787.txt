Item(by='Cthulhu_', descendants=None, kids=[25773886], score=None, time=1610613790, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25773133, text='&gt; the living standard in Europe are considerably lower than in the US.<p>Citation needed, unless you&#x27;re being sarcastic throughout your post (can&#x27;t tell, Poe&#x27;s law?).<p>If I get the &#x27;rona, I might die but at least I won&#x27;t go bankrupt.<p>Anyway, GDP per capita in Europe is not the best measure, because there&#x27;s still a massive economic disparity within Europe; the east is still feeling the effects of the Soviet Union (and Russia&#x27;s influence), the south has been struggling financially for a long while now (Greece had to be bailed out). The West and North are doing all right for themselves; Germany has a GDP per capita of $46K, 10K higher than the number you cited. Netherlands is even higher at $52K, Switzerland does $82K, Ireland, the base of operations for a lot of US companies has $89K and Luxembourg, a tiny country, trounces the whole world at $114K per capita.')
