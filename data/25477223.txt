From a technical perspective, they are solid, diligent, but slow. They used to do a lot themselves, including IP blocks, simulators, timing tools, etc. I believe they are trying to adopt more modern design flows to keep up with the rest of the industry in terms of costs and schedules.<p>As a customer, I tried buying compute sticks in large quantities (i.e. 1000s) from a distributor but they would not extend pricing discounts until Intel approved them. In order to get approved, I had to take online training classes and quizes Intel offered. It was insane. No other company I dealt with required anything like that. I spent hours doing online training on their solutions and never was able to arrange a <i>single</i> discount. Finally said screw it and went with a different solution. Hands down the worst company I dealt with.')
