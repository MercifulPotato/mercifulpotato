In 2014 I was up + 40 lbs, started exercising and lifting heavy 4 to 5 times a week. I did clean my diet just a tiny bit and did loose 15 lbs or so. But amount of work was insane. Now in 2019 I started fasting and biking for fun and BAM! 25 lbs down with so little effort. I always struggled to do this. I always was amazed how people can eat clean and smaller portions constantly. For me not eliminating but minimizing sugar and carbs to some extent helped with cravings. Also just skipping a meal is so much easier now if I am not all carbed out! Also mentally fasting fits better for me. Life happens, I will eat cake :-) But after feast, there will be fast.')
