Per the CEO of Parler, banks and payment vendors, law firms, and text and mail services also cancelled on them. Thatâ€™s why people are talking about alternative currencies in the same breath as Parler.<p>Anyone too slow to ban Parker could face a full court press from all sides, and not merely any one firm. Apple has also banned porn and that is not legally required at all.')
