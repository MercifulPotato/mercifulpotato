The &quot;victim&quot; doesn&#x27;t have to be offended for the behaviour to potentially be inappropriate. Behaviour has second order effects beyond the direct &quot;victim&quot; (e.g. people watch and think its ok, so more people do it, and it becomes &quot;normal&quot;). Its also entirely possible for the victim to be hurt, without him admitting it for a variety of reasons (E.g. social pressure, not wanting to be seen as weak or a crybaby, etc).<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m speaking in principle. I don&#x27;t agree in the particular case that the behaviour was inappropriate.')
