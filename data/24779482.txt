Batteries determine pricing, speed, charging speed, and range. You can&#x27;t have a great car if you can&#x27;t nail those things.<p>BMW &amp; VW have managed to make EVs which are great in every other way, but without getting the basics right, nobody is buying.<p>&gt; ...an army of blind supporters...<p>Tesla has some glaring issues (IMO largely around self driving and quality control), but they&#x27;ve nailed the things about a car that people care about: Price, Performance, &amp; Range. Complaining that people like Tesla&#x27;s while ignoring the obvious advantages Tesla brings to the table just points out your own biases.<p>BMW&#x27;s best EVs have 60% of the range of the bottom end Tesla and only marginally better performance. That makes it a bit difficult to point at Tesla and say they are successful due to &quot;Blind Supporters&quot;.')
