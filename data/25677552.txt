The people I know call themselves anarchists. I don&#x27;t have much knowledge about anarchism so I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s different flavors of it. Like I&#x27;ve heard of anarcho-communism which must be fundamentally quite different. Based on the conversations I&#x27;ve had with them, my own understanding was that the idea would be almost like Laissez-faire, but even more extreme since there&#x27;s no government at all.')
