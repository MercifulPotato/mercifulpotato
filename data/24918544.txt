It&#x27;s not clear at all that decreasing China&#x27;s power but increasing that of the US will do any good to anyone. Just in Iraq, the US killed more people than anyone accuses China of imprisoning illegitimately. So unless you can find a way to reduce China&#x27;s power without also increasing that of the US, no one outside of those under US propaganda or interest will want to do much of anything.<p>Secondly, China is a nuclear armed country. Intervening in their domestic affairs is not easily done.<p>Finally, comparing the CCP to the NSDAP is frankly absurd. They are not comparable. The Nazi party wanted to kill around a third of the world&#x27;s population and enslave another third. The CCP is accused, at worst, to be trying to change the culture of one of their provinces using inhumane tactics and torture, which sadly is just par for the course for the world in general.')
