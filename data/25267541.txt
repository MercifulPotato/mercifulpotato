Linux isn&#x27;t Android where user apps are written to run under a virtual machine and development  has to deal with the Java monoculture (Android still doesn&#x27;t have low latency audio for this exact reason). However, some Python apps that on a powerful desktop run at high speed might be taxed by the Pinephone comparatively slow hardware, so native compiled code would be the solution to give a significant speed bump to most Pinephone userland applications.')
