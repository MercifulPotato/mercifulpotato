Colleges increase prices since their customers have infinite money.  Children and their parents go into further and further debt as colleges keep raising prices and there is no limit to the amount of debt the government will underwrite.<p>Situation B:  Government does not lend any money.  Colleges have to keep tuition at affordable levels, and&#x2F;or obtain funding from government.  Children pay an appropriate amount of money for education and don&#x27;t waste money on fancy gyms and stadiums and catering halls and ceremonies and extraneous administrators.')
