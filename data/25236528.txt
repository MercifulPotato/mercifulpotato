Textmode interfaces began with the teletypewriter in the nineteenth century and UNICODE began around that time too. The programming interface for these machines wasn&#x27;t standardized until the 1960&#x27;s with ASCII, which was extended a decade later by ANSI X3.64-1979, and then again in the 90&#x27;s by UTF-8. That&#x27;s the trifecta of textmode definitions which, only as of these last few years, became basically universally supported. CGA is kind of just a uint16_t[20][80] array for personal computers.

I&#x27;m certain things will get better if we consider that GUIs are a relatively recent invention by comparison. So it&#x27;ll probably take another fifty years for widget authors to forge out a consensus that&#x27;s as good and widely supported as the one we have now for terminals.')
