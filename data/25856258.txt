Honestly, the flavour is out of this world and that&#x27;s pretty much with everything you grow too with hydro&#x2F;aeroponics.<p>From first hand experience though, the electricity is a huge cost plus being in Poland right now, my labour costs would have swallowed up any profits.<p>These won&#x27;t replace traditional farms BUT a farm growing fields of lettuce could and should be replaced for other variants of root vegetables etc. Lettuce, leafy greens and herbs IMO should be grown in vertical farms as it&#x27;s low effort and really it&#x27;s all about getting maximum taste into each leaf. Lettuce doesn&#x27;t really provide that much in terms of nutritional benefits, especially when it&#x27;s been transported for hundreds&#x2F;thousands of miles so local or as close to the end user it vital.')
