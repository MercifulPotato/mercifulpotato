The rest will always be open to interpretation, that will depend on the biases of the censors. It seems to me this is the case here. There is nothing in his (other) tweets that incites violence.<p>Or can you show anything? Can they do it? After all the criticism they received, they still can&#x27;t produce a IoV tweets as evidence? This does not look questionable to you?<p>A question I have is - why am I even asked to be reading twitter&#x27;s thoughts about a matter, instead of actual tweets or things that the account wrote? Who is twitter? Why should I care about their opinion, who gave them right to affect opinion? Why are they supposed to have the moral authority to decipher complex situations for me and tell me how I should understand one message or another? Who elected them? What was the democratic process behind it?<p>It is these questions that make the situation real shady, not the two tweets.')
