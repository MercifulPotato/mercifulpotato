As I understand it, the power of a union is that the collective group will strike if they don&#x27;t get the results they want. Would a few hundreds Google employees striking make that much of a difference? I don&#x27;t think so. More importantly, I don&#x27;t think Google is going to allow such a threat to its business to grow.')
