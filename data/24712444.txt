Having bought into the Tesla Kool aid last year, I decided to get myself one (S). Sure, I liked it and all, and it certainly reeks of German engineering design thanks to Holzhausen, but it&#x27;s overall service model leaves much to be desired. I only realized that when my SO&#x27;s Dad showed me the Porsche Taycan, that I realized how much Tesla had sacrificed, in terms of customer convenience and customer service. Tesla is no BMW or Porsche, and I don&#x27;t think it can be one either - not with Musk&#x27;s demanding sort of leadership. Designing a sexy car might be possible, but designing the processes behind manufacturing that with no qualms or quality issues, with a constantly changing team of engineers, is not possible. That requires time and patience and a lot of TLC, all of which Musk doesn&#x27;t have.<p>It&#x27;s a good stock to ride the sucker wave on though.')
