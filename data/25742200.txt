Item(by='sterlind', descendants=None, kids=[25743047], score=None, time=1610424954, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25742138, text='&gt; <i>Even after removing cases occurring within 7 days of vaccination (409 on Pfizerâ€™s vaccine vs. 287 on placebo), which should include the majority of symptoms due to short-term vaccine reactogenicity, vaccine efficacy remains low: 29% (see footnote).</i><p>The 95% claim assumes you&#x27;ve had both doses and five weeks have passed since the first dose. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a fair way to dice the data. Also, &quot;covid-19 symptoms&quot; (the proxy that opinion writer used) are very non-specific. Headache, sore throat, cough - there&#x27;s myriad causes. That&#x27;s why PCR+ is the only way to get a decent signal.<p>This seems like a crackpot analysis, not that I&#x27;m an expert.<p>Oh, and finally, relative risk reduction (that number you&#x27;re quoting) is a <i>fundamentally</i> different property than efficacy. It&#x27;s the difference between the placebo and vaccine groups in catching covid. Relative risk reduction would only equal efficacy if 100% of the placebo group caught it.')
