You can even do it on public property if you have a generic hunting license, though there&#x27;s time-of-year and time-of-day restrictions in that case.<p>There is no bag limit.  You can even do it with night vision.<p>But yes, shooting pigs with small children playing nearby isn&#x27;t good.  I don&#x27;t know the context, maybe it was very obvious that the kids all got safely inside and accounted for.')
