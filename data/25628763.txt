And all that jazz does take time &amp; energy.<p>The net result is data consistency across components&#x2F;screens (which is great), separation of concerns and clean code (cool), but at the code of slower development.<p>Even though, as I&#x27;m writing this, I also think about the alternative. Not having it means having less structure, maybe more issues to fix everywhere due to the lack of consistency, etc. It&#x27;s not a choice that I can weigh easily, even now. I knew the tech already, used it in production before, and it still wasn&#x27;t easy after all. Details details ^^')
