That worked until hardware stopped wrapping around memory. Apple created a launch error “program had special memory requirements” which actually meant “this is Excel version so-and-so”.<p>And yes, that can bite you in the future, but the gains today can (appear to) outweigh that.<p>It also is perfectly valid when you control both the side that determines the constraints and the side that runs extremely close to them. For example, Cocoa’s tagged pointers (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mikeash.com&#x2F;pyblog&#x2F;friday-qa-2012-07-27-lets-build-tagged-pointers.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mikeash.com&#x2F;pyblog&#x2F;friday-qa-2012-07-27-lets-bui...</a>) are fine, given that Apple both controlled the memory allocator and the library assuming it aligned allocations (they also are safer in that they won’t try to read from addresses that don’t point to valid memory. That’s essential for their use)')
