To me the Nature article just says &#x27;nah, evolution is random, therefore SARS-CoV-2 randomly happened.&#x27; but it would be nice to see more detail. Especially with the closest ancestor of RaTG13 being decades of evolution away. (not to mention the questions around the origin of RaTG13 on the author&#x27;s site...)')
