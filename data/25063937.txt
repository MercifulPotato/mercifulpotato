They loved the &quot;new ideas&quot; but many of the &quot;old guard&quot; hated the idea that something from outside of IBM was novel and worth pursuing. I watched first hand as things that had been done by a company that was acquired were buried while the exact same kind of thing done by IBM research was given lots of funding. I understood not having two efforts, but suggested they be blended to get the best of both teams, alas that was shot down.<p>At one time IBM research had a pretty awesome storage group, perhaps they will will have a computational storage fabric offering at some point.')
