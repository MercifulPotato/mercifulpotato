One team does all the expensive design work, and then both benefit because the design cost is over more devices, plus more hardware means better scale factors in manufacturing.<p>The above is on a case by case basis. So they may share some complex part, and some other (possibly more complex) they decide isn&#x27;t worth sharing.')
