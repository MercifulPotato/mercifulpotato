I got a new LG CX last month and it&#x27;s incredibly fast - switches on like my CRT TV used to, it&#x27;s almost instant. And all the apps work very quickly, menus don&#x27;t stutter at all......huge change from a Bravia TV I had before, that was like &quot;press a button and wait 10 seconds for something to happen&quot; and you couldn&#x27;t change the input for at least 30 seconds after switching it on.')
