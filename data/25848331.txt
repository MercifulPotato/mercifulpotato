I like thinking of results in color science as tools to help designers, rather than some objective truth. There&#x27;s a lot of scientism.<p>From that perspective, I definitely support offering designers either an IPT or Oklab based gradient tool. With the lightness predictions, it&#x27;s likely that Oklab will do a slightly better job on blend modes, but clearly they&#x27;re both good color spaces, certainly a major improvement over CIELAB which is vastly more popular.')
