They cited her message to the brain group as reason for doing so (without the resignation I suspect she may have faced some disciplinary action, though whether it would have gone as far as firing I don&#x27;t know).<p>They clearly weren&#x27;t happy with the content but, beyond that, if somebody is pissed off enough to write that the kind of message Timnit did then, by making them work their notice period, you only invite them to cause more trouble whilst they&#x27;re still part of the organisation. You therefore bring forward their leaving date and make their resignation effective immediately.<p>When you do this it&#x27;s about mitigating risk to the organisation. Commonly I&#x27;ve seen it done with salespeople in certain sectors, where when they resign they are escorted from the premises and access is revoked as part of minimising the risks that they&#x27;ll take clients with them to their next role (particularly if they&#x27;ll be working for a competitor). Still, any situation in which continuing to have an employee around represents a significant risk to the organisation is one in which you might ask them to leave immediately.<p>Google already had a mess to try to clean up with the brain group as a result of Timnit&#x27;s message to that group. They probably didn&#x27;t want any new messes to deal with, so they asked her to leave immediately to mitigate that risk.<p>Btw, I&#x27;m not advocating for Google here: I&#x27;m just looking at this in terms of, &quot;What would I as a manager do in a circumstance where an employee has set out conditions of an ultimatum for their continued employment that I am unable or unwilling to meet?&quot;')
