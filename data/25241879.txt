But I am unable to keep my posture correct in a chair, I <i>always</i> twist myself in horrible ways (and developed scoliosis because of it), usually within less than a minute. I totally zone out of the physical world when I&#x27;m programming, my body cases to exist, I don&#x27;t even feel hungry or the need to drink, have to have reminders for these. And  because of my lower back problems, I shouldn&#x27;t probably be sitting at all.')
