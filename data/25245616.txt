It doesn&#x27;t need to. It only needs to know how much physical memory it can use, and where it lives in physical address space. On PCs, that is provided by the firmware at boot time via the e820 map (or via a UEFI method these days, and there is also the multiboot standard which GRUB will use to pass the info along to the booted kernel).<p>Therefore, there is no portable way to obtain that information that is guaranteed to work, because some platforms might not even provide it at all. Only if the kernel has&#x2F;needs drivers that interact with the physical memory controller directly, or gets platform metadata such as via DMI, is this information readily available.')
