Many liberals consider conservative beliefs to be inherently racist. Opposition to the ACA, for example, was decried as &quot;racist&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;peterubel&#x2F;2013&#x2F;11&#x2F;21&#x2F;is-opposition-to-obamacare-racist&#x2F;?sh=315b303da603" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;peterubel&#x2F;2013&#x2F;11&#x2F;21&#x2F;is-opposit...</a>.<p>A lot of this worldview isn&#x27;t unwarranted.
