I&#x27;m guessing that the risk depends on how the cows are kept. Industrialization of milk farming introduced high concentration of cows in cramped spaces, which led to disease&#x2F;bacteria spread. I&#x27;m guessing this, because we kept milk cows for thousands of years and didn&#x27;t use pasteurization. If that&#x27;s true, and you know that your milk cow is kept in good conditions, you should feel comfortable drinking its milk raw.<p>Again, correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.')
