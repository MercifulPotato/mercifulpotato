The modern GPU rendering stack won&#x27;t be able to do it, but I was able to do it in software without giving up the Linux kernel, IRQs, or the input stack.<p>My experiment got down to ~10 ms average tap latency on a 60 Hz phone with a touchscreen scanning at 240 Hz: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;kdrag0n&#x2F;status&#x2F;1291213993219039232" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;kdrag0n&#x2F;status&#x2F;1291213993219039232</a><p>Source code: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kdrag0n&#x2F;touchpaint" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kdrag0n&#x2F;touchpaint</a><p>I have to say that writing on phones really feels much more interactive and natural when the latency is so low. I don&#x27;t personally feel like these ranges of latency are that big of a deal on desktop computers where input is indirect, but it feels much more significant on phones where your interactions are right underneath your finger.')
