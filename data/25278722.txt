By using this metric for a species&#x27; survival nearly nothing should be allowed to live.<p>When considering an ethical question, typically one must have the &quot;ability to have acted differently.&quot; To be grotesque: I may be justified in eating a dead relative to survive in some nightmare scenario, however its permissibility here doesn&#x27;t allow me the opportunity to desecrate human corpses for pleasurable eating. Is it possible there was a point at which humans were required to perform otherwise unethical acts to survive? Yes, absolutely. Does that permit the same behavior when its necessity no longer exists? I wouldn&#x27;t think so.<p>&gt;If you think farming animals is bad wait until you see a Hyena eating the guts out of an animal that is still alive, and will be for most of the meal.<p>Hyena&#x27;s aren&#x27;t moral agents, they cannot consider the ethical content of their decisions. Even if they were, the bad behavior of one moral agent usually isn&#x27;t a justification for another&#x27;s unethical behavior.')
