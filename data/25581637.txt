I mean not everyone on this planet is doing well economically, they obviously follow this advice because they are forced to. By definition it&#x27;s the wealthy who have lots of spare resources and therefore can afford to &quot;waste&quot; them. So if we force the wealthy to think and act like the poor then who on earth would want to become wealthy then?<p>You can argue that life is unfair but it can&#x27;t be unfair for everyone. If it was then poor people might start thinking that their own sacrifices are meaningless. After all, why slave away for some &quot;rich asshole&quot; who doesn&#x27;t even enjoy being a rich asshole? Just give the excess wealth back if you don&#x27;t want it.<p>Spending it on yourself can be selfish and you will quickly run into diminishing returns but you can also spend it together with other people or use it to help others. There is absolutely nothing wrong with spending instead of investing your money if you have enough. It&#x27;s not like we are being flooded with domestic investment opportunities anyway.')
