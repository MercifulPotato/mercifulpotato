Another person will see that statement and believe it is harassment and not free speech.<p>You are mistaken. Criticism is never harassment and it’s always free speech by definition. Someone might have their feelings hurt by criticism and they might even believe it to be harassment, but they’d be mistaken. The president would prefer the media not to criticize him so much and I’m sure he believes they harass him, but never the less, he is mistaken.<p>&gt; No, this is false. You asserted the contradiction and you still have not demonstrated that it exists.<p>I interpreted (evidently “misinterpreted) your comment as a contradiction; I wasn’t <i>claiming</i> a contradiction. It seems like your point is instead “some people consider harassment to be free speech” which is fine, but incorrect at least per the widely accepted definition of free speech. You can have your own definition of “2” for example which means “3”, but you don’t get to call others wrong when they say “2+2=4”—they are simply using the conventional definition of “2” and not your personal definition.')
