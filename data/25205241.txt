Worked in tech by day and rennovated a carriage house by night - all the way from a literal barn to a &quot;fully rennovated&quot; space, all done by himself and friend&#x2F;family help.<p>Granted, he&#x27;s a smart guy, and has people he can call with questions that are outside his expertise, but a carraige house is a cool project as the size is manageable, and each problem is much more suited to the scale of 1-3 people working on it.<p>Happy to answer any questions via email as well.')
