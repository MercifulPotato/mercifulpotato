He became aware that there were queues of financial workers outside retail branches of banks in South Manhattan. These people had cash in various US banks, more than the insured deposit limit, and were withdrawing it and&#x2F;or shifting it between accounts to protect themselves against the bankruptcy of major banks. They has a better idea than the newspaper-reading public of what was about to go down.<p>John decided that this wasn&#x27;t worthy of being covered in the FT. He did however queue up himself to move his own money so it was protected.<p>You can judge for yourself whether that makes him likely to be a complacent shill for the financial industry, talking down to the rubes.')
