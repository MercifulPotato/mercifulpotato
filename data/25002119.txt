Sure it has some imperfections but as a product that does &quot;all of the things&quot; (email, calendar (CalDAV), contacts (CardDAV), etc.) and open source - imo, it deserves support. I reported some bugs on the 68.x(edit: oops, 78.x) release and their response was prompt, professional, and helpful. I love Thunderbird.')
