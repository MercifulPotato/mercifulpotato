Bad actors will always find some way to communicate, and the intelligence failed even when they were doing so openly on mainstream networks. Go crack that nut first before breaking everybody&#x27;s encryption, the consequences of which are far more detrimental for a free society.<p>Also, it does not hurt to point out that unlike Facebook, which is wired for clicks and &quot;user engagement&quot;, Signal does not spread or profit from hate speech and disinformation, which is what got us into recent developments, but rather works like a private chat. So perhaps we have already made some progress by having these people switch over--their recruiting is likely to be severely affected if they rely on Signal for it.')
