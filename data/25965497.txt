You probably don&#x27;t want to buy a house in a flood zone.  Also, because hurricane codes were updated recently, you want to buy something recent-ish, definitely nothing older than 2002.  The windows in my place are rated for a Category 5, and I&#x27;m at 50ft above sea level.<p>In most of Florida, Sarasota included, if you go with a traditional home, you&#x27;ll want newer construction in a community.  The HOA takes care of all the outside stuff like landscaping, so it&#x27;s pretty much condo living except without shared walls.  All the houses look similar.<p>The HOAs usually maintain some kind of &quot;activity center&quot; where you&#x27;ll have a gym, pool, common area, tennis courts, etc.  Again, it&#x27;s pretty much like living in an SF condo, except instead of all that stuff being downstairs, it&#x27;s down the street, and much larger.<p>If you prefer to live in an actual condo, there&#x27;s plenty of those too with a walk-able downtown area, but I like not having shared walls.  Also downtown is in a flood zone, so you might need to evacuate if we get a bad enough hurricane.  I wouldn&#x27;t be too concerned about flooding if I was buying several stories up though.<p>As for internet, frontier offers decent symmetric fiber (previously fios).  I&#x27;m on gigabit with them and it&#x27;s been fine.  It&#x27;s in most of the area.<p>Also, as a rule of thumb, you want to buy when a new community is just getting started or just finishing up.  You&#x27;ll get a better deal if you&#x27;re one of the last houses before they shut down the sales office, or if you&#x27;re one of the first to buy.  Construction takes 8-12 months usually, but it&#x27;s perfectly fine to have the house built while you&#x27;re remote.  I lived nearby with family while mine was being built, and me walking the construction site periodically wasn&#x27;t particularly useful.<p>Hope that helps!  Happy to answer any other questions you might have.')
