Every line of code gets reviewed before it gets committed, and if the commit is longer than 20 lines or so, it undergoes an additional scheduled review as well as pre-commit review. They also have pretty good code sniffers that ought to catch errors like OP mentioned.<p>The reason they&#x27;re concerned, I think, is because they try to protect users who have plugins that came from their plugin repository, where the same code quality rules don&#x27;t apply. WordPress has always been huge on backward compatibility.')
