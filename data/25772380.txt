I would argue for greater regulatory enforcement on this front.  &quot;Bumper-to-bumper&quot; is not the same as &quot;bumper-to-bumper-but-not-the-silicon-bits&quot;, and it can be a meaningful and large difference in the total cost of ownership of a vehicle that is increasingly focused on &quot;the-silicon-bits&quot;.<p>If this <i>stays</i> a purely proactive measure that <i>adds</i> to the Tesla experience, I&#x27;m all for it, but I really hope regulators continue to hold their ground without ceding to the industry pressure of &quot;we&#x27;ll self-regulate because we have the best data on individual component failures and can provide a better customer experience around it than recalls.&quot;')
