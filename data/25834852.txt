Item(by='vidarh', descendants=None, kids=[25835206], score=None, time=1611072701, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25834445, text='Here is the grand total of formatting supported by RTF in use in my novels:<p>* headers<p>* italics<p>* maybe 2-3 instances of *bold* through the entire text.<p>I don&#x27;t need any additional &quot;quality of editing&quot;. Hiding the syntax is <i>irrelevant</i> because the needs are so limited. Hiding <i>the user interface</i> on the other hand, matters to me, because it&#x27;s a distraction (to others it isn&#x27;t). My editor color-codes the headers and the italics, and having it stand out matters far more to me than that it looks the way it will in the formatted book, because my draft looks nothing like the finished book will <i>anyway</i>.<p>If you look at interviews with writers, you&#x27;ll find a whole lot of obsession over the process, and things like how it feels to write with a pen vs. a typewriter vs. a word processor, and very, very little about what their drafts <i>look like</i>. It&#x27;s <i>far down</i> the list of considerations you&#x27;ll find novelists care about.<p>Nobody cares what the drafts look like, because they are transient. In fact you&#x27;ll find a whole lot of authors advocate avoiding going back and editing and arguing for things like dictaphones etc. to make going back <i>harder</i> or using tools that won&#x27;t let scroll up in some cases to simulate the typewriter experience, and <i>all kinds of similar</i> obsessions with spending as little time as possible on formatting and what the manuscript looks like in preference of being able to just dump the first draft into text the fastest way possible (while other authors <i>want</i> writing the first draft to take longer <i>on purpose</i> - to some that is a reason for using pens or pencils).<p>You mentioned Gaiman in another reply - someone who has talked at length about how since he wrote Stardust in a fountain pen he has come to enjoy being forced to rewrite his second draft entirely instead of being able to go back and forth and editing it since he switched to writing with pen on paper.<p>I&#x27;m sure you <i>can</i> find novelists that want to see a beautifully formatted manuscript while writing it. They have tools they can use.<p>But to suggest Markdown is some sort of big hindrance compared to some of the barriers novelists create for themselves on purpose doesn&#x27;t pass the smell test for me.')
