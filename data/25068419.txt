Yes, we have a &quot;proper&quot; platform and for some undefined security reason I&#x27;ve lost access - I believe I now exist on a separate astral plane to all other employees, which is reassuring but makes account recovery difficult. I <i>might</i> regain it this week, but we <i>needed</i> to process the data yesterday. I suppose you could argue it&#x27;s good training for business continuity in a partial DoS.<p>On a related note, my partner has managed (as the customer) migrating an examination platform recently, to a &quot;more secure&quot; one with lots of yummy microservices. Or was - the contract has now been cancelled and she&#x27;s looking for a new job, and possibly therapy, after a torrent of personal abuse caused by bugs she simply cannot fix.<p>What&#x27;s sad is that I wish I could say this was unusual. But it&#x27;s anywhere and everywhere I&#x27;ve worked.<p>Quite seriously, what are we doing? Why do other apps exist when I will, <i>every single time</i>, be justified in replicating the entire workflow in emails + Excel? I&#x27;m at least partially supposed to advise on security, and the only people who won&#x27;t recite this very rant at me as a reason to ignore all security advice, are the people who can&#x27;t be bothered to.<p>The one ray of light is that at least it&#x27;s easy enough to attach links to access-controlled spreadsheets now, rather the spreadsheets themselves, <i>possibly</i> protected with a password (usually, in that same email).<p>I thank you for listening to this &#x2F;rant.')
