Luckily after so time I decided that it may not be such a good idea ;).<p>Somehow related - long, long time ago in one of Google services I&#x27;ve used an account bound to my &#x27;external&#x27; email that I&#x27;ve been using actively back then. Just few days ago I had a need to login to this service. I know my login (and I still have access to those e-mail), I know my password, but since I haven&#x27;t used that account for a few years Google wants to send me a verification code on some phone number. Even that the last 2 digits displayed by Google on the verification screen match my phone number apparently I&#x27;ve made a mistake back then and provided a wrong phone number. There is a zero possibility to contact a human person at Google support and their docs in general provide a gentle &#x27;fuck off&#x27;. I understand (somewhat...) the scale they operate at, security concerns and hey, I&#x27;m not a customer really here. Still it is rather infuriating that I cannot do anything. Fortunately the account and that service is not <i>that</i> important... :&#x2F;<p>I&#x27;ve started to untangle myself from Google services some time ago and this incident will only accelerate this. Unfortunately - in general - our dependency on digital services will only increase anyway. With so many services providing some kind of &#x27;free&#x27; tiers and all the effort needed to backup your stuff spread across so many accounts it will only get worse.')
