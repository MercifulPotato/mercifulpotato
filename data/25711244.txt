For example, randos from twitter who went to parler to follow their favorite alt-right opinion producer but otherwise don&#x27;t care about politics probably won&#x27;t want to follow them a second time and will end up entering less radicalized spaces and then deradicalizing themselves.<p>At the end you have a small group of severely sick people who can only be helped by therapy, but prevent mass unrest of otherwise normal people who got radicalized only because getting radicalized was as easy as joining a platform.')
