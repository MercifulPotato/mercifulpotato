He claims to have taken no salary from Wikimedia [1], despite running one of the top internet sites by traffic. Wikipedia makes a fair chunk in donations, but none of their execs make more than about $200k or $300k, IIRC.<p>If anything, a top exec making $2 million at a tech non-profit might be actively attracting the <i>wrong</i> leadership to run Mozilla. Same with the other top execs. If Firefox share was increasing, perhaps you&#x27;d have a case otherwise. I kinda hope someone creates a viable Firefox fork and backing org, with better stewardship as I&#x27;ve long been a Firefox fan.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jimmy_wales&#x2F;status&#x2F;1118168799876976640?lang=en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jimmy_wales&#x2F;status&#x2F;1118168799876976640?l...</a>')
