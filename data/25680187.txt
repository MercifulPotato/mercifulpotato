I&#x27;m not worried about 50,000 votes stolen due to doublevoting somewhere or a mailtruck of votes getting lost. If victory falls on the 50.1% mark versus the 49.9% mark, that&#x27;s okay. I&#x27;m worried because we have a system which IS exploitable and which WILL be exploited, if it hasn&#x27;t already been.<p>Rigging US elections has incredible ROI for any foreign state actor, and simply isn&#x27;t hard.<p>For the record, I made equally tone deaf comments when 9&#x2F;11 happened and when COVID19 was in its early days. Now, they&#x27;re common sense to most people. I don&#x27;t want to wait for Russia, China, or North Korea to pick our next president before we do something.<p>Open source, transparency, and auditability won&#x27;t solve the problem 100%, but they&#x27;ll prevent most types of gross, blatant rigging. Cryptographic voting algorithms or paper trails will get us much of the rest of the way there. We don&#x27;t need perfect security, but we need to be in a place where a single point of compromise can&#x27;t break our democracy.')
