If I saw someone on the street wearing these, it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;d go up to them and be like &quot;why did you waste your money on those?&quot;.<p>Anyway, the issue for me is that these are supposed to be audiophile&#x2F;professional grade headphones - something you buy explicitly because you want the best audio quality. If you need these in the first place, then it&#x27;s worth doing 20 minutes of research to see if it&#x27;s the best quality for your money, or even in general.<p>I hate to say it, but I agree with the comments that mention these being more of a status symbol than anything. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that either, but that&#x27;s the reality. I mean, they are pretty much guaranteed to perform worse than high end Sennheisers while still costing more, so what else could it be?<p>I find the argument of &quot;I need professional grade headphones to do my job, but don&#x27;t have the time to research the best option&quot; just disappointing I guess.<p>I own AirPods Pro myself, but those are intended for a different market and are actually a decent value (compared to the Sony which has better sound quality but worse integration with Apple stuff).')
