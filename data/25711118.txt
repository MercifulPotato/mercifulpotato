It was many things. It was, most particularly, a ticket out of the world of the Microsoft sharecropper, needing to learn a whole new Microsoft Framework every second year, and discovering over again each time all the shit that didn&#x27;t work, that couldn&#x27;t be made to do what it was for, and cobbled-together ways to get around it instead.<p>I managed to never need to code on Microsoft until a bit around 2010, so missed the appeal.<p>I was amazed to discover that, even in 2010, nobody who had coded for MS their whole lives knew any better than I did how to get an MS OS to do any sensible thing. I would ask, and they would start rooting, trying random things until something seemed to work. The idea of a documented, stable, standard library component that actually did what it said without crashing was an absolute revelation, but the opposite of every shiny thing imposed on them before.')
