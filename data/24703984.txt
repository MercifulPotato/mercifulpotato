It may be because I&#x27;ve been doing Erlang so long but I still prefer it and its tools (like rebar3 and Common Test). I find the syntax more consistent, less verbose  and the lack of Elixir style macros to mean less confusing third party libraries.<p>But I do think Elixir has its strength in web applications. The macros make Phoenix and Ecto much simpler for building full web applications and if I were building a full fledged interactive web application I&#x27;d reach for those.<p>So mainly personal preference, you may find Elixir preferable, but all that to simply say it is not a &quot;strict improvement&quot;.<p>Oh, and one none personal preference reason: it is nice to do libraries that don&#x27;t benefit from being written in Elixir (like postgrex and jason get a lot of performance out of using macros so there isn&#x27;t an argument to write those in Erlang) and aren&#x27;t specific to Elixir (like a Plug adapter) in Erlang so they are more easily usable across BEAM languages, a list that continues to grow.')
