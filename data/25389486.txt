Awesome host and at that time, much cheaper than a hotel.<p>However I can&#x27;t get over the service and cleaning fees, especially as they are added on the second page. I don&#x27;t mind them, but why not include them on the listing page?<p>Not sure if it&#x27;s an US thing or if it&#x27;s something people actually falls for? This is a practice that is prevalent throughout industries, but one standing out of course is restaurants.\nThe menu price: 20USD BUT + SF mandate + service fees + sales tax + mandatory tips, the dish is actually at least 30USD ? Why not just put that on the menu? In Sweden for instance (and most of Europe) the price you see in stores and on menus is the price you pay. Someone starting the next AirBnB and just shows you the actual price on the front page that is on your statement of your credit card in the end, will be very successful (I hope!)')
