The gynocentric society that we live in provides much more opportunities and privileges to young girls as compared to young boys. Eg:<p>- There is a wage gap in favor of women for people younger than 30, that absolutely no one talks about.<p>- Young men are more likely to be victims of false accusations,\nbecause women are never reprimanded for falsely accusing anyone.<p>- Men get longer sentences for similar crimes as compared to women.<p>- Young men who want to start families are in tough luck because more and more women do not want to bear children until early to late thirties.')
