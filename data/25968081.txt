That\nyou could access the global audience of everyone who might want to run\nthat code over a low cost universal network. And that that audience\ncould switch to your product at a very low cost, because you could\nalways write the code that it would take to to port the old data\nformats and to connect the old services to your new product. It was a\nmarket where the best ideas would turn into companies that would find\ncustomers and change the world.<p>&gt;&gt; as these companies acquired new monopolies, they diverted their monopoly\nrents to foreclosing on competitive compatibility.<p>When talking about monopoly, people tend to focus on price, but modern\ntech monopolies don&#x27;t need to use traditional form of rent\nseeking. Exploitative prices don&#x27;t make sense when the monopolist\nundermines the entire market with &quot;free services&quot;. Instead, tech monopolies are\nabout <i>control</i> of what is allowed to participate in the market.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.ccc.de&#x2F;v&#x2F;rc3-11337-what_the_cyberoptimists_got_wrong_-_and_what_to_do_about_it" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.ccc.de&#x2F;v&#x2F;rc3-11337-what_the_cyberoptimists_got...</a>')
