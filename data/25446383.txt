I live in central London near a small street on the first floor and measured PM2.5 for a year, it barely ever went over 2ug&#x2F;m3, with 10ug&#x2F;m3 being safe long term threshold set by the WHO, which makes any PM2.5 air purification useless. Now, NO2 is a bit different and I haven&#x27;t measured it, but common household air purifiers do nothing for it.')
