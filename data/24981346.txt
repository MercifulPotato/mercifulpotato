The maximum RPM of the engine, propagated through the lowest gear ratio, gives a hard limit regardless of the &quot;real world&quot; variables like wind resistance and friction.<p>The point was really if the mechanical system can only &quot;turn&quot; to a maximum theoretical speed of e.g. 300mph, then they clearly and obviously didn&#x27;t exceed it, no matter what, unless the car transforms into an airplane at some point.')
