POWER9 integrates the PCIe and memory controllers onto the CPU die itself. This is one reason why then open source P9 computers from Raptor exist and have sort-of sane pricing (for such a tiny and niche market) -- a lot of the traditionally hard components are integrated onto the CPU, which makes designing boards around it that much easier vs needing complex chipsets.')
