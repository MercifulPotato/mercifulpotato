It&#x27;s however quite moody, Tuesday Wonderland is far more accessible while also being extremely good.<p>Haven&#x27;t listened to them in a while, but I also enjoyed listening to Tingvall Trio, though I remember them as being more atmospheric. There&#x27;s also Vijay Iyer Trio, I specifically remember Accelerando well, but that&#x27;s a long time ago.')
