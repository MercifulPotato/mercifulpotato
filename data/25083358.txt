If not, I feel like Uber rides would be full of people pushing multi-level marketing.<p>I can&#x27;t actually find the Uber driver agreement on the internet, but pyramid schemes are illegal, and drivers who peddle scummy garbage to passengers are liable to get bad reviews, so there is no reason to expect that a lack of this would have to be because Uber prohibits it.')
