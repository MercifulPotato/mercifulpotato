I did a stint of ruby on Rails work many years back, and remember seeing sequel for the first time. It&#x27;s documentation web page is honestly probably the best &quot;what is this&quot; and &quot;getting started&quot; page I have ever seen for any library.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the library itself or the documentation contents or the documentation website theme, but it jives absurdly well for me. I also really like the simplicity+flexibility of the library itself, and have yet to find anything even close to it in the c# or c++ world.')
