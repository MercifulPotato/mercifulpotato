If I&#x27;m playing a game where I&#x27;m good at one element of it (especially the element after which the genre is named), but I consistently lose against those who have no skill in that element because a different element is so strongly weighted it trumps almost all of the others, I&#x27;m probably not going to have a lot of fun playing it, and it&#x27;s probably going to lack wide-ranging appeal.<p>In fact, in modern RTS this effect is probably strongest at the lower performance levels. Just executing something, anything faster will win far more than any deeper understanding of the game and its systems or strategy.')
