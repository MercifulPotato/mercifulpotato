If your account doesn&#x27;t have 25% more money in it you&#x27;re losing out and someone else is gaining an advantage without working.<p>Only partially, because the money supply is actively managed. If it starts coming out an being used, the fed will step in and reduce the money supply to match their commitment targets. They both giveth and taketh away, to meet their 2% target. You are right to an extent that the closer you are to the money supply, the more you can benefit or lose - this is the cantillion effect people are on about these days in crypto land - but this effect is very small in aggregate.<p>&gt; At any given instant, that new money has to be somewhere controlled by someone. People would have to be a bit naive to try and hold their wealth in dollars with that sort of unfairness built in. And also even 2% inflation makes it a stupid strategy.<p>Which is why you&#x27;re not supposed to hold dollars. You&#x27;re supposed to spend them on investments. This, by the way, is the whole point of inflation - money only has any value at all when its moving.')
