So maybe more similarity between users? In more mainstream genres, say Hip Hop, Rock, Metal, EDM i feel it is much harder to break out of the loop of sameishness although the genres have much more to offer.<p>Also in either case, I&#x27;m pretty sure, the vast majority of songs out there have sub 10k views and basically never get recommended. Just top of mind a few songs, that based on the list above you might like, but I think I would never have discovered via algorithms, unless I already happend to start quite close.<p>Roel Funcken - Balaklavskiy prospex\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Z7WVGwb-9x8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Z7WVGwb-9x8</a><p>Subheim - Foray\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MQ7IHYSrquc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MQ7IHYSrquc</a><p>Klez.E - Nachtfahrt\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hi-8wkccjsw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hi-8wkccjsw</a><p>Altın Gün - Cemalim\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=j_J3-yr9GNI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=j_J3-yr9GNI</a><p>Ok, the last one is fairly large, but it came to mind :) I do discover quite a bit of new music on YouTube, but only when I deliberately select a starting song and go from there, on the main page there is rarely something interesting. If there is music at all. I&#x27;m sure it would get a lot better if I&#x27;d listen music primarily via YouTube.')
