We&#x27;re not looking for a small incremental improvement in contraction rate of the virus here, we&#x27;re looking for a very large percentage of those who have been administered the vaccine not getting covid. Yeah it could change behaviour but so what? How is that going to bias the result to suggest it isn&#x27;t working if it is? (or vice-versa)')
