At the time I had to the only way to do it is by getting an apointement online, expect the  website to get the apointement form is closed, it opne for less than 5 min while crashing continully on a sunday at midnight, after trying for I few month I sent emails explaining the situation -&gt; no reponse and went in person to the prefecture only to be told sorry that&#x27;s not our problem and was given no clue on how to try to fix this. thanks to covid the process for converting driving licenses is now fully online, I aplied when they first announced this beginning of last summer, I&#x27;m still waiting for any news positive or negative.')
