Don&#x27;t exchange convenience now, with shackles, for freedom later on.<p>In any case, not being able to install whatever he wants, or being forbidden from sharing things with friends because of DRM is a very immediate limitation even Joe Average will notice and complain about -- <i>unless</i> we, the people who know better, &quot;train&quot; him to accept this is the way things are and there&#x27;s nothing to be done about it. And we really, really shouldn&#x27;t do this.<p>As for your second point, two thoughts:<p>- Free software has already succeeded. The tech world we live in couldn&#x27;t exist without it. If you work with computers, your job likely wouldn&#x27;t exist without free software -- or if it existed, you wouldn&#x27;t recognize it or want to work in it.<p>- There&#x27;s a lot already said, by better thinkers than you and me, about quality vs freedom. Because free&#x2F;libre software is a philosophical point of view, quality comes <i>after</i>, not <i>before</i> freedom. This is precisely the kind of thing people like RMS pointed out about the differences between libre and merely &quot;open source&quot; software. Please consider what better thinkers have already said in battles already waged decades ago before rehashing the same arguments.')
