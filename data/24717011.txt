Item(by='gambiting', descendants=None, kids=[24717038], score=None, time=1602144563, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24716974, text='My local council barely has enough money to patch potholes in the streets, they are switching the lights off at night to save money. Yet somehow.....they will build this expensive to build and maintain infrastructure?<p>I imagine the first answer people will have is &quot;it&#x27;s simple! We will just let the private sector handle this!&quot; - to which I say, this is an absolutely awful idea. The charging infrastructure is already handled like this and it&#x27;s an absolute mess - every charger requires a different app, from a different provider, they all have different rules and requirements, if you turn up to a charger that you don&#x27;t already have an account for, good luck spending the next 15-20 minutes setting up an account and hoping it actually works(instead of giving you &quot;unknown error occurred&quot; like it happens in my experience, just yesterday I wanted to use a &quot;public&quot; charger but failed because the 1 star android app by that provider kept crashing - it&#x27;s a shitshow basically). The best thing that could happen to it is either all charging infrastructure being nationalized, or at least the government introducing very strict standards like they do with petrol stations.')
