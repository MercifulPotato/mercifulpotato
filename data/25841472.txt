Don&#x27;t consider yourself to understand an issue until you&#x27;ve heard a compelling argument on both sides, or have thoroughly convinced yourself that you&#x27;ve adequately searched through diverse enough fora. Don&#x27;t read anything, from Alex Jones&#x27;s Facebook page to the frontpage of the NYT, without spot-checking sources, reading studies, etc. There&#x27;s no filter that ensures that journalists are the best humanity has to offer: just like all humans, plenty of them are incompetent or dishonest, and beyond that groupthink exists in cultures that get as insular and self-aggrandizing as journalism&#x27;s. Correctly combine a variety of low-quality signals and you can get a really high-quality signal.<p>That being said, some general recommendations for individual sources are (in ascending order of obscurity) The Atlantic, Foreign Affairs, and Marginal Revolution (economist Tyler Cowen&#x27;s blog). I find they do a better job than most of:<p>1) representing different opinions intellectually honestly<p>2) being thorough in their reasoning and analysis<p>and&#x2F;or<p>3) being fairly high-quality')
