The speed of the exhaust is relative to the frame of reference of your rocket which is an accelerating frame, that speed is always the same when measured against the stationary rocket in that frame.  When measured from a fixed inertial frame the speed changes as your rocket accelerates.<p>For a more concrete example, for a moon rocket the speed of the rocket exhaust is around 3 or 4 km&#x2F;s. On the ground the speed of the rocket is obviously 0, in low earth orbit the speed of the rocket is 7 or 8 km&#x2F;s, and to initiate the transfer orbit to the moon you have to accelerate to about 10 km&#x2F;s. (these would all be in earth centered, nonrotating frame speed measurements)<p>The rocket exhaust doesn’t have to get faster to get you to those higher speeds because you’re taking it with you.<p>The more you can increase the rocket exhaust relative to yourself though, the more efficient your rocket is.')
