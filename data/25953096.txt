That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m saying you reap what you sow: you wanted a world where people can be deplatformed, and you got it.</i><p>I don&#x27;t &quot;want a world where people can be deplatformed&quot;. I am 100% in favour of better censorship resistance, open messaging, etc and I 100% think whatever &quot;bad&quot; comes out of a system like that would be far outweighed by the good it brings.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m against Facebook deplatforming assholes. Hell I&#x27;m against Facebook as a whole, but as far as their current role in society plays? They have a stupid amount of influence over large swathes of the population and that&#x27;s a problem.<p>The problem is no matter how I phrase this, you&#x27;ll think I&#x27;m in favour of Facebook &quot;censoring people&quot;; whereas my position is that Facebook has <i>actively given new tools</i> for assholes to spread hateful messages, including not just the groups systems but active recommendations, advertising, sorting algorithms which prioritize engagement (read: flamewars), etc.<p>In short: I&#x27;m in favour of Signal <i>and</i> against Facebook. How&#x27;s that contradictory?')
