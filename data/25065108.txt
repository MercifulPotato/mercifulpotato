Over years that opinion can change drastically and nobody bats an eye (eg: the russians easily hacked the election, that&#x27;s why the bad guy won - it&#x27;s almost impossible for someone to hack the election, that&#x27;s why the bad guy lost). \nThey also promote all the trendy family destroying &#x2F; sexual liberation stuff which was my kool aid as a teenager and that I find depressing and socially damaging nowadays.\nOn top of this they push for governments to hoard more money to redistribute to the people they like, which is just appaling.\nIn the last years they started being incredibly anti free speech and limiting personal freedom (taxes on alchohol, sugar, etc) which I find jarring and totally opposed to all the personal freedom they talk about (eg. on drugs).<p>Conservatives news are much more data and fact based and they have a passion for debating. I&#x27;m grossed out by how much religious they are (which is not proven by facts by definition) and by how much they like to have the government tell people what is legal and what is not (outside of someone damaging someone else). I don&#x27;t see why anyone should tell<p>Libertarian news is again, very fact based, very coherent, nobody talks about religion, they support drugs and personal freedom, it&#x27;s the perfect mix of economic freedom and personal freedom.\nToo bad nobody votes for them.')
