Strictly speaking it only means you&#x27;d be able to run another instance of Darwin in a container. And, as you surely know because your tone of voice implies you bear immense knowledge, a Docker-style container is not a full OS: it doesn&#x27;t run an init or normal system daemons, so it wouldn&#x27;t even be a full instance of Darwin, so it wouldn&#x27;t have to support functionality only needed by launchd or system daemons (e.g. WindowServer). It would just need to let you run a stanalone program in a chroot + separate network, PID, and IPC namespace + apply resource controls.<p>Furthermore, since most people are using Docker for developing software that&#x27;s going to run on Linux, there would be no real need to virtualize the parts of XNU that aren&#x27;t also provided on Linux - notably all the Mach stuff. You&#x27;d just need to provide a BSD-style syscall API to programs in a container.')
