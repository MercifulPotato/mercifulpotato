So you get this weird set of fears that encompasses the worst of both.<p>The house-as-residence aspect makes them fearful that you won&#x27;t make your mortgage payments, or your mortgage will end up under water, and the bank will foreclose on you and you&#x27;ll be homeless.  The house-as-investment aspect makes them fearful that they&#x27;ll take a loss or even break even come sale time, and then their retirement nest egg will be weak.<p>So I agree that <i>fundamentally</i> yes, people are buying a house to live in, but it&#x27;s a lot more loaded than that.<p>If housing costs were more reasonable, perhaps we could turn the tide against this &quot;primary-home-as-investment&quot; attitude, which I believe to be counterproductive.')
