You could have nice browser plugins for listing all your available passwords and single click logins, etc.. Everything that lastpass&#x2F;1password does from a UI standpoint.<p>The difference would be that decrypting&#x2F;unlocking passwords would require you to physically tap on the device each time to approve the unlock- and the screen would say &quot;Unlock password for github.com?&quot;. Basically, this system makes it impossible for some trojan remote-control virus to be able to get your passwords, even if they have your master password. The BEST they can hope for is just to sit quietly on your PC for months, slowly storing all the passwords you decide to unlock.<p>Alas, doesnt seem like this device is going to exist any time soon. As I said, the best bet was trezor but they dont seem to care about it anymore. Too bad, they were so close.')
