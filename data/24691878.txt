Taking things to the limit to demonstrate the absurdity of absolutist statements like the one you made is a perfectly acceptable thing to do and is not &quot;spin&quot;. You said &quot;no amount of money&quot; and I took that at face value. If that&#x27;s not what you meant then that&#x27;s fine, there&#x27;s no disagreement between us.<p>From reading the many other replies to your comment, everyone else was left with the same impression by what you said.')
