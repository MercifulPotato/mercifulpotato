You haven&#x27;t fallen prey to scams because you are experienced with avoiding scams.<p>I guarantee there are people who are a hell of a lot smarter than you, know a hell of a lot more about many areas than you, who have very little experience avoiding internet scams (for one reason or another) who might well fall prey to them.  Given enough experience would they learn how to avoid them?  Yes.  But in the mean time, their lack of that experience does not mean they deserve to fall prey to those scams - nor that we shouldn&#x27;t go after and punish the scammers.')
