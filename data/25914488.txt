I had the same kind of thing, but more of an acute event precipitated by stressful work, late night partying&#x2F;drinking, and years of sleep apnea. The device was magic. The morning after the first night wearing it felt like heaven.<p>I _highly_ recommend calling around and finding a &quot;sleep dentist&quot; who will bill the device as a medical device (not a dental device). This is the only way to get American health insurance to pay for it (they are ~$5k). The down-side is you can only use the device for ~10 years before you get permanent forward lower jaw displacement. But those 10 years allowed me to get everything in order and gracefully switch to a nasal pillow CPAP (which is also heaven once you get the settings right).<p>If you live in the Boston area or LA area, I can recommend a fantastic sleep dentist that specializes in these devices.
