I keep a cluttered house because I&#x27;m OK with that. Not to mention that housework takes very little mental effort - in fact, it is a grand time to daydream and get ideas (like showering). These are not the same beasts at all.<p>The second job is closer to homework, so long as you are doing it most nights and it takes some mental effort.  And gee, it seems that having two jobs will pretty much kill creativity also and cause folks to burn out. At least with a second job, you are probably older. Teens and pre-teens simply aren&#x27;t there mentally.')
