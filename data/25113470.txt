I was used for an experiment in the year 1986 by the head ophthalmologist of the biggest clinic in the second largest city of the country where I am from.  I was supposed to be screened every 6 months.  From one of these &quot;screenings&quot;, I came back with signed of an invasive operation.  Weeks later, I was 100% blind.  It turned out that this ophthalmologist in chief did all sorts of malicious things.\nI even met another of his victims at my time in the school for the blind.  And no, before you ask, he was never convicted for anything.<p>This is not a backward country mind you.  At least we believe we are not.  And we have a socialized medical system, so we pay nothing for hospital visits.')
