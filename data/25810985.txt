(A small--but user-visible--cost; the requirement for a spare USB port of the right form factor; loss.)<p>However, authenticators that are built into the client device (e.g. Apple&#x27;s support for a TouchID-verified WebAuthn authenticator) solve these problems, to varying degrees: the user doesn&#x27;t see a marginal cost (it&#x27;s built into the computer!) and doesn&#x27;t have to worry about loss, USB ports, etc.<p>The principle challenge with using (as an example) Safari&#x27;s WebAuthn support is what how the relying party should support loss of the device. (If you lose your Safari--or claim to--how does your bank authenticate you?)<p>Ultimately, the lost-device--or new-device bootstrapping--problem is currently what stands in the way of a truly secure ecosystem, but with platform providers increasingly supporting WebAuthn, we can at least <i>reduce</i> phishing risk to &quot;phishing of the platform provider credential.&quot; Your iCloud password might get stolen, but at least that&#x27;s the _only_ thing an attacker can steal to gain access to your other accounts.<p>For most services, delegating authentication (and anti-phishing) to someone like Apple is a big plus.')
