If you&#x27;re happy painting a masterpiece even if nobody sees it, then you only really need advice on how to make beautify art.<p>I think most artists want an audience, and that requires skills on the business side. Having a successful business also pays to create more art. I can&#x27;t help you there!<p>If you look at the app store top 100, there aren&#x27;t that many &quot;fun&quot; or original games up there. There&#x27;s even a tonne of idle click games! I think one thing that&#x27;s important to recognize is that most people playing mobile games don&#x27;t see the experience as a &#x27;game&#x27;. It&#x27;s more of a passive ride to distract themselves for a few minutes. Idle click games aren&#x27;t fun in a traditional sense, but they have isolated a reward feedback loop in your brain and serve some function to make its users enjoy the experience.<p>I didn&#x27;t work at Zynga on game design, so I&#x27;m not here to defend corporate mobile game design. However, I don&#x27;t want to knock the business side of things too much either. I learned there&#x27;s a ton of creativity in creating new hooks and game modes to increase engagement&#x2F;spending. Games constantly riff off each others game loops and it&#x27;s a very quickly evolving field. There&#x27;s also lots of room for creativity in making successful advertising campaigns.')
