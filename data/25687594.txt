Combined with the technology and software, I haven&#x27;t seen any car that competes. It is still absolutely amazing to me how much code goes into traditional ICE cars and they still can&#x27;t create a coherent, usable, interface.<p>I will say that Ford has drastically improved in the last few years (I own a fairly new Explorer ST) but much of what they&#x27;ve done you can clearly see is copying what Tesla has done. Even still it is miles away from what Tesla has done.')
