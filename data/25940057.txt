Item(by='haspok', descendants=None, kids=[25940107], score=None, time=1611827544, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25939918, text='&gt; Tesla early on asked other car manufacturers if they wanted &quot;in&quot; on their charging network...<p>This is the problem. Nobody asked _me_, the consumer.<p>In reality this should be strictly regulated. Just as there are no manufacturer-specific gas stations, there shouldn&#x27;t be manufacturer specific chargers either.<p>If somebody builds a charger network, they should make it possible for anybody to charge there (of course, the prices can be different for each customer).<p>This is in essence what Ionity does in Europe. I&#x27;m surprised that the EU regulations have not caught up with this yet.')
