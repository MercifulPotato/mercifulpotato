No one is telling Parler they&#x27;re not free to do what they want. AWS is telling Parler they don&#x27;t want them as a customer. That is not censorship. Whether a business should be able to refuse a customer is an interesting question. People on the political right have historically believed they should (refusing to make a wedding cake for a gay couple is often cited as a case of such freedom).<p>There is also an argument that AWS is now so big and important that they should be treated like a utility, and then refusing customers <i>is</i> something that they shouldn&#x27;t necessarily be allowed to do. I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about that argument though.')
