Item(by='dredmorbius', descendants=None, kids=[25008757], score=None, time=1604678373, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25007653, text='The first <i>Connections</i> series (and the book), and <i>The Day  the Universe Changed</i>, are both excellent.<p>Connections2 and Connections3 flag somewhat.  Both were produced for TLC, at a point before its Honey Boo Boo slide, though off its peak.  One ran shorter (~25 minute) episodes, which is unfortunate, and there was an excessive fascination with early-1990s CGI effects.  Still a net positive.<p>The series  is often findable on YouTube.<p>A notable omission from all four series is much reference to Chinese science and technology, or <i>any</i> reference to Burke&#x27;s compatriot Joseph Needham, who compiled the definitive study of these topics, <i>Science and Civilisation in China</i>, a monumental work I&#x27;ve only learned of in the past five years or so.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Science_and_Civilisation_in_China" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Science_and_Civilisation_in_Ch...</a>')
