Once you are in a speed limit - your car can&#x27;t go faster.<p>This is actually dangerous because people need the ability to use discretion.<p>Suppose you&#x27;re transporting a part to repair a machine which is causing a fatality every five seconds as long as it&#x27;s offline. Getting there 20 seconds faster saves four lives. Do you still want a chip that prevents you from exceeding the speed limit?<p>&gt;  Oh wait, this wont generate revenue - so it wont work. Never mind.<p>This is a major reason why the US doesn&#x27;t have many speed cameras either. Also why most of the speed limits are set 10-15 MPH below the ordinary speed of travel. If violations are prolific and enforcement is sporadic, they can generate fine revenue whenever they want.<p>If enforcement is automatic then people figure that out and do what&#x27;s necessary to avoid the fine, but then you&#x27;re left with an expensive boondoggle that isn&#x27;t generating revenue.<p>It also deprives the police of the excuse they currently have to pull over cars at whim when everybody is speeding at all times, and they wouldn&#x27;t be happy to lose that at all.')
