I&#x27;ve often wondered if it&#x27;s feasible to create a plug-in that recognizes TOS agreements and <i>clicks the Accept button</i> for you.<p>It should also make a record showing that you never saw the agreement and did not click the button. Maybe it could aggregate these records to show that for a given website there are thousands of users who have never seen the TOS.<p>Given that most people seem to think these click-through agreements are already pretty weak from a legal standpoint, I wonder how much more it would take to make them completely worthless.')
