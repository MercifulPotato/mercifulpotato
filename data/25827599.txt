The automakers almost certainly outsourced the inventory risk and <i>nobody</i> is holding inventory anywhere.<p>If the automaker is the only customer having a parts problem, then the distributor has risk because a penalty by the automaker will absorb their profit from other customers.<p>If <i>every</i> customer is having a parts problem, the distributor can just laugh and say &quot;Penalize us and we&#x27;ll drop you and maybe declare bankruptcy.  Have fun getting a new distributor in this mess after you penalize us.&quot;<p>Welcome to Always Late (aka Just In Time) Inventory.')
