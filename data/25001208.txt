He suggests the effective address space of IPv4 is closer to 52 bits.<p>On the flip side, in IPv6 the recommendation is for ISPs to hand out &#x2F;48&#x27;s. Add a few hosts inside there, and you got an effective address space that&#x27;s roughly the same as the effective IPv4+NAT address space.<p>Don&#x27;t shoot the messenger, listen to the podcast.')
