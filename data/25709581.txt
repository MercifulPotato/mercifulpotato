That&#x27;s the line at which we ban accounts (see [1] for more explanation), regardless of which politics or ideology they&#x27;re battling for. We have to, because this sort of use of the site—or rather abuse, given its intended purpose—destroys what HN is supposed to exist for. I&#x27;ve therefore banned your account.
