And macros are a &quot;bandage&quot; that make the problem worse.<p>&gt; include files should never include include files<p>Cool, there are two possible outtakes to this:<p>1) Why aren&#x27;t include files generated automatically from C files then? (If you can&#x27;t include anything this means they shouldn&#x27;t have no &quot;code&quot;, so they can&#x27;t call anything, so they can&#x27;t include anything or reference anything else)<p>2) Why aren&#x27;t they a compilation target? (yes I know modern GCC allows you to do that) but why doesn&#x27;t C specify a binary representation for them.')
