I have several sponsor tiers and $10 a month or more will get you access to my sponsorware, which means you will be added to the private repository and can use the features immediately. What you&#x27;re effectively getting is early access, so you can use the features before other users.<p>The official documentation of my project lists exactly which features are &quot;Insiders only&quot;, and which aren&#x27;t. When the features tied to the funding goal that was hit are merged, everybody can use them. I try to always have sponsors-only features on higher tiers to keep sponsoring attractive.<p>As I understand, Caleb does it with content and entire projects - I&#x27;m doing it with new features for an existing project. Also, I&#x27;m doing it fully transparent, disclosing how much I earn with this, which I think is crucial to build the necessary trust relationship.')
