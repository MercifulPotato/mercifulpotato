A vast majority of software ships after it has been built as a stand alone application as well as a Docker container so that it can be run in container environments.<p>A lot of CI systems natively support Docker because of the variety of tools and images you have available to run you CI steps in.<p>Docker is an excellent distribution tool because it only requires Docker.<p>You can send someone some python code and ask them to run it, only to find they&#x27;re missing a bunch of C libs required to build and run the code which is a pain to help them figure out how to solve.<p>Docker solves many of these problems but has a drawback of being more &#x27;bloated&#x27; than other distribution mechanisms. It doesn&#x27;t make it a bad one though.')
