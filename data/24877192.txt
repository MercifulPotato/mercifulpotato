Do they save on royalties and licensing by only having one channel for music?<p>If they didn&#x27;t bundle YouTube Premium with the music subscription I would have ditched it and switched to Spotify.  As it is, I&#x27;m considering getting a phone with enough storage and just switching back to mp3s.  Google still doesn&#x27;t understand what music lovers want(like not skipping to the next track abruptly if there is a momentary connection issue).')
