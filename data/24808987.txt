For example, I need to run desktop MS Office, so Windows and Mac are viable options for my main machine, but Linux is not.<p>LibreOffice&#x2F;OpenOffice is not sufficiently compatible (receiving an e-mailed complex Word or Excel document, changing a single letter, and sending it back is not guaranteed to not change anything else), so that&#x27;s it, the &#x27;network effect&#x27; locks me in.<p>I could run Windows in a VM on Linux, or Linux on Windows; but that&#x27;s a bit inconvenient, so OS X gives a good compromise for that.')
