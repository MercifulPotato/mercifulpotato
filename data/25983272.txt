Then I quickly had a realization that the forces at play were far too overwhelming for the measly amount of precious metals I could purchase to ever be meaningful. Sort of like that feeling you get when a big wave crashes right on top of you and pins you to the sand. The difference in power between yourself, no matter how built, strong, and good of a swimmer you might be, and the wave, are just so huge, that there really was never any point in trying to resist it anyways.')
