Not sure if Max Weber would have done the same, most probably not (he was really versed in English constitutional law, his &quot;Economy and Society&quot; has lots of quotes to Maitland&#x27;s &quot;History of English Law&quot;), but he didn&#x27;t strike me as a fervent supporter of democracy rights either.<p>And there was also the definite jump made by Heidegger, not exactly a legal scholar but a very well-read person nonetheless (and a mentor to Hannah Arendt, among others).')
