Regulations created to address proven problems are one thing. Creating a new regulation because somebody dreamed up a theoretical scenario is a different thing.<p>Progress involves risk. Cowering and doing nothing because someone, somewhere might possibly be harmed is as bad as having no regulation, if not worse. We wouldn&#x27;t have airplanes at all if someone were running after the Wright brothers telling them it&#x27;s not safe.<p>How does &quot;Maybe we don&#x27;t need 800 bazillion regulations that make it impossible to do anything&quot; get translated to &quot;Oh, so you want a wild west cowboy world where everyone does whatever they want and there are no regulations at all?&quot; Try and have at least a little bit of nuance.<p>Neither I nor TFA are arguing to abolish all regulations. Just recognize that regulation has a cost. It&#x27;s not an unalloyed good. When speed matters, like getting a vaccine to end a global pandemic, that cost is measured in lives just as surely as the cost of a lack of regulation is.')
