Our territory was actually attacked. All the other noise around what FDR did or didn’t want to do goes out the window; we were attacked by an equal or near equal contemporary power.<p>2. Up until Midway, it was a more or less even fight with the Japanese. Had we lost Midway, there’s a decent chance the Pacific war could have gone very differently.<p>3. Our technical superiority over our adversaries was not as obvious before the war as it is in hindsight looking back at the War. There probably wasn’t a scenario in which the Japanese, let alone the Germans landed on American beaches, but part of that was that we fought back. We didn’t take Pearl Harbor on the chin and just lie down and let the Japanese have the run of the Pacific.<p>Everything after that is a big what if. What if Germany won the Battle of Britain and consolidated control over Europe with virtually no opposition on the Western Front? I’m not going to waste my time or yours entertaining that question. If we faced an existential threat after the Revolutionary War or 1812, WWII was that threat.')
