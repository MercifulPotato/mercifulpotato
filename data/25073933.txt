All it takes to do math research is time, knowledge, writing material, and, preferably, the support of an institution which allows one to do research full time.  There are no pesky experiments to run, except possibly inside a computer.  Physics can be the same way, but, even when it involves &quot;pesky experiments,&quot; those experiments only depend on the physical laws of the universe, and the labor of a fleet of graduate students who have great incentives to see these experiments through.  SWE research has either of these properties.')
