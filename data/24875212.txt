The main one I can see is that the RIAA is accusing ytdl of being a DRM circumvention tool while Popcorn Time is just a straightforward P2P infringement tool. That doesn’t make the DMCA notice any more valid.<p>I guess I’m nitpicking but it’s important that they’re not “filing suit”, possibly because they don’t care enough or don’t think they have a case. DMCA takedown is a sort of dispute resolution process mandated by law, it’s not a substitute for an actual lawsuit.')
