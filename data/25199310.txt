You need to expend energy to concentrate the CO2, but it&#x27;s less than you gain from combustion.<p>In practice, it&#x27;s more difficult to come out energy positive overall if we&#x27;re capturing CO2 at atmospheric concentrations rather than from flue gases&#x2F;etc at the time of combustion.  Regardless, though, &quot;driving roads in reverse&quot; is not a good analogy.  We don&#x27;t need to expend anywhere remotely as much energy as was generated from the original combustion.')
