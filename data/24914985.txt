We haven&#x27;t started down that road in any serious way as a society, even though the technology is commercial and past early-adopter pricing.  But living in that house, it&#x27;s no different to living in any other nice house -- a McMansion has a big reception hall, my passive solar house has a airlock&#x2F;mudroom -- that&#x27;s not a difference in lifestyle, just in detail.<p>The second problem is transport. At a personal level this might mean EVs, except that they are so very expensive. You might afford to replace one of the family&#x27;s cars, but not all of them.  Public transport would appear to be an alternative, but if you don&#x27;t have access to that already, then the build time for that is over a decade.  So there&#x27;s going to be an uncomfortable interim of, say, twenty years. Which I suspect will be filled with bikes and e-bikes, as adding bike lanes and bikeways are minor projects.  There are times when your description of personal transport as &quot;scaled up&quot; is very true.<p>There are many small annoyances from being slightly ahead of the bulk of the population. But one of the things Covid-19 has done has been to make local government is far more open to change: they&#x27;ve flipped from sending me letters about my vegetable garden in my front yard, to asking me if I&#x27;d be happy for their staff to tour it and collect ideas.')
