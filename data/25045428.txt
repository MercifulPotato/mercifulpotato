Printer manufacturers are in the business of loss leading as far as I can see. They probably don&#x27;t make any significant profit on the printer itself, judging by what I&#x27;ve paid for printers in the last few years. The price of the printer is subsidised by the projected profits from the ink&#x2F;toner. And they are not insignificant, I agree. But in the current market, selling printers at an unsubsidised price probably won&#x27;t work commercially. We&#x27;ve gotten used to cheap printers and expensive ink&#x2F;toner I guess and it&#x27;s difficult to come off them. There&#x27;[s no such thing as a free lunch etc..')
