If you trust the infra for root certs, it makes no sense to ever expire cross-signings <i>as long as you have a signed timestamp</i> to prove the signing happened before the (cross-)signing cert expired.<p>For example, Microsoft recognizes authenticode-signed binaries even if the signing certificate is long since expired <i>if</i> the signature includes an optional timestamp from an also recognized root cert (usually digicert or Symantec née Verisign) because you can verify the binary hasn’t since changed (because it includes the sha-x in the signature and the timestamp verifies that the signing took place before the certificate expired). It’s quite clever and provides a very good solution for running decades old apps from now defunct software houses that once took pains to sign their releases.<p>A certificate itself is such a “binary” that really is just testifying that the at x date, y party trusted z (unless a revocation was subsequently issued or the algorithm used is no longer considered secure).')
