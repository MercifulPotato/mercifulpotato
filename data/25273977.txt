It&#x27;s the freedom to move resources around. It&#x27;s the freedom of not having to wait for your procurement process and approval from a purchasing department. It&#x27;s the freedom of not having to wait for your operations team to plug in and configure bare metal.<p>I don&#x27;t understand your point. How is any random cloud provider, or even hosting company, a blocker to moving resources around or wait for procurement or to iterate?<p>I&#x27;m looking at the Hetzner cloud dashboard and I&#x27;m free to launch how many instances I need at the drop of a hat.<p>In the end there&#x27;s an itemized bill, which unlike AWS you pay only for what you ordered up front and you can reason about without having to endure advance courses or freaking machine learning tools.<p>Where exactly are you seeing any freedom at all on AWS?')
