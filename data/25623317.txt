If the killer app is JVM interop, nothing but JVM based languages should even be on the table. The &quot;why Clojure?&quot; question just becomes &quot;because Clojure is the best language <i>on the JVM</i>,&quot; which is not too interesting of a topic IMO.<p>Haskell has decent interop with C&#x2F;C++ languages, but certainly nobody uses haskell <i>because</i> of that.')
