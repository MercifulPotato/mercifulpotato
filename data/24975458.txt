A message is exchanged between counterparties, who verify its authenticity; they now know what they need to know. Allowing unrelated parties to reliably verify the message is conceding information to them. This is, for example, the reason that OTR deliberately leaks secrets after they&#x27;re used.<p>It&#x27;s easy to see an example scenario: someone steals your laptop, then posts your mail spool publicly. You&#x27;d like to be able to say &quot;you can&#x27;t trust any of these messages&quot;, to mitigate the damage.<p>What I think confuses people is the fact that there are settings where non-repudiation is crucial to the security model. We&#x27;re used to abstract cryptographic promises that apply universally to all systems. But this one doesn&#x27;t.')
