It&#x27;s not a legal debt, and it&#x27;s not denominated in dollars and cents... but you shouldn&#x27;t be surprised that there are norms of repaying this debt in various ways and that people&#x2F;entities that excessively &quot;take&quot; from the commons incur reputational damage.<p>&gt; I just wanted to say that in general, yes those social norms are often against what I&#x27;d consider a free society, since they are just another axis of power to force you into behaviors you might not have agreed to participate in.<p>This just feels like hyperbole to me.  Expecting acknowledgment from someone when they&#x27;ve benefitted from something you&#x27;ve done is not an unreasonable ask.  Getting shamed when you don&#x27;t do this isn&#x27;t a significant curtailment of liberty.')
