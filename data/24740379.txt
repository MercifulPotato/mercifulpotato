There may be a similar problem with the way we work: a normal job may be as bad for us intellectually as white flour or sugar is for us physically.</i><p>This is the part I agree with most. In your 30s, you start to see a bifurcation whereby the people who take the corporate grind seriously go into cognitive atrophy, while those who have a fuck-it attitude keep getting smarter but become less employable (due to age and their shitty job histories). You do turn into a moron if you buy into whatever role the corporates are willing to give you. The more you believe in it, the faster you lose intelligence. It&#x27;s probably optimal to be able to pretend you buy into corporate, while not actually investing yourself in it at all, but most nerds aren&#x27;t very good at this code-switching.<p><i>It was remarkable how different they seemed. Particularly lions. Lions in the wild seem about ten times more alive. They&#x27;re like different animals. I suspect that working for oneself feels better to humans in much the same way that living in the wild must feel better to a wide-ranging predator like a lion. Life in a zoo is easier, but it isn&#x27;t the life they were designed for.</i><p>I thought it was lobsters the libertarians were all on about.<p><i>Anyone who&#x27;s worked for a large organization has felt this. You can feel the difference between working for a company with 100 employees and one with 10,000, even if your group has only 10 people.</i><p>Corporate is corporate. It&#x27;s all trash. It shouldn&#x27;t exist. Capitalism is a dinosaur. That said, it&#x27;s usually better to work for a large company than a small one. In a big company, you can move around. There&#x27;s more diversity of work, and there&#x27;s more organizational experience with outlier talent. (That doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;ll be recognized as outlier talent. If you work at Google and have a 160 IQ but mediocre paperwork, you&#x27;ll probably just get a regular assignment.) At a 20-person venture-funded company, there isn&#x27;t much choice of work to do, and there isn&#x27;t much room to move or grow except by becoming a manager. Which means it&#x27;s not really any different from the old corporate grind-- it just has worse benefits and more ways to fall between the cracks (and that&#x27;s by design).')
