You don&#x27;t have the same IO latency between nodes using VMs unless you start messing around with artificial attempts at inducing latency on each node individually.<p>It&#x27;s much easier to accurately simulate real world networking by not bothering to simulate and just using real world networking.<p>There&#x27;s a huge difference between latency on a wire vs latency within a hypervisor, and you won&#x27;t know what you&#x27;ve papered over through lower latency via VM until you move to real hardware.')
