I think that will stay even with value only being pegged to the US Dollar, but there is less need for that<p>Indeed, that was their most unique feature.<p>A stablecoin pegged to a basket of fiat (say just USD, CAD, EUR, GBP, JPY, SGD), using traditional crypto tools (burning, pegging) definitely has a place and a bright future ahead.<p>However, there&#x27;s no need for facebook - defi may be able to do that with smart contracts over wrapped stablecoins (say USDC for the USD, etc.)<p>Hell, even USD, EUR, JPY would still be <i>EXTREMELY</i> valuable and useful.')
