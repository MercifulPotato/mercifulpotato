Literally the worse kind of grift and project paralysis. I worked on government contracts in the 90s, and the process is so full of grifters and people over billing, companies selling software licenses far above market rate with supposed levels of support and reliability that are actually no better, or worse, that I wouldn’t recommend anyone work in that sector.<p>Oh and all of this talk about 95% of the work being understanding the problem or integrating with legacy government systems, gimme a break.

Addiction to hyper complexity, too many layers, too many points of failure.<p>Just how complicated does a vaccine management system need to be? If you’re adding more and more requirements, it’s not software that’s the problem, it’s the requirements that the vaccine distribution is being made more complicated than it is needs to be.<p>I think at this point, a random distribution would be more effective than the complicated rollout they’re trying.')
