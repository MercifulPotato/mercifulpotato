Or, we have launched something, but we didn&#x27;t validate what we should have validated. In other words, we have no traction that shows 1) that we can grow a business, or 2) that our hypothesis is correct about the users and market.<p>The final nail in the coffin: Timing.\nOur venture is in Travel Tech, which is not the most promising industry to be in 2020. We believe that this represents an opportunity, but others may disagree. And I believe, from the viewpoint of YC, that with 2 red flags already identified, the 3rd one can only be identified as a negative too.<p>Now I ask myself, as a serial failed entrepreneur, with some OK experiences under his belt, and a serious imposter complex: &quot;Will I ever be accepted?&quot; Should I perhaps hang up the hat and try with another project? Or try to correct the above errs and try again? I can fix the 2 issue, and I am trying to fix that now. But I doubt I can fix the 1st, and biggest issue. Should I then just hope that me, and my passion will shine through? Or should I apply with another startup? Another idea, which I might be less passionate about, but that might have a bigger chance, because of Team, Traction and Timing?\nAnd I continue thinking: &quot;Does it even matter if I ever get accepted into YC?&quot; Should it matter? Is it the recognition I am looking for? The applause? The validation? Or perhaps it is a Napoleon complex which is driving me towards YC...\nAnyways, I am left with mildly damaged self-esteem, but I&#x27;ll continue doing the only thing I think I can do at this time, keep moving forward...<p>Thank you for reading, any feedback will be appreciated')
