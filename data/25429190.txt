The process is: politicians levy taxes and excise, divert the revenue to linked entities, pay Facebook out of the proceeds. Or they extract money from companies under threat of expropriation via adverse regulation and litigation. In developing countries this is blatant; in developed countries it is disguised (as lobbying, consulting fees etc.).<p>In fairness, there is an argument that at least some political advertising is consumption by politically engaged citizenry who don&#x27;t stand to gain financially from the result; witness spending on unwinnable Senate races in the latest election, for example. But in general you have to assume that political advertising comes with some expectation of return, which comes out of the everyday citizen&#x27;s pocket.')
