Do your employees say &quot;merry christmas&quot; or &quot;happy holidays&quot;?<p>I really don&#x27;t believe many people care about this. I work with people of every major faith, and it has literally never been an issue. if you want to be extra neutral, you can get rid of company holidays and just give everyone a little extra PTO. this way the company doesn&#x27;t have to play the delicate game of deciding which faith&#x27;s holidays to recognize.<p>tl;dr: I don&#x27;t think any of this stuff is terribly hard to sidestep. many tech companies choose not to; I suspect they feel they benefit from playing the game.')
