If I loan the share to someone else and they sell it then it is still only sold once.<p>The share can then, afterwards, be loaned out and sold again. This causes it to be “double sold” and you’ll see something like the 140%.<p>Alice loans share to Bob, Bob sells to Carol, Carol loans to David, David sells to Eve.<p>Bob and David are both short sellers. There is only one stock. It has been sold twice.')
