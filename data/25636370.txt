It&#x27;s the courts and their enforcement arm, the US military, that do.<p>The reason the US dollar is valuable worldwide is because if you run into trouble, you can use the US courts to be made whole, and if that doesn&#x27;t work, assuming the dollar amount is high enough, the US military or Secret Service will use violence to make you whole again.<p>Same thing with the Euro and all the other major currencies (and even a lot of the minor ones).  They have the threat of legal recourse and military violence back them.<p>Bitcoin does not have that.  If someone takes your Bitcoin, there is little recourse to be made whole again.  Now maybe if the US government decided to buy up a significant amount of bitcoin, they would have an interest in using the courts and military to enforce it.  But the US government doesn&#x27;t like competition, so most likely they would be buying up bitcoin to get people to exchange bitcoin for dollars, making the dollar even stronger.')
