The movie The Social Dilemma really stuck with me and I started to think, shouldn&#x27;t I author my own app my kids use? In the video:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;10CEKzmlWjxkWdxR_NPdrZn5zuHKHx2qe&#x2F;view<p>you&#x27;ll see me demo my network with my 4 kids. But I&#x27;m starting to notice after building this, it would make a good dating app too. Just place 6 quality people into a network and let them interact as a group. Like the TV show https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Circle_(American_TV_series) you get to know people differently in a group setting. Six might be the perfect number! Anyway thanks for reading&#x2F;watching. Appreciate feedback and you can find it in the app store under the name &quot;replacement&quot;.')
