If your program&#x2F;language&#x2F;environment needs a smart editor, you&#x27;ve built or chosen a program&#x2F;language&#x2F;environment that is too complex, and an IDE won&#x27;t ever solve that fundamental problem. I get we don&#x27;t always get to choose these things (wh o hasn&#x27;t had to learn React, Typescript, or the general JavaScript ecosystem) but my cultural stance is the people who made those things should have used Vim, realized it was hard to manage w&#x2F; Vim, and questioned their priors.<p>That might sound nuts or the ravings of someone who&#x27;s completely drank the kool-aid; who got good at one difficult thing and now like, jams it in everywhere to ladder pull or whatever. And so I should say that I&#x27;m super amazed by the capabilities of IDEs like PyCharm or even Eclipse (or, honestly, even Code::Blocks). The sheer engineering effort alone is awesome, but some of the stuff you can do with them is incredible. I can&#x27;t imagine developing the source code of Eclipse with Vim. But does using an IDE to develop Eclipse make Eclipse great, or does it simply make Eclipse _possible_?<p>I contend Eclipse shouldn&#x27;t exist, at least not in its current form. It&#x27;s too complex for humans, and its design necessitated so many engineering hours it was a net loss for humanity. If the complexity of your program&#x2F;language&#x2F;environment rises to the level you need an IDE to manage it, the only thing to do is start over.')
