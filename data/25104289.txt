They won&#x27;t really want to steal your idea because they already got their own money making idea and its currently making them money.<p>Its going to cost a lot more than a fiver like $25k minimum for something you could potentialy trial in front of customers &#x2F; investors. Upwork is fine for finding a developer but you need to make sure its some one who has a range of skills to essentialy be able to lead the project and understand you when you are communicating your idea, ie don&#x27;t just go for the cheapest.<p>You can learn programing yourself its easy enough but it will take a few year or two for you to be good enough to build an mvp a few more years to be able to grow your technical understanding enough to lead a larger project or organise a team of developers etc, you are investing a lot of time into a skill that won&#x27;t really help the business side of the business.<p>You won&#x27;t impress a technical found by trying to do his job, do your part of the job plan out how you intent to implement and communicate your idea. Design a prototype of your idea draw it out on paper how it works. Whats the problem? How to solve it? Who will pay for the solution? How to market and sale to these people? How many are there? How are we going to finance this?<p>The more evidence you can provide that this is a real idea and not just wishful thinking the more time a developer will commit to your idea.<p>Ideas are worthless some one who can figure out the idea and communicate it effectively is worth something you need to prove you can do that, also setup a ltd business its like $100 and gives you a legal fallback.')
