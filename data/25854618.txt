Arrest one person and free speech activists aren’t concerned, arrest everyone that says something, now they are concerned. The notion of trying to suppress topics is the problem, not the limitation of a particular individual.<p>&gt; Saying that freedom of speech can&#x27;t ever be limited is a very ideological point of view, so far away from reality that I wouldn&#x27;t consider it worth debating at all.<p>You built a shitty strawman and then attacked it. Bravo. If you actually want to debate people who advocate free speech, the concern is when speech is suppressed because of the contents of the speech. Not because the person is dead, in prison, in a coma, or some other contrived crap.')
