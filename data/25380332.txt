Item(by='cactus2093', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607643722, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25378937, text='Except in unusual circumstances, I normally find that #1 and #2 don&#x27;t change much on the one or two week cadence that 1:1s usually happen. Every couple months there might be a significant amount of time spent on one of these, and then there might be a few check-ins on that afterwards, but in most cases it&#x27;s not anywhere near enough time to fill a 30 minute slot every 2 weeks.<p>I also at some point personally started making a conscious effort to spend less time on #2, bringing up concerns&#x2F;issues. Nine times out of ten nothing will come out of it anyway (most things are out of your manager&#x27;s control), and nobody likes a complainer. Your effort is better spent practicing meditation, or else applying to new jobs if things are really bad, rather than spending half an hour every week &quot;voicing concerns&quot; in a 1:1.<p>That basically leaves a large majority of 1:1 time spent on #3, which I totally agree with the parent comment gets awkward after a while.<p>I have started wonder if the 1:1 in tech is an &quot;emperor has no clothes&quot; type of situation. Am I so unusual? Or do we all just go along pretending that these are super essential to a functional team, while in practice not much really ever comes of them?')
