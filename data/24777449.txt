As a rule, these allegations are found to have no basis in actual fact&quot; [1]<p>Committee of Foreign Affairs chairman Vanhanen of Finland said Norway&#x27;s intelligence is trustworthy and in any case Norway won&#x27;t release technical military data: &quot;There is every reason to trust Norway and its intelligence. It’s unlikely that Norway will publicly disclose the methods behind its assessment. As no technical evidence will be offered in the public domain, we may end up in a situation where Russia just denies it. We need to tell Russia that we do not accept disturbances of this kind in our airspace&quot; [1]<p>Year 2019: GPS is again jammed in Northern Norway. Norway now has electronic evidence it was Russia. Russia asked for evidence. Norway provided the civilian-side evidence. Result: no reply from Russia.<p>Again, the message of innocence, victimhood and lack for evidence were made; &quot;The [Russian] Embassy called for evidence.&quot; [2] and Zakharova (foreign minister Lavrov&#x27;s spokesman) &quot;even named the accusations “absurd histories” and said western politicians are making it a habit to blame Russia for all kind of incidents without providing evidence.&quot; [2]<p>The Norwegians say they have provided the data: &quot;“We believe this is not acceptable and we have provided the information we have from the civilian side. They asked for our data, and we gave it to them,” [foreign minister] Eriksen Søreide says and underlines that Russia, so far, has not responded to the data.&quot; [3]<p>There is a mention of a dialogue having started but where this went is not elaborated.<p>Now, in the year 2020: GPS jamming still happens. &quot;“The last incident was not long ago. In April&#x2F;May this year we registered another episode. ..., says Police Chief Ellen Katrine Hætta to High North News.&quot; [3]<p>&quot;District Police Chief Ellen Katrine Hætta first noticed jamming in 2017 and then notified the Norwegian Police Directorate. The National Security Authority has analyzed the jamming and in September 2018 verified that the jamming came from the east. The intelligence services have concluded that Russia was behind it.&quot; [3]<p>There is a pattern.<p>Now, disturbing navigational systems in an wilderness-rich area like Finnmark and Northern Lapland is dangerous, and if it is done intentionally, it is an aggressive move and not anything innocent friendly nations should be doing.<p>Maybe some of those cases were somehow accidental, but why not just come out and say so?<p>&gt; which sadly can hardly be had with most Americans anyways<p>I honestly have no frame of reference for this, since I&#x27;m not an American and have no experience discussing these issues with Americans.<p>As for apparatuses creeping to their inevitable demise, President Putin is, however sparky and bright, not by any means immortal, and there is no clear successor defined. There are rumors but that is all. Once Putin loses control for whatever reason, a rush to grab political and economical power is likely to ensue and more than likely to become messy, and no doubt skeletons will fall not only from closets, but windows, too.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.defensenews.com&#x2F;global&#x2F;europe&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;16&#x2F;finland-norway-press-russia-on-suspected-gps-jamming-during-nato-drill&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.defensenews.com&#x2F;global&#x2F;europe&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;16&#x2F;finland...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thebarentsobserver.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;security&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;russian-military-officials-arrive-oslo-norway-provides-facts-gps-jamming" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thebarentsobserver.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;security&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;russian-m...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.highnorthnews.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;gps-jamming-still-causing-problems-finnmark" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.highnorthnews.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;gps-jamming-still-causing-p...</a>')
