In fact if it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that repeated characters are eventually ignored it would at least be guaranteed to <i>always</i> overestimate the entropy, as it is now it just punishes the use of long passwords using a small set of characters (again going directly against the quoted xkcd comic).')
