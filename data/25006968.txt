Cats are creatures of habit in general. If a cat is used to a certain routine, it takes quite a bit of effort to shake that. Relocate their food, and they&#x27;ll have to go seriously hungry and uncomfortable before they get used to eating from a &quot;new&quot; bowl again. This actually led me to rethink some of my own behavior. Humans are more of &quot;creatures of habit&quot; than they realize. Whatever conforms to their habits comes to them much more easily than things that don&#x27;t. But humans are too self-absorbed to see it.')
