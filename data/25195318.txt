Now mentally walk through it, e.g. room by room or nook by nook. What kind of details do you remember? Colors? Objects? Are you impressed at all by the fidelity with which you can remember those things?<p>Using the Method of Loci is premised on leveraging that sort of visual-spatial fidelity, providing a large number of distinct loci that you can readily recall. Often times people will reuse their childhood home or similar space (e.g. a bus route between home and school) precisely because they can already remember the details so well. Most people usually only have one or a handful of &quot;palaces&quot; that they use. The hard part of the Method of Loci is creating mental narrations for placing facts with the imagery. That can take alot of practice.')
