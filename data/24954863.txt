I get that it&#x27;s fun to say that PHP was &quot;stupid&quot;, but history shows that PHP&#x27;s historic imperfections didn&#x27;t prevent developers from building everything from web-scale apps (Facebook, Wikipedia, Flickr, Tumbler, etc.) to, yes, millions of blogs.<p>(Don&#x27;t get me wrong, your favorite language seems nice too.)')
