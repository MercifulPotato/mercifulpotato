I find this argument very similar to that of devs who complain &quot;I wrote this piece of code that made my company $3mil in revenue over the past year, but I only got paid a fraction of that, i am getting ripped off, oh woe poor me&quot;. If you could do that, you would have made it on your own and made that much money already.<p>Turns out, other people at the company are actually doing tons of work to make it possible to make that much revenue off your code. Same applies here. It isn&#x27;t just as simple as having one good model at a single point in time to be able to make tons of money off it, there are a lot of other people doing their own work at those finance shops that make it possible for those models to bring in tons of money.')
