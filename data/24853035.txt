I&#x27;m not making a value judgment on Youtube Premium.  I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s not the same class of service as Quibi and thus not a counter-example for how Quibi could&#x2F;should have succeeded. They&#x27;re fundamentally different things with completely different non-user to paying customer paths.  Quibi wasn&#x27;t Youtube. Quibi is 2013 Netflix if it didn&#x27;t have <i>any</i> non-original content.  Except 2013 Netflix wasn&#x27;t dumb enough to charge you money and still show you ads.')
