But as all our meetings are small enough, we never used it, so I don&#x27;t know how useful it is<p>Not all that useful really. The icon is small and gets easily missed. Also, when you&#x27;re presenting, you <i>can&#x27;t see it at all</i> which is mind-blowingly stupid to me. If there was ever a time I want to know if somebody has a question, it&#x27;s when I&#x27;m in lecture mode and can&#x27;t see people&#x27;s faces.')
