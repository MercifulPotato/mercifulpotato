That way, if there are any embarrassing mistakes, they&#x27;ll be obvious. Are you saying that with 1200-2000ppm, we&#x27;ll have another extinction event? That it will include humans? Also that we expect to reach that concentration in our childrens&#x27; lifetimes? Those claims together are certainly not what scientists predict, so I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re wrong or using some other logic that I didn&#x27;t infer correctly from your words.')
