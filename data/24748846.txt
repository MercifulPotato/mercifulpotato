The same stuff soil and sand is made of. It&#x27;s not really a huge problem to bury them. There&#x27;s also huge developments in fiberglass recycling&#x2F;repurposing these days. Solving this issue will be extremely helpful as wind power is not the <i>only</i> use of fiberglass as I&#x27;m sure you know. In fact, wind power could be instrumental in setting up a supply-chain for recycling of fiberglass, since you get such huge quantities of uniform and clean fiberglass from one source.<p>&gt; The difference is that the nuclear waste eventually decays into nothing, while the fiberglass&#x2F;plastic blades will stay around for thousands of years...<p>This is just a ridiculously skewed perspective, and wrong - nuclear waste does not decay into nothing, though I suppose you didn&#x27;t meant it very literally. And saying anything about what will happen to plastic composites over thousands of years is futile. We are already finding bacteria that break down plastic, and we&#x27;ve already accelerated that process by genetically modifying them to make the enzymes more efficient. Did you know that for a long time, trees did not decay? That&#x27;s why we have coal. They were essentially like plastics. Bacteria and fungi didn&#x27;t have the enzymes to break them down.<p>I&#x27;m willing to bet that it&#x27;ll take way less time for life to develop the ability to break down plastics. Evolution has more genetic material to draw from now, organism now spread across the globe faster, and humans can transfer genes between species and improve genes in the lab.')
