If you think that movie was ahead of its time in terms of exhibiting what was <i>possible</i>, then might I suggest Three Days of the Condor (1975), and of course the ever popular Sneakers (1992). The former is far more fascinating given its age, although I suspect less so for someone who was in the middle of their computer science&#x2F;computer engineering&#x2F;signals intelligence&#x2F;cryptanalysis career during that era.<p>The things that governments are capable of doing are rarely secret. They leak out over time, and you&#x27;ll see them portrayed in niche culture long before they become undeniable public knowledge. For example, off the top of my head, the satellite photos published amidst the 1998 missile strike of the Al Shifa pharmaceutical factory (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Al-Shifa_pharmaceutical_factory" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Al-Shifa_pharmaceutical_factor...</a>) are the types of evidence that inform the private sector, including authors and screenwriters. I&#x27;m sure similar photos and descriptions were publicly available much earlier than that, so the generic ability to track people on rooftops via satellite (notwithstanding all the little gotchas that aren&#x27;t fit for storytelling) was more than plausible at that point, especially considering that then as now the military doesn&#x27;t typically release material that discloses their best capabilities.<p>I used to have a link to a pre-9&#x2F;11, accidental admission in a magazine interview by a general about the Navy&#x27;s ability to tap undersea fiber optic cables. Though at that point I think it was already assumed the U.S. performed such missions--certainly by Russia and China, but even among intelligence geeks--which is probably why he didn&#x27;t think much of the comment. (IIRC, the topic was a submarine designed for tapping undersea cable, though at that time it was only &quot;public knowledge&quot; that it could tap traditional copper cables, not fiber optic. He impliedly--only barely shy of explicitly--admitted that it also tapped fiber optic cables.)<p>What&#x27;s fanciful is the degree and extent of corruption assumed in these narratives. People seem to think it&#x27;s more plausible simply because of the true-to-life character of the technological portrayals. But NEVER forget that the principal aim of movies is to elicit strong emotions by leveraging common fears[1] and desires, suspending disbelief by deftly mixing fiction with non-fiction. And I don&#x27;t mean to preach; it&#x27;s definitely a life-long struggle for everyone to differentiate culturally constructed narratives from reality.<p>[1] E.g. Big Brother, the particularized fear of powerlessness that comes when mixing it with political cynicism.')
