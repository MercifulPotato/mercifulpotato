Item(by='dragontamer', descendants=None, kids=[25333643, 25335207], score=None, time=1607352359, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25331442, text='It is estimated that the M1 is 16-billion transistors on 5nm for a 4-big core + 4-little core + iGPU + neural engine SOC.<p>The most comparable laptop processor is AMD Renoir: Zen2 8-core + iGPU for 10-billion transistors.<p>As such, I&#x27;d expect a &quot;hypothetical high end&quot; 32-big core Mac to compete against a 64-big core EPYC in terms of #transistors. Would the high end market be interested in a lower core count computer but higher single-thread performance?<p>I somehow doubt that. Server &#x2F; workstation loads scale well to many cores: indeed, any computer that actually scales to 32-cores would probably also scale well to 64-cores (or SIMD-compute), and the M1 is only 128-bit wide SIMD.<p>------------<p>There&#x27;s also the issue of the lack of hyperthreading: the Apple M1 does NOT implement SMT in any way what so ever. Those 32-cores would likely only support 32-threads, while the 64-core EPYC supports 128-threads.<p>I dunno. &quot;Just scaling up&quot; the M1 doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;d be a winner in the high-end market to me. Maybe if the core gained a wider SIMD-width and SMT (2x threads&#x2F;core), that&#x27;d help a lot.')
