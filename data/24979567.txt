These interfaces dervive from that base, so they can always be cast as IUnknown.<p>The rest builds on this base.<p>source: Inside OLE and Inside Windows 95<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;about&#x2F;Inside_OLE.html?id=adpwQgAACAAJ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;about&#x2F;Inside_OLE.html?id=adpw...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bookdepository.com&#x2F;Inside-Windows-95-Deluxe-Edition-Jim-Boyce&#x2F;9781562056957" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bookdepository.com&#x2F;Inside-Windows-95-Deluxe-Edit...</a><p>Edit: saw the reply below, the specific Longhorn components only expanded the scope of what is extensible to include searchable&#x2F;virtual&#x2F;indexed filesystem extensions and few other places, based on the innovative concepts in Longhorn. My reading of your comment originally was that Vista was a departure from what came before, though it appears that it may have been intended to say it was more of a return to the simpler COM.')
