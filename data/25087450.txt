This happens to me on Windows and Linux, with my Sony WH1000XM3s. If there is a workaround please let me know. I am sure there are some non-standard extensions but I don&#x27;t think my headphones support them.<p>If you are experiencing &quot;bad&quot; quality on Linux, you probably would benefit significantly from installing the additional codecs. Linux is the only desktop operating system that supports basically all of the Bluetooth audio codecs! But of course, they&#x27;re patent-encumbered (except Sony LDAC) and thus not typically included by default.')
