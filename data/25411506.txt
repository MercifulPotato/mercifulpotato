To someone rich, the &quot;solution&quot; to having to deal with bike liability is to <i>ban bikes</i>.<p>The only solution is separate bicycle and car infrastructure.  Period.<p>Yes, it sucks that San Francisco has backed off separate infrastructure due to budget.  However, the solution is to <i>go lobby SF</i> and to <i>make pro-bike infrastructure a single vote issue</i> to make them put it back.<p>One thing I do not understand: why hasn&#x27;t some rich millionaire&#x2F;billionaire taken some second&#x2F;third tier city and funded bike infrastructure into it?  It seems like it would be a lot easier to get bikers to move to a city that has infrastructure rather than trying to jam infrastructure into city that is basically land-locked&#x2F;water-locked.')
