I&#x27;ll agree there&#x27;s some fluff in the article and it is selectively edited after-the-fact. But dismissing the concepts here is naive.<p>&gt; Domino&#x27;s aren&#x27;t currently delivering pizzas by drone or self-driving cars<p>But it gets them a ton of free publicity -- even better than paid advertising. And it gets into your subconscious -- the idea that Domino&#x27;s <i>really</i> cares about getting you a hot pizza, and is actively developing technology to make that happen, certainly more than any of the competition. &quot;Hot&quot; (or lack thereof) is likely the attribute most-highly correlated with customer satisfaction vs disappointment, so this is huge.<p>&gt; Domino&#x27;s pizza tracking and online ordering is cool, but nobody orders Domino&#x27;s because of it.<p>Yes, plenty do. It adds accountability and transparency to a rather chaotic process. Would you continue to use Fedex if they got rid of all tracking numbers? When Domino&#x27;s delivers as promised, and the transaction went smoothly, and all the steps along the way were displayed, people remember it -- especially the next time they want a pizza.<p>&gt; they finally improved their product after years of cost optimization. Better pizza = more sales<p>So if they stopped optimizing costs, how do their prices stay super-competitive? Better pizza doesn&#x27;t translate to more sales if it also means higher prices')
