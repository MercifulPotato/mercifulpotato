Often there is an underlying personality disorder which combines with personal circumstance that leads to the crime. The most common ones I&#x27;ve seen from criminals are borderline personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder.<p>&quot;Though psychopaths make up roughly 1% of the general male adult population, they make up between 15% and 25% of the males incarcerated in North American prison systems&quot; - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4059069" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4059069</a><p>These disorders don&#x27;t go away on their own, and these disorders can be difficult to pick up in an interview, often because the person is motivated to thoroughly hide it and present the best possible image to the interviewer.<p>Put simply, if you are hiring a criminal that just came out of prison, you are far, far, far more likely to be hiring a psychopath or someone with a severe personality disorder than you would be if you hired from the non-criminal population.')
