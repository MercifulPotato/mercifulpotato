I agree itâ€™s likely not malice but absolutely negligence.  Ammon is in way over his head and has failed at recognizing that.  Should have learned from the layoffs  (COVID was an excuse but appears either Ammon personally had early knowledge of the impending lockdowns or the layoffs had been planned for weeks prior).  Way way way too much leverage, and the lever rightfully bit back.')
