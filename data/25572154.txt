Generally speaking, slaves had some kinds of rights that were far better than those in Auschwitz-II.<p>It&#x27;s one thing to be treated as someone&#x27;s property and forced labour, as a slave.<p>It&#x27;s another thing to be subject to awful medical experimentation (often to death), torture of kinds that are barely imaginable, and mass killing with on-site factories literally built to murder the occupants and other occupants forced to dispose of the body parts of their friends afterwards.  All of this in large numbers.<p>There&#x27;s a reason Auschwitz-II had sections called &quot;Crematoria I-IV&quot;.<p>Auschwitz-II makes almost every evil in the world look mild in comparison.  It&#x27;s that bad.')
