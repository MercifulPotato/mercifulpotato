I&#x27;d go with that format for learning new topics, also supplementing with books. You can get a lot with $1500<p>Conferences and trainings are nice, but they are very expensive. I&#x27;ve been to conferences(because of my company) only when it was to do some recruiting and networking for the company I worked at. It&#x27;s actually nice, you buy some sponsoring package and get a place where you can tell future applicants about the company. It&#x27;s also a interesting network exercise. But then in 2-3 days your whole budget is used and the learning vs. cost can be low.<p>Also certifications(perhaps just the test) is a nice one. My company told us they would support us by paying the k8s certification and this is a nice thing to have. Might motivate some people to conquer something a bit more concrete.<p>One thing I wouldn&#x27;t make is, make it mandatory, or that everybody must spend it in a certain event(like a conference). I&#x27;ve worked on a company that didn&#x27;t really give us flexibility and that sucks. A lot of people function differently and would have better results if you just... let them pick what they want.')
