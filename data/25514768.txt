Or is Gates actually wearing the mask that way? In either case, doesn&#x27;t it appear to be OVER the bottom of his glasses? Don&#x27;t mean to be too picky, but the post stresses the importance of wearing masks to &quot;slow the spread of the virus and save lives,&quot; so one would want to avoid suggesting wearing masks in a way that has been noted to decrease their effectiveness. Btw, tried Googling for another photo of Bill wearing a mask for comparison purposes, but couldn&#x27;t find any. Guess he&#x27;s been pretty good about social distancing! :-)')
