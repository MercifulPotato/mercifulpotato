But since that got fixed in both browsers I&#x27;ve used HTTP2 push extensively when optimizing web applications. For example instead of first requesting the main html-file, parsing it, requesting the css file and parsing it, requesting a background image, etc, both the css and the background image is pushed when the index.htm is requested. This can shave off seconds and drastically improve user experience.<p>I&#x27;ve also implemented commonJS module system where all dependencies are HTTP2 pushed on the first module request.<p>The main advantage with HTTP2 push is that is simplifies development as you do not get penalized for not using  resource bundling (which complicates caching).')
