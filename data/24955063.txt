Person B rightfully continues to use project X under GPL, possibly even hosting a fork and continuing collaboration.<p>(I&#x27;m not sure if step 3 is feasible - while person A is free to use their own copyrighted work however they please, it might not be possibly to legally erase all trace of foreign contributions.)<p>---<p>What normally should happen is that Person A needs to contact all contributors, and have them agree to the relicense their contributions. If all authors agree, then there is no issue.
