It&#x27;s kind of funny that a VPS with little RAM can build a full Linux kernel with all the modules and drivers, yet cannot build a small webserver. For big projects, the final linking process also eats enormous amount of RAM, it&#x27;s possible for a small system to survive all the build and gets killed during the final linking.')
