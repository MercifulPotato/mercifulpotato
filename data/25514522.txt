A manager is the only &#x2F;reasonable&#x2F; alternative for tracking all the various sites that <i>all</i> want one to register an account for this or that use.<p>&gt; Do you maintain 100+ accounts?<p>My password manager has about 350 &quot;entries&quot; in it -- not all of the &quot;entries&quot; are &quot;online accounts&quot;.  So taking 75% of that as likely &quot;online accounts&quot; that comes out to about 262 &quot;accounts&quot;.  Do note that most of those are retailers from which I&#x27;ve purchased once, but that failed to have a &quot;guest purchase&quot; option.  The &#x27;core&#x27; day-to-day usage entres over any given time period amounts to likely about 5-15 total.<p>&gt; Don&#x27;t you think having 100+ accounts (even with a password manager) takes a mental toll on you?<p>Not at all, because all the effort of &quot;remembering&quot; is handled by the manager.  That is one of the benefits of using a password manager, all the effort of remembering &quot;do I have an account here&quot; <i>and</i> &quot;what is the user-id&#x2F;password for that account&quot; is handled by the manager, which is a massive mental simplification.  When a given account is needed, a short search either finds it, or I just add another to track it for reuse later.')
