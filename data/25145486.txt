Yes, KrF (Christian People&#x27;s Party) has at various times made noises about pornography DNS filters. I don&#x27;t recall all the specifics, but various proposals have included opt-out DNS filter and&#x2F;or filters in schools and such. While I don&#x27;t support these proposals, I think the language used really exaggerates the reality (and few or none of these measures have ever gained much headway, either at the national or local level)<p>&gt; If you read the Norwegian Christian paper, though, it is expressing itself very positively toward this censorship (which is somewhat weird for a newspaper, any newspaper – those generally oppose censorship vehemently and defend any and all freedom of the press).<p>They really dug deep on this one. The paper in question (Dagen) has a circulation of slightly over 10,000. That&#x27;s not even among the top 20 in the country [1]. I&#x27;d be skeptical of assigning much weight to their coverage.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_newspapers_in_Norway" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_newspapers_in_Norway</a>')
