Working front desk at a hotel currently. Just the latest in a string of crummy jobs, stuck climbing up and falling down the bottom rungs of society.<p>Had a couple programming jobs after college. One was a startup that folded after a couple years when the president, CEO, and CFO all got indicted for tax fraud. The other was at a game studio a friend from college started that seemed to be successful... Then he started using company accounts as his personal piggy bank and stopped paying his employees.<p>That part you wrote about developing a lack of trust in humanity really resonates with me.<p>By now, I&#x27;ve lost touch with anyone else I knew in the industry. A couple medical issues wiped out my savings, so I don&#x27;t have money to relocate. And the only jobs I&#x27;ve been able to find in my area barely cover monthly expenses.<p>These days, I try to forget I&#x27;m only ever a few paychecks away from homelessness and utter destitution. Instead, I just focus on keeping up my health and tinkering with the latest technologies. All I can do is hope someday a position near me opens up for a Rust dev or K8s admin or whatever the next thing happens to be and be ready when it does.<p>Anyway, hang in there. You&#x27;re not the only one stuck in a rut. Keep holding on to whatever it is that still brings you joy. Never let them take that from you.')
