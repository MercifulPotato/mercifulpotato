The ranking member of the houes intellgience committee disagrees.<p>&gt;- No one in the Biden campaign has denied the laptop itself is genuine (only that they couldn&#x27;t find a meeting on the books that matches the one in the email)<p>Because the ownership of a laptop is not the scandal, it&#x27;s the fabricated Russian-sourced smear campaign is.<p>&gt;By the way, he guy at the computer store came forward as to why he got in contact with Rudy Giuliani. He went to the FBI with the info and got stonewalled by them. Sensing they were covering it up, he decided to become a whistleblower and went to whoever would listen.<p>I&#x27;d love to get into the process by which a blind computer repair person trusted Rudy Giuliani more than the FBI.')
