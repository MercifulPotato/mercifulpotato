There is always some x profitable level to integrate into some portion of the grid. Before you actually start to lose money. Used to be around 30% in most cases a decade ago. Imagine it is bit asymptotic without improvements to the cost of energy storage. I would guess 40% in most cases now.<p>Found this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iea.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;will-system-integration-of-renewables-be-a-major-challenge-by-2023" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iea.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;will-system-integration-of-rene...</a>')
