A lot of the top fencers have siblings who also fence. To the point where I can name several sibling duos in the fencing community.<p>Could it also be that younger siblings get parents who are a little richer and gotten over the sticker shock of being a top athlete? A lot of top youth sports require an obscene amount of money to get to the top levels. Maybe by kid #2 the parents are okay with junior&#x27;s sport costing them a few thousand a month.')
