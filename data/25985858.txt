Market making firms however, they are the true stars. There are also some really good hedge funds: RenTec, Millennium, 2 Sigma, etc.<p>A lot of hedge funds are dinosaurs and are slowly going extinct. Even in the last 5 years there has been a big shift: investors really prefer systematic firms and raising money for a discretionary fund gets harder and harder every day.<p>I do not believe insider information is key. If it was, hedge fund risk adjusted returns would probably be less abysmal. It&#x27;s not that straightforward to evaluate hf performance, but trust me when I say, there a lot of funds out there providing very dubious value to investors.')
