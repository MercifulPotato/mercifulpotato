The market is beyond huge, there are bound to be use cases where one or the other is clearly better.<p>Also a 10x cost improvement on nuclear would blow everything else away (in a good way). I don&#x27;t think renewables have the same potential - for one thing, they&#x27;re a more mature technology (weird, I know, but they&#x27;ve been the focus of global development for quite some time now).<p>And also there&#x27;s only so much energy you can get out of solar and wind - you just can&#x27;t get more than 1.3 kw from a square meter of solar, you have to cover more square meters. On the other hand there&#x27;s no theoretical reason why you wouldn&#x27;t have a clean, safe reactor in each car. It&#x27;s just a technological challenge.')
