Trump unilaterally desired to use a private service as his main medium of mass communication, while he also unilaterally decided to not only shun his standard and traditional media of mass communication.<p>If he wanted it, he had at his disposal all media in the whole world to address the public.<p>But somehow he chose to use a free service provided by a single and very specific private company which also has a very public and clear list of service terms and conditions.<p>To make matters worse, in spite of his individual choice of using the private company&#x27;s service as his exclusive medium of mass communication, somehow he also threatened the company with judicial and criminal persecution if they didn&#x27;t abused by his very personal and unorthodox choices and preferences, which rendered his continuous use of the service as a major liability.<p>Thus it&#x27;s pretty obvious that no, a corporation like Twitter cannot discipline the speech of a US president. What we have seen is a president that, due to his individual lack of judgement and insistence of exclusively using a private service while ignoring every single alternative there is in the world proceeded to violate the service&#x27;s terms and conditions, thus resulting in the service being terminated.')
