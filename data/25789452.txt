It will read the Digikam DB for metadata and allow access to the photos without having to manually export albums. This scratches my itch as I have a large photo collection (~120000 photos) organized in Digikam, and I want to be able to navigate my collection from everywhere without having to export new photos as I add them. The flow I&#x27;m looking for is:<p>1. I organize photos in my laptop, add titles, descriptions, tags, faces, etc.\n2. Photos and Digikam DB are automatically synchronized to my home server using Syncthing [1].\n3. The web gallery instantly sees the new photos, albums and tags, no interaction needed.<p>I&#x27;m trying to focus on getting an MVP up and running (unrestricted access to everything), but after that I have many features planned such as multiple user accounts, access control, share with a link, tag filtering, embed support...<p>Besides this I have also been working on a Python library implementing the CashID authentication protocol [2]. Once it&#x27;s done my plan is to create a Django app that uses it.<p>I meant to take over maintenance for the rust-bch [3] crate but haven&#x27;t found time to work on it much.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.digikam.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.digikam.org&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;syncthing.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;syncthing.net&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;cashid&#x2F;protocol-specification" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;cashid&#x2F;protocol-specification</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;haplo&#x2F;rust-bch&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;haplo&#x2F;rust-bch&#x2F;</a>')
