It&#x27;s a very complicated issue and is one that I don&#x27;t have strong feelings about (for or against in totality) because I think that sometimes, it&#x27;s worth it to end the life of the little human and sometimes it&#x27;s not. Also frankly because I&#x27;m a man and am less affected by it. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll ever have everyone on the same page with this topic.')
