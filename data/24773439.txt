They aren&#x27;t even <i>close</i>. Cell Data plans are Unlimited<i></i>* (Up to 15GB tethered, Up to 25GB at 4G speed, Video limited to 720P)<p>The thrust of my point is that if you say Unlimited, you should mean it. If that means nobody says it, I&#x27;m okay with that. They have a business to run and they should do what they need to to make it work.<p>But I don&#x27;t think they should be able to get away with selling it as &quot;Unlimited&quot; when there are several fine print details to define what that means that are as hidden as possible so that you don&#x27;t know what they are until you&#x27;ve been parted with your money and run up against the limits.')
