Kudos to the author for mentioning the things the primary author did well and correctly put the primary responsibility on the senior researchers.<p>ML privacy isn&#x27;t at all in my wheelhouse, but I did do computer security research in school. The author makes a good point that researchers need to be ready for their methods to be broken. More importantly though, researchers have an ethical responsibility to publicize when a vulnerability in their work is discovered, so it&#x27;s not used improperly.<p>I think this is something that&#x27;s very clear in the security community, but isn&#x27;t the norm in the machine learning community. Hopefully privacy researchers in ML take a few notes from their colleagues that have been doing computer security sooner rather than later.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s pretty disappointing to see how far Bell Labs has fallen. I won&#x27;t spoil the article, but the quote from the Bell Labs judge is telling.')
