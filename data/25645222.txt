The services I self-host was configured by me, if anything goes down (which they very rarely do), I know the exact cause and have it fixed in minutes. When some company&#x27;s cloud service goes down I&#x27;m completely at their mercy. I also spend very little time on maintaining these services, just security updates, which are mostly automated.<p>Bottom line, maintaining and self-hosting services that has 1 or a few users is much less complex than services with millions of users. Hence, my uptime is better than Google&#x27;s, Amazon&#x27;s, and Azure&#x27;s, etc.')
