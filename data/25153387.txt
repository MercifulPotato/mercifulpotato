Thatâ€™s an iOS-like milestone.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s important to remember: this is Apple&#x27;s <i>low-end</i> chip for entry-level&#x2F;consumer level hardware, yet it&#x27;s more than competitive with a $5000 iMac Pro.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;17&#x2F;yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro-is-powerful-but-its-the-battery-life-that-will-blow-you-away&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;17&#x2F;yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro...</a>')
