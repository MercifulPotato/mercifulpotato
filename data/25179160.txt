It&#x27;s the premier video platform not just of the US but the world. And it&#x27;s only going to grow.<p>&gt; How many companies can afford to keep it running? How many would want to?<p>Every major company in the US. And every major international company around the world and maybe even governments around the world would want to buy youtube. But I highly doubt we&#x27;d let a foreign company get control over youtube. Youtube is important enough to be a national security matter.<p>Google is known for shutting down products left and right. It&#x27;s kept youtube around for 15 years. That, in and of itself, should tell you something. Youtube is one of the world&#x27;s most valuable&#x2F;important products right now. You think no one would be interested in buying it?')
