There is absolutely nothing I miss about the office. I get my own bathroom at home that is clean and doesn&#x27;t smell like shit all day long. I don&#x27;t have to time my bathroom breaks or wait in line. I don&#x27;t have to search on different floors to find a free bathroom. Not to mention the shitty quality public bathrooms you have in the US with 1 inch gaps so people get a nice view of you taking a dump.<p>I can do laundry during the day, I can go exercise during the day. I can take a nap if I&#x27;m tired.<p>Meetings start on time more often because you don&#x27;t have to wait for a meeting rooms to clear out.<p>I could go on and on. I will say this though, I hope everyone gets to work the way it works for them. I&#x27;m not going to tell people that want to work in an office that they shouldn&#x27;t be able to. I hope we get the same respect and not have in-office advocates push their ideal environment on remote workers.')
