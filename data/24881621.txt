I feel like it is particularly unsuccessful and that seems to be for some pretty good reasons.<p>Zeromq is a bag of tools and it&#x27;s not really clear to me how a novice would put them together safely.  This is important for a message system because everyone has to start somewhere and it really shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;step 1: build your broker with our subroutines&quot;.  Is that broker really going to be any good?<p>Secondly, for many years zeromq was a kind of monty python style &#x27;judean people&#x27;s front vs people&#x27;s front of judea&#x27; community.  They split from the AMQP standardisation process I agree had clearly gone wildly wrong and then...split and then...split again.<p>Right as far as I know people doing messaging are using a) RabbitMQ if they&#x27;re deploying it themselves b) AWS of GCP&#x27;s thing or c) some proprietary thing which has no name recognition among the public (who here has heard of AMPS?) d) Kafka.  No one is using zeromq as far as I know!  Look forward to anyone sharing their positive experiences using zeromq on big projects eg in banks.')
