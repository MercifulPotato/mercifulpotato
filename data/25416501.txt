Like evolution. Even in countries where creationism isn&#x27;t a thing and everyone &quot;believes in&quot; evolution, most of them couldn&#x27;t describe a logically workable mechanism of evolution, they know a cartoon version but believe it because they &quot;know&quot; that &quot;evolution&quot; is true.<p>But would you say it makes no sense to read books on evolution just because most people who believe in evolution don&#x27;t believe in it for the reasons outlined in advanced books?<p>Why did schools end up teaching evolution? For scientific reasons? To suppress religion in some freemasonry conspiracy?<p>You can ask the same about the race topics.')
