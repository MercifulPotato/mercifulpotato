A couple of weeks ago I finally got around to trying Miniature Golf.  The graphics are terrible by any post-1982 standard, and the hand-drawn screenshots in the paper catalogs of yesteryear made it look worse, so hardly anyone bought it.  But it&#x27;s actually a pretty good game.  You can sit down with and play for several hours while relaxing, instead of gnashing your teeth and swearing at other players.<p>Ditto for the regular Atari 2600 Golf.  Looks terrible.  But once you go a few rounds, it&#x27;s a really nice game.')
