The government paid them to install fiber optic networking in my rural neighborhood we were told we were near a backbone so we were going to be a test bed for extremely fast internet 99. 2001 rolls around these trucks are everywhere installing glass in the ground. 2003ish Adelphia cable goes through a legal battle with the larger cable companies they&#x27;re accusing them of all kinds of stuff. Adelphia cable is bought out by Time Warner Cable the fiber optic network is never turned on even to this day every once in awhile I&#x27;m digging in a flower bed and I un Earth the glass wire that&#x27;s been there for 20 years. Fastest internet available here is from former TWC which is now spectrum $80 30&#x2F;10mbps.')
