At the end of the day, the members total investment is so small that it doubtfully makes any difference. It is probably more analogous to Ed Thorp&#x27;s Beat the Dealer. He devised an algorithm to count cards. Ran a simulation on a computer at MIT, got bankrolled, and went to Reno to test it in person. Why didn&#x27;t he continue counting cards in Nevada? Because hedge funds are more lucrative per effort.<p>Nonetheless, after he published Beat the Dealer casinos greatly benefitted rather than a situation where they lost revenue from Blackjack card counters. Thousands of people believing that they could make a fortune using his system went to the casinos. Between the free drinks and the inability to focus, people lost fortunes instead. Moreover, Blackjack remained hugely popular.<p>You never hear about people losing money in Vegas, only about that one time someone won big. It&#x27;s the same with WSB, sort of. They do lose money and lots of it. Moreover, they post the losses. It is only during squeezes like with Tesla do we hear about it in the media.<p>Still, at the end of the day, they invest a very, very small sum of money and can&#x27;t have much influence. I thought for a while that maybe there were outside influences driving memes to get the cartel to behave a certain way, but decided they are not much of a force.')
