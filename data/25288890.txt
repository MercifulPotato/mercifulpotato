Here are some benchmark results of the iPhone 12 versus some of it’s Android competitors [1]. Notice that last year’s iPhone 11 Pro Max still outperforms Android phones from this year as well.<p>I think part of the reason this isn’t a major differentiator (for phones at least) is that phones have been “fast enough” for several years now. Given the very aggressive throttling that is utilized on these types of devices, I think the primary difference ends up being battery life &#x2F; efficiency rather than raw performance.<p>It’s also worth noting that while the performance &#x2F; efficiency gap between x86 and ARM seems to be pretty sizable at this point, the gap between various current generation ARM CPUs isn’t nearly as drastic.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tomsguide.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;iphone-12-benchmarks-this-destroys-every-android-phone" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tomsguide.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;iphone-12-benchmarks-this-des...</a>')
