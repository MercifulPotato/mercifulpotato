By using a 3D scanner, you aren’t getting rid of artists, you are just changing how artists do their jobs. Vocal synthesizers and vocal transformers, similarly, aren’t making it possible to press a button and get reasonable sounding voice in your games if you don’t have a voice actor making it possible. If you aren’t convinced, then just look at soundtracks. You can press a button and your iMac will spit out the sounds of the BBC Symphony Orchestra violin section. In spite of this, getting a symphonic score is still expensive. It’s expensive enough that TV shows (with sizable budgets) often skip out on the symphonic score and do something cheaper. We haven’t gotten rid of musicians, it’s just that musicians are much more likely to have computers.<p>There is, in theory, nothing stopping you from buying like $200 in software and making a symphony orchestra right now. The problem is that you have <i>no idea</i> how to write a symphony orchestra. For the same reason, if you have an iPhone 12 or something similar then you can start using the LIDAR features and making a 3D model using photogrammetry in moments—except for the fact that you have <i>no idea</i> how to make a 3D model.<p>I think there’s a trap that people fall into, thinking that technology is just around the corner that will get rid of job X, Y, or Z. Often what you end up with is MORE people doing job X, Y, and Z, it’s just that they use computers to do it, and have a different skill set.')
