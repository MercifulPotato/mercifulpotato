Overall, they have been calling states for Biden (and Trump) much sooner than most of the other news organizations, so they haven&#x27;t shown any reluctance to calling it the way they see it. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they call a Biden win first -- it seems like they want to be breaking these calls and getting the traffic&#x2F;views.<p>Brian Stelter (CNN Chief Media Correspondent&#x2F;Anchor of Reliable Sources) said on Monday night that although the Fox Editorial department is a dumpster fire (not his exact words), the AP&#x2F;Fox election desk is trustworthy and usually does a trustworthy job (it&#x27;s not just Fox News alone, they&#x27;re working alongside the AP).<p>I&#x27;ve been flipping through the networks and other than Fox News calling Arizona a little before they probably should have, they haven&#x27;t shown any bias toward either candidate in the numbers. I can&#x27;t say the same for the guests they have chosen to have on.')
