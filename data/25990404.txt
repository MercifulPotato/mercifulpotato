Again for what it&#x27;s worth (perhaps nothing), at 7:53AM ET this morning, I added this sentence:<p>&gt; Citadel is a hedge fund and market maker. Its success has vaulted founder Ken Griffin to a net worth of more than $20 billion. Technically, the two sides of Citadel (hedge fund &#x2F; market maker) are split into two separate arms -- but they are both under one parent company and owned by Ken Griffin.<p>This was posted on HN (again, not by me) after I added that sentence.')
