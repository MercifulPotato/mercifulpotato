I picked up an x230 for cheap pre-Covid, and it looks like x220s are now selling for 75% more than I paid.<p>I am sure that it is possible to get these computers. For example, lots of places are shutting down offices to move to remote-only, and I am seeing tens of computers at liquidation auctions every week...but it is obviously difficult to get this to where they are needed (and at liquidation, these things are still being given away...$50 or so for a 4th gen Intel, with monitor&#x2F;keyboard&#x2F;mouse).<p>But I suppose not many people know where to get things or how to make it work themselves. It always has to be new, new, new. Also, realistically, you should be able to do work on a phone...the idea with phones is&#x2F;was that they are replacing the functionality of towers. It isn&#x27;t ideal but it should be possible.')
