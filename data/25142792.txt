That&#x27;s not a bad thing per se, but I think it diverges from what most of society implicitly wants.<p>You stance optimizes for liberty as you rightly point out. People, however, generally want a society that balances liberty and stability. Laws and policies are enacted to try and find that right balance. It&#x27;s similar to the centralized banking model vs. a completely laissez-faire economy; it&#x27;s enacted to provide stability, perhaps at the expense of some liberty. I don&#x27;t think people inherently have an issue with the government having a monopoly as long as they have a say in how that government functions. In a well-functioning democracy, the people <i>are</i> the government so the idea of a governmental monopoly is diluted somewhat.')
