It&#x27;s not gonna be as efficient as a heat pump so there is some loss, but the heat added is heat your HVAC doesn&#x27;t have to provide so it&#x27;s not exactly wasted. I haven&#x27;t actually run the numbers to calculate the effective power used (how much energy it uses to generate the same amount of heat versus if a more efficient heat pump did it), but my hunch is that it ends up being quite a bit more competitive than it might first appear.')
