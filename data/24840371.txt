Item(by='zachf', descendants=None, kids=[24840669, 24840599], score=None, time=1603216401, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24840267, text='The “physicist” explanation that I heard (meaning non-rigorous but good for building intuition) is that at every point where the derivative vanishes, for suitably random functions, every direction you move in will either be a direction where you increase or decrease at about 50-50 odds. In D dimensions there are 2D independent directions to rise or fall in (e.g. in D=2 dimensions, there’s north south east west), so there’s about 1&#x2F;2^(2D) odds that any given critical point is actually a minimum if those probabilities are independent. That gets small really fast at large D.<p>Obviously this is not rigorous, though.')
