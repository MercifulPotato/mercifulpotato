This is what I notice after asking questions.<p>1. Most People Like Answering Questions<p>I notice that most often people are receptive to answering my questions. They like giving quite in-depth information about the project or certain parts of the code. Sometimes even more then what I was asking. In fact, sometimes they explain about parts I wouldn&#x27;t be able to google or search up because it pertains specifically to the project.<p>2. Knowing when to stop.<p>Sometimes I notice some people do get annoyed at my questions so that&#x27;s when I know that I should stop for the day. Knowing when to stop is also a skill to be developed over time.<p>3. Batching Questions<p>This both helped me to understand what I didn&#x27;t know and be able to verbalize it. I write down my questions and 3 things happens in this process.<p>One result is that I discover the answer to my question. I was framing the question in the wrong way. I either know the answer or through framing the question realize what is the answer.<p>Second thing is just clarifying whether the question is something I am able to search or find on the web. This tells me it&#x27;s that my knowledge on this topic or subject requires more research on my part.<p>Lastly, it displays that I respect the other individual&#x27;s time. My working time is not worth the same value to the company, wage or impact as the senior engineer. Usually, they have more responsibilities and important tasks to delegate or manage. By batching together questions, they know that I made the effort to list these questions to ask at the same time.<p>All this is what I gather after 1 month of working at my company.<p>Edit: Also I stopped caring about looking competent. I feel confident in the fact that if I don&#x27;t know something, I&#x27;ll be able to find it or learn it. Rather than, being confident in my own ability to appear smart or look competent. That at the end of the day is more important to me. Competency in engineering is managing what you don&#x27;t know and learning how to find the resources to tackle what you don&#x27;t know.')
