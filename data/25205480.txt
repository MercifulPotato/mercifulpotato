I could play 6K realtime at 1&#x2F;4 quality, while my fully loaded MBP with i7 + 32GB of ram could only playback at 1&#x2F;8 quality. Keep in mind real editors NEVER edit raw footage, they use proxies.<p>The really impressive part was that the mac mini did NOT spin up the fan during playback, completely silent. The i7 Macbook Pro sounded like a jet turbine spinning up within 30 seconds. Awesome.')
