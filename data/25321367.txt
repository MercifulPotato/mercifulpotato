Once those became hard to find, they switched to cigarettes.<p>2) I hate smoking lights or menthols because I need to smoke more of them to get the same satisfaction as a 100.<p>3) A lot of people don&#x27;t know you can at least write-off smoking cessation aids on your taxes.<p>4) There are medications such as Wellbutrin that help reduce cravings. I&#x27;ve taken one, and it basically makes it so you get nauseous from smoking or dampens your ability to taste it at all.<p>5) It&#x27;s annoying to get cessation aids. There are plenty of neighborhoods without even a basic pharmacy and no dearth of liquor stores.<p>6) There&#x27;s campaigns to prevent people from smoking and there&#x27;s campaigns to help people quit. There&#x27;s one way to moralize and there&#x27;s another way towards harm reduction. Telling people they will die or get sick only makes them feel more cool. Smoking is cool. Especially when you&#x27;re a teenager who feels invincible.<p>6a) I like this campaign they did in Japan produced by Japan Tobacco.\n<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;inventorspot.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;japan_tobaccos_delightfully_dist_9553" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;inventorspot.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;japan_tobaccos_delightfully...</a><p>7) Encourage smokers to carry an ashtray. Muji sells one for $5. It is my favorite accessory, because I use it to pick up other people&#x27;s cigarettes.\n <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.muji.us&#x2F;store&#x2F;d-aluminium-portable-ashtray.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.muji.us&#x2F;store&#x2F;d-aluminium-portable-ashtray.html</a><p>8) Cigarettes are incredibly valuable as currency and shifting their value towards the black market will backfire. The illegal cigarette trade has all sorts of geopolitical ramifications and even selling a loosie here in USA will get you killed.<p>9) Nicotine by itself is not sufficient for me. I smoke cigarettes BECAUSE they are dirty. There is something more than just nicotine that is addictive about the flavor. Substituting or replacing nicotine intake does nothing to change my addiction to the habit itself.<p>10) People smoke literally just to talk to other smokers. This is basically a science in nightlife culture and even a tradition in some places.<p>In conclusion: this smells like ethics washing.\nThe only &quot;better&quot; cigarette, is no cigarette.<p>The argument for a &quot;safer&quot; cigarette is old. And it&#x27;s marketing.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;wgbh&#x2F;nova&#x2F;cigarette&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;wgbh&#x2F;nova&#x2F;cigarette&#x2F;</a><p>There are substantial measures we can take actions towards to reduce harm.\nReduction of pesticides. Polonium. Regulation in cultivation and curing.\nDid you know that tomatoes can get mosaic virus from smoke or ash?\nThings like &#x27;natural&#x27;, &#x27;organic&#x27;, &#x27;less-additive&#x27; create false perceptions of &#x27;healthiness&#x27;.<p>Legalize cigarettes. Ban smoking.<p>Aside:\nThe title is &#x27;easy-way-to-quit-smoking&#x27;<p>The headline is &#x27;The Easy Way for Joe Biden to Save Lives&#x27;<p>The submission is &#x27;Eliminating nicotine from tobacco products could help up to 5 million adult smokers quit within a year.&#x27;<p>I find the wording to be a bit odd.')
