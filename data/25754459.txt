What&#x27;s different <i>now</i> is the speed and concentration of misinformation.<p>Platforms of mass misinformation and manipulation are curious beasts, and susceptibility to radicalization != stupidity. Something somewhat novel appears to be happening due the new ways we communicate, and it&#x27;s not unreasonable to suggest that &quot;something&quot; should be done about it.')
