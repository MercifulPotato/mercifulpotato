M1 does not change anything in that regard.<p>So the only meaning that remains that would make sense is: how would HP, Asus, Dell, and others react if MS sold non-OEM licenses for Windows 10 for ARM.<p>Given for now I suspect they don&#x27;t ship a lot of ARM laptops, that boils down to; would the M1 hardware be unfair competition.<p>I don&#x27;t think so. MS x86 emulation is likely inferior to what Apple is doing for now, and I&#x27;m not sure if&#x2F;how quickly they could make use of the M1 specific capabilities if they even wanted to. So at least the market won&#x27;t shift quickly.<p>Will it shift slowly? Maybe.')
