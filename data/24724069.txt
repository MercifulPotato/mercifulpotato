For example extremely few people from below median homes are politically active in USA, while home owners are among the most active. Ergo people are mostly politically active to defend their privileges and not to fix injustices.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how anyone can think that being politically active would make your life more stable.<p>Edit: An example of this is that black people are much less likely to vote than white people. Is this because black people support the status quo while white people want to change things? No, it is because black people don&#x27;t have the time and energy to spare to vote. And no, this isn&#x27;t about voting disenfranchisement, black people are less likely to vote even in very blue states.')
