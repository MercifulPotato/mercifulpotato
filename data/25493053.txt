The &quot;m&quot; is the number of states you&#x27;re speculating on which doesn&#x27;t grow with look-ahead length. In the case where you&#x27;re just speculating on whether an instruction starts at a given byte offset, you would have m = 2.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone is saying they could scale up the decoder &quot;for free&quot;. If they had a fixed-length ISA, I&#x27;m sure they would have increased the decoder width sooner (and using different techniques) since with high-end out-of-order cores you&#x27;re always looking for cheap ways to over-provision your pipeline even if it only helps on some workloads some of the time. Their current use of the uop cache tells us that they consider it the most economical trade-off at that point in the design space (where the decoder can output up to 4 instructions and the uop cache can output up to 6 instructions); you can&#x27;t infer that they&#x27;ve hit an impassable brick-wall with instruction decoding.')
