Item(by='balfirevic', descendants=None, kids=[25702986, 25703123], score=None, time=1610215190, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25702436, text='&gt; Strength Training very broadly just means a rep range that makes you stronger, not bigger.<p>There is no such thing (edit: well, except maybe 1-2 reps, because it&#x27;s hard to get much volume with those. But beginners shouldn&#x27;t be doing those anyway). You get stronger in the rep range you practice. People often (in gym circles) mean &quot;1-rep strength&quot; when they say &quot;strength&quot;, but such a narrow definition only makes sense if you are competing in powerlifting.<p>As a beginner you want the rep range that maximizes gains&#x2F;risk and also gains&#x2F;unpleasantness ratio, which will usually be 5-10.<p>&gt; rep range is high with bodybuilding because bodybuilding cares about volume<p>People who train for strength also care about volume because volume is a great way to get stronger. And also great way to get bigger. Which makes sense, because getting bigger is a great way to get stronger.<p>&gt; starting off as an amateur by copying what bodybuilders are doing<p>I think this is where the most of the confusion comes from. It is bad to start amateurs on stuff that professional body builders do, but it would also be bad to start them on stuff professional powerlifters do (low bar one-rep max squats or speed deadlifts).<p>On the other hand, as an amateur, whether your goal is strength or better physique - the best approach is going to be very similar.<p>&gt; Not to mention machines are garbage and cause injury since they make you do unnatural things (unless you really know what you are doing, which amateurs do not).<p>Some types of machines are absolutely fine (cable machines), other types are also mostly fine - they get a bad reputation from few of the worst offenders such as leg press and leg extension machine.')
