I am aware it is a single point of data in my case but it is backed by research and accepted medical advice (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC3412202&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC3412202&#x2F;</a>). I had severe chronic pain from herniated disc that was not a perfect candidate for immediate surgery.<p>My GP prescribed Cymbalta (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cochrane.org&#x2F;CD007115&#x2F;NEUROMUSC_duloxetine-treating-painful-neuropathy-chronic-pain-or-fibromyalgia" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cochrane.org&#x2F;CD007115&#x2F;NEUROMUSC_duloxetine-treat...</a>) and I was surprised to find out that the depression med actually is known to help with chronic pain.<p>It took a few days&#x2F;weeks to really kick in but it absolutely worked for me. What it did was dissociate my conscious self from my in-pain self. I was always aware that my body was in pain but frankly it didn’t bother me.<p>This allowed my body the time to properly heal itself without me consciously trying to adjust my position and movement to minimize pain. After about 9 months, I got off the meds, completely pain free. Cymbalta does have a ton of side effects and I experienced a number of them, especially when tapering off. However it was all worth it to get rid of the literal pain in my neck. Sounds like a parody to say “Ask your doctor about Cymbalta” but honestly if you are in chronic pain, don’t want to be addicted to opioids, have tried every rational thing but this, it is not a woo crystal oil gimmick. It is a risk that may be worthwhile to you.')
