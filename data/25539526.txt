But, there is no separate memory for textures to take advantage of.  Just a 4k cache that textures were loaded into from main RAM one at a time while rendering.<p>There were some games that manually implemented their own virtual memory paging system to map the cartridge ROM to RAM address space.<p>But, in general a feature that distinguished the N64 from the PS1 was that it had a single, unified block of RAM for all of the hardware to share however you like.')
