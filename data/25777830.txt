Unfortunately, my day-to-day doesn&#x27;t provide opportunities to work with the massive amounts of data we generate. I&#x27;ve looked into learning this stuff online but courses like DataCamp seem too basic (I have experience with Python and data cleaning in a research setting along with some academic ML experience) or downright a bit scammy. Many of the articles I read online about this also frame data engineering as a way to transition into the tech industry, which isn&#x27;t my blocker. Does anyone have advice to help me transition away from pure software to a job as a data engineer?')
