I&#x27;ve tried a variety of noscript chrome extensions and can&#x27;t seem to turn off the right things without breaking the site entirely. It&#x27;s driving me crazy that this simple-ish site is making my fans blow at full speed all day. I even modded my MBA by adding better thermal components, literally just so I could use LinkedIn everything else slowing down. I have uBlock Origin running, tried to turn it off as LinkedIn allegedly punishes user with ad blockers by forcing more CPU usage, but still nothing seems to work. I&#x27;m contemplating running a remote instance (on paperspace?)  just to use Linkedin without killing the performance of my other tasks...')
