If they don&#x27;t get them they will simply loose out on money (reviewing the game 1-2 weeks after everybody else already did so is kind of pointless) and I&#x27;d guess a reviewer would risk getting essentially blacklisted by the whole industry as there is no reason to assume that a reviewer would uphold one NDA but not the other.<p>Game publishers also tend to advertise their content on said review sites and youtube channels so that would be another income stream gone.')
