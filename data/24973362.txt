But the risk of The Algorithm locking me out on a whim is definitely scary. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m following more of a &quot;have a backup plan&quot; strategy: mostly just making sure I have copies of all I care about in other places. Gmail, Drive, Photos, etc. Sure, changing workflows and stuff would be painful, but not as much as all that PLUS losing all my data.<p>Sure, my gmail address is still the primary (possibly only) contact on many many places, but I think that risk would be outweighed by my domain registration accidentally lapsing, or my servers getting spamlisted, or smaller providers going out of business. Again, it would be infuriating and bothersome, but not the end of the world.<p>That said, I try to keep my personal account for personal stuff, and whenever I want to try something out of the &quot;ordinary layman user&quot; realm, like trying out dev tools or APIs, cloud products, you name it, I&#x27;ll use a secondary unrelated account just in case The Algorithm finds that odd and ban-worthy.')
