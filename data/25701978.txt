It was such a major point that I decided the book needed a near-complete rewrite to fix. The editor was worth the money just for that one thing!<p>You&#x27;re definitely right about genre conventions playing a big role. That said, you can still say &quot;I think the character hasn&#x27;t suffered enough, but maybe that&#x27;s normal in this genre&quot;. What I said about my own editor is actually interesting because they don&#x27;t normally edit my genre, which was obvious in some aspects, but they could still point out the pacing &#x2F; tension issue.')
