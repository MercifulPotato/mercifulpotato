Fiction rarely shows how long it can go on with virtually no memories left and no ability to care for oneself for even a couple hours. (The fictional danger is often shows as the person forgetting where they live and walking off - the real danger is that they will shit themselves, not tell anyone, and get painful skin issues.)<p>That’s before you get into the emotional side. How many times a year do you think you could meet your mother and have her not know you from a stranger? No, seeing her every day doesn’t help either - it actually makes it worse for both of you.<p>Alzheimer’s can be such a slow death you’ve already grieved through “acceptance” while your loved one is still, medically speaking, ‘alive.’')
