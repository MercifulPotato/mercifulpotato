It&#x27;s mostly a matter of avoiding short circuits and mechanical damage.<p>Multi-cell devices require a little more knowledge and care, but the main thing is just to make sure the cells <i>match</i>. Being the same model and charged to full before installation will do for new cells, but salvaged ones need to be tested and binned.')
