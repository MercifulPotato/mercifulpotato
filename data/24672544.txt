At that point, someone has to be responsible, and a reasonable choice would be the most senior manager(s) who mandated that policy and perhaps the level above them for failing to adequately supervise and control them before the damage was done.<p>The company itself is likely to have the legal liability anyway, unless perhaps there was actually criminal conduct on the part of its staff. However, surely those managers should expect at a minimum to be disciplined. Depending on the severity of the mistake, the seniority of each manager and the level of awareness of the relevant issues that they should have had, something like this might even constitute gross misconduct and be a firing matter.')
