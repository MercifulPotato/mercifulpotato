No one should have to live in fear that they&#x27;ll be spotted on some camera and have their life ruined.<p>Those that break the law SHOULD have to live in fear that they&#x27;ll face consequences. In some cases that may amount to having &quot;their life ruined&quot; and in other cases the consequences may not be that dramatic. But we have a society built on laws, and enforcing the law is required in a fair and just society.<p>&gt; Last week we were all discussing how hospital administrators blamed &quot;the algorithm&quot; when vaccines were issued to admins rather than front line workers. People constantly say, &quot;well, the computer says...&quot; when the computer is obviously making a mistake.<p>In my opinion, you are comparing very different situations. The hospital admins have an incentive to get admins vaccinated first, and are not in a position where they&#x27;re tasked with <i>validating</i> an algorithm&#x27;s match. Additionally, the algorithm in question did not involve machine learning as a facial recognition algorithm would. It was simply software implementing a very straightforward formula (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technologyreview.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;21&#x2F;1015303&#x2F;stanford-vaccine-algorithm&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technologyreview.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;21&#x2F;1015303&#x2F;stanford...</a>).<p>&gt;  The TSA regularly screws up people&#x27;s travel because they make mistakes about the no fly list.<p>This isn&#x27;t because of facial recognition or black box machine learning algorithms. It is because the TSA uses very rudimentary heuristics like name matching, to err on the side of safety. I disagree with the unsophisticated approach they use, for what its worth. A complex AI based matching algorithm would do a better job of balancing safety against such mistakes.')
