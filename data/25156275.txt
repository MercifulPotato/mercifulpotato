If you look at their minimum browser requirements, then look at the minimum OS requirements from the browser, and go back to hardware requirements from that, you&#x27;ll probably end up with something that seems ridiculously overpowered for the task, yet with that &quot;minimum supported&quot; system the site will still be slow as molasses and worse than the static page.
