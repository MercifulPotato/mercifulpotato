My main point is that the smaller states would have never agreed to a representative democracy which made their desires 100% irrelevant.<p>There&#x27;s enough small states like that to get some leverage. WY is one example, but there&#x27;s many more. And as we saw in the civil war, states and people were willing to go to war to defend their interests, whatever those interests were.<p>I simply can&#x27;t imagine the feds trying to conquer Wyoming. There are no cities to burn. There would be a rifle behind every shrub-brush, and the casualties would be so massive, and so demoralizing, that they would be forced to allow those states to form their own federation. It would be a high-desert Vietnam situation.<p>edit: I&#x27;m actually so ignorant on the history that I didn&#x27;t realize WY became a state in 1890. The Great Compromise was in 1787. So this matter was already long settled by the time they had a chance to become a state - this nation was clearly intended to be a federation of states with independent control.')
