When Leslie Stahl [1] on 60 minutes says it&#x27;s never been proven that the Trump campaign was spied on, that&#x27;s deliberate journalistic malpractice. When Joe Biden is never asked about anything that could even remotely stymie his campaign, that&#x27;s deliberate journalistic malpractice. When that malpractice covers _every single news outlet_ except Greenwald, Taibbi, and Tucker Carlson, that&#x27;s a coordinated disinformation campaign. I&#x27;ll let you draw your own conclusions, if you are able.<p>[1]. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitchute.com&#x2F;video&#x2F;S55HwMyFjSP3&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitchute.com&#x2F;video&#x2F;S55HwMyFjSP3&#x2F;</a> - I&#x27;m not sure what made it into the on-air version.

HN won&#x27;t let me post, so I&#x27;ll just edit. From Wikipedia: Former NSA leaker Edward Snowden has used the term generally to refer to the influence of civil servants over elected officials: &quot;the deep state is not just the intelligence agencies, it is really a way of referring to the career bureaucracy of government. These are officials who sit in powerful positions, who don&#x27;t leave when presidents do, who watch presidents come and go ... they influence policy, they influence presidents.&quot;<p>Let me remind you, he&#x27;s in Russia because Joe Biden personally called half a dozen heads of state and threatened them with reprisals.')
