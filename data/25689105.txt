It sends a message of non-approachability if you have heavily-armed forces out front, which politicans don&#x27;t like.<p>I&#x27;m assuming a similar security plan is in place in e.g. European countries&#x27; parliaments; extracting the high value targets is P1. The building is just a building; if it&#x27;s damaged it can be repaired. And killing a bunch of people defending a building is a political no-go.<p>None of this applies to an embassy.')
