Traditionally, companies used a VPN to allow remote access to their network.  If an attacker breached that VPN, they would have unfettered access to the internal network.  The idea here is that companies are going to use a &quot;reverse VPN&quot; (not sure if that&#x27;s the proper term..) where they tunnel all server traffic through Cloudflare&#x27;s network, and then people needing remote access to whatever service, which would in the past be an &quot;internal&quot; product, can connect over the plain old internet (or using Cloudflare&#x27;s WARP VPN).  Cloudflare Access, which is a product that works with various identity providers, sits in the middle and ensures that only people with the proper roles can access the &quot;internal but now external&quot; app&#x2F;services.  Basically, route all enterprise traffic through Cloudflare and let Cloudflare make sure only people who should have access do.  There seems to be a bunch of ancillary services on offer too, like integration with services that provide apps that live on phones&#x2F;laptops and &quot;ensure&quot; that they haven&#x27;t been compromised&#x2F;rooted, which then report back to Cloudflare who then allows&#x2F;denies access based upon that information.')
