They also involved total strangers driving us home from bars. We&#x27;ve also had people rent their private homes as lodging: that&#x27;s how I vacationed with my parents in Eastern Europe in early 1990s. Even today, if you go to any town on Baltic Sea, you&#x27;ll find plenty of &quot;Rooms&quot; signs (in local language) on private homes; many of them have been up for decades.<p>All of what Uber and Airbnb do, had most definitely existed before. What Uber and Airbnb brought was making it much more efficient, convenient and safe. Uber and Airbnb use some level of social trust, but they also <i>provide</i> extra trust on their own, which comes from the rating function they provide. Before Uber and Airbnb, if you had bad experience in a cab or a rented lodging, there was little recourse, and the service provides had little incentive to behave well. Now, they can easily get kicked off the platform after too many complaints.')
