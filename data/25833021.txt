In fact things that are a failure in one system are a success in the other.<p>In the same way today, groups like the Jawara&#x2F;Andaman or similar tribes will always remain a footnote in our books, at least until their successful assimilated into our own &quot;superior&quot; culture, and then we give them an honorary mention (= by then their way of living is destroyed ofc).<p>Another way to read this (and the way I personally do) is that a successful decentralized alternative is often the by-product of (an over-reaching) centralized system. Take a look for what the state labels as crooks, outlaws, degenerates, pirates, insurgents, terrorists, or anyone they are struggling to tax and prosecute, ... in modern times Roma&#x2F;gypsies are the only ones left who come to mind. Everyone else we eradicate!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;James_C._Scott#The_Art_of_Not_Being_Governed" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;James_C._Scott#The_Art_of_Not_...</a>')
