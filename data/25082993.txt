I read this statement in the same way I read his comments in &#x27;08 and &#x27;12 about how he &#x27;struggled&#x27; with the question of whether gay marriage should be legal. Now, as then, he is playing to the middle (In the case of gay marriage, to the middle of the American electorate. In the current case, to the middle of the Democratic party). He doesn&#x27;t know which way the political winds are blowing for Democrats--further leftward or back to the center--and he is too shrewd to be left behind in either case.')
