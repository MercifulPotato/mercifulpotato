Cost of living, housing, etc. is obviously different in US, you might end up with less income than is necessary for survival. What makes you think you will be able to find any workers at all, let alone those trained to the necessary standard and skill?<p>It should be obvious that appropriate responce to a crime (slave labour) being committed is not to commit the same crime yourself.<p>Any products with stolen materials, stolen labour, or stolen taxes should not be allowed on the market at all.')
