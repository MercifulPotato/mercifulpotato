Item(by='shuntress', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602877998, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24803566, text='&gt; &quot;Being who you are&quot;, &quot;Staying true to yourself&quot; etc, are very negative things to tell someone<p>I disagree with this though I think I understand how the lack of nuance in &quot;be yourself&quot; can allow it to be easily misinterpreted.<p>&gt; I used to really like X, it was a core part of my identity. One day I simply decided to not do X anymore, I didn&#x27;t like the people doing X and I didn&#x27;t see any successful people in my orbit, and I replaced it with Y &amp; Z.<p>This is basically the textbook definition of &quot;Being who you are&quot; or &quot;Staying true to yourself&quot;')
