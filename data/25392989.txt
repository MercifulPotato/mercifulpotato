They also exposed 600,000 people (the &quot;liquidators&quot;) to direct contact with life-limits of radiation in the clean up. I also love the nukers going hand in hand with the oppressive soviet-era government in covering up the immense toll of Chernobyl, because it suits their argument.<p>In Fukushima&#x27;s case, it was the fact they had decades worth of spent fuel rods that if they weren&#x27;t able to keep them cool (which was a possibility in the first weeks after the disaster) would have ignited, once again releasing ungodly amounts of radiation. This practice of storing spent fuel rods onsite is also very common in the US, and it is a huge problem waiting to happen.<p>Great excerpt from suppressed Japanese report on Fukushima:<p>&quot;A report delivered to then Prime Minister Kan Naoto on March 25 warned that if the situation at the plant spun completely out of control, authorities would have to issue mandatory or voluntary evacuation orders for all people living within 250 kilometers (155 miles) of the plant - a zone including greater Tokyo (population 35 million, the world&#x27;s top city in terms of GDP) and the major cities of Sendai (pop. 1 million) and Fukushima (pop. 280,000).&quot; source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apjjf.org&#x2F;-Asia-Pacific-Journal-Feature&#x2F;4706&#x2F;article.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apjjf.org&#x2F;-Asia-Pacific-Journal-Feature&#x2F;4706&#x2F;article...</a><p>Gee, evacuate Tokyo. Oh well, at least we have our totally earth-friendly nuclear power!')
