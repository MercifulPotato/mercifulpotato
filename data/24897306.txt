Not sure if Zoom does this. Hiding a little &quot;mute&quot; icon in the corner is not good enough, we need to bake this functionality deep into the UI so that it becomes a natural and reflexive part of meetings. Zoom doesn&#x27;t share layouts across all participants, which is a big problem too.')
