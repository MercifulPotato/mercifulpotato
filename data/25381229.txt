Fedora is and will continue to be the the RHEL upstream for <i>major releases</i>.<p>Lifecycle of RHEL:<p><pre><code>  Fedora \n  |\n  Enterprise Linux Next*\n  |\n  HARD FORK for next RHEL\n  |\n  Centos Stream (Pre-release phase)\n  |\n  RHEL Major release\n  |\n  CentOS Stream\n  |\n  RHEL Minor release\n</code></pre>\nThose last two will loop until the RHEL full support phase (first 5 years) are over, at which point Stream will end due to there being no more minor releases. Any consumers of Stream will need to migrate to the next major version of Stream.<p>Stream will have effectively 6 years of support (5 + 1 year pre-release), and RHEL will be releasing major versions every 3 years.<p>Considering new technology and design decisions aren&#x27;t incubated at all in CentOS, it is in no way shape or form possible to use it to replace Fedora.<p>* ELN: Fedora Rawhide with RHEL buildroot context.')
