You assume everyone&#x27;s first language is English, right?<p>So, it really depends on your search engine. Using 3 different ones, assuming my English spelling is less than stellar, only looking at the first page:<p>&quot;Prolog Web framework&quot;<p>Duck Duck Go&#x2F; Bing&#x2F; Google: all prolog<p>&quot;Prologe Web framework&quot;<p>Duck Duck Go: 5th hit is Prolog based<p>Bing: 7th hit is prolog<p>Google: first hit prolog<p>So yeah - there is a possibility of confusion.<p>&gt; If someone told me about that “C programming language” I could easily transliterate that as “sea” or misremember it as “B”.<p>If you knew nothing about programming and technology. I counter that if someone told be about &quot;Prologue&quot; I would assume &quot;Prolog&quot;. I wonder why &quot;Nim&quot; would come in to it? I don&#x27;t know about you, but I don&#x27;t go around saying &quot;I wrote apps in MFC in C++ in the 90&#x27;s&quot;, or &quot;I write ASP.Net applications in C#&quot;. I think the framework stands alone, surely? The language is an implementation detail, and I guess Prologue might one day be ported to another platform if it is really all that good?<p>The issue is that your position is people something like - should be intelligent enough to know what is meant by a phrase. My position is that you are massively underestimating the issue with the words basically looking and sounding the same. Your attempt at a counter is a weak argument about how people might dramatically misremember facts anyway.<p>I think I looked at your history, and this is not the first time you got in to a debate like this, so I&#x27;m out... it&#x27;s a bad name - the creator should probably rethink it or prefix &quot;Nim&quot; to make it unique, but whatever.')
