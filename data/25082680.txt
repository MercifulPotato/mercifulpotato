We run phone and computer repair shops as our primary business. Uber is his part-time side gig.<p>We do pay into unemployment, as we are both salaried workers of our own business.<p>He did not take unemployment during Covid. Our stores were considered essential, so they stayed open.<p>That is pretty much the point of part-time driving. You have a full-time job or business that pays the bills and you just want some extra cash.<p>The extra cash from Uber enabled him to pay off his car quickly and continues to provide extra money for our family. It is not a full-time income, nor do we ever expect it to be.<p>This is our situation, and I understand that others are different. However, you specifically asked about him, so I replied with our details.')
