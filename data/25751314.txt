Item(by='em500', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610476527, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25748817, text='&gt; When the government calculates inflation, they look at prices of common goods, but not housing. Housing is based on monthly payment. That&#x27;s why inflation is artificially low.<p>Please read how the shelter part of CPI is actually calculated, rather than using your imagination. The rental component of shelter is based on surveying renters how much rent they actually pay. Owner equivalent rents (OER) components is based on surveying owners how much rent they think their house would rent for. It&#x27;s simply answering the question &quot;If someone were to rent your home today, how much do you think it would rent for monthly?&quot;. There are no house prices, no interests rates, no house payments in there at all; they only affect CPI as far as it unfluences house owner estimates of rents.<p>The OER component of CPI would be &quot;artificially low&quot; if you believe owners systematically understate how much their own house would rent for (or if you believe the BLS folks are lying). Your $500k house would be equivalent to the $210k 1990 house in the CPI calculation if its owner believes it would rent for the same amount today as in 1990.')
