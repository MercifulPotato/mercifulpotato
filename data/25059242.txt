That alone has been one of the big things keeping me firmly in Logic Pro&#x27;s camp.<p>I&#x27;m also glad they&#x27;re starting to add more instruments to the default package (notably, finally; a proper &#x27;Upright Piano&#x27;) - as the value proposition of Ableton Standard at $400 vs Logic Pro at $200 has been extremely one-sided in Logic&#x27;s favour for many, many years now.<p>I do understand, of course; I&#x27;m strictly speaking as a Mac user. I honestly have no idea about the DAW landscape for PC&#x27;s. I am extremely reliant on exporting songs from GarageBand on my iPhone as I create beats on the go quite often - and opening those .garageband files in Logic Pro to seriously hone in on the sounds, keeping the original instruments and MIDI intact. It&#x27;s an irreplaceable ecosystem for me.')
