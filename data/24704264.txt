It&#x27;s certainly better than the death in the post I was replying to (&quot;was found dead in his home because he couldn&#x27;t afford $1,300 per month for insulin.&quot;). I get that the older insulins are not as good. I get that they&#x27;re more difficult to use. They are, however, most definitely better than dying. Any story that says says the person died because they couldn&#x27;t afford 1300&#x2F; month for insulin is being disingenuous.')
