Item(by='goffi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606838460, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25266119, text='&gt; It seems like you are confusing two pieces of software: There is Baloo, which is the KDE file indexer. And then there is Akonadi,<p>Oh right, seeing those Gio in my ~&#x2F;.local&#x2F;share&#x2F;akonadi, I was supposing that it was for file indexing and that was somehow the storage for Baloo or something like that.<p>I haven&#x27;t investigated more than that as I don&#x27;t want to spend too much time on it and just killing Akonadi server from its console is enough (the downside is that after killing it I can&#x27;t use KMail anymore, which otherwise is a really great MUA).<p>So maybe it has something to do with my email settings then? I&#x27;ll try to find time to investigate and check if I haven&#x27;t activated anything like offline storage, otherwise I&#x27;ll create a bug report.<p>Anyway thanks for the great work over the years, beside this little issue, KDE works flawlessly and I like to be able to customize just what I need when I need.')
