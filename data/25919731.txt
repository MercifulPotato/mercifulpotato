If you believe that a flat tax is unfair because the people at the lower end of the spectrum have much less free money that isn&#x27;t taken up by base needs, then it follows that different amounts of money affect people in different circumstances differently.<p>To the person with 10 million dollars, doubling their wealth is nice for them but likely won&#x27;t result in a major change in lifestyle and what they could or couldn&#x27;t do before.  Maybe they go from a large house to a larger house.  For the person that makes 30 thousand a year, doubling it makes a huge difference in how they live.  The disposable income amount doesn&#x27;t double, it&#x27;s likely many <i>many</i> times higher, because it was such a relatively small portion before.<p>The same thing applies to one-time payments.  It would make sense in your example even if the payout was much less (like $10k) but still affected the group similarly (i.e. if they had less disposable income).  That amount of money is a huge  to people that have little disposable income.')
