There&#x27;s only so much you can do by dragging and dropping items on a screen, eventually you need to take their respective escape hatches and do some programming - and when you do it&#x27;s almost never ideal. I&#x27;ve also yet to see a visual coding tool produce readable concise diffs in any source control provider. Most of these tools also require some sort of centralized server infrastructure and a thick client making it so much more challenging to bootstrap new ETL developers.<p>I do hear others in the data world who have migrated to Spark or DBT share the same sentiments - but that could just be confirmation bias.')
