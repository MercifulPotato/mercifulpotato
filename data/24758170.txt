I would _never_ do it again. The process has all the pitfalls of the waterfall software development model, but at the end you have to live in the failed project!<p>It took months for the factory to do their pre-build engineering, and that&#x27;s after they started the process using plans from my architect. The companies building these modules tend to sell mostly from their own catalog of floorplans and modules, so they don&#x27;t have a strong incentive to hire skilled architects for the relatively small amount of custom work that comes in (I fell into this category). I&#x27;m led to believe that they hire draftsmen instead of architects.<p>They built one of the modules a foot too long, so it hangs over the edge of the foundation. They also messed up the roof line, so some guttering and geometry had to be changed for the garage that was stick-built onsite. They did all of the drywall wraps around the windows incorrectly. Every single door was hung incorrectly, some with chunks taken out from bad routing. The vinyl plank flooring has bubbles because they didn&#x27;t float it correctly. They omitted electrical features that were on their own drawings. They ordered a few wrong windows, so they charged me anyway and just laid them on the floor when they shipped the module.<p>It&#x27;ll all be fine at the end of the day, but the parts that were built onsite are all so much better. No cheaper, mind you, but faster and with much less drama. Maybe there are some parts of the industry that do a lot better, but I kind of wish I&#x27;d listened to my dad when he said &quot;the pioneers take the arrows&quot;.')
