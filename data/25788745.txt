Sure it’s not immediately towards your goal but you need the lower level skills and knowledge first. And it’s only 8 days!<p>Stop trying to assemble a fully functional car with no understanding of the fundamentals and then getting frustrated that car assembly is difficult. Go and learn some electrical engineering, go and learn some metalworking, go and learn some mechanical engineering, then you may come back and attempt to assemble a car. You might fail the second time too, but each time you’ll get further.<p>Stop seeking that immediate gratification, the path to success is NEVER a straight line')
