First of all limit orders place a limit on the worst case price that can be executed but SEC rules impose a duty to execute orders at the best price. If there&#x27;s a $100 buy order and the best price is 99 dollars, then there is a duty to fill the order at 99 dollars.<p>Second, the allegation made by the SEC, for which they most likely have very strong evidence, is that Robinhood didn&#x27;t fulfill its duty to execute orders at the best price to the tune of some 30 million dollars.')
