The deal, though, still faces much uncertainty.<p>“All of the technology will be maintained here,” Trump said at a North Carolina rally. “They’re going to move probably to the great state of Texas.”<p>...<p>If approved, the new entity, TikTok Global, would contribute $5 billion to an educational fund based in Texas, according to the Austin American-Statesman, though Walmart said in a press release the money would go to the U.S. Department of the Treasury.
