For example, most units can be converted to another unit of the same dimensionality by mulitiplication or division (such as length in inches * 2.54 == length in millimeters), but then there&#x27;s temperature where you also need to add or subtract an offset.<p>It&#x27;s almost as if humans spent thousands of years inventing units without ever once considering how difficult they might be to implement in a computer programming language.')
