I think it has merit for areas where stem cells can be extracted and edited and then multiplied and the ones with site specific +content identified and the change then confirmed. These cells can then be multiplied and used to replace defective cells - as is done with certain blood cancers where the old stem cells can be killed to allow the multiplied cells to locate in the bone marrow and  replace the defective cells. This has been done pre-CRISPR, by other methods - CRISPR will be of value here. In addition, it will be useable in somatic gene modification after all it&#x27;s details are worked out. Work goes in this area, but is a few years from prime time application.')
