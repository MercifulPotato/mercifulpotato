Some websites will go past that. A torrent client almost certainly will. And, now that people are working from home, there&#x27;s a good chance that having multiple computers will only make that 1024 table limit even more laughable.<p>EDIT: okay I&#x27;m wrong. It&#x27;s 8192 connections, not 1024 connections. But still ridiculously low')
