I tend to open a dozen tabs when looking for a product, with different models, reviews, and second-hand prices. Then I get tired of sitting down, go do something else, do work, get sidetracked into researching other things, and when I get back to the topic of the product I have fifty more tabs and it&#x27;s time to nuke the whole mess. To start anew, I would again go to those listings on local analogues of Google Product Search&#x2F;Amazon and Craigslist, so I guess linking to them would sorta help.')
