It&#x27;s probably hard to break down the revenue generated by individual videos, but I&#x27;m assuming that what little CP there is on PH is in the unverified user generated pool. Users can&#x27;t pay for that on PH, and I suspect that if PH makes money in other ways (advertising and whatnot), that the audience watching these videos is not big enough to make them any money.')
