In Canada I&#x27;ll just say it casually to mean a polite &quot;hope I&#x27;m not troubling you&quot; or &quot;sorry that happened to you&quot;, and never thought of it as immediately declaring responsibility let alone fragility.  But in the US, I&#x27;ve been pounced on for a casual use of that word, as if I&#x27;d announced failure and that I <i>owed</i> something to the other party.<p>So I much appreciate what you&#x27;re saying here.')
