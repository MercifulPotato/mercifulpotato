If the automation falls over we just switch them on and off using the switches. If family are visiting I switch the house to &quot;guest mode&quot; which deactivates the motion sensors and various other automations and we use the light switches like normal.<p>The term &quot;critical path&quot; is when a whole system depends on that thing to function; it is in the critical path.<p>For example, if I couldn&#x27;t use the lights at all when the home automation server is down, or your Mac won&#x27;t run any programs when the phone-home server is down, those things are on the critical path, without them the system fails.')
