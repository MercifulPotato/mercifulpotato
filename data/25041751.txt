Item(by='rasz', descendants=None, kids=[25041879], score=None, time=1604969273, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25040353, text='DVI just encodes VGA signal in digital form :( Same for HDMI. Both are still sending pixels at VGA timings, Hsync&#x2F;Vsync&#x2F;blanking and all, with clocking locked to PixelClock.<p>DisplayPort is packetized, but not in a 100% sane way. You would expect that clean slate purely digital interface designers would at least optionally allow sending whole screen update at a time. Alas you are still sending same VGA formatted pixel stream (Hsync&#x2F;Vsync&#x2F;blanking), just chopped into TUs (32-64 symbol Transfer Units) with stuffing (aka never used garbage) between them, even when connected to eDP display supporting Panel Self-Refresh (own frame buffer inside display).')
