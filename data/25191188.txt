Right now there&#x27;s a big debate about whether there was widespread fraud in our recent election (though I would be remiss not to point out that there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any credible evidence for that). That&#x27;s a politicized factual dispute, the adjudication of which (by which I don&#x27;t merely mean in courts or the Electoral College or what-have-you, but also in the public&#x27;s perception) will have fairly profound real-world consequences for some years to come.<p>That is one of many recent examples of these sorts of politicized factual disputes.')
