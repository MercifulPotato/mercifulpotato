It&#x27;s ok to post your own stuff occasionally, but the primary use of the site should be for curiosity.&quot;<p>and<p>&quot;Please submit the original source. If a post reports on something found on another site, submit the latter.&quot;<p>Basically, submit the things you find that are most interesting to you. Once in a while, that might be your own stuff, but mostly it won&#x27;t be. In your situation, maybe your newsletter contains the things you found interesting; instead of submitting the newsletter, submit the most interesting thing it links to.')
