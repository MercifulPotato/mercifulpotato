For some people, it&#x27;s about how well the character is written, for some it&#x27;s about being able to affect moral decisions, for some it&#x27;s about deciding how they look and sound.<p>I think playing the historical accuracy card here is pointless as games (and popculture in general) always sacrifice accurracy to increase fun - no point in getting upset over this one specific thing.')
