Surprised, I investigated and learned that Urban Dictionary is implementing a new initiative to reduce hate speech and as such is watering down definitions [1]. So now I&#x27;m wondering: is anyone familiar with an alternative resource that contains the &#x27;dirty&#x27; slang that Urban Dictionary used to provide? All of the resources I&#x27;ve found so far don&#x27;t come close to its coverage.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;urbandictionary.blog&#x2F;post&#x2F;2020-07-07-rethinking-the-dictionary&#x2F;')
