It seems like an odd discrepancy.<p>But really. If the polls are so unreliable then at some point people like FiveThirtyEight or the Economist need to understand that and stop incorporating them into models (which may mean not attempting to forecast at all). Just pointing the finger of blame around only gets you so far.')
