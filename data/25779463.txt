If someone tries to seize your property in a nation&#x27;s territory, you can go to that nation&#x27;s government for restitution. They&#x27;ll police their territory and prevent would-be thieves or other bad actors. At the very least, you can bring a suit against the bad actor and the government will force them to comply with the court&#x27;s decision.<p>However on the open sea, there is no such authority. What&#x27;s to stop someone from sailing up and seizing your crew and cargo? You don&#x27;t know the nationality of these pirates, and even if you did you have no way of forcing their government to do anything about it. Indeed they may be working for that government. You could try to defend yourself, but then the pirates will just better arm themselves and the odds of violence escalating dramatically increases.<p>Someone needs to prevent piracy and unlawful seizure for international shipping to be possible at its current scale. Having a single power guarantee free navigation allows ships to cross the world while avoiding complicated jurisdiction divides (if one nation won&#x27;t give you permission to sail through its waters, you can go around) and eliminates jurisdictional overlap (Country A says Country B&#x27;s ship is committing piracy and vice versa) which could lead to conflict. It&#x27;s also just more efficient as the vast majority of nations don&#x27;t need to duplicate the infrastructure to maintain a navy that can protect assets on the other side of the world - which also means countries don&#x27;t need to enter arms races to protect themselves from their neighbors&#x27; defensive fleets &quot;just in case&quot; they aren&#x27;t really that defensive.')
