By the point we realized there was a problem, there was no realistic hope of containing it.<p>If we had been screening international travelers even with a slow test prone to false positives, like a generic coronavirus test, we would have known earlier that we had a problem, and that information could be given to contact tracers to contain the problem. Rather than scrambling to come up with specific and appropriate interventions and countermeasures as our hospitals were being overrun, we could have taken the time to develop a well thought out system and been ready by the time community spread could not be contained.<p>Looking at the future, imagine what it would do to every year&#x27;s flu season if screening for fevers were common. Imagine if you got an alert that someone on your flight was identified by a camera as coughing a lot while standing in line for their TSA check? With minimal inconvenience we could be much better informed about the real-time state of public health, and change our behavior accordingly so we and especially the at-risk get sick less often.')
