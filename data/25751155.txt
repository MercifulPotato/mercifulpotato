They would have to have a big exclusive that I really wanted to see for me to use that again.<p>Smallish differences in how long it takes to get a stream started (including browse&#x2F;search time) probably drive long term behavior, when content quality is similar enough though; because I&#x27;ll tend to use the service that gets me into watching something I&#x27;ll enjoy sooner; and when the same content is available on multiple services, I use the one that&#x27;s faster to get started.')
