Found a couple of new ones, but nothing major. I&#x27;m thinking of abandoning PyCharm altogether. Was really using it mostly for it&#x27;s great debugger, since I had such a good experience with IDEA, but there&#x27;s only so much slowness, hanging, and system resource hogging I&#x27;ll put up with. Maybe it has to do to some degree with the type inference demands of Python. Gonna give Eclipse with PyDev a whirl this weekend.')
