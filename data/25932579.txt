Item(by='rayiner', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611775207, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25929193, text='&gt; I get that there is a need to differentiate, for the purpose of discussion, traditionally privileged white people from, well, literally everyone else.<p>Is there? Asians are wealthier, more educated, more upwardly mobile, less likely to be shot by the police, and live longer, than whites. As an Asian-American man, I can expect to live as long as my Irish-American wife. Latinos, meanwhile, have various disparities resulting from the character and recency of immigration, but have similar economic mobility to whites, and within 1-3 generations achieve economic parity with whites. Cubans, who came to the US as refugees with no money, achieved parity in just one generation. 60% of multiracial people, mostly white-asian and white-hispanic, identify as white, and not multiracial.<p>Black and Native American people, meanwhile, face persistent economic disparities that are both large and are completely unchanged since the segregation era. Almost all black-white multiracial people identify as Black or multiracial, not as white.<p>The constructed term &quot;people of color&quot; actually <i>obscures</i> the fundamental dynamics of American society:<p>1) America is incredibly successful at assimilating immigrants, white or non-white, both socially and economically. The term &quot;people of color&quot; obscures the fact that these groups are basically experiencing the same economic and social trajectory that Germans, Irish, Polish, Italians, etc., experienced over American history.<p>2) America has been unable to make any progress at eliminating economic disparities for two groups that face unique historical circumstances: Black people, and Native Americans. The term &quot;people of color&quot; obscures the fact that these groups are facing American experiences that are <i>sui generis</i> in American history.<p>&quot;People of color&quot; is strictly less useful of a term than what preceded it, &quot;underrepresented minority.&quot; And it appears that people realize that impracticality, because you&#x27;ve seen the emergence of phrases like &quot;assimilation into whiteness&quot; or &quot;white-adjacent&quot; to describe Asians and economically assimilated Latinos. These are phrases (which are offensive, by the way) coined to remedy a self-inflicted problem: defining who is &quot;privileged&quot; in the country in terms of &quot;whiteness&quot; and not something that actually reflects society.')
