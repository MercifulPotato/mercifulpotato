Item(by='vladvasiliu', descendants=None, kids=[24678728], score=None, time=1601815691, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24678462, text='What you say is true, but I think there&#x27;s often a detail missing from these conversations: culture.<p>What I mean is that OP&#x27;s question and your answer both have a context which isn&#x27;t always explicit in these conversations.<p>The Linux kernel development, and I would argue most successful remote shops, have had a &quot;remote first&quot; culture from the beginning, or, if remote was something that came up later, have had a change in culture.<p>My client, for example, has a culture where people would just drop in and ask random questions. Or you would overhear people talking about something and you&#x27;d jump in. During lockdown, this wasn&#x27;t possible anymore. So they would start having meetings among &quot;stakeholders&quot;, which, in the above story would be the people initially in the conversation, and reach some sort of decision. The other people wouldn&#x27;t be able to jump in during the conversation. They could of course argue with the decision, but sometimes they&#x27;d find out about it &quot;too late&quot;.<p>Contrast this with a culture where everything is done in public, for everyone to see and with a possibility for everyone to intervene during the discussion, as is the case on the LKML or as I suppose is the case in a remote-first company. There would be discussions say on slack or some other communication tool where even people not directly invited could at least have a look and see what&#x27;s emerging.<p>I think that those people &quot;wringing their hands about how thereâ€™s no way to do spontaneous, creative, collaborative work remotely&quot; are people used to working in in-person cultures. Not only that, but it&#x27;s very likely that the companies where they work are very &quot;in-person&quot; companies and that those companies have a hard time adapting to the remote way of doing things. It&#x27;s not enough that some people would try to make this work. For this to actually work, there has to be a serious change in how the company itself works.')
