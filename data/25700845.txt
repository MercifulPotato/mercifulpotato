Not just locally, but abroad. They censor our domestic companies that want a foothold in their market (Disney, Blizzard, the NBA, Apple).<p>We need to stop taking their money, and we need to move manufacturing to Vietnam, India, Mexico, and Africa. Strategic manufacturing (medical and tech) needs to be re-onshored.<p>They&#x27;re flexing their muscles because they know they will be on top. If we continue the status quo, it&#x27;s only a matter of time.<p>We will wind up just like them if we continue to let this cancer grow.<p>It will be incredibly painful, but we need to stop importing. Now.<p>We can play hard. Militarize Japan. Strengthen our partnership with Vietnam. Offer US statehood to Taiwan and build a base there. Dispute the South China Sea takeover, start building oil rigs, and police the area.<p>Be a better ally to Europe and our democratic partners.<p>edit: Here come the anti-US downvotes. We&#x27;re overrun with the enemies of democracy. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re a liberal of conservative - we have to unite to protect our precious, priceless freedom.')
