And they end up under the user&#x27;s `&#x2F;images` endpoint too.<p>For eg:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gurlic.com&#x2F;bob&#x2F;images" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gurlic.com&#x2F;bob&#x2F;images</a><p>All exif&#x2F;metadata is stripped, but there is a bit of compression. I think I&#x27;ll allow high-res images if people care enough to use it. I should implement pasting&#x2F;dropping images too. Didn&#x27;t think of that before..')
