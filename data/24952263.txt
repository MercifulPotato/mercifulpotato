What follows is a conversation between nine_zeros and his boss.<p>---<p>Boss: nine_zeros, I told you that your budget was $100k per quarter, but over the past 4 quarters you&#x27;ve managed to spend $500k per quarter! We don&#x27;t have that kind of money!<p>Nine_zeros: I know, I know, but it&#x27;s fine, don&#x27;t worry! My trend line is going <i>down</i> so there is nothing to be concerned about.<p>Boss: That doesn&#x27;t matter NZ! You&#x27;ve already gone $1.6M over budget! Your trend line going down doesn&#x27;t change the fact that you&#x27;ve already spent that money, money which we don&#x27;t have.<p>Nine_zeros: It&#x27;s all the difference in the world. Just look at Stevens, boss. His trend line is going up while mine is going down, that&#x27;s so much worse than me.<p>Boss: Except he was only spending $200k in his first quarter and has only just now gotten up to $400k! You were spending more than that <i>every quarter</i>. It doesn&#x27;t matter if his trend is upward and yours is down if you&#x27;ve spent way more money. It will take him many more quarters to get to what you spent in your first! It&#x27;s easy to have a downward trend when you spend an unbelievable amount of money in your first quarter, anyone can do that.<p>Nine_zeros: Wake up sheeple! Pull the wool out of your eyes! Stop being such a fool!<p>&gt; nine_zeros is fired<p>Fin.<p>---<p>Look, I agree that this country is headed in the wrong direction. But it&#x27;s clearly not Trump&#x27;s fault, you&#x27;ve just been led to believe that by the news media. This country has been waning in some areas for decades now. At the same time, some things have been getting better. Crime is way down from where it was 30 years ago, for example. You wouldn&#x27;t get that from watching the news, but you will from reading the stats. The news isn&#x27;t gonna tell you that though. If everything gets better, what will they have to report on? They make all their money on outrage at the moment. They don&#x27;t want things to get better, because then they&#x27;ll be out of a job.<p>But yes, there are all sorts of things that need to be fixed. Trump, however, is a symptom of the problem, not the cause. Orange man bad is a misdirection that an unfortunate number of Americans have swallowed â€“ hook, line, and sinker. Things aren&#x27;t gonna get better under Biden. He&#x27;s been in Washington for 40 years. Hell, he helped cause some of the problems you mentioned (<i>cough</i> incarceration of blacks <i>cough</i>). He&#x27;ll just lull far too many Americans back into a sense of complacency by offering a much higher level of decorum than Trump, while at the same time continuing to allow things to fall apart in the background.<p>If you want to fix this country, stop being such a partisan and calling everyone who disagrees with you a &quot;willing fool&quot;.')
