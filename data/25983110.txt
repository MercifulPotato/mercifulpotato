You personally have to trust the person &#x2F; people deciding which sources on a matter&#x2F;story are trustworthy. It&#x27;s a chain. That trust gets built up over a long period of time ideally, starting typically from a very modest beginning. It&#x27;s worth noting that sources are often not consistent, they can be trusted on one thing and then get another thing wrong, so it certainly won&#x27;t be a simple matter of dictating that This Source is good and That Source is bad (for everything).<p>More challenging than earning that initial trust, is maintaining it, not allowing a perversion to occur over time (where the service becomes biased, irrational). For every service that gains initial trust, most inevitably lose it over time; keeping it long-term is far harder.')
