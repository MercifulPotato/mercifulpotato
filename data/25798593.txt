They talk of a baby becoming one year old after one full Earth revolution, but do not acknowledge that baby is basically 0 years old until that time. Sure, we&#x27;d say it&#x27;s in its <i>first</i> year, but age-in-years is zero-based.<p>Part of this is using counting numbers for continuous values, part of it is philosophical, but there are a lot of mathematical properties of zero that make it really appealing (eg. being zero-based allows Python to have a very clear iterable[-1] interpretation).')
