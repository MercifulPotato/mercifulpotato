Diet is a part of it but so are hormones.<p>I&#x27;ve been overweight (90kg&#x2F;200lb at 1,8m&#x2F;6ft) since going to college and tried dieting but never managed to be lean. In my 20s I would diet and lose 20lb but then gain it again. Over time I convinced myself &quot;that wasn&#x27;t a big deal&quot;.<p>I went to an endocrinologist last month and I feel like the scales have fallen from my eyes. Suddenly all that resistance to losing weight wasn&#x27;t because I suck at dieting. It&#x27;s because my hormones and my fat keep me from losing weight. The medicine I&#x27;m taking even drove away the binge factor. Even though I&#x27;m still at the start of my weight loss journey just lifting that burden from my shoulders.')
