It&#x27;s simply a further expression of free speech.  No one has to obey it.<p>If you are ok with with giving your $100 to someone like C.K. after it&#x27;s been revealed that he pulls his penis out in front of random females, you totally can.  I would prefer to make a less funny comedian wealthy whom doesn&#x27;t whip their penis out at random.<p>I have the freedom to not participate in making certain individuals or companies wealthy, and I have the right to call for their &quot;cancellation&quot;. That&#x27;s MY free speech at work. If you want to un-cancel them, well, that&#x27;s YOUR free speech at work.')
