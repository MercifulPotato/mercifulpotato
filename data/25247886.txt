The newer α6100, α6400 and α6600 don’t run so hot, using a newer and better chip for the encoding. You’re wrong about the ability to record indefinitely: this is not specific to the α6600; all three of the newer generation get it. I’m recording 100 minute videos weekly on my α6100 with no sweat now (plugged in by USB, otherwise the battery will be down to 5–10% by this time—with the camera fixed in place for these recordings I also don’t care about image stabilisation, whether in-lens or in-body), it was only having trouble in the middle of summer when the ambient temperature was at least 45°C.')
