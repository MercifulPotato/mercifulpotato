And I’m sorry, giving non-technical people a code editor and telling them to write markdown &amp; front matter and deal with git is just hilarious.<p>It’s the typical “developer’s developer” solution. Fun for the dev to set up and write an article about how they built it on Dev.to, but with zero thought put towards the marketing functionality or flexible content production that any end user will need.<p>Developers don’t understand that their role in the process of creating a marketing site is the <i>least important one.</i> The marketing functionality (advanced SEO, newsletter sign up, form collection, landing page generation, dynamic header banners etc) and multi-author content production is all that matters. Otherwise nobody will ever be visiting the site.<p>Content is king. Not “developer pleasure is King.” Hence why Wordpress runs most of the internet.')
