Item(by='6c9be5fc6b39', descendants=None, kids=[25233459, 25233460], score=None, time=1606511720, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25232350, text='The article implies that a number of the Black people who left did so because the compliance division was relocated and they didn&#x27;t want to relocate with it. It doesn&#x27;t say how many people&#x27;s decisions were influenced by annoying work crap that they interpreted as discrimination.<p>This is a really dishonest article. It tries to lead one to believe things (e.g. that 15 Black people left Coinbase because they were belittled in meetings) without stating it outright or making a case for it. Just insinuation spun up from a few concrete situations that themselves are mostly vague or not obviously discrimination (the gun and drugs thing being the obvious exception).')
