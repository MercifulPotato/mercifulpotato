I will still have to remember to call them back (so their problem is now a task more for me to remember) and I&#x27;ll still have to consider if it isn&#x27;t important after all to ping them immediately. Because maybe last time they pulled the same stunt with a major problem and I initially got chewed up for doing minor stuff instead of asking about theirs...<p>So imho: either state the problem in a concise way and state your priority evaluation. I may adjust that evaluation based on my interpretation. Or just don&#x27;t bother me with it because it isn&#x27;t important.')
