On DDG I got an equivalent result for fifth result. Second search result on Google which is the increment operator for C++ in C++ reference was probably the best result?<p>Personally for me, when I search something like this I tend to lookup the language reference directly and find the operator I want there since it&#x27;s a very specific query with a very specific answer.
