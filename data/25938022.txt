If they&#x27;re not keeping up in skills, which is highly likely due to teaching load and other non technical time consuming tasks, some of them sadly resort to misconduct to hold on to their jobs by faking competence.<p>A more subtle form of misconduct is not with the technical results, but with fraudulent activities.<p>A close friend of mine got his professor kicked out due to fraud. Furthermore, the professor was using university research grants to cover expenses of his poorly performing startup via bogus reimbursement claims and was also using the university researchers&#x27; labor and results to be products (that unsurprisingly didn&#x27;t sell and didn&#x27;t benefit the researchers). All this while the professor is at the comfort of his home even before work-from-home was a thing (because staying at home made transportation tax deduction profitable).<p>The professor has a habit of plagiarizing his researcher&#x27;s manuscripts so he can attend miscellaneous conferences (field-trips). In some cases, dropping the researcher from the co-authors of the new plagiarized work. There is a shared excel file of massively self citing scientists shared a couple years back, and that professor is in the list.<p>As far as the world is concerned, this professor is a prolific scientist with many (last-authored) publications and prestigious talks (that should have been presented by the researchers) who happened to recently &quot;transfer&quot; to a different university and stopped publishing.')
