As soon as someone sees your appearance or hears your\nvoice they will subconsciously associate you with a gender. And\nif that association is often incorrect then what&#x27;s wrong with\navoiding awkward situations?<p>We don&#x27;t mention ethnicity or religion because they&#x27;re not\nrelevant for communication with business partners. Genders are,\ndue to how our language works.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t enforce mentioning pronouns as in the majority of\ncases it&#x27;s simply unnecessary, but if someone has a problem with\nthat detail in an email signature that tells a lot more about\nthem, enough for me to reconsider working with them. Because no,\nit&#x27;s not an important thing for me, but if someone thinks\nthemselves as too professional for such little things they&#x27;re probably\nnot a pleasant person.')
