One could practically spend all ones development time inside it, so I would say Emacs workflows are more impressive than Vi ones, especially since so much of great functionality is baked into it without even needing pluggins.<p>This I say after a couple of recent days in which the GUD gdb interface was a great help in solving a few of the problems I was working on. Does VI has something similar built in? Or for any of the common workflows like these which work out of the box, without needing plugins or extra configuration:<p>1. Remote file editing on other computers.<p>2. Rectangular&#x2F;columnar text edits and manipulations.<p>3. Essentially infinite kill ring, i.e, a very easy to use copy-paste history: This I find is very useful, one becomes acustomed to building, blocks of text by assembling things from the kill ring. Also plays nice with point 4, easy macro record&#x2F;replay.<p>4. Easy macro record&#x2F;replay of even complicated edit sequences.<p>5.Inbuilt calculator, with both rpn and algebraic modes.<p>6. The Dir-ed mode provides a very convenient file manager.')
