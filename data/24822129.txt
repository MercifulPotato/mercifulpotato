In the article&#x27;s perspective, why does a kitchen scale report a higher number when I place an object on it?<p>(In my perspective there is gravitational attraction between the object on the scale and the rest of the Earth, and the the scale, assuming it is &quot;level&quot; (set perpendicular to the direction of gravitation toward the center of the Earth) reports the magnitude of that attraction.)<p>If gravity isn&#x27;t a force, then when the object and Earth are not in freefall or moving, what does the kitchen scale measure?')
