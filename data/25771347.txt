And what does that mean for the overall datacenter, consumer markets?<p>Processor design is already a commodity, and has been for many years. Any company with the cash can buy a license to the ARM64 instruction set and the reference core design, and have someone like TSMC or Samsung manufacture it.<p>These designs haven&#x27;t taken over desktop market from x86 yet because those designs simply weren&#x27;t performance-competitive with what AMD and Intel are pumping out, and it&#x27;s not clear that that&#x27;ll change anytime in the foreseeable future.<p>Apple knocked it out of the park with the M1, but they&#x27;ve been kicking ass for years, including their competition in the ARM processor space. Just because Apple&#x27;s processors happened to use an ARM instruction set, doesn&#x27;t imply that an ARM revolution is upon us.')
