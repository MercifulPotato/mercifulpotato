We&#x27;ll do the best we can to identify promising people but a lot of people will get something somewhat functionally equivalent to a form rejection. You could argue that this is merely a prioritization decision -- we could keep hiring recruiters until <i>everyone</i> could be individually assessed -- but doing so would require a recruiting team of comparable magnitude to the rest of the Stripe organization and so the current state is an unfortunate compromise given the current constraints and given the decision to have an open application form (which is, I think, on net better for everyone).<p>(2) Cases where people at Stripe mishandled the process. I know for a fact that <i>some</i> of the anecdotes shared in the thread are from many years ago, and I know that our process has improved since then (we have empirical data to this effect), but we&#x27;re also acutely aware that we continue to make mistakes -- recruiting is a high-stakes and complex process with a lot of fallible moving parts. For whatever it&#x27;s worth, we issue CSAT surveys to <i>every</i> candidate who interviews (about 6,000 onsite interviews in 2019), and track the results both at the aggregate Stripe level and at the individual recruiter level. And I get why some people here sound so annoyed -- what might be &quot;another entry in a database&quot; to a recruiter or hiring manager is &quot;the future of my career&quot; to someone on the other side. While it&#x27;s always hard to know what to make of a set of anecdotes, and while our referral rate among Stripe employees is very high today, I&#x27;m nonetheless bothered by the number of cases shared here, and we&#x27;re going to be digging in.
