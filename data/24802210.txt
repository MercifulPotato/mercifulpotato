A big business used my software in a way that rubs me the wrong way (in this case, without giving prominent enough attribution)! Not nice!<p>What&#x27;s not nice about it? You use a permissive license but you&#x27;re going to get upset if people follow the letter of your license? This doesn&#x27;t make sense. This might make sense if there were not alternative licenses but there <i>are</i>, and the author chose not to use them. This seems like playing a mind-game. &quot;It&#x27;s permissive! Use it how you like! (but I&#x27;m going to be <i>upset</i> if you don&#x27;t follow the unwritten attribution guideline I have in my head).&quot; How is it fair to expect other parties to meet your secret expectations?<p>What did AWS do wrong here? Were they supposed to know this guy&#x27;s unwritten expectations?')
