Platform A approaches Daisy&#x27;s Cafe offering an amazing deal on a delivery partnership, as long as the Cafe agrees not to use any other delivery companies. Daisy asks around and hears great things about Platform A, so she says yes – what a win!<p>Months later, the quality of Platform A starts going way down – food is delivered to the wrong addresses, delivered cold, etc. All of the restaurants in Daisy&#x27;s area also deliver with Platform A, so the local customers don&#x27;t use other platforms – she&#x27;s stuck. If she switches, she&#x27;ll lose almost all her delivery traffic overnight.<p>Now imagine if Platform C did delivery for her without an agreement signed. Daisy isn&#x27;t breaking the agreement with Platform A when customers order through Platform C! She&#x27;ll still lose business when she stops working with Platform A, but not as much, so it&#x27;s an easier choice to make.<p>In this scenario, predatory platforms are more likely to squeeze restaurants if agreements must be signed, because exclusivity can be enforced.<p>Of course, the simple patch here is to disallow exclusive delivery platform contracts, but I don&#x27;t see that in this bill.')
