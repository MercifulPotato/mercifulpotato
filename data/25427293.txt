With that, I got in a conversation with a company that is in the business of providing senior software engineers to SMBs.<p>Particularly, SMBs located in the US, Canada and some European countries that are looking to hire software engineers.<p>It happens that\n1. I have Crunchbase Pro subscription, so I can export a list of companies that are small&#x2F;medium sized based in revenue and&#x2F;or funding information\n2. Dogfooding our own API, I am able to fetch Job Listings of these companies on Linkedin.<p>The customer wanted an updated stream of such companies every two weeks. But before he can commit to such a deal, he wanted to know what he will be getting if he paid. (Fair enough). Unfortunately, that means I had to get dirty and write some code. I decided to go above and beyond in hopes of closing a recurring deal. A deal would amount to a few hundred dollars every month.<p>With a little of coding, I managed to get these results:<p>&gt; Out of 1000 Series A&#x2F;B&#x2F;C companies based in the US that I had exported from Crunchbase Pro, I found 286 companies that were actively hiring software engineers. Not bad. A 28% hit rate of prospect companies.<p>Unfortunately, I did not close the deal. (Not sure why, he did not reply to my emails). So I decided to share the code that I wrote so if you&#x27;re doing sales and you&#x27;re tech-savvy, these might be helpful.')
