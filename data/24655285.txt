Increasing resolution is OK if not overdone. 2x, maybe; 4x, no, as Photoshop users know. Remove dust, scratches, camera sprocket drive jitter, no problem - those are all mechanical problems with the original camera.<p>Colorization is bad, though, because it&#x27;s often a total guess. The article linked to the Wuppertall monorail shows this. Look at the  monorail supports. They keep changing color. The system doing the colorizing has no baseline data for &quot;color of late 19th century monorail supports&quot;. It might match them to elevated railway supports, but there&#x27;s no official color for those. The Wuppertall monorail was a different color in the 1960s than it is now, a much darker green. Parts were brown.<p>Colorization can probably be stopped by claiming it&#x27;s racist, when it guesses wrong and makes a Black face white.')
