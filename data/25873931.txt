Item(by='gen220', descendants=None, kids=[25873956], score=None, time=1611337027, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25867693, text='We have something very similar to differential dataflow implemented at my current place of work, with our own home-brewed libraries and patterns that leverage the relatively unique way we store our data (most similar to TimeScaleDB).<p>Like map reduce, most people do not understand how it works and why it is a useful paradigm.<p>Unlike map reduce, there is not an entire sub-industry of companies offering it as a service, and engineers who have used it for years without contemplating its alternatives. In absence of this background noise, people assume DD is niche, and even &quot;wrong&quot; or harmful.<p>We have new people who come in from time to time, who have experience working at a giant MR shop, who spend the first few months wondering aloud why we don&#x27;t &quot;just use &lt;MR Framework&gt;&quot;. They usually come around (if they care to understand how this new system works) or give up (usually because they never understood the MR trade-offs in the first place, but were unwilling to part with its style of thinking&#x2F;working).<p>One thing I&#x27;ll note is our jargon around it is extremely minimal and literal. The diction employed by DD (and TimeScaleDB!) feels very formal in comparison, which can be off-putting to prospective users.<p>I&#x27;m not one to advocate for dumbing down your tone (quite the opposite). However, it&#x27;s interesting to note that the successful-yet-complicated projects (like MR, kafka) have an accretion disk around them of dumbed-down explanations on Medium, youtube and the like, that can lure in people who are curious but less-academic.<p>I don&#x27;t think you can manufacture these. It&#x27;s just a matter of time, until things like this appear for DD.')
