Of course, they are different molecules with different additional properties and metabolic products. For instance, aspirin is a blood thinner whereas naproxen isn&#x27;t. The remarks about the different interactions are absolutely true.<p>With regard to mechanism of action, one oddball is paracetamol (acetaminophen, Tylenol).<p>Wikipedia: <i>&quot;Despite its common use, the mechanism of action of paracetamol is not completely understood. Unlike NSAIDs such as aspirin, paracetamol does not appear to inhibit the function of any cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme outside the central nervous system, and this appears to be the reason why it is not useful as an anti-inflammatory.[24] It does appear to selectively inhibit COX activities in the brain, which may contribute to its ability to treat fever and pain.&quot;</i><p>What makes naproxen &quot;stronger&quot; is how it endures in the body.')
