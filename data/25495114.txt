Don&#x27;t waste your time on homework problems.<p>I disagree. Not everything is about business and money. Many people already build &quot;real shit&quot; for a living and want to simply have fun building other things, and focus on the cool parts, and not all the boring parts involved in a commercial project.<p>Also CS is constantly evolving. Nobody knows the &quot;fundamentals&quot; once for all. A ray tracer is still a ray tracer, but languages and technologies have changed immensely in just a few years. Git didn&#x27;t exist 15 years ago. A langage like Rust is 10 years old. React is 7 years old. We need these homework problems simply to keep up to date.')
