That he is the head of ethics compliance at Apple makes it even more galling, especially given that the company forces everyone through this kind of training when really only management &amp; leadership violations of these ethics trainings can possibly get the company into serious trouble.<p>&gt; He has overall responsibility for Apple’s ethics and compliance program including Apple’s Business Conduct Policy, governing the ethical and legal obligations of Apple’s Board, executives and over 130,000 employees around the world,<p>A delivery of 200 iPads as a bribe to get CCW permits makes me think it&#x27;s more involved. Although this may be with his discretionary power, it&#x27;s shocking to me that the donation was aborted as soon as warrants went out. I&#x27;d like to better understand what happened at Apple.<p>Beyond the problem of &quot;may issue&quot; permits you raise, I&#x27;d love to remove this kind of discretion for discovery. For example, when bringing charges like this the DA must be obligated to initiate discovery of the company documents to investigate how far reaching the problem may be (settlements can&#x27;t begin to be negotiated until the DA completes discovery).')
