Compared to the data plan that can access the whole internet it is very very cheap to use just WhatsApp.<p>The cheapest WhatsApp bundle on the most popular network (Econet) is currently at around 51cents to text the whole week (65MB of data) vs the $13 for 8gigs. Granted the 8gigs is for a month but $13 is a big amount in this part of the world, and with regular data there&#x27;s the aspect of discipline to not use all that data on youtube and other data hungry apps&#x2F;websites.')
