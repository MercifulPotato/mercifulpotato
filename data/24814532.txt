I only have a couple on my short list: == vs === and xs.includes(x) vs x in xs, and only the latter is not reducible to a trivial rule of thumb. TS is helpful in this regard, possibly there are more in plain JS.<p>Regarding performance, modern JS is plenty fast, but it&#x27;s not in the &#x27;terrible&#x27; category. It&#x27;s memory usage, perhaps ;) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net&#x2F;benchmarksgame&#x2F;fastest&#x2F;node-gpp.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net&#x2F;benchmarksgame&#x2F;...</a>. For performance critical code JS is not the answer, but good enough for most uses, including UIs.<p>Regarding UI paradigms, I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is, or what significantly better alternatives are.
