Anyone can become a package maintainer. They then do a package update, but nobody is verifying that they did it correctly. Anyone can sneak a backdoor into a new release of a package. And any hacker can backdoor the source code before it gets packaged. This has happened many times.<p>Also, the distro often <i>does not</i> keep it up to date. Debian has probably been the worst offender here. Its software is often so ridiculously out of date that you have to use some crappy bleeding-edge release to get a recent version of some software. Or users end up piping an http get into a bash shell as root, which is a <i>super</i> idea.<p>Finally: dep management? Really? The one thing everyone on Linux bitches about and is always creating some new hokey package manager to solve?<p>&gt; there definitely are problems with current implementations of app stores in phones, but the idea in general has been a huge boon for security and maintainability.<p><i>&quot;This week Google removed 17 Android applications from the official Play Store.
