Most people&#x2F;entities are when they&#x27;re spending other people&#x27;s money.  This would result in the same issues as all government spending does - the powerful Reps and Senators will funnel money to open source projects in their districts and to their donors.  We&#x27;ll see a lot of open source projects in Kentucky get funded because of McConnell.  Liberal &amp; Democrat based projects will see little funding as Republicans block their funding.  It would be a mess.')
