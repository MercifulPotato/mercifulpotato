Item(by='indigochill', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605711846, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25136494, text='&gt; what&#x27;s the difference with phones&#x2F;tablets?<p>The difference I see is more about Apple specifically, because unlike, say, Google with Android, they have full vertical integration. They make both the hardware and the OS. Everything about Apple is focused on complete corporate control over the experience.<p>If Apple decided to only permit apps distributed through App Store X on OS X, I wouldn&#x27;t be at all surprised. That&#x27;s Apple&#x27;s MO. And there is a customer segment I think that serves, which is the consumer market which doesn&#x27;t want to think about maintaining their own digital security, because Apple seems like a reasonably benevolent dictator in this respect, as much as developers dislike the cut they take. Requiring Apple to open their devices to third-party app stores would break this vice grip they have on the experience and, IMO, degrade the experience for Apple&#x27;s end users (even if it might make things nicer for developers).')
