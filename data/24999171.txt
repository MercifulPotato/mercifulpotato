Everybody can throw together hello world and some buttons in any toolkit, but reaching any meaningful level of productivity requires a lot of experience in the toolkit.<p>Something designed from the beginning for multiplatform will very likely end up not productive overall of you have a 50:50 distribution, but if you have a clear first class platform for product &#x2F; second class platform for the occasional supporting tool situation, then something designed specifically for the first class platform that also has some capability for the second class platform can easily be superior.')
