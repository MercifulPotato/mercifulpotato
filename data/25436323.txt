European vehicles were easily registered using standard European &quot;Whole Vehicle Type Approvals&quot;. Each new European car came with a type approval number linked to it&#x27;s info, no problem.<p>American cars were a nightmare. Every new vehicle type came with it&#x27;s own adventure of Googling or otherwise gathering information about the vehicle (number of doors, engine size etc...). Just no standards whatsoever. Horrible.')
