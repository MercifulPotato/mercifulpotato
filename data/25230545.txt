A warp drive that is not superluminal is still interesting for other reasons (all reactionless drives are kind of interesting).  Also importantly the paper suggests specific mathematical properties of the geometry; namely that they should be flatter in the direction of motion.  That is not at all intuitive to me, and certainly not the aesthetics of space ship design in most sci-fi.')
