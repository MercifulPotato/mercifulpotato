The duopoly of parties that have captured the US political system are corporate servants that have allowed the public to descend into worse and worse conditions since the 70s.  The reason Trump was successful was because he (falsely) claimed he would address this grift and corruption.  Instead of addressing it, the establishment has tried to tamp down any dissent and promote censorship.  Without relief and a release valve, the pressure in tank will certainly will get even higher and eventually explode, with a more competent and scary Trump 2.0 when the democratic establishment fails to deliver even through they now control everything.<p>Censorship is not necessary in a fair society.')
