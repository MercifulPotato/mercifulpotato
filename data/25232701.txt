If the same user is harrasing you, and you block it then problem solved. If it&#x27;s a more sophisticated harrasment where users change, then reporting one of them won&#x27;t do anything better than blocking.\nThey can block the device.<p>&gt; If it&#x27;s someone spamming random numbers, a simple algorithm can raise a flag without any report necessary.<p>Yet every single major company uses reports as part of their algorithm.<p>&gt; The child porn scenario just seems so bizarre, why would someone send you child porn? And I&#x27;m pretty sure the police will get involved in that case.<p>That they would but lots of people would much prefer it if the sicko was quickly stop from spreading it further. And there are groups on nearly every chat system that allows private chat groups where they&#x27;ll send illegal porn etc. It is easy enough to send a message to the wrong person, I am sure you&#x27;ve done it just like I have only with no consquences other embarrassment and saying wrong person.')
