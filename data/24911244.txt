These read-only monitoring systems can be connected to networks (presumably reachable to hackers through some means). As long as the safety control systems cannot be modified by any means, these types of failures should not happen.<p>Also, irrespective of software safety, for a system like this grid power generator why can&#x27;t they design physical safety relays&#x2F;cutoffs? If the generator sped up beyond it&#x27;s tolerances, it could cut-off. Why should it generate shocky torque that can damage the rubber grommets? That could be prevented by design?')
