Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610426137, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25737963, text='&gt; What’s most perplexing about Roe in particular is that it’s out of step with public opinion (broader than what the public wants) and also has no basis in the constitutional text.<p>This is false, <i>Roe</i> doesn&#x27;t have “no basis in the Constitutional text”. It is true that the derivation of the understanding of rights articulated in <i>Roe</i> from the text is indirect, but that does not make it absent; it is a judicial understanding built on prior judicial understandings each of which directly or via even more intermediary judicial understandings derive from the text.<p>&gt; What’s the source of the court’s authority in that context?<p>“The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority”')
