In most jurisdictions that&#x27;s not a protected class. Nightclubs are well-known for having dress codes with vague guidelines such as &quot;no gang colors&quot;. Some fancy restaurants require men to wear jackets or women to wear dresses (this seems politically fraught to me). Some bars don&#x27;t let you in if you&#x27;re wearing shorts. And so on.<p>Generally a protected class is an unchangeable attribute.')
