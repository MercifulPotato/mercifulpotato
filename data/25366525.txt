I&#x27;d say - depending on where you want to live in the city can influence your results.  Ultimately it&#x27;s what you&#x27;re after.  I think, today, you can live there very reasonably.  We have better than average access to health care, but taxes are also an impediment in Hennepin county (Minneapolis metro).  The metro is very conveniently laid out - so if you&#x27;re looking to move there you should broaden your search as commuting isn&#x27;t horrible, public transport is decent and there&#x27;s a lot of option for reasonably priced rentals - but definitely not &quot;cheap&quot; compared to other metro areas.  The area does have a lot to offer, however.')
