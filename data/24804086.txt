It is also more reliably achievable. A rationalist thrives in the absence of uncertainty. Becoming a decent engineer is a far more reliable way to be successful than starting the next billion dollar company. That is practically leaving everything up to luck.<p>The truth is, we only see two kinds of successful people in media. The lucky, the pig-headed visionary and those who fall in line. Rationalists are by ideology averse to luck, stubbornness and compliance. Go figure, why they do not feature in cohorts so opposed to their core ideology.<p>Now militant rationalists are rarely rationalists. If anything, acknowledging the virtue of gut feeling&#x2F;intuition in presence of uncertainty and the the prevalence of uncertainty in everything we do, are the 2 most evident facts of our universe. To make a strong claim of correctness in the presence of massive uncertainty, is innately irrational.<p>That being said, a lot of the most successful people I&#x27;ve met, use various tools of rationalism quite frequently.')
