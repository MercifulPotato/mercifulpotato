It&#x27;s looking to compete with <i>redis</i>, whose base features are relatively simple, with majority of people probably using it as a simple cache.<p>Yeah maybe don&#x27;t deploy it to your highest priority intensely complex production service that was using all of redis&#x27;s advanced features immediately, but not trying it at all just because it hasn&#x27;t been audited is ludicrous.')
