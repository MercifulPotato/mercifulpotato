Use more oil and a lot more salt than you would normally use for pan frying. Make sure to move them around, don&#x27;t be afraid to scrub them around, they will feel gritty due to all the salt. Fry the peels until they&#x27;re very dark, they should be far too dark and salty to be edible.<p>Wash out the pan with hot water and dry it. Done.<p>It doesn&#x27;t have to be any more complicated than that. It&#x27;s the method used in professional kitchens, as far as I know.')
