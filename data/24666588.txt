That&#x27;s where what GP wrote comes into play, though in the opposite role than they meant. There are at least three reasons you need to pace yourself at work:<p>One, peak capacity work is unsustainable over long term; there&#x27;s no point in burning yourself out in the span of few months, because then you won&#x27;t be doing anything at all.<p>Two, if your managers try to set up the workload at the level of your observed performance (or worse, try to squeeze more work by assigning a bit more things to do than were done the last time), then if you start going on afterburners, you&#x27;ll set up an unrealistic baseline that you&#x27;ll be later held accountable to. That&#x27;s where cutting corners will start.<p>Three, systems with no slack are fragile. If everyone is constantly crunching and a genuine emergency pops up, nobody will be able to deal with it. There&#x27;s probably some general principle in systems science that systems under full load are not optimal once you start doing risk analysis.<p>Good managers understand that, and will actively prevent you from getting yourself overworked - as developers are sometimes prone to do.')
