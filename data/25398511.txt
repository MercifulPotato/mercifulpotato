As I looked at the patents, most were filed in the late &#x27;90s (don&#x27;t ask me how the grant were delayed by ~5 years, I also don&#x27;t know this). The main question is that the techniques discussed in the patents were prior art before 1999? Because chanting &quot;open source&quot; is not really helpful here unless there are code that exists then that matches the patents.')
