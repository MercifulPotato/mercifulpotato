Item(by='NovemberWhiskey', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605791838, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25146991, text='&gt;<i>The purchasing power is the property of the money received, it is exactly the same in all cases.</i><p>That&#x27;s nonsensical. You can trivially find examples of where the same goods cost different prices in different locations.<p>Here&#x27;s a really simple example. $5.79 will buy you a McDonald&#x27;s Sausage Egg McMuffin meal in Montgomery AL. The same menu item is $6.71 in Los Angeles CA.<p>The same money has less power to buy goods and services in Los Angeles than it does in Montgomery. You know this intuitively; the same way you know that a gallon of milk is more expensive in New York City than it is in Madison.<p>I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;re tying yourself up in knots to come to the opposite conclusion.')
