I tried experimenting with Matrix today, I could make it to join #freenode_#xmonad:matrix.org but any message I sent didn&#x27;t go through to the IRC side. When I then joined #irc:matrix.org it seems several other people were reporting this not working lately.<p>To make this experience even less amusing, I then tried to join #xmonad:matrix.org, assuming it&#x27;s the matrix equivalent of #xmonad on freenode, but it just said I&#x27;m not invited and that was it.<p>Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m impressed. :-(')
