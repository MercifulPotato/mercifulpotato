Unless you win a lawsuit, &quot;haven&#x27;t won any of their lawsuits&quot; is 100% true. And the media <i>did</i> report on sme of the lawsuits being thrown out, but I&#x27;m sure they would have found something wrong with reporting that too. Or should the courts just suddenly start entertaining invalid lawsuits just so Trump lawyers don&#x27;t look as incompetent? (And from reading up a bit, multiple courts have judged on merit and found that the claimants didn&#x27;t provide compelling evidence for their claims)')
