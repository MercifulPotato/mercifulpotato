They will not.<p>Just like a small business is less regulated than a large one (often), or how smaller incomes are taxed simply while those with more money&#x2F;more complex assets get audited more - the ultra-wealthy will certainly have more of their assets audited, and yes, they will have side channels to evade taxes. That doesn&#x27;t mean we don&#x27;t try to tax them.<p>When someone out in the open owns 75 cars, a private jet, and a $250,000,000 townhouse in Manhattan and another $5 billion in stock, it&#x27;s pretty damned simple and not wholly intrusive to look at that and say &quot;alright...&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not defending the entire concept of a wealth tax, but I am saying it isn&#x27;t as dire for _everybody_ that you say it is.')
