This is of course not to say that mistakes haven&#x27;t <i>ever</i> been made in enforcement, or that some COCs are poorly designed.<p>People under-appreciate the difficulty of building a community that people <i>want</i> to participate in. The problem is a close analogue to maintaining a desired company culture as it scales.<p>The reason all these communities have &quot;woke&quot; guidelines for behavior is because the ones that didn&#x27;t have reasonable guidelines no longer exist, or have remained at a size where a COC isn&#x27;t necessary.<p>Again, there&#x27;s a fine line to be walked, so mistakes will sometimes be made, but if you think the &quot;free for all&quot; approach works, then you should try it. It won&#x27;t scale once your community gets past a certain size. A few bad apples will spoil the barrel.')
