Item(by='newacct583', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612068319, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25974527, text='&gt; The market is rich with GME stock buyers who donâ€™t care to listen to any of these traditional buy&#x2F;sell signals.<p>It is this week.  But let&#x27;s be honest: (1) wallstreetbets isn&#x27;t a very large community compared with the whole market, or even the capitalization of GME or AMC and (2) these are investors engaged in a fun revolution.<p>This won&#x27;t stay fun for months.  These folks want to trade in those portfolios.  And if this doesn&#x27;t go up any farther (it&#x27;s been flat at ~$300 since Thursday), how many of those will get bored and sell so they can trade whatever the next meme stock is?  Not that many, sure.  But enough to push the value down lower, to a threshold where more Robinhood traders decide to get out.  And we have exactly the kind of feedback loop described in the linked article.<p>GME is going to fall because there&#x27;s no reason for GME to stay high.  Once the short squeeze is over and the lols play out, it&#x27;s just another failing company.<p>(And I continue to believe that this is going to turn out to be a big astroturfed scam when this is all said and done and I&#x27;m betting a bunch of the early players will turn out to have been executing a pump and dump.)')
