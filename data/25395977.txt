What I can say for certain is that there was a t-minus one, the day before the results were unblinded, and there was a t-zero, the day results were unblinded. On that day t-zero they uncovered which of the patient IDs got the vaccine versus which got placebo.<p>No expense should have been spared in preloading the analysis, verification, whatever could have been done, it should have been done up until t-minus-1.
