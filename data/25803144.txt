At least it necessitates adding a layer of obfuscation to the layperson&#x27;s definition of &quot;prime&quot; that doesn&#x27;t add any useful mathematical insight.<p>On the other hand if you&#x27;re programming a function isPrime() for some practical purpose, then whether you include negative numbers will be dependent on that purpose. Whether you include <i>floating point</i> numbers will be between you and your conscience. ;-)')
