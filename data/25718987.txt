All you need to do is cite all of the material that was used for its initial approval before they knew about the problems.<p>Another example to help illustrate. The Boeing 737 MAX had a well-cited full article before the MCAS issues were known.

It makes for such boring reading. All you’re stating is that you have confirmation bias and don’t like seeing ideas you disagree with.
