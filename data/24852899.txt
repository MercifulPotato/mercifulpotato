Originally between three computers (Debian desktop, Debian laptop, and Microsoft laptop) where it was part of my git repo that I&#x27;d sync in between the machines as needed (git repo hosted within my own instance of gitolite, btw).<p>I&#x27;ve migrated more functionality into Syncthing - so now it&#x27;s very rare that I ever need to do a manual merge within KeePassXC (which was always a robust operation anyway).   KeePassXC has a setting to reload from disk if it sees that the password db file has changed, which makes this process seamless.<p>Part of my Syncthing setup is that I have a receive-only copy of my various repos on a Debian VM that runs a couple of archive tools (dirvish and borg) which provides for point-in-time restorations if needed.<p>So - I&#x27;m wondering what synchronisation problems you&#x27;ve had, and what you&#x27;ve tried.  And what alternatives there are to trusting someone else&#x27;s OS (replete with non-free components) on mobile, along with someone else&#x27;s bundling of code into mobile packages?<p>There&#x27;s a handful of keepass-compatible android apps, some of which are GPL, and Syncthing can keep a copy on Android easily enough, but ultimately there&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of trust in mobile land no matter how you slice it.')
