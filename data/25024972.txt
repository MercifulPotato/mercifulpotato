I guess that&#x27;s just stating your point a different way. TCP doesn&#x27;t know whether it goes over a wire or a radio link, it doesn&#x27;t care. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that no error correcting is happening, just that the error correction is handled outside of TCP.<p>&gt; A basic assumption of TCP is that retransmission only happens due to congestion.<p>From the perspective of a single computer, what&#x27;s the difference between an error caused by congestion and an error caused by a noisy channel? Can you tell the difference? Isn&#x27;t a transmission error just a transmission error?')
