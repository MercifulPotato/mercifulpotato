School&#x27;s First FCU, BECU, etc. They have all been great and I highly recommend them. I charge something to a card outside of the state but have recently bought a plane ticket to that area, it&#x27;s fine. If I don&#x27;t buy a ticket and my card is charged in some out of state area or 2 charges are made within a few hours across 100 miles in distance, instant lock on my card and a phone call.<p>This stuff is just wonderful. No monthly fees. Can use a debit anywhere Mastercard is valid, even overseas.<p>&gt; The problem is most credit unions suck.<p>This has not been my experience. Chase is miserable, but if you need a business account, credit unions can&#x27;t help you there.')
