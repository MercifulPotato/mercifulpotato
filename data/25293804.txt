This just won&#x27;t happen. Also, market dictates that even if it happened, nothing good would come out of it, and that&#x27;s nothing to do with Colombia, just pure market behaviour: druglords will still be buying the product, it&#x27;s just there would be a drive to produce more to cope with this higher demand.<p>Also Colombia won&#x27;t become a first world country any time soon, the infrastructure is lacking and the country has three different mountain ranges. Furthermore, and I say it as a Spanish national, their culture comes from the latin&#x2F;Spanish culture and that has a lot of anti-capitalist cultural implications that will nevertheless drag any possible economic growth.')
