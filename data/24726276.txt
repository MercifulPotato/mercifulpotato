Many of my successful items are surprises, much of what I&#x27;d like to see take hold doesn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ll submit certain ‘beats‘ of interest regularly (different items), hopefully without becoming too polemical.  I also scan &#x27;new&#x27; upvoting items of interest frequently.  I&#x27;ll nominate items from others for the 2nd chance queue (email the mods).<p>The Assange story is complex, has always been inherently political, and those politics have dhifted, as has awareness of interactions and consequences.

Myself among them.<p>But items concerning him and his case(s) can still be submitted.')
