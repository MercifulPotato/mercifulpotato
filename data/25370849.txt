I wrote in to CX at about the 90 minute mark and they told me that maybe the restaurant wasn’t finished and that they had a person on the way to pick it up (counter to what the app said). Around the two hour mark, I wrote in again and they said the same. I asked if they had a <i>specific</i> person currently on the way and was told yes. We eventually called the restaurant who confirmed that they had had our food ready for hours, at which point doordash said “oh actually, we don’t know when we’ll be able to get it to you, we’ll give you doordash credits in refund.”<p>When we drove ourselves to the restaurant to pick it up, hours after ordering, they said doordash had kept submitting orders but hadn’t actually sent any doordash drivers in a week or two.<p>Everyone seems to have a doordash is terrible story.<p>I can’t believe the valuation I’m seeing.')
