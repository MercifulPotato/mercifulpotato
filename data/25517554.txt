Youtube actively guides me away from educational content.<p>Back when I was not particularly into YouTube and hadn&#x27;t had many great recommendations YouTube insisted I should watch Sapolsky&#x27;s Harvard lectures - these probably had particularly good metrics. Once I started to watch them (and was very satisfied) more and more great recommendations started to appear.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s quality stuff, but you gotta find it yourself.<p>People should start sharing curated lists of high-quality no-bullish YouTube videos&#x2F;channels. Kind of like those awesome-everything on GitHub.')
