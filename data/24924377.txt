Hopefully that helps you adjust some of what you hear to be a bit more grounded.</i><p>In Rust&#x27;s case, it&#x27;s usually very easy to separate the amateur reviews from production users. The latter will follow up the praise with the same set of &quot;devils in the details&quot; shortcomings like the compile times, community maturity and rapidly developing best practices like the error handling story, compile times, steep learning curve when bringing team members onto the project, growing complexity of the language, and compile times.<p>I&#x27;m working on a Rust realtime (streaming updates, not embedded) service thats going into production soon and it&#x27;s a breath of fresh air after decades of C&#x2F;Python&#x2F;JS but man, bringing up junior devs is harder and those compile times don&#x27;t help (especially with async&#x2F;await).')
