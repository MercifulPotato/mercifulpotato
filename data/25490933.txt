Overall it was poorly executed, but the espionage and intrigue aspect of it was amazing. It really felt you were dropped into the middle of a cold war era conspiracy. I was fascinated by it and loved it despite the poor gameplay.<p>Have you ever heard of or played Covert Action [2]? Not one of Sid Meier&#x27;s best, but I enjoyed it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Floor_13_(video_game)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Floor_13_(video_game)</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sid_Meier%27s_Covert_Action" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sid_Meier%27s_Covert_Action</a>')
