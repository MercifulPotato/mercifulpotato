These researchers may have even talked about hardware backdoors in the abstract (a known potential problem, but whether or not it was actually happening... well... hard to tell from the article).<p>They then went to a 2nd researcher to talk about &quot;small chips&quot;, which is ambiguous. Some researcher was like... well... those 0402 ceramic capacitors are called &quot;chips&quot; (which they are: they&#x27;re &quot;ceramic chip capacitors&quot;).<p>The authors then got confused, and wrote about how 0402 capacitors were security flaws. Or something. I don&#x27;t know, but that&#x27;s how an article like that comes to be written in my head.<p>And now that the authors of the article are talking about stupid chip capacitors that can apparently take over the computer, they&#x27;re completely off track and there&#x27;s no reason to read the article with any level of seriousness.<p>-----------<p>&gt;  So are you implying that senior execs at tech companies were lying?<p>All I mean to imply, is that its bloody obvious that an 0402 chip capacitor can&#x27;t hack your computer. That Bloomberg&#x27;s authors couldn&#x27;t understand this fact before publishing greatly diminishes the reputation of the article in question.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.bwbx.io&#x2F;images&#x2F;users&#x2F;iqjWHBFdfxIU&#x2F;i9VdsjZLS_Pk&#x2F;v1&#x2F;600x-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.bwbx.io&#x2F;images&#x2F;users&#x2F;iqjWHBFdfxIU&#x2F;i9VdsjZLS_P...</a><p>That&#x27;s a 6-pin chip capacitor, is it not? Please, explain to me how a passive noise-dampening component can hack a computer.')
