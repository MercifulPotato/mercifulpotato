The M1 seems to be an excellent processor with good performance. It&#x27;s not worlds better than a Ryzen 5 5600X or its mobile variant.<p>&gt; <i>I decided I don&#x27;t need more RAM than 8 GB, because nobody from the first reviewers managed to give the RAM a hard time. It seemed to me it&#x27;s a different beast altogether and it doesn&#x27;t make sense to just compare numbers and say that more is better.</i><p>The processor is not a magical thing that changes how much memory is needed for workloads. When the first reviewers did not look at your workload it&#x27;s meaningless that they did not complain.<p>Your memory requirements completely depend on your workload. It&#x27;s quite possible you do not use more than 8GB, but I had IDEs and GIMP use more than that. And it&#x27;s of course (it&#x27;s Apple) not upgradeable, 8GB will not be enough if your usage changes, and then that laptop will just be expensive garbage for you.')
