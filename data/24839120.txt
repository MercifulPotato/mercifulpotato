Basically, what you would use imagemagick for. I just haven&#x27;t discovered yet scenarios where imagemagick does something better than ffmpeg (my use-cases are pretty simple, though). And since I also work with videos, I feel like I have to learn just one command-line monster instead of two.<p>I&#x27;d be interested in use-cases where imagemagick should be strongly preferred over ffmpeg.')
