I don’t think I have a stronger back from using this chair alone, although I guess I do have a less damaged and atrophied one. I do remember a time when it felt like certain muscles were getting stronger. I vaguely remember it taking a few months to become comfortable.<p>It’s worth mentioning that I do a fair bit of weight training too and that I’ve had the chair for about 8 years.')
