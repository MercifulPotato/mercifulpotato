Now we’re scaling it quickly to support distance learning for kids affected by school closures. Our business is growing explosively and as of August, 500,000 learners have taken more than 2M class hours. We just announced our $45M Series B funding round, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners. Our sales have grown 2000% in the past year to reach a run-rate of more than $100M. We&#x27;re also making $1M of live online classes available for free to families in need and adding thousands of new teachers in weeks.\nWe need senior software engineers to build up a complex product for a highly engaged audience. We are also looking for infrastructure engineers to help our systems scale effectively. We have a pragmatic culture that promotes focused collaboration and iterative development.\nStack: TypeScript, React, Node&#x2F;Express, Apollo GraphQL, PostgreSQL, AWS CDK, CloudFormation, AWS Batch, AWS Fargate, SQS.')
