Only took 5 years between the introduction of type declarations and consistent support for type declarations...], and dictionary keys being automatically cast from string to int if they look vaguely numeric. It’s a shame Hack never took off in the open source world, as it’s basically “What if we could reimagine PHP without the legacy baggage?”)')
