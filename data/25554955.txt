And some of the rules are just pointlessly argumentative. Such as refusing to use &lt;cstdio&gt; and instead using &lt;stdio.h&gt; - those are officially documented to be different things with different behaviors. Blanket banning one of them doesn&#x27;t improve simplicity, especially if you&#x27;re blanket banning the &quot;wrong&quot; set of headers. Unless the goal is to also ban namespaces, but that&#x27;s not called out as such (and namespaces are one of the least contentions C++ features - everyone seems to like them well enough).<p>Or similarly:<p>&gt; Don&#x27;t use anything from STL that allocates memory, unless you don&#x27;t care about memory management.<p>So don&#x27;t use std::vector? Or std::unordered_map? Or std::string? These are all perfectly fine classes, banning them makes no sense at all. Maybe the goal was to ban &quot;hidden cost&quot; classes like std::function, but rolling your own &#x27;C-style&#x27; is a <i>hell</i> of a lot more complex &amp; error prone (raise your hand if you&#x27;ve seen a C pointer callback that forgot to have a void* context or a mismanagement of said void* context...)')
