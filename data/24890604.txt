I moved to SF relatively late in my career, and only realized afterwards that I have nowhere near enough savings to own a nice home here.<p>But most of my coworkers seem eager to return to the office. They miss the office environment, the perks and catered meals, and the socialization. And the managers, who subsist on meetings and in-person interaction, seem even more anxious to get everyone back to their desks. The powers-that-be probably have personal motivations for keeping everyone here as well (e.g., many millions of dollars tied up in their homes, which could lose significant value if the housing market deflates).<p>All this is to say, I&#x27;m skeptical that workers won&#x27;t be called back into the office as soon as leadership gets the chance.')
