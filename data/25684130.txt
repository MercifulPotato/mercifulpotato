I am confident that if you took each claim and systematically argued it out in public you would have seen that number go down drastically to an insignificant one.<p>I think GOP lawmakers had the right idea to hold some kind of public audit of it. Giuliani had a lot of incorrect &#x2F; blatantly false facts and so he was dismissed out of hand, but many of his witnesses came across as credible and describe things very differently from your explanations.<p>Logistically I don&#x27;t think anyone wanted to back the election fraud argument for political reasons but there is still very much a need for it because plenty of people feel like it was stolen.<p>As for the President - whether he&#x27;s making it up or whether he&#x27;s among those who believe it was stolen, nobody reads minds so you cant know one way or another unless you add your own personal bias into it.<p>Now you can be very angry about the fraud claims because they are baseless etc and be emotional about it or be a problem solver and recognize that those people are fellow citizens and there is no divorce option. Railing against Trump 24x7 actually makes the problem worse because nobody is going to be persuaded. You can also call me also irresponsible for bringing their concerns up, but what you can&#x27;t really do without being dishonest is to deny that there are millions who believe this stuff, out of whom a few dozen got mad enough about it want to break in to the Capitol, and succeeded.<p>The fact remains that the media does a tremendous disservice to the public by not casting a wide tent, and the President capitalised on this because frankly what other option is there if you want to win? The American media hoaxed the public into thinking he called Nazis very fine people when he instead said they should be condemned totally, and was said in the context of the broader debate about statues of controversial historical figures.<p>Now you can again cheerlead for the media and say they are the finest journalists on the planet, but the fact is that more than half the country doesn&#x27;t believe them. You can dismiss them all as brainwashed or stupid or whatever you like but they&#x27;re going to be around for a very long time.')
