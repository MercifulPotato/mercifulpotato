As someone who has thousands of tabs open, I&#x27;ve always wanted to &quot;close all tabs with a single command&quot;, or view all the open tabs and mass select them and close, for years. Otherwise, going through them one by one and deleting takes forever. Now somebody make a vim pluggin so I can delete tabs by visual selecting a bunch of them and typing &quot;d&quot;.')
