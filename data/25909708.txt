Before adolescence, I would spent most of my time outdoors. Very stable weather so windows were open most of the day (and night). There was often direct sunlight even indoors. We would go to the beach every weekend. \nI ended up with -5.00 and -5.25<p>Maybe this would decrease the prevalence, if you are looking at the entire population.
