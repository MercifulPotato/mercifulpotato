Item(by='ryandrake', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605646133, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25128281, text='&gt; I think we can all agree (and I don&#x27;t have to prove) that if nobody would ever meet anyone outside their home there would be 0 infections. So that would be the ideal. We could have states just mandate very strict shelter in place. Would you like that?<p>Absolutely. If we were really serious about beating the virus, that&#x27;s exactly what we would do: Real and strictly enforced stay-at home, and mask wearing for exceptional cases when you had to go out. Coordinated nationally so we didn&#x27;t have this healthy state - sick state problem. Then stick with it until it succeeded. It would be temporarily economically painful, and people would complain about their freedom to get their nails done and eat at Olive Garden, but we&#x27;d get the public health benefit and come out the other side not-dead.<p>Instead, we managed to do an even worse thing: Announce half-assed &quot;business closures&quot; and stay-at-home orders (more like suggestions), uncoordinated with other states, and unenforced, which gave us the negative economic effects <i>and</i> did not provide the health benefit. To top it off, we opened up way too early, causing this yo-yo effect where cases predictably spike after re-opening, causing re-closing, then a rush to re-open because economy, then another spike, then an inevitable re-close, and on and on.<p>Unless the vaccines pan out, we&#x27;re going to be in this exact situation a year from now. Constantly re-opening, faking surprise at the cases spiking, and then re-closing.')
