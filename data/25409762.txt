Was any one curious about your plans?<p>In my future perfect alternate reality:<p>Google Ventures, GoogleX, or even just thwarted &amp; bored midlevel manager aspiring to become an angel investor, would offer seed capital to any one turning in their badge.<p>&quot;Hey @jasongrishkoff, if you ever need some cash for an idea, please talk to me first.&quot;<p>In my mind, that parting offer is central to Silicon Valley&#x27;s magic.
