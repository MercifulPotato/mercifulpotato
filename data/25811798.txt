Item(by='rcarmo', descendants=None, kids=[25812437], score=None, time=1610899566, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25810427, text='I&#x27;ve tried all of them, and still prefer vim because it&#x27;s the least hassle to install&#x2F;configure anywhere - my dotfile setup installs my plugins automatically, and I&#x27;m set.<p>However, I do use VSCode extensively as well, largely because of the language servers. But sometimes it takes so long to start up (and nags me to do so many updates to itself and extensions) that I just toss the window aside and use a native Mac editor (like Textastic) to work while it finishes.<p>Sometimes I don&#x27;t go back -- it&#x27;s all a matter of taste, really.')
