It&#x27;s not really a flesh color; breaking out the Digital Color Meter, it&#x27;s slightly warmer than a grey.<p>Then there&#x27;s the way light reflects off of it, some of it looking rough or dirty in a way skin usually doesn&#x27;t, with some parts brightly lit as if by one very bright source.  (I think glare explains some of it.)  The breasts themselves often look brighter, and sometimes <i>cleaner</i>, than everything else; occasionally they <i>do</i> match the surrounding skin, which naively looks a lot better until I realize I have to abstract out the lighting.<p>Even if you can&#x27;t vary the skin tones, I think that using more uniform lighting would help.  And maybe something dumb like spraypainting the main body a mono-color would work, although that might make it more complex to show scars.')
