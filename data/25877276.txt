That would be like saying Red Hat is exploitative.<p>Part of the whole concept of free software is that you have freedom of choice with vendors (this is derived from &quot;freedom 0&quot;).  Amazon is providing the software and its support as part of the Elasticsearch offering as a managed service.  Elastic is a competing vendor, both as a managed service and in a traditional sense too.<p>Elastic made this decision because they wanted to be the exclusive vendor for Elasticsearch.  That&#x27;s fine, but it&#x27;s not in the spirit of free software.<p>If anything, Elastic has exploited the third-party contributors who contributed to Elasticsearch under a CLA by promising to not do what they did and then blaming AWS for doing it anyway.')
