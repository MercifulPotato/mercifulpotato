E.g. look at the settings icon which is basically screams  &quot;lets change the settings icons just enough to not be a copyright infringement&quot;. That icon is trademarked by Apple and the JingOs variant has still\nquite many of the points which define the Apple trademark, enough to open potential for a case. (They have 3 connection from the gear ring to the center at the exact same position, a &quot;dot&quot; at the center, a inner ring (but just one color instead of an gear) and  the gear background color doesn&#x27;t stretch to the sides of the icon (I have no idea why they didn&#x27;t change that, it would be more different <i>and</i> look better), they also replaced light silver with white. Anyway I would guess a trademark case for this detail has a good chance, especially given that this icon looks different enough to the other icons to not fit in, making it super clear that they somewhat forcefully wanted to make it look as much like Apple as possible. Instead of just using similar visual clues).')
