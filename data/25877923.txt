But in enterprise apps I can see all you needing is an API client with normalized caching (Apollo or `react-query` for REST), and store as much of your page state in your query string, and the rest in React Context. I would reach for Recoil if React Context performance became an issue.<p>But rolling your own comes with so much personal risk if things go wrong - not good for politics.')
