Another example is that despite being O(log n), B-trees or skip lists can be much faster than hash tables if your keys are naturally ordered (and queried in order) because of memory caching.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s perfectly possible (and quite common) to describe expected complexity (which is a mathematical function of the input size, too) with O notation.<p>Yep - its common in practice but sloppy. Technically its not big-O anymore if you&#x27;re doing that. Its big-theta notation. (Same thing, just T(n) instead of O(n)).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Big_O_notation#Use_in_computer_science" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Big_O_notation#Use_in_computer...</a>')
