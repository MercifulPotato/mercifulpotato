Nothing in the dashboard. Also I think <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;unifi&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;unifi&#x2F;</a> is crap from a security standpoint. Their threat management also seems to be just some kind of a bad joke.They could for example do a nice hardware based honeypot that you have to untrigger with physical access. They could offer so much more for prosumers providing sane defaults for a common case of having multitude of devices at your home which can be categorized as intruder but expect to be on the same network as your phone.<p>Is there a better alternative? When I tested multiple routers mostly regarding low latency, network stability and reliability a few years ago nothing came close, especially when having multiple access points.')
