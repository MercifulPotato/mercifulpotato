I can think of plenty of actions in robotics that boil down to “do these 3 things concurrently and then do thing #4 when they all complete” and Promise.all or async&#x2F;await are helpful constructs to have when designing those instructions. It won’t be as performant, but the developer won’t have to worry about polling or communicating across threads&#x2F;processes<p>That’s not a knock against assembly, or to say that the same can’t be done in C with time and skill. But in many cases, compromising performance for developer efficiency is a good call.')
