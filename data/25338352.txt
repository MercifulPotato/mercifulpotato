Item(by='tempestn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607379090, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25335235, text='tl;dr: also leave your furnace fan in the on&#x2F;recirculate mode rather than auto.<p>--<p>Also if you have a central furnace, leave the fan in the on&#x2F;recirculate mode, rather than &#x27;auto&#x27;. The power usage of modern furnace fans is very minimal, and the effect on air quality is significant. Especially if your furnace has a fresh air intake, which most do.<p>You can combine that with periodically cracking windows or running bathroom or stove exhaust fans (could even install a switch to automatically run the bathroom fan on a daily schedule). When things are sealed up, the furnace won&#x27;t pull in a lot of outside air (but the recirculating still helps a lot), and then when you have an exhaust path (fan or window), it will pull in more. Then it&#x27;s just a matter of finding out how much to exhaust. A bit each day should be fine, or you can get more precise with a CO2 sensor like [1]. Especially in a closed bedroom overnight, it&#x27;s amazing the difference you&#x27;ll see with the furnace fan and&#x2F;or an exhaust fan running, or a window open.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Hydrofarm-Autopilot-Desktop-Monitor-Logger&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B01FYWU2IS" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Hydrofarm-Autopilot-Desktop-Monitor-L...</a>')
