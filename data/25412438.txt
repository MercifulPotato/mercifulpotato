The chips they designed are fabricated by Samsung in Austin.<p>The &quot;FSD Computer&quot; that they have in their cars now has an Intel Atom board to run the user interface, and then dual arm SoCs to run the Autopilot stack. Each arm SoC has a special ASIC to hardware accelerate certain common neural net inference functions (I.e. dot products and other matrix math).')
