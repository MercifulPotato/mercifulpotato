I can&#x27;t get paid if I don&#x27;t use my real name and real identity online. I don&#x27;t make enough money, but the money I do make helps me survive.<p>Women and other marginalized people are routinely told things like &quot;On the internet, no one knows you are a dog if you don&#x27;t tell them&quot; as a way of saying &quot;If it is a problem to admit you are a woman, don&#x27;t admit it&quot; and they fail to see how huge a problem that is.<p>For many marginalized people, the internet is a godsend. People who are LGBTQ are often vocal in certain online spaces precisely because they can&#x27;t be so vocal in person.<p>But we do need to make clear that what works online if you aren&#x27;t one of the privileged few may be very different from what works online if you are one of the privileged few and it&#x27;s a bit frustrating that this post -- written by someone who is gay -- does such a poor job of highlighting that fact.')
