Google ? Is it okay if a German citizen starts obeying American laws on German soil instead of German ? It makes no sense.<p>Imagine being the lawyer in FB who cleared this, obviously he was right to clear this because there is fundamentally nothing wrong with this, nothing illegal or immoral. Even as VP or PM I do not see why anyone would object to a Facebook login on a device owned by Facebook. Heck, even my website supports login via Facebook.<p>Clearly German government officials do not have a job to do so they are picking on this sort of things.')
