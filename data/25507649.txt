Item(by='curryst', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608653223, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25502237, text='&gt;  I really wish more activist types helped around the world today vs shouting about the past.<p>I don&#x27;t really even see the need for activists.  This seems like something that could be fairly easily handled by the world&#x27;s governments, either through economic leverage, supporting insurgents or direct military intervention.  If we can drone strike terrorists, I don&#x27;t see why we can&#x27;t drone strike slave owners.  Let them live in the fear they have fostered among others.  Or if we don&#x27;t want to get that involved, start leaving AKs laying around conspicuously.  The South was terrified of slaves having guns, and it generally ended poorly for them when slaves did get guns.<p>The countries will complain, but I don&#x27;t see them getting much sympathy on the world stage with a &quot;you can&#x27;t kill our slave owners&quot; tack.')
