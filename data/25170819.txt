Lot of sleeping (9 hours&#x2F;day, sometimes more). Weekend hiking trips - much better if you don&#x27;t have to wake up for work on Friday and Monday.<p>Travel would have been great, but I didn&#x27;t want to overspend since I didn&#x27;t have any income. If all of that got boring I would have tried to join an amateur band (used to play guitar long time ago).<p>I guess I&#x27;m just describing a student life without the classes, lol.')
