I&#x27;ve spent some time thinking about better ways to build houses, spoken with like-minded architects, etc., and haven&#x27;t gotten to the bottom of this question.<p>Intuitively, it seems like there should be quite a bit of room to decrease costs by using engineered, pre-fabricated&#x2F;panelized construction.  There should be less waste, less manual labor, and less re-work.  Yet the best case seems to be approximately the same costs, though I would expect at improved quality or improved first-time quality.<p>Another system for engineered building, though based on wood, is Blueprint Robotics: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blueprint-robotics.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blueprint-robotics.com&#x2F;</a><p>I actually started my personal line of inquiry favoring steel construction as well, though some research convinced me that using a home as a carbon sink through wood construction from sustainably-managed forests made significant sense.  For something like an airtight, well-insulated (Net Zero or better) home using wood-based sheathing, the coefficient of thermal expansion compatibility with wood structure also makes sense.  That being said, it appears the Bone structure folks have their own solutions to prevent thermal shorts between the exterior and the steel structure, as they have apparently used their system for Net Zero and Passivhaus construction.')
