It would take a special kind of device to do that, one whose behavior is more complex than any yet created.</i><p>This is just getting it wrong. Modern neural networks run as vectorized operations on a GPU. They are efficient because they do <i>not</i> use a single device to act like a single neuron, they can do massively parallelized work by optimizing for the hardware we have. If we had memristors, it doesn&#x27;t seem like GPUs are the first thing they&#x27;d replace. More likely they would replace some sort of memory, since what makes them unique is storing information rather than performing analog operations faster.')
