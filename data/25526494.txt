The creators of ethereum created 72 million ether.  They sold 60 million of it to themselves and others and they benefited from the sale.  This is precisely what a premine is, and it is almost identical in structure to other premined altcoins.<p>They subsequently paid the funds received from the presale to themselves in their entirety.  The foundation&#x27;s current funds come from selling a large portion ($100 million USD) of the pre-mined coins at around Ethereum&#x27;s all time high in 2018. ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.trustnodes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;13&#x2F;ethereum-foundation-sold-100-million-at-the-top-says-vitalik-buterin" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.trustnodes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;13&#x2F;ethereum-foundation-so...</a> ).<p>&gt; Your conspiracy theories notwithstanding, the founders were on equal footing with every one else in the crowdsale.<p>100% percent of the funds in the pre-sale were eventually paid back to the founders and their employees starting with a million dollar payment to their CEO the literal day the presale closed (and a few days before he left the org).  Anyone who stood to be repaid from their own payments was in a substantially advantaged position.<p>The earliest presale participants also participated at significantly reduced prices.<p>&quot;Salting&quot; the tip jar by participating in presales at reduced rates or with rebates was an established fraudulent practice in cryptocurrency prior to Ethereum&#x27;s creation, one that Ethereum&#x27;s CEO previously also engaged in prior altcoins.<p>Moreover, the terms of their presale expressly prohibited the participation of US persons.  There is no way in which you can claim there was a broadly equal playing field here.<p>Even if the presale had been an equal playing field that  wouldn&#x27;t have changed the fact that the issuers of ethereum conducted a security sale which directly enriched themselves to the tune of millions of dollars before the system was even running, and has subsequently benefited them to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars.')
