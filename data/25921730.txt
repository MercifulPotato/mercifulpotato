I&#x27;ve already read that ;) But let me say this. About 10 to 15 years ago I&#x27;ve been more interested in transmission lines because of &quot;Energiewende&quot; and such, came across HVDC, how that would enable smart grids, possibly protection against  solar&#x2F;geomagnetic storms because of faster switching times, and so on. I looked into how they built those HVDC-lines in China, how that is not new at all, but eased by modern solid-state power semiconductors, and so on.\nAnd looked further into patents, modulation schemes, even many &#x27;papers&#x27;(pdf) and also very technical books(skimmed those only).<p>Anyway, what I learned was that the grid has <i>many</i> very nonlinear phenomena which are extremely hard to model and predict, because of the dynamics. Much more complicated than the simplistic answers some here have given you. So...relax?<p>:-)')
