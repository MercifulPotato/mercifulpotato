Rest in peace, Mr. Trebek.<p>I can thank Alex Trebek for inspiring the first ever computer program I made and actually distributed - a terrible &quot;Jeopardy&quot; game. Made it myself in Java (that I learned entirely from a paper book), then tried to &quot;convert&quot; the resulting JAR to an EXE using some weird converter, then burned the somewhat mangled result onto a bunch of DVD-Rs and gave them out. One of the most difficult parts of the &quot;programming&quot; process was copying and pasting the same few lines around the whole program, because I didn&#x27;t yet fully understand scope and variables, hah.')
