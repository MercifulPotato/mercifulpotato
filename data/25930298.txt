I will say, if they can crib some code or at least hints on how that might be done (provided they even want to support that feature), there was an old app out there called EnsiChat[1] that IIRC had internet relays running on servers, but was P2P-first.<p>So: if Alice could see Bob directly via P2P, they could chat. Or, if Alice could see Bob indirectly, they could still chat.<p>No idea if it supported meshing P2P connections to get Alice&#x27;s message to Bob via Alice -&gt; internet relay -&gt; Frank -&gt; Dmitry -&gt; Bob<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Nutomic&#x2F;ensichat" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Nutomic&#x2F;ensichat</a>')
