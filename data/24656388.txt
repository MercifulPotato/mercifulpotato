Item(by='turdnagel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601588258, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24649770, text='&gt; “The problem with colourisation is it leads people to just think about photographs as a kind of uncomplicated window onto the past, and that&#x27;s not what photographs are,”<p>&gt; “Colourisation does not bring us closer to the past; it increases the gap between now and then. It does not enable immediacy; it creates difference.”<p>I don&#x27;t find either of these stances intuitive, but the article doesn&#x27;t help. A simple follow up question of &quot;why?&quot; would have gone a long way. The technology is clearly explained -- there is interpolation happening -- but clearly the opinions expressed by these historians are philosophical in nature. It&#x27;s worth having the discussion but the article doesn&#x27;t go far enough, IMHO.')
