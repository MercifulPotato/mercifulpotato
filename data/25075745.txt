Maybe I was too hasty to judge the book by it&#x27;s summary. From other comments, it sounds like this book takes a pretty reasonable approach.<p>I am frequently skeptical of efforts to show the &quot;one true way&quot; of programming, because it usually results in some poorly vetted process being forced on my at work. So, I was probably too quick to jump to conclusions.<p>It actually sounds like this book is good about showing that a lot of our current assumptions about good process are faulty.<p>The point I was trying to make about the &quot;labour of the cognitariate&quot; was that developer doesn&#x27;t really produce software, they create the blue-print for the software (source code), and then compilers or interpreters produce the actually software. It may seem like an overly semantic point, but I think it is an important distinction to make. It changes they way you think about software development.')
