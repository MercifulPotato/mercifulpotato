The first email to me also outlined the whole process (what to do when).<p>About 40 min before the talk I was invited into the speakers corner online chat. Usually, when you arrived at the congress you were to checkin at the speakers corner and they went over the process with you … asking you for slides for the translator team introducing you to the herald etc. This happened all in the chat and over email now.<p>We started to setup, unfortunately there were technical problems with the setup we tested the week before (the self-coded OBS.Ninja version was out and some other glitch).<p>Over checking all other options, we went with a Jitsi solution. \nI had a herald and 2 other tech angels in a Jitsi chat when starting the presentation.  They told me when to start, the herald introduced me, the tech staff gave me feedback on when they started to play the video. We discussed the talk and how to introduce &#x2F;moderate … very similar to how an in person talk would work at the previous congresses.<p>We had a short technical difficulty with the stream (short outage to the media.ccc.de website), the tech angel told me as it happened and when I could continue talking (Recording was still going on).\nSo far, there were no hiccups with the<p>Overall, given the technical issues and other glitches, it was a great experience. For some friends listening in US, Germany and Japan, the talk was smooth and watchable (except the about 30 sec. drop technical glitch). Pretty awesome, also for being in the first talk this year.<p>Surprisingly way more professional than most other online conferences, events I was part of the last year.<p>It&#x27;s wired to give a presentation without feedback though. One of the main reasons I give talks at the chaos communication congresses, are the questions and chats after the talk (the most critical audience you can get ... for me always a pleasure to go through comments and discussions ... having a talk on one of the first days is usually great, as people will just ping you randomly about it when walking around. I got so many cool research ideas over those exchanges). This time, no direct questions after the talk :S\nYet, I already received 4 feedback mails with cool ideas in them :D :D<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.ccc.de&#x2F;v&#x2F;33c3-8225-beyond_virtual_and_augmented_reality" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.ccc.de&#x2F;v&#x2F;33c3-8225-beyond_virtual_and_augmente...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.ccc.de&#x2F;v&#x2F;31c3_-_6460_-_en_-_saal_g_-_201412292115_-_eye_wear_computing_-_kai_kunze" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.ccc.de&#x2F;v&#x2F;31c3_-_6460_-_en_-_saal_g_-_201412292...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.ccc.de&#x2F;v&#x2F;30C3_-_5387_-_en_-_saal_6_-_201312272030_-_toward_a_cognitive_quantified_self_-_kai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.ccc.de&#x2F;v&#x2F;30C3_-_5387_-_en_-_saal_6_-_201312272...</a>')
