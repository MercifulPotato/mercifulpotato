And India is not really the most shining example of protecting our workers from unfair and harsh working conditions. So, if such treatments don&#x27;t fly here, I don&#x27;t think they will fly anywhere else. The kind of labor expectation that these companies have after their stints in China is ethically incompatible with most other countries. So, I can&#x27;t see the condition improving in the near future, companies will continue chasing profits at all cost and China will remain the most fertile ground to do that.')
