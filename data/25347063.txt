There are several reason why OSes provide services to applications and one is that the OS manages the user&#x27;s configuration (e.g. what devices are plugged in, where and how to resolve names, cacheing data, etc).<p>I also find it rather insane the amount of overhead required to resolve a name when an entire http connection needs to be set up and torn down for the process.')
