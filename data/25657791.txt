Ukraine had Russia as the biggest trade partner before 2014. Several companies were owned by Russians: banks, communication providers etc. and millions of Ukrainians working in Russia. Now, when 2014 comes, the armed thugs get their hands on automatic weapons and overthrow the government. And the new government is not just “not pro-Russian”, but actively anti-Russian with all the consequences for Russian capital which has been invested in Ukraine. I mean, you had to be in Kiev in 2014 to see what was going on. So saying Russia was unreasonably hostile towards Ukraine...that’s just being naïve.')
