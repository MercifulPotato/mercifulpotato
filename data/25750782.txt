Looked into on-site warranty options, found very little information, emailed them to get details and got no response. People online seemed to be saying they could only be purchased as warranty extensions and are expensive.<p>So I got another Dell Latitude. Refurb, i7, last model with expandable RAM. 5 YEARS of on-site warranty (which I&#x27;ve used numerous times and been very happy with in the UK&#x2F;EU).<p>I also ordered some other kit from Lenovo, unfortunately they filled in a customs form wrong and UPS returned it to sender immediately. That was 3 weeks ago, they seem to have lost it.')
