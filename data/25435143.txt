This is huge on its own, and you mention it.<p>It also lets me stretch things and make scenes work which would otherwise exceed the dynamic range of the exposure and the built in tone mapping would guess wrong.<p>Storage is cheap these days.  If you&#x27;re not doing something boost-shooting&#x2F;burst intensive, why not shoot raw?  Most of the time the result will be the same, and occasionally it will let you do much more.<p>And, here, IMO, the rant is particularly off base.  A big part of ProRAW is being able to have big linear HDR stacks, which is immensely powerful and absolutely will let you do things you couldn&#x27;t do any other way.')
