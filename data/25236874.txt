They arenâ€™t fools. The ones who care about learning provide you with sandboxes where you need to create different environments and they validate your work. Do some shopping beforehand and see which platforms have sandboxes for learning specifics.<p>I learned through LinuxAcademy.com (dunno if it exists in the same form anymore).<p>I was hired to help a group of linux admin seniors who knew a ton about their work, but had pretty terrible AWS knowledge. After 2 weeks (!) I was able to improve architecture of our environments enough that I made thousands in savings per month and make our product more resilient at the same time.<p>All this gain just because they hired someone who learned how and why to so things through a good cert course. Instead of using the platform as a pure KVM alternative I showed them the APIs that make things easier for us.')
