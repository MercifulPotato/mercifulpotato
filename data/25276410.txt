I&#x27;m guessing one can&#x27;t bookmark any pages and the back button is broken?<p>Everything is broken :-)<p>It really should be taught in schools as how not to design anything. I actually once worked on some extension (at least I think it was) of Java Server Faces which sent serialized Java objects as hidden html-input elements (base64-encoded binary blobs) back and forth with each request(!!). At least I hope that was not part of the core JSF technology. You really should run away from most of the early Java web-tech, it truly was horrid.<p>It&#x27;s also strange that a language, which was so &quot;connected&quot; to the early days of the web (even had their own html element &lt;applet&gt;) ended up with such strange things for web-development shortly after.')
