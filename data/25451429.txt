Ironically enough, because this mindset is popular within the industry, you end up with quite a few interviewers who lack the ability to understand any solution they have not memorized. It&#x27;s always fun reading posts of someone failing an interview because they gave a more optimized solution, which was different from what the other guy in the room had, and couldn&#x27;t be convinced he was wrong because he didn&#x27;t understand how mathematical proofs worked.<p>Discrete math, basic linear algebra, and a few mathematical concepts in computing, generally cover all the possible questions you can get. What I like to do is quickly scroll through all the LeetCode&#x2F;HackerRank questions, identify which ones I&#x27;m unable to quickly label with the type of math to be used, and then learn that math subject&#x2F;topic. It takes me more time learning the math&#x2F;theory, it takes me longer still trying to memorize every possible solution out there.<p>Spend on the history, end all the mystery. Or just keep trying to collect all the rocks in the world.')
