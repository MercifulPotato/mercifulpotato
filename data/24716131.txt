Item(by='Natsu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602134850, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24715928, text='There are plenty of FBI docs that get released by journalists and others who are not FBI agents, so it&#x27;s hard to take that as a given without seeing the tweets in context, which I did not see.  The ruling does mumble something about the account passing itself as an FBI agent, as I&#x27;ve since had a chance to read, but it doesn&#x27;t give any details and I didn&#x27;t see any mention of that law.<p>Also, I&#x27;m surprised the NPR ran this article, given the disclaimer at the bottom that it&#x27;s a <i>party to it</i>.  Usually the lawyers just don&#x27;t let you do that.')
