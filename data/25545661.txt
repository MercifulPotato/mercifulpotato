A more accurate description of the situation is a lack of BELIEF or conviction about PC-class ARM.<p>The M1 situation can be likened to smart phones before the iPhone. No one believed it was possible to make a device that could be operated entirely with the fingers - they all needed styluses.<p>Microsoft and the PC industry has literally spent billions of dollars on ARM. Microsoft alone lost $990 million[1] on Surface RT, their ARM version of Microsoft surface. Microsoft&#x27;s next ARM device Surface Pro X has meh sales. HP, DELL lost money on their Windows RT devices[2]<p>In other words, ARM on Microsoft land has failed not for lack of effort, or some grand conspiracy - just lack of example.<p>Now that the entire industry can SEE a laptop class ARM processor that does not suck, someone will come up with an appropriate response within a few years. I doubt it&#x27;ll be Qualcomm.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Surface_(2012_tablet)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Surface_(2012_tablet)</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Windows_RT" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Windows_RT</a>')
