Item(by='tidepod12', descendants=None, kids=[25361553], score=None, time=1607530291, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25359653, text='The distinction CA (and other states) make is between being a &quot;resident&quot;, &quot;part-time resident&quot;, or &quot;nonresident&quot;. If you are classified as a resident or a part-time resident, you pay CA income tax on <i>all</i> of your income, even if it was earned from work that happened outside of CA. If you are a nonresident, you pay CA taxes only on the income that was earned from work happening in CA.<p>It&#x27;s possible this move might help Musk become a &quot;nonresident&quot; and pay less CA taxes, but I kinda doubt it. The classification of type of resident is based on more than just &quot;official address of your house&quot;. It also includes things like where your work is, what banks you use, what doctors you go to, and even what social activities you take part in.<p>This is pretty common in many states, btw. One time I had to file a tax return to a small city in Michigan because I had a 4-hour work meeting there and they taxed it.')
