The solar charging one that syncs to atomic time automatically runs about $90 (Model: GWM5610-1).   The battery powered, manually set time runs about $40 (Model: DW5600E-1V).   They keep such good time, and the batteries last for over 5 years in most cases, and can swap out in a few minutes for a few bucks, that you&#x27;ll have to decide if it&#x27;s worth it.<p>I also like pretty much all Timex Ironman watches... T53151 is small like the F-91W and pretty cheap, usually under $25.  The Transit series is more square and modern looking, the TW5M19300 runs under $40.')
