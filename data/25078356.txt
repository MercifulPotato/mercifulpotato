And this applies to all the libraries that it uses, directly or indirectly - if any library spawns a thread and does some locking in it, you get all kinds of hard-to-debug deadlocks if you try to fork.<p>So unless you have <i>very</i> good perf reasons to need fork, I would strongly recommend multiprocessing.set_start_method(&quot;spawn&quot;) on all platforms. No obscure bugs, and it&#x27;ll also behave the same everywhere, so things will be more portable. Code using multiprocessing that&#x27;s written to rely on fork semantics can be very difficult to port later.')
