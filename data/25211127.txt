Item(by='laverya', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606322590, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25210726, text='&gt; The evidence is that immigrants generate positive net tax benefits.<p>Immigrants as a whole being a net positive might be clear, but the demographics most commonly under debate are things like &quot;refugees&quot; or &quot;illegal immigrants&quot; or &quot;people seeking asylum at the US-Mexico border&quot;. Now, it&#x27;s possible that those groups are still a (financial) net positive, but I&#x27;d be a lot less confident in that than &quot;doctors&quot; or &quot;people with a degree&quot;.<p>This also doesn&#x27;t really address the issue of &quot;what impact does immigration have on US wage earners&quot;. An immigrant doctor or programmer might be clearly beneficial financially and to the country as a whole, but the doctors and programmers they&#x27;re competing with might not be quite so happy. And while those demographics can &quot;take it&quot; so to speak, unskilled laborers facing the same competition are in a bit tougher of a spot.')
