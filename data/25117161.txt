However, each time you do this, you can create yet another new Godel sentence for the new system with the new axiom. Since it&#x27;s a diagonalization argument, no amount of adding of new axioms can permanently &quot;fix&quot; the system and make it complete -- there will always be new Godel sentence that is true but not provable.')
