It&#x27;s not because you have  designed something yourself, that you don&#x27;t need to observe it to understand it, or that you can answer any question about this thing analytically.<p>For example, the folks from high performance computing conduct loads of experiments to observe and understand which CPU design work best and why. Deep Learning people also run lots of experiments understand which model is easier to train and corroborate theoretical results from learning theory. etc.')
