Item(by='MayeulC', descendants=None, kids=[24749881], score=None, time=1602447399, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24746093, text='The assumption behind my comment is: Most of the time, you only care about whether the train is coming. A 1-second advantage isn&#x27;t really interesting. Of course, maybe that&#x27;s the interesting part in that kind of situation? I doubt it, though.<p>At 5km, sound will take 15 seconds to cover the distance. That&#x27;s negligible compared to the time the train will take, assuming a good old train going at ~40 km&#x2F;h (7&#x27;30&quot;). Using the quoted 6 km&#x2F;s, that gives ~ 0.8 s inside the rail.<p>I admit I was initially expecting a smaller difference. But I still think that the 14 seconds advantage is negligible over just knowing that the train is arriving from a far away distance: to hear the train at all, wind needs to blow in the right direction, and the train needs not be too far away (~d^2 energy propagation, so ~log(d) in dB vs virtually no attenuation in a simplified model). I wish I had time to look up and compute the attenuation in both cases....')
