It&#x27;s cheap, plug&#x27;n&#x27;play setup, compact (relatively to the laser jet printers).<p>Yea, inks can run out. When they do I just use a syringe and refill them all in 20 min. However, laser cartridge can run out as well, what are you going to do with it? Buy new? Refill at the shop? Meh, I don&#x27;t want to go to the shop. (If it works during these times)<p>People hate them, however, for tech savvy folks they&#x27;re cheap and easy to maintain.')
