This will prevent interruptions and maximise your focus.<p>- Instant Messaging (via teams AND slack) must be reserved only for urgent blockers. We are monitoring activity for the time being, continued &quot;noisy&quot; chatter on these channels may lead to further policy improvements.<p>- Phone calls and videoconferences require a clear, written agenda and are to be scheduled via email as per the thrice-daily email periods. All outcomes to be clearly documented in CRM, wiki, or task board as relevant. Email your project manager if you&#x27;re uncertain on these processes.<p>- All such activities are to be logged against billable projects where relevant. Any non-billable communications are to be logged under &quot;Focus Improvement - Internal&quot;<p>Over time we will build up a clearer picture of focus, interruptions, and productivity, so our standard timekeeping policies remain in effect. Please submit all time entries immediately upon completion of any activity so that we can effectively track and manage these improvements.<p>And don&#x27;t forget, our team virtual fitness challenge shirts are being ordered on Friday so don&#x27;t forget to fill out the spreadsheet with your preferences and remember to hit up the donations page - it&#x27;s for a great cause!<p>Love,<p>Management')
