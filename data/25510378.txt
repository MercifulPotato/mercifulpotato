I was a technical co-founder was that left a startup early on, and because we didn&#x27;t have a vesting agreement from the very beginning, I was entitled to my 40%, even when I left the company. While it was to my advantage, I didn&#x27;t want my co-founder to give up when I left, so I gave most of it up. For my next startup, I&#x27;ll make sure to have a goals-based vesting agreement from the very beginning i.e. co-founder gets x% on first sale, x% on first raise')
