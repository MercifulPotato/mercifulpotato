And to what end?<p>I&#x27;m happy to retract the conspiracy definition on the basis that there isn&#x27;t explicit coordination. If you&#x27;ll allow me to move the goalposts a bit I&#x27;ll settle on the fact that my frustration is in the excuse-making that these actions are just regular checks and balances, instead of being the nefarious acts they are, unfair interference in the markets to the detriment of retail investors.<p>When you have heads of brokerages coming on talk shows (my memory of who isn&#x27;t great) recently claiming that they&#x27;ll open things up &quot;when things settle down&quot;, and actually claiming &quot;this is a $17 stock&quot; (nothing wrong with the opinion, it&#x27;s just unfair for a marketplace to be wielding their influence like that), we&#x27;re living in bizarro world when the media isn&#x27;t calling them out on it.<p>Then you have the CEO of nasdaq saying they&#x27;ll consider halting trading if they can match social media chatter to movements (as if it&#x27;s possible to prove causation anyway) so that large institutions get time to adjust??  When does the retail investor with their pension on the line ever get time to adjust?<p>&gt;extreme volatility.<p>It might be extreme but it&#x27;s not unpredictable. The helpless &quot;how could we have seen this coming?&quot; from institutions rings hollower each time throughout the decades that it&#x27;s used.<p>The answer here is to stop the interventionalism that tries to hide natural volatility. Do you think social media is causing volatility and leaving pump and dump bagholders? Fine, <i>let it happen</i> on the small scale more frequently and sooner or later people will learn through frequent exposure that you can lose your shirt.<p>However, if you constantly intervene? You&#x27;re hiding the volatility until a large event is allowed to hide in plain sight and deliver a liquidity crisis for many.')
