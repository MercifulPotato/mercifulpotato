Then, when charged with attempting to hang the politician, I said &quot;I was just joking&quot; even though I had some hanging equipment and I was in a giant mob full of other people all chanting to hang the politician and many of us had guns and anyway I also broke into a locked building to do the hanging -- and then it came out that large swaths of the content on the same site was people making those kinds of threats, and then it came out that the site operators didn&#x27;t care to remove the threats because they had a moral opposition to moderation, and then it came out that AWS had contacted the site owners many times to implore them to remove other illegal content, and then the site operators, rather than removing the content, gave press interviews where they boasted how they were invincible and didn&#x27;t care if AWS took them down... then it&#x27;s probable that AWS would take the content down. And this doesn&#x27;t concern me at all. Lock me up, in this hypothetical, and lock up the people who enabled me.<p>I ran a legacy website that once got spammed. My host contacted me because one of the spam things was an ad for a website hosting stolen credit card numbers. They gave me 24 hours to take down the content. This isn&#x27;t because they&#x27;re censoring math and they&#x27;re using their monopoly power to prevent numbers from being posted, it&#x27;s because stolen credit card numbers, provided for the purposes of credit card fraud, are illegal and they didn&#x27;t want to do business with me if I wasn&#x27;t willing to remove the content.<p>And I also don&#x27;t see a further problem with using the posture of the site operators + the site itself to make a judgment call about whether the content in question is an aberration or intentional. If someone posted a magnet link of pirated content in Hacker News, I wouldn&#x27;t presume per se that Hacker News was a piracy website because I can facially see that the site is general purpose, and also because I can see that the site has a general moderation policy that signals it is willing to comply with legal requests. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that ThePirateBay can credibly argue in court &quot;We had no idea our site was used for piracy, and if you ban us, you have to ban Google, because they crawled us.&quot;')
