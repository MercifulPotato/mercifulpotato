Paint.net is windows freeware, closed source since an early release, which is both feature rich and a pleasure to use.

It still gets regular updates.<p>There&#x27;s an attempt at a clone, Pinta, which was based off the early open source version but it didn&#x27;t get much further than mspaint functionality.')
