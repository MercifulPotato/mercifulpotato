Emissions are going down in all of the most highly developed countries. As technology improves, this will improve as well. You&#x27;re complaining about progress that has lifted billions of people out of squalor to having powerful computers in their pockets and being able to transport goods across the globe.<p>&gt; The damage is that now I can’t go outside in late summer, if it doesn’t rain the week before, because the air is poisoned by soot from forest fires.<p>Maybe they should do some forest management with the billions in taxes they take every year, instead of giving it to street-shitting, drugged-out hobos.<p>&gt; The rich are the reason I couldn’t afford a place to rent in San Francisco, their speculative housing investment and gentrification raised the marked rate so much that a working class person from one of the richest country in the world couldn’t afford to live there.<p>When demand goes up, and supply doesn&#x27;t, the price goes up. This isn&#x27;t rich people&#x27;s fault, it&#x27;s basic supply and demand.<p>&gt; The rich are the reason—unless you are one of them—that you are not making significantly more money from your current job, they consistently take away from your contribution to the wealth you generate in your current job without contributing anything of value.<p>They provide you with a job. You are free to start your own business. Rich people can&#x27;t stop you.<p>No one owes you anything.')
