It exists to protect national interests.<p>This is meaningless, and to the degree that it has meaning, ridiculously overbroad. Almost all activities that &quot;protect national interests&quot; are not military. The definition you purport to provide here does not distinguish the military from anything else.<p>What actually defines the military is that it achieves its goals through the use of violence. And the police belong in this category too; there isn&#x27;t a difference. Saying the police are not military purely because they wear a label saying &quot;the third amendment doesn&#x27;t apply to us, for reasons that will make sense if we beat you enough&quot; would be the same error as saying that a newspaper didn&#x27;t enjoy freedom of &quot;the press&quot; if it published online (and therefore didn&#x27;t use a printing press).<p>Actually, it would be more like saying that the New York Times didn&#x27;t enjoy freedom of &quot;the press&quot; because they&#x27;re &quot;the Times&quot;, not &quot;the press&quot;.')
