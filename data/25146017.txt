That is because competition is being prevented.<p>No it doesn&#x27;t. The 30&#x2F;70 split for revenue share is a standard thing across industries. This includes other industries that aren&#x27;t related to IT at all.<p>&gt; Except for epic! They charge 12%. So that is one specific example right there, that would reduce the fee below the current fee that Apple charges.<p>Epic are trying to buy their way into the market. They are flush with cash from fortnite and unreal engine. Once they wedge themselves in it will raise their take I would wager.<p>Every other player is at 30%. Nintendo have lowered it to 30% to be inline with others.<p>Every brainlet brings up EPIC as a gotcha, ignoring the fact that EPIC are buying their way into the market. Which is very important thing to consider.<p>&gt; All I need is a singular example to prove my point. And we have that example. Epic&#x27;s app store is being prevented, and they charge less money.<p>A singular example where a company is buying it way into the market is not representative of the whole. There were banks that had interest rates of 16% back in the 1970s. That doesn&#x27;t mean that the other banks should have offered that or that it is fair (those banks with high interests rates would always collapse).<p>So no that isn&#x27;t true.<p>&gt; Even if you are willing to ignore basic economic theory completely by saying it would have no effect on price, giving more money to developers indirectly helps consumers even if prices stay exactly the same.<p>I am not ignoring basic economic theory. You are. If people buy a triple A game for £50 or £60 in the sufficient numbers then the prices won&#x27;t be lowered.<p>As for developers getting more money helps consumer. Absolute nonsense. The company will pocket the cash. You are living in fantasy land if you think anything else.<p>&gt; It helps them because more resources can be spent on the game to make it better.<p>That is good for developers by not necessarily for consumers. And no it won&#x27;t be spent on making the game better.<p>&gt; And to go even further, even if such benefits don&#x27;t exist, it is still better to give the money to the people who made the game, who I think deserve that money more than Apple.<p>Apple deserve the money because the devs agreed to put their software on their store and the stipulation (until now) is that Apple got 30% of the purchase.')
