There was a running joke between managers about recycling developers so they never had to sponsor any of them.<p>I also worked at two different startups where they hired a developer and then a few weeks into the gig, they figured out this wasn&#x27;t the person they thought they had hired. The second time, I wondered to a co-worker about it and he said there&#x27;s a huge problem with one person (the qualified candidate) doing the interview and then they send a totally unqualified person to the gig.<p>I also experienced large teams were an Indian developer would be getting close to his H1-B expiring and suddenly send a manager an email about a &quot;sick family member&quot; and having to return to India, never to show up again. One of co-workers said its pretty common and the H1-B devs are constantly interviewing and if they get a fresh contract, they&#x27;ll just leave the current company and start at the new one - without any heads up to anybody, they just ghost.<p>The whole program is so unregulated and so many loopholes for both sides to take advantage of, it needs to be changed for sure.')
