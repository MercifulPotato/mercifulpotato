That makes sense. But doesn&#x27;t Bob need to send a packet to Alice to setup the NAT traversal on his side? More accurately, Alice uses the SRV field to populate the wg peer information on her side -- but how does Bob know that he needs to update the peer information on his side?<p>I think this is <i>really</i> close, but maybe using a custom DNS server for this might be trying to be a little too clever?')
