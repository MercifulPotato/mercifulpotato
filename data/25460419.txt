It won&#x27;t teach you the various commands on the command line but it shows you what is actually happening inside git when you perform various actions. It made me transition from &quot;I know how to run these commands to operate git&quot; to &quot;I know what git is doing, so I can reason about the system and adapt to unusual circumstances&quot;. Now when someone makes a mistake in my company&#x27;s git, I am the person people go to for help.')
