If your culture is one where you must be in the office at all times this wouldn’t fly. When I managed large teams I allowed this on a few conditions.<p>1) Work&#x2F;Delivery can’t suffer. No decrease in velocity because of some work&#x2F;life balance. This is easily measured and padded with a +\\- 5%.<p>2) Accountable. If you have things you are accountable for and they aren’t done yet, better get that homework done.<p>3) If your an engineer, we pay you to think, not to sit in a chair.
