End-of-life and maintenance guarantees. Transferring nuclear waste and processing them is not cheap. You need to put capital aside to pay for these.<p>Why isn&#x27;t that solvable? You just provided a solution, ie. rather than charging $100k for a reactor, they&#x27;ll charge $100k + $20k disposal fee (to be put in a trust or something). Why can&#x27;t this be done by a startup?')
