Ideas around censorship came about when the social medium that mobilized thought were MUCH more viscous.<p>Like imagine a physical surface on some liquid medium, in which its initial properties were such that a small force rippled to such a degree due to viscosity. You&#x27;d generally know the forces other points would feel when event Y happened so much distance away. But if suddenly the liquid developed very different properties, and now waves travelled differently through it, you must respond by adapting (or at least CONSIDER adapting). Whatever science or activity or measurement was happening on that surface before, that would need to be adapted or changed or even discarded. One&#x27;s views on how to navigate the environment must change to respond to such an important change in the mediating layer.<p>Sorry if that&#x27;s a bit of mixed metaphor, but I truly feel it&#x27;s more than light analogy. Anyhow, be well!')
