Momentum traders, swing traders, automated high-frequency traders front-running order flow, that&#x27;s all kosher. But let a bunch of retail traders step outside of long-term fundamentals and beat the funds at their own game, and suddenly that&#x27;s a problem.<p>People keep assuming the WSB crowd are idiots. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a given that they can&#x27;t do risk management, and in a short squeeze it&#x27;s generally the short sellers who end up holding the bag.<p>Anyone who FOMOs in this week is probably in for a hurtin&#x27;, but the ones who got in before this was all over the media have a good shot at significant profit.')
