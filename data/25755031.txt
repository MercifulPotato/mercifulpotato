One of the worst software companies out there.  Aside from their &quot;Free&quot; Turbo Tax fiasco (easy to find via web search), Quicken was the most infuriating program I ever used.<p>I now use MoneyDance (no affiliation, customer for 5+ years).<p>It&#x27;s a Java program.  It just works.  It looks the same after every update.  Updates are free for a couple of years.  Then I pay for the update, because I like them and want them to succeed.<p>They have a user forum where problems are solved.<p>I no longer swear about my finances, unless it&#x27;s about my finances.  The software I use is now invisible.')
