In practice, however, I think that, to use your example, South Korea will act based on its relationship with China rather than your relationship with China. So, if KOR agrees with you that free speech is more important than how China might react to non-extradition, then KOR may not extradite you. However, if KOR thinks that they must turn you over to preserve their relationship, then they might. Again, all of this is of course hypothetical and in the real world should be defined by treaties.<p>I&#x27;ll just note that in your example, if C is just trying to stay neutral and acting of its own accord, then the correct term would be that C would <i>deport</i> the suspect to A rather than extradite the suspect to A, unless A is seeking extradition in its own right.')
