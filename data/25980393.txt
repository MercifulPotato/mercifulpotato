The practice of pulling in all of jQuery just to add an event listener for showing and hiding a div is _why_ web development looks the way it does today.  Normalization of deviance is the vehicle, and jQuery was the payload.<p>I come across stuff &quot;only&quot; using jQuery today, and every time, I end up ripping it out because it&#x27;s totally unnecessary and often ends up being the <i>source</i> of breakage and logic errors.  What&#x27;s worse is that its APIs are awful, and it&#x27;s impossible to debug in its blob form.  The fix always ends up being to just get rid of it.')
