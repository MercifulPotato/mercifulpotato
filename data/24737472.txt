I&#x27;m not sure what the point of church is if it doesn&#x27;t help through personal crises.<p>Beyond that, if the divorce is OK with the church, what&#x27;s the secret? If it&#x27;s not OK and it&#x27;s still happening, doesn&#x27;t that imply irreconcilable differences with the church as well as the spouse? I guess given that, you have a point about timing, but all relationships are two-way streets, including ones between families and churches. Seems like the problems unravel on their own and we&#x27;re just complaining about a catalyst.')
