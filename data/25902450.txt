I doubt that a benevolent team of developers can match the expertise of the NSA.<p>Of course, most users don&#x27;t really have to care about such security flaws since they&#x27;re very advanced issues, and most users care about their privacy.<p>Meanwhile, I honestly would like to voluntarily submit my interests so I can choose what ads I would like to see. Advertisers should do that.')
