If Ford has charging stations that cover, e.g., the Rockies very well, it&#x27;d be &quot;wasteful&quot; to force Tesla to have to build out an identical network to cover the same region. (Where &quot;force&quot; is accomplished by incompatible cables, or communication changes, or some other issue.)<p>If companies can share infrastructure, then they all will benefit from each other improving their own networks. Ford adding stations that can be used by other EVs will further improve the quality of life for <i>all</i> EVs.')
