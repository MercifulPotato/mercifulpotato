Web applications do not do this, even with aggressive caching and using service workers.<p>I’d also argue that the web is far more accessible than native apps, in that it’s cross platform and independent of any one vendor, currently. So there are valid reasons for considering the page load price of websites&#x2F;web apps.<p>Also, know your target audience. I’m decidedly not okay with non application sites loading megabytes of JS just to function. However I’m okay with complex functionality provider by my very good and feature rich web based email client need a few MBs of JS to work on initial load, because the features justify the cost in that case<p>It’s not all or nothing')
