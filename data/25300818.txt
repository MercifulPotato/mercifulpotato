Most font designers seem to publish web fonts for free as an advertisement for their services or print font products they sell. As a consequence, while the sample sentence might look great, the feeling when reading is poor. Especially screen optimisation is lacking, which is what distinguishes the usual fonts you get with your OS (like Arial or Roboto) from stuff you would buy for print (like Helvetica). Also, people tend to pick more fancy fonts to set themselves apart, which of course decreases readability even with very good fonts: you can just read fonts faster if you are used to them, uncommon ones slow you down and feel uncomfortable for long texts.')
