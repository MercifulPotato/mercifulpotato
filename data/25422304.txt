Incoming geeking about Universal Programming Languages.<p>1. If you can increase the performance of a language by adding language specific instruction sets to the processor, how much of a boost would we see on average?<p>2. Instead of building in instructions for say Python, C#, Java, etc, what if you built it in a language designed to create other languages I.E Racket? (I like Racket but another language that specialized in this would be fine). Since languages built on Racket ultimately compile to valid Racket code, you&#x27;ll still get the speed up, and can program with the features and syntax you want (within reason obv constrained by the limitations of the base language).<p>3. I wasn&#x27;t around for this, but isn&#x27;t this what made Lisp faster on Lisp Machines? Since they had dedicated hardware for interpreting Lisp instructions?')
