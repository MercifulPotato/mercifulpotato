The one I had mainly in mind was highschool and college-aged students who are working part-time:  they&#x27;d get included in under-employment, but aren&#x27;t necessarily looking for a living wage yet because they have other priorities, so they don&#x27;t get included in unemployment counts.<p>Also,<p>&gt; I&#x27;d like to see unemployment measured more like total population minus those employed.<p>This measure would include children who can&#x27;t even work part-time.')
