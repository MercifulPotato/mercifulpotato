Item(by='dgudkov', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610923170, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25815399, text='&gt;security is as much about discipline as the actual security you implement<p>Totally agree on that. The author&#x27;s main ranting about Yubikey is that it requires developing new habits, but that&#x27;s exactly the point.<p>&gt;they&#x27;re not promoting their value to sites in a way that implementation is a no-brainer.<p>That&#x27;s a good point. Although, poor adoption of hardware tokens even by banks (e.g. no bank in Canada supports Yubikey) is surely not because it&#x27;s hard to implement. It&#x27;s a &quot;chicken-or-egg&quot; problem. Organizations don&#x27;t support hardware tokens because few people use them, and few people use tokens because many organizations don&#x27;t support them anyway. Yubikey and other hardware token vendors could&#x27;ve done a better job promoting and simplifying using hardware tokens.')
