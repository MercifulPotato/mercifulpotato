Clients not handed pointers cannot abuse them. It does demand correctness of the library implementation similar to demands on the compiler. But such correctness in a library formalism is certainly as possible to establish and maintain as in a compiler.<p>Use of wild pointers in other parts of the client could overwrite library data, but that is a different risk than the data races that are the topic here.')
