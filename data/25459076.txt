The biggest problem is, it&#x27;s very difficult to define relevancy, since code search is EXTREMELY context driven. And I&#x27;m guessing purging inactive repositories, addresses most of the noise issues they have.<p>However, I&#x27;m kind of surprised by a blanket purge like this, as I figured they would take repo stars and other signals into consideration to decide what to purge.')
