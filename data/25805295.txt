It ruins the immersion for me, unless there are dialogue choices so I still have some agency. I quit playing Dishonored 2 after a couple of hours because the protagonist keeps talking as a way to narrate things for the player, but it&#x27;s just silly being a stealth assassin constantly talking to yourself.')
