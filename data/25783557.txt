Community moderation of directed hate or specific threats of violence only works if a majority of the community believes that content shouldn&#x27;t be there, and that concept is antithetical to Parler&#x27;s philosophy. Pretty much by definition of the crowd it attracts, the crowd is going to be unwilling to flag or delete posts. Heck, from what I&#x27;ve read about their user on-boarding process, people basically start out partly shadow-banned and have to have enough comment green-lit in order to become full member. This means, given the high (and somewhat extreme) conservative population there, there&#x27;s a built-in filter that selects for additional and ever-more extreme views. Again, antithetical to community moderation.<p>Regardless of the above, small staff is not a sufficient excuse. Plenty of businesses have hurdles they have to jump over in order to operate legally. If you don&#x27;t have the staff for it, you don&#x27;t have what it takes to operate in that industry. Considering that countless other forums large &amp; small manage this task though, it doesn&#x27;t seem a high barrier of entry.')
