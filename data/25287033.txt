Item(by='jholman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606986172, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25286819, text='I absolutely agree, drawing rasters or using a vector display (or doing neither, for example doing picking in UX or hitscan in a game) is later in the pipeline.  I agree about the more complex taxonomy.<p>But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a branching taxonomy?  Both can raster-display, both can vector-display, and both can be used for things other than display.  I feel like it&#x27;s just a 2x3 matrix, or maybe I&#x27;m missing some rows columns.<p>I also agree with your other comment that, even though it&#x27;s not strictly necessary to do any rasters at all (Battlezone), in 99.99% of cases polygon-pushers are more rasterizer-y than ray-tracers.  Even if you&#x27;re not texturing, you&#x27;re doing depth occlusion checking (again, Battlezone and other wireframe renderers don&#x27;t, but yeah, niche), and although there may be some way to do depth occlusion without rasters (z-buffer), I dunno what it is and I&#x27;ve never heard of anyone doing it any other way.<p>I dunno, when I&#x27;ve taught the material that your book covers (on rare occasion, in less-formal settings), I have definitely felt this need for a raytracer-vs-polygon-projecting taxonomy, and definitely felt a need to talk about rasterizing, but not felt a need to talk about rasterizing <i>in the context of the taxonomy</i>.')
