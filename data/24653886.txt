You&#x27;d start with a computer engineering degree focusing on computer architecture and VLSI design.<p>- Designing analog or RF chips?  You&#x27;d start with an electrical engineering degree.<p>- Fabricating chips from bare silicon wafers?  That&#x27;s an intersection of chemistry, applied physics, material science, and electrical engineering.<p>Look up the course requirements for degrees at universities with engineering programs and you can see what courses and textbooks are used for each.')
