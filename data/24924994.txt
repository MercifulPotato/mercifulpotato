Most places I see that offer that are self-reported numbers, and I don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s self-reporting.  Freelance is going to be largely what you make of it, but there&#x27;s definitely a &#x27;sales&#x27; aspect to it, at least periodically.  You need to connect with prospects, demonstrate ability, set up a deal, get paid, do the work, get more paid, etc.  It&#x27;s not impossible, but definitely takes a bit more work for many folks.  Word-of-mouth referrals helps remove some of those steps.  Finding another agency to work for&#x2F;under can help too - they can handle some of the &#x27;finding work&#x27;, and maybe even billing, but they&#x27;re going to take their cut.  May or may not be worth it - you can definitely get more flexibility, but that&#x27;s not everyone&#x27;s primary goal.  And... with the pandemic, most people are remote working now anyway, and have some more flexibility than they had a year ago, so there&#x27;s a bit less obvious win there as a comparison point.')
