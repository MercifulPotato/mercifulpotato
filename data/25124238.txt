I&#x27;ve flicked through a few of the videos and really like the style.<p>My one nitpick &#x2F; thought would be that the terms of service[1] are a bit limiting. I wasn&#x27;t expecting Creative Commons (although it&#x27;s always great to see CC-licensed educational materials), but expressly forbidding any commercial use is a bit of a shame - what if someone is learning as part of a job?
