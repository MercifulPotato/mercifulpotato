And a carrier may charge a customer more if at least y% percent of calls are flagged as abuse. And a customer is referred to FCC for enforcement action after N calls are flagged in 30 days or if z% of calls are flagged.<p>Perhaps a requirement for record keeping of flagged calls, such that the recipient can sue for statuatory damages, and the carriers involved would be liable if they can&#x27;t provide records. If they provide the records, liability moves to the origin, but the end customer may seek to quash the suboena without revealing their identity in narrow circumstances where anonymous calls serve the public interest and the abuse process is being used to deanonymize rather than stop abuse.')
