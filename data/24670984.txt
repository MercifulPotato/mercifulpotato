You are doing work for free, they are risking their asses deploying what you wrote, you both care about quality.<p>In the end the fact you&#x27;re there making time for any interaction requires some money to be entering the system somewhere, to pay the rent.  If the guys deploying it have skin the game and you don&#x27;t, your helping out encourages the dynamic that FOSS author time is worth less than paid dev time, that rather than send patches just complain and let the little people take care of those details.
