What does &quot;believe in&quot; mean?</i><p>It&#x27;s just a casual way to say &quot;If you&#x27;re all for theories and falsifiliability&quot;.<p>(It&#x27;s also pedantically correct. In the end everything comes down to believing it).<p>&gt;<i>I wrote that your original statement is more of an opinion&#x2F;spiritual statement than a falsifiable scientific statement. </i><p>It&#x27;s also empirically consistent. The observed universe is mostly gas, rock, nuclear reactors we call stars, and so on. Where are the proofs that it has a &quot;purpose&quot; or &quot;meaning&quot;?<p>&gt;<i>It just didn&#x27;t sound like you realize that what you wrote is an opinion, and not some hard-cut proved and obvious statement, so I was wondering whether you realize it? Or do you have an illusion that you have provable grounds for it?</i><p>No, I have the certainty that it&#x27;s the only empirically matching to observables conclusion, and that it&#x27;s the less extraordinary claim (and the simplest one).<p>It&#x27;s any further claims that need to bring proof. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, Occam&#x27;s razor, and all that.')
