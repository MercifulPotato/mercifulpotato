I am sure the author is an extremely capable engineer but he is obviously missing the elephant in the room: that the root problem is app growth and feature creep caused by uncontrolled growth of the eng. workforce (who are all incentivized to ship their code because it&#x27;s good for promotion). As if app growth was some kind of god-given fate that can&#x27;t be changed! But instead of fighting the real (organizational, political) issues within the company, they blame it on technical issues (Swift is not mature! 100 MB app size limit is too low! etc.). Incredible.<p><i>The larger community benefited from our learnings.</i><p>No. The larger community would have benefited if you had written a story about how someone in the org. stood up to management, fought the feature creep, the crazy app growth and doubling eng. each year, and brought the whole project back to sanity. But that didn&#x27;t happen.<p><i>So my advice.  Everything in Computer Science is a trade off. There is no universally superior language. Whatever you do, understand what the tradeoff are why you are making them. Don’t let it descend into a political war between opinionated factions.</i><p>No disrespect, but no choice &#x2F; tradeoff in the world would have led to a satisfactory outcome if you have hundreds of engineers burying this app under an avalanche of code day after day. The tools &#x2F; tech are alright. The company is not.')
