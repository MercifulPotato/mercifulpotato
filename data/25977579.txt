Docker, Kubernetes, Buildah and Podman are mostly Go code and I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much intent to change that.<p>I suspect the conclusion (that Go is not ideal for this kind of low level component) is accurate. OTOH, I wish it could be a memory-safe language instead of C. I can only assume there is some decent reason why Rust isn&#x27;t used here, though personally I wouldn&#x27;t know.')
