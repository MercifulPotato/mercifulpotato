Since then, tools and repositories have been created to help facilitate per-registration [2].<p>But again, they are not universally adopted. Some of this is probably generationalâ€”academia is quite conservative, and doesn&#x27;t change quickly. A new generation will likely use these tools more. Other times, fields are more insular than others, and so such tools will take some time to diffuse into their community. In the meantime though, things have improved, even if only somewhat, across the sciences.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apa.org&#x2F;science&#x2F;about&#x2F;psa&#x2F;2015&#x2F;08&#x2F;pre-registration" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apa.org&#x2F;science&#x2F;about&#x2F;psa&#x2F;2015&#x2F;08&#x2F;pre-registrati...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cos.io&#x2F;initiatives&#x2F;prereg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cos.io&#x2F;initiatives&#x2F;prereg</a>')
