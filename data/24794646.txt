Item(by='tialaramex', descendants=None, kids=[24795835, 24796135], score=None, time=1602799282, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24794129, text='PINs seem like the wrong focus?<p>The first thing to know is that payment cards have two almost unrelated systems, named Authorization and Settlement. Authorization is about protecting the card company from crooked card holders by validating that the card holder authorized this transaction. It&#x27;s optional, and it has some modern technologies like EMV (Europay&#x2F;Mastercard&#x2F;Visa the joint system known for the presence of a chip on your card) which could enable PIN verification if you wanted.<p>Settlement is the part that moves money from your account to a merchant&#x27;s account, it&#x27;s childishly simple and it is run almost entirely on the honour system like it was when it was invented last century. A merchant says card 1234 5678 9012 3456 was used to pay them $280, the card company either accepts that and moves $280 from the account associated with that card to the account for the merchant, or they refuse. The merchant <i>can</i> provide more information, but they don&#x27;t have to and will usually get paid regardless.<p>The fancy modern technology for Authorization makes no difference to Settlement. If the bank receives a Settlement for a transaction supposedly made with a card you actually tossed into the mouth of an active volcano a month earlier, the <i>only</i> thing likely to stop that getting paid is if you call the bank and insist you made no such transaction, confident that the merchant doesn&#x27;t have evidence to the contrary because duh, that card was destroyed a month ago.<p>Check your statements. Read every line item, dispute anything you don&#x27;t recognise. Even if you use (for example) Apple Pay every single time, your bank is under no obligation to treat a $150 payment for scratch offs  supposedly made with a mag stripe card on the far side of the country as suspicious and block it. They might, but they might not, that&#x27;s on you.<p>The volume of fraud is driven by easy ways to steal a shared &quot;secret&quot; that should never have existed (a card number, the only thing truly needed for Settlement) and then use that to fraudulently obtain things of value. PINs don&#x27;t really impact that, they&#x27;re a defence against a much rarer crime - theft of the card. A pickpocket or burglar doesn&#x27;t know your PIN. But pickpockets do not steal millions of cards at a time.<p>If you have a card, with a PIN, and you used that card, with a PIN, at Dickey&#x27;s, there is <i>every</i> chance you&#x27;re vulnerable as a result of this anyway. Do the crooks get your PIN? Nope. But chances are your priority wasn&#x27;t keeping a four digit number secret but not losing your money.')
