Separately I’ve created (and maintain) a 200-thousand-line multi-threaded PHP application with over 4 million downloads. I’m reasonably aware of PHP’s performance characteristics.<p>I’m less up-to-date on Node, admittedly, but it also intuitively makes sense that the V8 engine will be optimised more for in-browser use than serverside use.')
