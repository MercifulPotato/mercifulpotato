We’ve never been at “let us track you for free access”, we jumped directly to “we track you and you can’t do a thing to avoid it”.<p>As despicable as Facebook’s behaviour is as far as its users are concerned, at least one could claim that there is an implicit contract (I am sure everything is explained clearly in 2pt white font on a white background on a page that’s not linked to and not indexed by Google). There is no such excuse for non-users who are tracked all the same.')
