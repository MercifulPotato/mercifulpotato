No one was discouraged against getting politically active on their own time, and no one was &quot;removed&quot;.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;rachelsandler&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;08&#x2F;60-employees-leave-coinbase-over-ceos-pledge-to-be-apolitical" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;rachelsandler&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;08&#x2F;60-emp...</a><p>As someone who has never lived in the bay area, it was kind of surreal to see employees expecting their company to get involved in amplifying their own personal political preferences. I&#x27;ve always been reasonably politically active, and had fairly liberal coworkers who, even if not politically active, at least believe similarly. I&#x27;ve always thought that work hours are for working though, and political activism has always seemed like more of an &quot;after hours&quot; activity.<p>It&#x27;s nice when a company says they&#x27;re in support of one thing or another, but it doesn&#x27;t really mean anything without human boots on the ground willing to put in the work to make positive change happen. Corporate PR press releases always seemed really insincere anyway, so I don&#x27;t get why people would be upset when some company decides that they&#x27;re not going to do them.')
