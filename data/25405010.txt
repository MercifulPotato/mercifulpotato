If you need better multi-user and multi-channel support, you can use Slack.<p>Both have an easy to use bot API and both support adding action buttons to messages that you can connect to your app&#x27;s webhooks.<p>Using a messenger, in my experience, feels more convenient than using an email client when dealing with automations. You can view messages by channel, you don&#x27;t have to deal with GMail assigning random categories to your emails, and the UI is faster.')
