If we can regularly gather data en masse, we regularly over time can identify more predictors and risk factors for poor (and good) health, and evaluate efficacy of treatments received or effects from lack of treatment.<p>Again, why pay for seatbelts (and get tickets for not having them) in vehicles if I&#x27;ve have no history of accidents, or receive preventative dental care despite no serious current oral issues, etc.<p>Why do we have heat sensors in vehicles? The vehicles I&#x27;ve driven in life have never overheated.<p>Somehow we continue to excuse doctors who practice poorly by treating by markers alone rather than the whole picture (including the patients feelings and desires), or despite contraindications for the treatment being considered.<p>Somehow the only practical solution is to allow health degradation, and then rush to identify and treat and attempt reversal.')
