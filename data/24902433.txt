The distribution, in this case, via source code, allows anyone to download that copy.<p>If the code snippet that downloaded infringing materials didn&#x27;t exist and the user had to find the parameters themselves, that&#x27;s fine. But it does exist and was included alongside a tool that makes that recording possible.<p>A better analogy would be like, if you had a video store that had a machine in the store that allowed people to make copies of a video tape using a duplicating machine. If someone wants to buy a duplicator for home use and use it in their home, that&#x27;s one thing (though there was litigation around that too), but if you go to a store and can plug in a video tape -- and the example in the store is a copy of a Disney movie -- that&#x27;s sort of what this is.<p>(Photocopy shops and libraries often have fairly strict rules about what kind of content can be photocopied, for what it&#x27;s worth. The guy at Kinkos at 3am might not care that you&#x27;re copying an entire textbook on the machine, but if you go to Office Depot in the daytime, they definitely will. Kinkos was sued and lost over a photocopy case in regards to excerpts&#x2F;packets&#x2F;anthologies for textbooks.)')
