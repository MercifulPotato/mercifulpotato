All labor is partially owned by the public.<p>Private IP makes corporations and people a lot of money.<p>That money is taxed. That&#x27;s how the government gets its share.<p>The public-private partnership allows for researchers to claim most of the value of their labor, while the government can encourage areas of research which are in the national interest through grant funding.<p>How much tax money do you think has derived from the early research on integrated circuits? A lot, right?<p>Proposing that the government can simply confiscate intellectual property if they fund it, would just result in a world where government funding is unattractive. This would give more power to corporations and billionaires to direct the course of research into their own private interests.<p>That doesn&#x27;t strike me as a win.')
