(We tried using code generators for this step, but quickly dropped them. If your language and web frameworks are sufficiently concise, adapting the generated code to your needs is likely to be more work than just writing from scratch.)<p>Then we enable an automatic tool to automatically generate an OpenAPI spec from the code. We can then compare it to the original spec to quickly see if we missed something. It&#x27;s not an automated diff, but it still saves a _ton_ of time.<p>Finally, we use code generators for the client code. Those actually work pretty well, unlike server-side code generators, probably because there&#x27;s little room for customisation in making HTTP requests.')
