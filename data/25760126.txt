Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610531911, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25745160, text='&gt;     - Why do we need complex numbers in the SE, what do they bring to the table and how does that tie in with physical intuition?<p>The complex numbers are the smallest algebraically closed field, they&#x27;re the natural place for doing algebra.<p>&gt;     - How was the equation derived, intuitively?<p>I don&#x27;t know if this how it was derived, but the way I see it it&#x27;s pretty much the &quot;square root&quot; of the standard wave equation. So if you&#x27;re trying to describe something where the solutions are mostly waves but you want to also include some other kinds of solutions, it&#x27;s a very natural thing to try.<p>&gt;     - The laplacian in there feels like it&#x27;s a &quot;diffusion&quot; term (as in the heat equation, things tend to spread and smoothen over time). Why isn&#x27;t there ever a intuitive explanation in text books about this?<p>It&#x27;s pure imaginary, so rather than a diffusion it&#x27;s a rotation (phase change). So things tend to behave as waves with a frequency proportional to their energy.<p>&gt;     - [edit]: Many book trumpet that classical mechanics is just an approximation of QM, but unlike in special relativity where speed going to zero obviously gets you back to classical mechanics, I&#x27;ve never seen a clear example of a system where the quantum behavior &quot;transitions&quot; to classical behavior as a variable (e.g size) increases or decreases.<p>You tend to recover classical behaviour as energy and momentum go to infinity (so frequency goes to infinity and wavelength goes to zero). E.g. if you look at a double-slit interference pattern, as you increase the frequency&#x2F;decrease the wavelength the classical bell curve becomes more and more visible.')
