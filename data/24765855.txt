It is an explanation of what he is looking at.<p>Do you need help interpreting the data and graph given previous conversation?\nThe height of the bars represent the number of deaths over different years and the bars are basically same height. I.e. considering all deaths, covid and actions taken (no lockdown but more distancing), no more than usual have died. Especially considering last year was a bit lower and therefore likely some old people who didnt die last year unfortunately did so this year.')
