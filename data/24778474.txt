I&#x27;m running it on Linux (unofficial client, [0]) because the original client is far worse.<p>Am I the only one that feels the necessity of replacing the client with an open source alternative that is not as bloated as the software provided by Microsoft? Is somebody working on the side to create an alternative client? I would love to contribute.<p>[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;IsmaelMartinez&#x2F;teams-for-linux')
