Item(by='volkl48', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606240367, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25198326, text='Amtrak basically is 3 different types of services, especially after PRRIA 2008 changed the funding structure.<p>- Northeast Corridor - Makes a solid operating profit (normally), run by Amtrak.<p>- State-supported corridor services - The states are basically paying the subsidy required to run the service and deciding what they want. If the state wants to upgrade the line for faster service, run more trains, etc, and they want to pay for it, Amtrak will run it. In some cases, the states (WA + CA come to mind) own or part-own the equipment being run as well. This is most other &quot;practical&quot; services (NY Empire Service, WA&#x2F;OR Cascades, etc)  and where you&#x27;re seeing most improvements&#x2F;investments.<p>- Long-distance network - They run once a day or less, they&#x27;re where most of the hours&#x2F;days late horror stories come from, they almost all lose money, federal government pays and dictates that they run it. Mostly impractical as transportation for people who have any other option for how to get somewhere. That said, the loss isn&#x27;t that big as a financial number (in part, because there&#x27;s not that much service), and it&#x27;s basically a matter of political calculus as well....lots of rural senators who sign off on Amtrak funding in substantial part because of their one or two trains a day.')
