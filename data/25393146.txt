It&#x27;s only a fundamental right in our system for <i>citizens</i>. There is no right for non-citizens. Nor have you provided any logic for why it makes sense to allow non-citizen voting.<p>It&#x27;s not a regressive policy. That would mean we go back to the method of only land owners voting or excluding classes of minorities. This is simply validating that citizens meet the minimum requirements to be good citizens, something we already do for immigrants. This also does not discriminate against any class of people - the requirements would be the same for all and are easily achievable. This would actual make the granting of citizenship <i>more</i> equitable by making the process the same for everyone instead of the current process that differentiates between those born here and those not.<p>I&#x27;m also still waiting for your answers to my previous two questions.')
