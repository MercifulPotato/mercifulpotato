Everyone keeps saying how well the highdpi stuff works, but then it really only works for a subset of things. For the rest it&#x27;s actually worse than Xorg.<p>Multiscreen is Xorg is kinda mushy so I thought maybe Wayland fixes it, but no it doesn&#x27;t.<p>Wayland is now 12 years old and everything is still half-baked.<p>It quotes an intel developer saying they don&#x27;t want to do any more stuff on Xorg. But the reality is that as much as I admire intels open source contributions. I don&#x27;t remember a time where all the features in the Intel driver actually fully worked. But sure, maybe it&#x27;s an Xorg issue, or they don&#x27;t know how to do release management.<p>Either way, Wayland doesn&#x27;t seem to solve the problems it promised to fix.')
