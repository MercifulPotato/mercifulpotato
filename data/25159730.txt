Personally, I enjoy not having to write functions like doStuff(true, true, true, false) or alternatively define types for every single boolean flag I want to have. Terseness is a non goal for Swift.<p>&gt; And on the first half of the file there are a bunch of POD struct definitions with a few init functions.<p>I don&#x27;t know how rust handles this but in swift, each POD struct has an implicit member wise constructor visible from the file it&#x27;s defined. This is for encapsulation purposes, as its signature of course changes if you add fields to the struct.')
