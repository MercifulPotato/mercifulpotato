I just don&#x27;t see the kind of abuses publicized in this incident in India -- namely deceptive &quot;bait-and-switch&quot; and skimming&#x2F;unpaid wages.  For instance, according to the report, their main grievances are that (1) the use of contractors and apprentices who make up 15% of the workforce there and are paid lower; (2) overtime and Sunday where they are required to work 1 or 2 hours more or work on holidays&#x2F;Sundays during high production season. (3) resistant to unions.<p>According to SCMP, most, or about 85%, of Wistron&#x27;s factory workers are contractors[1]. While there seems to be some discrepancy between workers wages reported and received at Samsung factories, the figure reported by Apple&#x2F;Wistron&#x27;s factory workers are as much as ~45% less -- Rs 21,000 promised vs Rs 12,000 received.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not saying that Samsung is a better corporate citizen, but it&#x27;s just that I don&#x27;t hear Samsung&#x27;s CEO parading around making grandstanding speeches about how ethically they run their business or socially, environmentally responsible they are, at least not as often.')
