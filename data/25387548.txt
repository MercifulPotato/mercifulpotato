Heavily.<p>My argument was the opposite - that if people want <i>less</i> censorship, because they don&#x27;t agree with FB banning their version of &#x27;hate speech&#x27; - then they can make their own website.<p>There are 0 common platforms that don&#x27;t censor. They all do, all day long.<p>Do you realize how much content on there is not suitable for publication? Death threats, doxxing, harassment, using the n-word to refer to black people etc.<p>No civil platform is going to allow that - and most of them have a higher bar frankly.<p>The much more challenging question has to do with &#x27;truthiness&#x27; - because if you make a post that says &#x27;XYZ stole the election, here is the &#x27;evidence&#x27; (and it&#x27;s not evidence) and it gets 300 million views - the result being that 50% of a nation firmly believe the election was &#x27;stolen&#x27; but by objective measures it clearly was not ... then you have a mass media problem.<p>The &#x27;free speechers&#x27; might want to be inclined to allow that to pass, because there&#x27;s nothing illegal about lying. But misinformation has material impact.<p>Issues of vaccination are a deep - we know that &#x27;anti vaxxers&#x27; have had huge success on Social Media leading up to COVID, and now were are facing a public health emergency where we need probably 75% of the population to get the vaccine to reach 60% herd immunity or whatever - or the pandemic won&#x27;t subside.<p>People spreading false fears and lies about vaccines - while probably totally within the scope of &#x27;free speech&#x27; is going to create some very serious problems.<p>On the other side, Twitter has announced that &#x27;deadnaming&#x27; a trans person will get you banned. Literally saying the name &#x27;Ellen Page&#x27; (because it&#x27;s now &#x27;Elliot Page&#x27;) is like hate speech. While I understand that &#x27;deadnaming&#x27; is a very rude thing to do, I don&#x27;t remotely think it&#x27;s a form of &#x27;hate speech&#x27;. The government of Quebec fined someone $30 000 for making a joke about a guy in a wheelchair. Again, really, really not nice, but should not be illegal, and probably should be allowed on Facebook or Twitter as well. That&#x27;s why we have the &#x27;unfollow&#x27; button.<p>If someone is threatening&#x2F;doxxing&#x2F;abusing Elliot Page a person in the wheelchair, probably greater steps need to be taken, but not otherwise.<p><i>All media is controlled</i>. Always.  Someone is always in charge, someone is controlling what information flows, and frankly it&#x27;s usually biased, but most &#x27;institutions&#x27; bend at least to the public good.<p>So you can say anything you want on your front lawn, and on your personal blog ... but once in the commons, different kinds of filtering will kick in.')
