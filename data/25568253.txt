Although there has never been any sort of politics or coercion involved. Sharing it is another matter, though. As others have been saying, it&#x27;s only a matter of time before various permissions get tied to vaccination status.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if multiple European authorities will cooperate regarding this. It&#x27;s a very relevant example of differing attitudes in Europe vs. the USA regarding state powers. And honestly, while some European governments can be trusted to act with ethics, some can&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;m uncertain why I&#x27;m a bit creeped out by this. Something feels wrong about de facto forcing people to do a medical procedure, regardless of its intent. While we&#x27;re not there yet, I think it is likely we will be soon. If e.g. border crossings, airplane rides or certain public gatherings <i>require</i> vaccination.<p>There might be an agrument here about the state vs. the private sector having such policies, but the question of how voluntary it really is exists in both cases. If e.g. you&#x27;re unable to do your job without vaccination, and there&#x27;s no <i>definite</i> reason, such as working with the elderly, why lack of one would make you unfit for the job... How voluntary is it, really?')
