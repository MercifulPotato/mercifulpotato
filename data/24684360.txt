Jefferson, Franklin, Madison, Hamilton, and Adams were adamant supporters of the idea of <i>private</i> property rights as a social construct. This is in contrast to the misinformation you were parroting which implied that property as a whole was intended to be protected absolutely by society - you seem to even agree that it is not, despite your original quotes implying the opposite.<p>However, <i></i><i>I&#x27;m decontextualizing</i><i></i> their quotes to support my view despite more precise context being included in the quotes I provided? The meaning of the second quote was not decontextualized and your emphasized component is addressed more precisely by &quot;except the Savage&#x27;s temporary Cabin, his Bow, his Matchcoat, and other little Acquisitions, absolutely necessary for his Subsistence&quot; which was included in my comment: your analysis does not really add additional nuance where I was supposedly lacking, you&#x27;re just repeating your original misinformation while bringing up their (related but tangential) ideas on government.<p>Even in this reply you seem not to delineate the nuance they were intending with their comments on social constructs vs natural rights - just additional context about how they intended to structure government around these ideas.<p>And next time should you want to spread misinformation without the decontextualizing the meaning of primary sources, include some links to the full text of the parroted quotes. There was certainly much more context provided in my instance that yours - which reeks of someone trying to misconstrue something for their viewpoint. Was Madison &quot;&quot;&quot;impure&quot;&quot;&quot; because he didn&#x27;t support your opinion exactly as you expected?')
