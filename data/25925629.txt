The problems begin when we worship the model instead of the reality it is meant to approximate. Any belief is a model that we are invested in and can have various levels of &quot;staying power&quot;. A Zen (or other spiritual practitioner) would tell you that strongest of those and the one we usually are most invested in is the belief of a believer...<p>The best antidote to crony or otherwise any false beliefs is deciding the benefit of uncovering of what is True is more important than any other benefit.<p>All the above of course is a belief as well, which I will gladly change given a good counter argument&#x2F;evidence :)')
