Why is computer science about the code side? Why did computer engineering end up being more on the hardware end of the spectrum?<p>Words, especially newly coined terms are pointers to meaning. That meaning is socially mediated, it is not inherent.<p>You&#x27;re saying this (adn I think the author is too) because there is a need for this group of people to look beyond titles to skillsets, and the existing titles carry linguistic baggage of the difference between science and engineering that has existed for decades.')
