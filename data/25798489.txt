Optional Chaining and Nullish Coalescing is everything that they could come up with in the last 5 years. Private fields in javascript. God please what is wrong with these people. \n2. If you look at resources, you have css-tricks as n1. Clearly there&#x27;s very little number of Software Engineers &#x2F; Computer Scientists in the JS world which doesn&#x27;t have to be because if you&#x27;re skilled you can take massive advantage of the cool prototypal programming language like JS. yet I bet 95% of the JS &quot;community&quot; hasn&#x27;t even got a clue what a prototype is. \n3. Additionally, you can see how the tools are skewed towards react&#x2F;webpack but server-side JS can be just as powerful, yet there isn&#x27;t much innovation in there. So that confirms the previous 2 points that the &quot;state&quot; of javascript, is just a homogeneous webpack&#x2F;typescript bunch of people who think the exactly same.<p>There are so many real engineers who work with proper programming languages, and they get terrified when they see the &quot;state&quot; of javascript and curse it. I&#x27;ve worked with JS for the past 5 years and I don&#x27;t blame them. There hasn&#x27;t been a professional approach to software development in the JS world, everyone&#x27;s obsessed with their tools instead of applying skill. But I&#x27;ll change it this year. If you&#x27;re a back-end engineer looking for a simple, yet very powerful solution to build your js&#x2F;widgets, you&#x27;ll get it soon. not free thank you.')
