And the WSB people are attempting to do force exactly this - basically, a distributed game of chicken at a world-wide scale with many billions of dollars at stake.<p>&gt; The company can create stock and sell it if the current holders don&#x27;t.<p>That process takes time to set up and exposes the company doing this to image and legal liability - if enough people shout &quot;market manipulation&quot; and file lawsuits, something may stick in the end. Gamestop, AMC etc. will avoid such a drastic step, I believe. Also, there&#x27;s a side risk of stochastic terrorism in that case, aka one person gambling their life savings away and now going on a &quot;revenge&quot;, which is <i>not</i> to be underestimated given how riled up the situation is.<p>(Disclosure: long AMC, NOK)')
