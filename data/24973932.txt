Ideally you’d have experience working with an IaC tool, i.e. Terraform, Ansible, CloudFormation, or SaltStack.<p>We&#x27;re also looking for frontend developers, who get to work with React and a GraphQL API. DevOps&#x27;ish interests are a plus here too, but not required.<p>Overall we have a deeply technical product, trying to build something customers love to use, and already have multiple happy and satisfied potential clients.<p>We promise interesting work, the ability to open source parts of the project which don’t give us a business advantage, as well as sane working hours.<p>If that sounds like fun to you, email me at kubam at spacelift dot io!<p>PS: Fear not, no whiteboarding!')
