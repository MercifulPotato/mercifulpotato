This is baryonic &quot;matter&quot; that is predicted by our theories but that had not been previously detected.<p>However the title is misleading, this is not the discovery of this matter even if the press release makes it look so. Previous detections of this matter had been discussed on HN before <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17953600" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17953600</a><p>What this is is an advance on our understanding of this previously undetected matter.

It was a long time ago though, I could be forgetting something important.')
