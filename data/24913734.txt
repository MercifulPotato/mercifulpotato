But you don&#x27;t really play them to determine who&#x27;s the more skilled player, you play for the experience. And even conventional games are often balanced by obscurity - Shadows over Camelot was recently &quot;broken&quot; (a reliable winning strategy was found), but plenty of people had fun playing it. An exploitable strategy was found in Caverna, but I still enjoy playing it with my family. A game like MTG even leans into that - every time new cards come out the game changes, and adapting to that is part of the game.')
