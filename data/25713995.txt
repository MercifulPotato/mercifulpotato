I&#x27;m still just sitting on the investment although many people told me to sell it, and also some people want me to ,,work again&#x27;&#x27;.<p>For me not selling it is the ,,hard work&#x27;&#x27;, as doing anything, like buying houses from the money, or ,,investing it to something sensible&#x27;&#x27;, or ,,diversifying&#x27;&#x27; would be damaging to my impact. I don&#x27;t see that people are understanding it.')
