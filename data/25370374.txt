You can analogize anything to anything - that does not make them equal. Stock trading is in no way similar to a deadly drug. At least no more than any other activity that may be addictive to a small minority - like eating, drinking coffee, playing D&amp;D, having sex or reading articles on the Internet about medieval armor making. None of it is Fentanyl.')
