Item(by='acqq', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606395998, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25218254, text='I write C++ for now almost 30 years, and always for the workloads where the cost of allocations was plainly visible, especially in the critical parts of the applications. So I have never stopped writing &quot;non idiomatic&quot; C++, at least from the point of view of typical language lawyers (and C++ attracted them a lot through the years). And I&#x27;m surely not the only one: there were different environments where it was recognized, through the times, first, that creating and destroying much objects was very bad, and later, with the growth of the C++ standard library, that even not everything in the C++ standard library should be treated the same, and that are better solutions than what&#x27;s already available, and that the third party libraries are often bringing even more potential danger.<p>Depending on the goal, one has to be very careful when choosing what one uses. The good side is, C++ kept its C features: if I&#x27;m deciding how I&#x27;ll do something, I don&#x27;t have to follow the rules of the &quot;language lawyers.&quot; I can do my work producing what is measurably efficient. And compiler can still help me avoiding some types of errors -- others can anyway be discovered only with testing (and additional tools). At the end, knowing good what one wants is the most important aspect of the whole endeavor.')
