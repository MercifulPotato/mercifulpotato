Likely I&#x27;ll have two choices for a vaccine <i>type</i>, an adenovirus type from astrazeneca, or one of the mRNA choices. Well, time to do some research and find the one that&#x27;s best for me and my family, right?<p>I tried googling a little bit about the various side effects for these vaccines to make an informed decision, and it&#x27;s <i>extremely hard</i> to find any <i>real</i> documentation about short term and long term risks with these vaccines. They&#x27;re basically scrubbed from the internet.<p>For example, the CDC page[1] for mRNA vaccines talk only of the benefits and not at all of any risks. The CDC page titled &quot;Different Covid 19 vaccines&quot; has pretty much no information at all[2].<p>One of the only places I can find good information is the University of Cambridge PHG foundation[3]. They list &quot;benefits&quot; and then &quot;important challenges&quot;, as if even muttering the word &quot;risks&quot; will scare people away.<p>It seems everyone is in a panic that people are too stupid to act in their own self interest and get a vaccine, and therefore we have to coddle them or (worse) mind-hack them into acting differently. It&#x27;s all so tiresome.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;vaccines&#x2F;covid-19&#x2F;hcp&#x2F;mrna-vaccine-basics.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;vaccines&#x2F;covid-19&#x2F;hcp&#x2F;mrna-vaccine-basic...</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;vaccines&#x2F;different-vaccines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;vaccines&#x2F;different...</a><p>3. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phgfoundation.org&#x2F;briefing&#x2F;rna-vaccines" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phgfoundation.org&#x2F;briefing&#x2F;rna-vaccines</a>')
