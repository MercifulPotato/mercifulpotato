I have ankylosing spondylitis.<p>Lasg time I heavily cut my finger while cooking, didnt feel a thing. Didnt feel anything on my first tattoo - the tattoo artist was quite surprised.<p>Now I feel a bit better with some anti IL17 medicine.<p>And yet some day the pain comes back with new, untold and unreasonable levels of pain and you can&#x27;t explain that to most people. The scale has changed and most of you will never feel that - or just once in a while. But not enough, not everyday with this consistency that shreds through your mental ability to take it and to shatter your life.<p>I would trade a night of torture against my health back.<p>And then the doctor with all his knowledge says that no - no other painkillers for AS ! Just nsaids !<p>Please donate for autoimmune disorders, they are awful')
