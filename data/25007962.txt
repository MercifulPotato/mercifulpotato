It&#x27;s a tradeoff of course, but I find that the super simple language agnostic Ctrl+N autocomplete gets me 85% of the way there, and it&#x27;s so predictable to me that I don&#x27;t usually need to even look at the menu.  I fly through it.  With IDEs I find myself having to think about it more closely, and look at subtext for context.  That&#x27;s just one example.<p>So while I don&#x27;t disagree with you necessarily, I think IDEs also (metaphorically) require tying some part of your hand behind your back.  They are just different parts.')
