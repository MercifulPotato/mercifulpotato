Perhaps <i>some</i> people <i>should</i> stop writing software, on that I fully agree . . .<p>In seriousness, we don&#x27;t have this kind of AI yet: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;7Pq-S557XQU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;7Pq-S557XQU</a><p>Therefore, IMHO, we should not stop writing software on that basis alone.<p>I agree with many points put forth, I really do, but I don&#x27;t come to the exact same conclusion. I believe we as a society shouldn&#x27;t stop making software. But I believe there needs to be a better filter. Far, far, far too much shitty, pointless software is out there. The author cites Java as a pinnacle; funny, some people have said similar things about Lisp[0].<p>Perhaps <i>some people</i> should stop writing software. Just determining who is allowed to write software or what software is allowed to be written is the hard part, and is ripe for abuse. Perhaps this discussion should be centered more on the <i>why</i> a particular piece of software is being written. But then we get into ideology, and even ideologies that are destroying the physical planet are staunchly defended when they are obviously having measurable harm on our information systems.<p>[0] - Greenspun&#x27;s Tenth Rule of Programming: any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc informally-specified bug-ridden slow implementation of half of Common Lisp. Also a quote from many moons back on slashdot: &quot;Lisp was a simple, elegant language that demonstrated that almost any language written after 1961 was unnecessary, except for demonstrations of concepts like Object-Oriented programming that could then be re-implemented into Lisp, and that any code written in older languages could be replaced with something better.&quot;')
