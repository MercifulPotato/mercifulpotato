Hence they want walls. I don&#x27;t think there is any good in demonizing them.<p>I agree with this, but there’s a bit that I don’t understand about their mindset.  If they think they’ve lost their job to an immigrant who’s willing to work harder for less money, how does less government involvement make it better?  You can’t just ban immigrants and solve the problem because the real problem is a system that allows exploitative labor practices.  By American standards those immigrant workers are also getting a bad deal and the people doing the exploiting aren’t going to stop unless someone forces them to.<p>I think the reason you see people latching on to Trump is because they think all politicians want to maintain the status quo and they think Trump will break it.  I understand the sentiment, but Trump didn’t really DO anything to help them.  All he seems to do IMO is assign blame and talk about how things should be.  It’s easy to say “we have the greatest plan” or “everyone should live in a mansion”, but it’s really hard to actually have the greatest plan and to implement it or to build everyone a mansion.<p>It’s really sad because I think middle class America is being disenfranchised and there’s a near majority of people who’ve been convinced it’s the fault of poor, “lazy moochers” rather than the wealthy capturing and hoarding all of our productivity gains over the past 40 years.<p>I think there should be common ground in wanting to get rid of the part of the government that serves the interests of the wealthy at the expense of the middle class.  It’s just a matter of understanding the sides are wealthy vs everyone else, not right vs left.')
