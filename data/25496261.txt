Four years of work experience in a given job makes someone far more valuable than four years of college preparing to start the same job.  College isn&#x27;t the only place to learn.  Art history can be studied as a hobby any time in life.<p>The idea that using four years to learn english 101 while accumulating massive debt instead of focusing on becoming valuable enough to start working in an industry you want is a destructive mentality. If typical college was much cheaper and more focused there might be more validity to it.<p>Four years of working earns money instead of bleeding it.  You meet people that actually know how to do the things you want to learn instead of guessing at them.')
