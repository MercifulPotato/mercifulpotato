People’s views on issues aren’t binary and people on the same side of the left right political divide can disagree on issues.  How many leftists disagrees with Expensify’s promotion of Joe Biden?  How many black people may not want to get into the nuances of Joe Biden’s support of the 1994 crime bill, even if they end up supporting him?  Does a woman who just went through a difficult abortion want to be around people passionately supporting abortion rights?<p>The problem with discussing politics at work is that we are not all 100% free to be there.  We depend on being at work and potentially being offended by people who we have to continue to work with for our livelihoods.<p>That being said it’s incredibly nuanced. People should be able to be unabashedly out at work.  People should be able to talk about why they support having birth control as part of their health plan.  Vulnerable and targeted populations should be able to talk about the struggle and discrimination they experience.')
