This is the hottest ever seed-stage funding environment, even in Europe. People are raising at 5m+ valuations on a slide deck alone. If you were to raise from professional venture capitalists (angels&#x2F;funds), even at this early stage you would most likely get a much better deal.<p>2. Hold on... a four-way 25% equity split? You mean you&#x27;ve built a product from scratch, and now you want to give away 75% of the value to a bunch of random guys? I wouldn&#x27;t do that.<p>3. And you don&#x27;t even get to be the CEO&#x2F;Chairman? The money guy is going to be a part-time CEO? That&#x27;s a recipe for failure.<p>Run, don&#x27;t walk. This is a terrible deal. You seem to have built something of value and you&#x27;re about to throw it away. Bootstrap your business for a couple of months -- build a product, validate there&#x27;s interest for it -- and then seek real funding.<p>Usually you can get all the intel&#x2F;network about the &quot;industry&quot; that you need by spending less than 2% equity on advisors, or by spending a couple hours with a knowledgeable  paid consultant.')
