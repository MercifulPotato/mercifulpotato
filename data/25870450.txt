So far it&#x27;s been very reliable and much faster than Nextcloud for file transfers. The current drive clients work well, but aren&#x27;t as polished as Google File Drive Stream, for example. On macOS, I hope they will transition from macfuse.fs to the new FileProvider framework soon.<p>Seafile&#x27;s file storage format has the advantage that it&#x27;s easy to revert a file or folder to some earlier revision, for example after accidentally deleting files.')
