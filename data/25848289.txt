It&#x27;s (theoretically) going to those who need it.  Tax havens, along with other tax avoidance schemes, are pretty popular with the rich, which means governments are on the lookout for them.  It&#x27;s not as easy as you think.  For example, if you&#x27;re American, leaving for a year doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot.<p>Second, countries are locked down now but even after this pandemic is over, your limit is 90 days.  If you&#x27;re from a Schengen EU country you can get a residence in Monaco and just spend your time traveling.  But again, I&#x27;ve heard that if you&#x27;ve ever paid taxes in France, for example, it might not be possible.<p>There are cruise ships that exist for this purpose.  Spending a year surrounded by those kinds of people would seem like a special sort of hell, to me, personally.<p>If you can live abroad, generally, that&#x27;s a great experience.

You end up being a different person, usually for the better.<p>Like with everything, it&#x27;s different per person.  I always say: don&#x27;t do anything just for money if you can help it -- and you usually can.')
