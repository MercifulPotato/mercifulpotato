Katzenberg is who he is because of what he did for Disney Animation. The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and Lion King.<p>Yes, he did well with dreamworks animation but that was much more a Hollywood studio focused on content than a technology product. It just happened to require a lot of good tech.<p>He’s a creative producer of long form content with a ton of Hollywood cachet that is the opposite of what upstart mobile video is today.<p>The other letters in SKG,  Spielberg and Geffen seem to know better than to wade into tech.<p>Only time software or app appears on their Wikipedia entries is a 1989 collaboration and an article about Geffen blocking public beach access.<p>I get why a mogul like Katzenberg would want to try at the app game, others have before him. But I am not surprised he’d fail to be successful with this company.<p>If anyone is interested in learning about Katzenberg and some of the insane power politics from his time at Disney, I recommend The Operator: David Geffen Builds, Buys, and Sells the New Hollywood.')
