Make a recording of this and keep details of the date and time and the name of the person you speak to.<p>If that doesn&#x27;t fix the problem you then make use of their complaints process. This is hard because they usually hide it away somewhere. But they all have one.  It&#x27;s best to do this using real letters in the post, because you might need this paperwork later. Grind through it until you get a final answer.<p>If that didn&#x27;t fix it you have a choice. For regulated industries you can go to the regulator for advice. Or you can start a legal process.<p>For the regulator send a letter using whatever weird webform they use. Make sure you mention that you&#x27;ve already exhausted the company&#x27;s own dispute resolution process. Some regulators are better than others - often you won&#x27;t get much satisfaction from regulators.<p>Send a letter before action. This describes what went wrong and what you want them to do to put it right. Give them the timeline of how you&#x27;ve tried to fix it. Give them reasonable time limits to fix it. Then issue small claims proceedings.')
