And I&#x27;d be interested to see what sales numbers you&#x27;re referring to.  Every single source I can find says retailers are receiving very low supply, and obviously selling out of that very low supply.  But selling out of low supply does not equate to high sales numbers.<p>But if you have a source that says otherwise I would love to see it.<p>P.S. I&#x27;m sure it would have great sales numbers if they could make enough of them.  I&#x27;m not suggesting the demand isn&#x27;t there.')
