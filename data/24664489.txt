The EU made a very conscious decision to tie free movement of labor to free movement of capital within its operating zone (probably the only such economic agreement of its kind).<p>The choices that the US has made are entirely favorable to capital, and entirely disfavorable to all non-professional labor. The only upside I can see (and I&#x27;m not alone in this) is cheap consumer goods that have obscured the true cost and depth of wage stagnation over 35 years.')
