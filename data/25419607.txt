Item(by='throwawaygh', descendants=None, kids=[25420746], score=None, time=1607964186, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25419528, text='<i>&gt; That&#x27;s just logistics - it comes after your philosophical understanding of the item. We don&#x27;t have to monitor things that aren&#x27;t bad. We monitor nuclear proliferation because we&#x27;ve already made a philosophical judgement on it. It came first.</i><p>But professional philosophers do not all agree on the morality of developing nuclear weapons, nor do those who do agree have particularly convincing answers about how to actually denuclearize. So I&#x27;m not exactly sure how professional philosophy is supposed to solve this problem -- they don&#x27;t agree, and even those that do offer no particularly useful solutions.<p>&quot;Software Needs Philosophers&quot; is NOT the same as &quot;software engineers should abide by a strict code of ethics that aligns with my personal ethics&quot;. The latter is simply equivalent to the observation that &quot;the world would be better if only I had perfect fiat&quot;.<p>Sans such fiat, you need politics. And, again, philosophers do philosophy. Not politics.<p>Regarding the rest of the post, the USA is run by business people and lawyers. To look at who occupies the major seats of power in government and business but then conclude otherwise requires a tremendous amount of mental gymnastics. Lots of relatively powerless people do things that are crucial to society -- factory workers, migrant farm workers, etc.<p>Do you really think better philosophy would prevent software engineers from working on ethically dubious projects? I seriously doubt it. I also doubt that putting technologists in charge of everyone would result in a wonderful utopia. But don&#x27;t blame the state of the world on technologists when business people and lawyers are the ones setting the rules and leading the teams that play by those rules.<p>Anyways, this is all quite far afield from the original thesis of my top-level post, which was simply that <i>professional</i> philosophers need STEM professionals in order to do <i>philosophy</i>, perhaps more so than STEM professionals need philosophy to do good engineering&#x2F;science.<p>Which itself is, admittedly, quite far afield from the original article :)')
