Given a secret and a name, it generates a password. You memorize that one secret, and use that and a name associated with each site to generate a password for that site.<p>This can seem like a good idea, right up until you run into a site that requires periodic password changes leading to &quot;name&quot; becoming &quot;name2&quot;, &quot;name3&quot;, ... over time, and you needing to remember which one is current.<p>That one also requires you to select the password length. Unless you find it acceptable to limit all passwords to the minimum of the maximum lengths allowed at all the sites you use, you will also need to remember for each site how long the password is.<p>Same goes for character class restrictions and requirements.<p>Password generators can work reasonable well, but generally only if they are coupled with storage to remember where you are in password rotation, password length, and character set rules for each site.')
