Item(by='jrochkind1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611867384, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25948863, text='&gt; One of the most important things to understand about margin calls is that your brokerage firm has discretion as to when you are required to increase the equity in your margin account. Some firms will attempt to contact you to tell you additional equity is required, but they&#x27;re not obligated to do so. Whether or not your firm has contacted you, they can take immediate action to increase the equity in your account if they decide the equity is too low and is not in line with the risk of your account. This means they can immediately sell out whichever securities they choose, regardless of the financial and tax obligations for you.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fidelity.com&#x2F;learning-center&#x2F;trading-investing&#x2F;trading&#x2F;avoiding-and-managing-margin-calls" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fidelity.com&#x2F;learning-center&#x2F;trading-investing&#x2F;t...</a>')
