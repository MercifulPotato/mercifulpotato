It was chuck full of typos and hand waiving, but it was pretty approachable as a short dive through how one might get from basic mechanics of ellipsoid potentials to standard model particles. It posits a view of maximum entropy among all potential paths in space-time in a Lagrangian framework determines physics. Fun to think about, but I&#x27;m not sure if anyone has explored enough to see if it really can get to some of the tricky corners of phenomenology.<p>[1] &quot;Four-dimensional understanding of quantum mechanics&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;0910.2724" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;0910.2724</a>')
