I find it kind of funny that the main requirement for IRAP funding is that you don&#x27;t actually need the money.<p>It&#x27;s extremely frustrating when you see a punt like Element AI get 20 million from the government, despite not having any product direction or seemingly any idea what to do with that money. It feels like people are rewarded for navigating the bureaucracy rather than actual startup success.')
