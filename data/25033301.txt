Again, from my own perspective - I know some friends groups where someone saying &quot;dude, Mark has a beemer! And it&#x27;s a 320d!!!&quot; Means that Mark is now as popular as a highschool cheerleader girl. He will be invited to more parties, to different employment opportunities(even if those opportunities to me and you would be probably a bit &quot;sketchy&quot;), it just makes you popular, and popular people often(but not always) have it easier in life. Again in the same group of people, if Mark wants to do &quot;business&quot; of some kind, people will automatically respect him more and care about his opinion, because clearly, a man with a BMW, an iPhone(fake, but no one knows), golden chain and signet(also fake), <i>must</i> be at least moderately successful - how else would be come to own these things if he wasn&#x27;t?<p>And no, I&#x27;m not being sarcastic, this is literally how people think.<p>And also, I think a form of this also exists in the West - I&#x27;ve heard many times that if you drive say, a Ferrari, people will approach you and literally ask &quot;hey, you&#x27;re successful - how can I get to where you are?&quot;. Sure some will be hateful, but some will be genuinely intrigued how you came into possession of this wealth and how can they replicate it.for themselves - they respect you despite knowing absolutely nothing about you, purely because you drive a fancy car. Again, not universal, but I know it happens. Same principle applies to that fake iPhone.')
