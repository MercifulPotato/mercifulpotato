And some systems have supervisory code running in a coprocessor.  At the other end, a modern OS, like the mainframe OSes of yore, did IO by talking to coprocessors that did the heavy lifting.  In the old days we called them &quot;channel controllers&quot; but now we just say that the USB chipset handles the details with the OS just orchestrating.<p>But I agree with you, as I hope my comment was clear: while it&#x27;s an interesting metaphor, K8s is a long way away from being usefully thought of as an OS.  And if it ever does reach a point where such a term would be useful it will be unrecognizable when compared to where it is today.')
