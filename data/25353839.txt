So like pages where you can define input and output cells. Then you top level sheet can invoke the &quot;function&quot; as like &quot;=myfunctionsheet{A1=5, A2=9}.N8&quot;. That way you get local scope, etc, and you can do more complex stuff because it&#x27;s very visual instead of being a mathematical function.')
