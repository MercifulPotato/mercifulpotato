Pre-covid, I did a comparison between in-store, Instacart, and Shipt. I did my normal groceries in store, then took the receipt and re-created it in Instacart and Shipt. It wasn&#x27;t just the delivery fee + tip. Shipt and Instacart both increased the prices of each individual item; sometimes by a lot. IIRC the total was about 12% more BEFORE taxes, fees and tips. On a $150 shop, it was considerable. This was a while ago and things may have changed, but its worth looking into. You don&#x27;t even need an in-store receipt; just download your store&#x27;s weekly flyer and compare those prices with Shipt&#x27;s and Instacart&#x27;s.<p>Also noteworthy: Shipt didn&#x27;t respect any of my store&#x27;s B1G1 offers. It didn&#x27;t even appear in their system while shopping (Instacart did). I actually know a Shipt shopper that was getting free stuff all the time because of this.<p>If you&#x27;re strapped for time but still want to stay safe and save money, consider stores that have curb side service like Wal-Mart. You get in store prices with no extra fees and no-contact hand off.')
