They are not chanting &quot;Jews will not replace us.&quot; If you asked them point blank, they wouldn&#x27;t dog-whistle anything about &quot;we don&#x27;t think blacks are inferior, we just want a separate but equal society&quot;.<p>But their actions are aligned with white supremacy. Their obsession with the Confederacy and their generals is an expression of white supremacy. They are not interested in heritage. They are interested in perpetuating old power imbalances that keep &quot;the poorest white man above the best black man&quot;.<p>&gt; Regarding bleach, &quot;So it&#x27;d be interesting to check that&quot; is a suggestion for medical research, not a recommendation for what patients should do now.<p>That&#x27;s now how supporters received it.<p>In both cases you give him the benefit of the doubt. His <i>intentions</i> are not to support white supremacy. his <i>intentions</i> are not to have his supporters drink bleach.<p>However he has a job, which is colloquially described as &quot;the most powerful man in the world&quot;. That has responsibility. His throwaway lines embolden white supremacists who ABSOLUTELY seized on &quot;fine people on both sides&quot; just as much as the left did. His supporters do hear his guidance to the medial community and jump to the next conclusion.')
