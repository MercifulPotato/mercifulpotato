They were packing a dozen people in a 3 bedroom apartment in a bad area of town. You then see how they are treated by their companies at work, and it disgusts me.<p>This is why you can&#x27;t have second-class citizens like this. They are terrified to go for help if they even know how. It&#x27;s even worse for undocumented workers. At least they can quit though. H1B workers are tied to their sponsors, which has to stop.')
