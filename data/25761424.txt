XPS13 uses Intel 11th Gen. MBP13 uses Intel 10th Gen. X1CG9 will use Intel 11th Gen.<p>There&#x27;s a major lag time where the business community doesn&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s happening in the engineering side of the semiconductor industry. Research analysts and traders pay more attention to operating profit and other high-inertia metrics than the technology itself.<p>That&#x27;s why AMD was trading $2 in 2016, and that&#x27;s why INTC stock is down over 20% since January 2020 despite the massive shift to WFH and teleconferencing.<p>I personally think both companies are amazing. Their innovations have fostered inordinate amounts of human advancement relative to the profit that they have generated.<p>Your point seems to be that Intel&#x27;s market dominance has not recently been marked by any watershed moments. I have to say, it&#x27;s a fair point and I&#x27;m not in disagreement, but I also suggest that Intel is responsible for more than &quot;tiny advancements.&quot;<p>In the larger context, we should be careful not to punish Intel for biting off more than it could chew. 10nm was a disaster, and 7nm is going to be late to the party. In my view, thermal waste is a major problem even for Intel&#x27;s newest consumer-oriented x86 processors. However, Intel has thrown big money at every possible path to advancement for the sector as a whole. Computer vision for self-driving cars? They bought Mobileye. FPGAs? They bought Altera. Sure, many of their endeavors end in failure or spinoff, but there&#x27;s certainly something special about a company that is willing to design AND fabricate any form of semiconductor technology that appears on the horizon.')
