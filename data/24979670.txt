I totally get the frustration, but when I learnt the DFSG, this was the biggest lesson for me.  Freedom means freedom to anyone.  Restricting your code to, say, non-military use, isn&#x27;t compliant with the DFSG.\nSo, now that we have perceived hostile code hosters, do we really want to go there? &quot;You&#x27;re not going to push my stuff to x.y.z, or I will make you feel the pain.&quot;')
