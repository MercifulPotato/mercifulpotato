People say &quot;just go and make another platform&quot; but Google literally tried and failed to make their own (Google+).  If they cant do it who really can?  Its not happening or it will take centuries&#x2F;enormous resources to gain traction and compete.  So we are left with an oligopoly that is censoring in lockstep and that&#x27;s an issue for all sides because eventually its not them, its you, with time (amongst other issues).  I think the platforms are a huge threat to democracy personally and I hope the new rules are meaningful and not just a knee jerk makeshift reaction.')
