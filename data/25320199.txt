Brown generates twice the $&#x2F;ftÂ² in revenue as private landlords in the area, but pays only a fraction of their running costs (Brown pays no income tax on this revenue, nor property tax on its dorms). There&#x27;s nothing wrong with students commuting, <i>per se</i>, but for a University that&#x27;s come to rely on residency fees, ditching the residency requirement is no easy financial feat.')
