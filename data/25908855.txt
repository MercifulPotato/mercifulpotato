I learned to code and got hired off LinkedIn thanks to my Github projects and fire in the belly. Sometimes my love of coding feels like a drug addiction :)<p>I&#x27;ve learned a lot from my first job but I get the sense that there are some things I&#x27;m missing out on with no formal CS education. I also work a lot and don&#x27;t have a ton of free time.<p>Are there any recommendations that y&#x27;all might have for getting up to speed, or leveling up as an engineer? I work mostly in Python and Bash these days, but am open to any resources you think would be good.<p>edit: added better title')
