Science is not supposed to be a cult where the Scientists are the high priests that shall not be doubted.  Science is a method to find (or at least get closer to) the truth, and for that we must always doubt what we have.  That&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to work.  In the end only the truth can survive criticism and misguided reasoning.  We  must not only welcome, but encourage doubt, criticism, and disagreements.  In fact, we should be very suspicious when all Scientist agree (you know, when the Science has been &quot;settled&quot;).  As for motives and integrity, the word of a Scientist has become too much of a powerful political force these days.  No wonder that among the serious and dedicated Scientists there are also a very vocal group of political activists with Science degrees.  So, yes.  As a person who loves his personal and indvidual freedom, I will reserve the right to doubt Science and Scientists all the time.')
