Do any of your nodes have a public IP address? If so then I explained exactly how they can be accessed. If all of your nodes are private and behind some kind of firewall or virtual network then yes you&#x27;ll have to make a public bridge, otherwise just point the DNS to your nodes. You can use a Deployment with the standard ports 80&#x2F;443 to avoid any port translation too.<p>That&#x27;s all the clouds do anyway, they just run a bunch of load balancers that move external traffic to the nodes of your K8S cluster with the port specified in the Ingress&#x2F;Service and K8S takes it from there. There&#x27;s no shortcut, the traffic has to be routed somehow so if you don&#x27;t use a managed service then you have to do it yourself. It&#x27;s got nothing to do with &quot;developers keep it enterprisey&quot;.<p>Here&#x27;s an answer I wrote about skipping GKE&#x27;s cloud LB to accomplish the same thing: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;54297777&#x2F;173322" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;54297777&#x2F;173322</a><p>Also try using Ambassador as a reverse proxy&#x2F;ingress&#x2F;LB. It uses Envoy and is much faster and more configurable. You can set it to use the host network on your nodes and skip the K8S cluster mapping: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getambassador.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getambassador.io&#x2F;</a>')
