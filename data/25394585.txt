I have the 8-core i9 16&quot; Pro and I prefer the Air in every way for development. The keyboard is better (no touchbar), it doesn&#x27;t get as hot, the battery life is better, it&#x27;s faster, and it cost 1&#x2F;4 as much ($999 vs about $4k). I bought the 16&quot; in February, only 10 months ago.<p>What a leap.')
