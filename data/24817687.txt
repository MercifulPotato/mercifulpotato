But the set of applications where:<p>* The Nano&#x27;s 0.5 TFLOP of CUDA is insufficient; AND<p>* Google&#x27;s 4 TOP of DL performance IS sufficient; BUT<p>* You&#x27;re not bottlenecked by things like USB2; AND<p>* You can&#x27;t afford a higher-end Jetson with dedicated ML<p>Well, let me just say I can&#x27;t think of one on things I&#x27;ve actually done. I could come up with ones in abstract, but it seems like Google is aiming for 1% of the market at best. With 1% of the market, NVidia will win on community, tooling, R&amp;D budget for v2, etc., so in the end, that means 0.1% of the market.<p>And that&#x27;s if the two businesses were starting on even footing. They&#x27;re not. Google has a horrible reputation for leaving customers high-and-dry, while NVidia&#x27;s reputation is pretty good for B2B. Even if the boards were equivalent, most would pick NVidia based on that alone. Plus, NVidia is coming in with established users; they have a first-comer advantaged.<p>Getting late to the game with a generally inferior product with backing from a less reliable company? It seems like a loser to me.')
