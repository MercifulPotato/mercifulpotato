I can look out accross the street and see a number of people who have done this in their tiny apartments. If I cared about people being able to see the room behind my WFH set up I would do it too. Thankfully for me it just points at the wall I use as a projector screen so there&#x27;s nothing to see. Plus my team seems to have just given up on video anyway.')
