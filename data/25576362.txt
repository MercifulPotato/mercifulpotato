The 9 other threads are then doing nothing while they wait.<p>Of course, you could implement a more robust algorithm for scheduling threads, but it sounds like an implementation of FiberScheduler would make the best use of a single thread&#x27;s resources (and you could scale that to multiple threads as needed using something like a shared queue). Since fibers are lighter-weight, it&#x27;s presumably more efficient to run parallel IO operations in a single thread, and only use more threads if your work requires it.')
