Should the EU stop all deals with the biggest exporting economy of the world, home of one in 5 human beings, because it disagrees with its policies?<p>Yes. Sanctions can be very effective in curbing China&#x27;s outsize influence worldwide and cut their economy by half. Just embargo them as long as they persecute Uighurs and HKers.<p>Unfortunately that can&#x27;t be done, since American and European companies were too stupid to give away their schematics and let the Chinese copy them outright, while also simultaneously reducing their indigenous production capabilities in important sectors such as rare earths mining and refining, solar manufacturing and extraction technologies.')
