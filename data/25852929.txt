I enjoy film photography because it imposes a constraint on the creative process and makes you consciously pause before shooting. I find that without such constraints it&#x27;s too easy to take a million garbage photos. For mundane everyday use I have an iPhone.<p>If I were to get something else it&#x27;d be a medium format camera with similar build quality and reliability.')
