What are the &quot;questions of ergonomics&quot; you&#x27;re thinking of here? Choosing the negative form of a goal whenever you have to prove something non-constructively seems even <i>easier</i> ergonomically than, e.g. adding LEM as an axiom.  You basically don&#x27;t have to change your proof methods as long as the statement you&#x27;re proving is of the appropriate form.')
