When is the official time for work to start or end?  Maybe 7, 8, or 9?  Office work seems to end around 5 or 6.  School starts sometime between 6 and 10 AM depending on grade and locale.<p>My point is that there already is no standard wake&#x2F;sleep schedule.  Noon may be the tightest bound on when people all want to be doing the same thing, but importantly that happens <i>after everyone is already awake</i> so picking DST or ST is arbitrary.<p>People who want sunset or sunrise to occur earlier or later in the day have a conflict coordinating with other people in their life, not a problem with official timezones.  Maybe pick your job and school district based on start times instead.<p>I&#x27;m happy to jump on the first bandwagon that gets rid of seasonal changes to timezones.')
