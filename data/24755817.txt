The windows nt kernel is better by design (dont crucify me for this, but it really is), but this decision will come from another perspective - &quot;we need to pay large sums of money to kernel dev. depart and we are having huge problems with HR to deliver what is essentially free and we can pick higher management bonuses for eliminiting that cost. It is not a technical question - it is $ question and linux wins here. I dont like it, I prefer freebsd but this is the sad fact:<p>Management bonuses &gt; any technical knowlidge or reason<p>The whole IT progress was destroyed by this fact, from OSes to the cloud, from irc to fb, from cats videos to having live cat. From optimal protocols for the task to http. From native gui to html&#x2F;js abomination,... from laundry machines that live 20 years to the ones that get broken in few years... It gets destroyed when complete analphabets drive the decision about progress trough their vision of getting more money.<p>At the end you will be running windows. With its look and feel, but with linux as kernel.<p>(I know that I am not great for anyone here, feel free to downvote me, but do take time to think about it. Consumerism destroyed the computer science and it is not getting any better)')
