That could mean only two people disliked your post, and that kind of small buffer greatly disadvantages unpopular opinions.  I would think a post that is really problematic would probably amass at least net 10 downvotes.<p>Do you take volume of total votes into consideration, e.g., do you treat a post with 2 downvotes the same as a post with 10 upvotes and 12 downvotes?  I would think a post with a sizable number of upvotes would be more likely to be an unpopular opinion rather than a really problematic post.  Maybe the threshold for greying could be lowered for posts with a sizable number of upvotes.')
