When is the last time states had to handle disaster relief on this scale with little to no assistance from the Federal government? A strong central force is crucial to handling crises like this, ours just blew it.<p>You can have input from local officials on setting up locations and timelines for clinics, but the 12 people making 20$&#x2F;hr working in my local health department shouldnt have to deal with some of the most complex logistics the country has ever seen.<p>This is absolutely the best time to mobilize the massive military logistics chain in order to distribute and use vaccines as fast as possible.<p>If states are truly doing a great job (not many are), they can always decline assistance, but it isnt even being offered in the first place at this point.<p>&gt; At some point politicians need to be held accountable. Passing the buck for everything is not a great answer.<p>Are you not just passing the blame onto local politicians and off of the federal level ones that hold most of the power?')
