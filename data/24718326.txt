Consider how when celebs get involved in scandals their PR isn&#x27;t always to admit fault.<p>Its the same thing of &quot;repeat a lie enough..&quot;; even if the defence itself is not accepted, it can still soften the blow of the scandal by resisting the death-blow of unanimous condemnation. Humans are sometimes herd creatures, visible support is a universal defence in itself, even if only to threaten&#x2F;dissuade attackers.<p>In other words, this is how political theatre works.')
