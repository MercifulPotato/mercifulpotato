The total aid amounts to well over 10-30k easily.<p>I know people that take advantage of it and honestly I can’t believe we all foot the tax bill for it. It’s free money, people will find a way to get it, the same way corporations find tax havens.<p>The incentives aren’t right, and the loopholes too many.
