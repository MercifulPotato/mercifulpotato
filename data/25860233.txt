But cats also sleep about 16 hours a day, so it is hard to determine at what point being mellow shifts into their typical nap time.<p>I don’t think there’s a long-term tolerance that builds up. I get the sense it is short-acting. I’ve read once a cat has catnip, giving them more in a 15-20 minute window is pointless because they’ve already been “activated” by it. They need to come down from the initial dose first.<p>My cats’ vet has suggested to use catnip to encourage activity (they’re a big chunky and need some exercise).')
