You agree to that when you install it.<p>Apple can&#x27;t practically enforce that against you, an individual using a mac in your home.  But then again you&#x27;re probably not reselling your mac&#x27;s functionality directly for profit to others.  They for sure can seek to enforce it with AWS or others who sell it commercially.  It&#x27;s the reselling of their software and functionality for profit that is covered by the terms of the agreement.')
