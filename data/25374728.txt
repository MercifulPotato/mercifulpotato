One tiny way I&#x27;ve found around it is to focus on coding things that will help me in the future - ie: some very small feature of the project I&#x27;m working on - make it as portable and good as possible, so that when I next need to do something similar it&#x27;s 99% done. What works about this is a) the focus on a small thing helps distract me from the big thing that my brain is feeling overwhelmed &#x2F; uninspired by, and b) every time I achieve one of these small things, it gives me a little lift. Plus as a bonus I have loads of helpful code written for future projects.<p>The only other thing I can suggest is find a creative outlet that you enjoy, and isn&#x27;t the thing you do for your job. I went back to making music for the same reason. I&#x27;m not very good at it, but then being good at it isn&#x27;t the goal - just the satisfaction of creating.')
