A current generation OLED (which will do 120hz) is superior to a CRT.<p>Even still, on many of those a good LCD has long been better than a good CRT. Color accuracy, for example. CRTs required constant fiddling &amp; calibration to stay good at that, whereas a quality factory calibrated LCD will be much better in an &quot;out of the box&quot; or typical usage. Not really sure what you&#x27;re calling &quot;image quality&quot; but it&#x27;s hard to imagine that going any way but solidly in a modern high-end LCDs camp, which are brighter, wider color gamuts, higher resolution, and higher pixel densities than CRTs ever had.<p>&gt; there must be a market for high end screens for gamers.<p>There is, which is why we have high resolution, high refresh rate, and adaptive vsync IPS monitors a plenty now. They come in all sorts of shapes &amp; sizes, in resolutions &amp; dimensions CRTs could only dream about.')
