As I understand if you repeal Section 230, and these companies become regulated as publishers, they will be required to censor ALL content. So how would repealing Section 230 protect free speech? It seems it would in fact do the exact opposite: result in EXTREME censorship on all these platforms. Furthermore, politicians would have direct control over what these platforms publish in form of laws governing publishers. So now we would have literal government censorship on private platforms. Perhaps this is what they actually want?<p>Am I missing something?')
