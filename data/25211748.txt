Or buy 2x2TB NVMe (motherboards with 2x m.2 are common these days).<p>Sure the 5600x&#x2F;5700x isn&#x27;t as fast in throughput, but how often do you max more then 6&#x2F;8 cores?  Per core performance is near identical and with more memory bandwidth per core you run into less bottlenecks.<p>I bet over a few years more people would notice double the disk than the missing extra cores.')
