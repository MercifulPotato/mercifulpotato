Deno running the entire environment is a negative for me, at least for now.<p>Nobody forces you to use the deno dev tools. You can still run eslint, prettier and closurescript, if that&#x27;s your sort of thing.<p>Personally, I prefer deno lint over eslint and deno fmt over prettier since they are much faster. I&#x27;m even using dprint (which is a standalone project for code formatting, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dprint.dev&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dprint.dev&#x2F;</a>) in Node projects.<p>Similarly, before deno test, I created my own deno testing tool. Now I use deno test instead since it&#x27;s just better - not because anyone&#x27;s forcing me to use it.<p>The integrated dev tools are a convenience feature. I hope that&#x27;s kinda obvious.')
