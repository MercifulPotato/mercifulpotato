The former pay for the latter.<p>&gt; A lucky startup can pull off a successful trial for a few hundred million (i.e. Sofosbuvir), if not tens of millions for an orphan drug.<p>Sure, one can always hit the lottery. But unlike startups (where the N-independent-failures model works OK), drugs don&#x27;t make it to market without a deep-pocketed company willing to set huge piles of money on fire in the final phases.<p>Your other comment below does a good job of explaining why trials are insanely expensive...which is why lucky startups almost never run their own. So you&#x27;re dependent on a system where deep-pocketed mega-corporations need to exist simply to get the drugs on the market, and <i>they</i> are reliant on massive returns to take the risk in the first place.')
