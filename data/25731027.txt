If they&#x27;re not planning to sell for a couple of years when they invested then it doesn&#x27;t matter that it dropped &gt;20% in the last 48 hours.<p>I&#x27;ve been through this rodeo twice before, I&#x27;ve been checking the price regularly since at least 2014. I haven&#x27;t lost any money because I didn&#x27;t sell during downturns (although it&#x27;s been tempting to do so for sure).<p>It&#x27;s hard to say for sure if this is just shaking out weak hands and institutions will jump back in and it will start climbing again, or if we&#x27;re at the start of a 2+ year constant downtrend again. I really hope it&#x27;s not that, that was annoying, and we just climbed out of that in the past year, but we&#x27;ll see (although it allowed me to keep buying a increasingly larger slivers of bitcoin every month all the way down to its low of $3500 last year).<p>It&#x27;s fine that this article exists for the people that could use the reminder, I just don&#x27;t like how the headline was worded. It made me think for a moment that there was going to be a major crackdown and we were definitely heading into a major drop in prices (way beyond what it has so far).')
