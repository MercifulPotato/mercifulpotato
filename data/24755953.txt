Item(by='Chris2048', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602519136, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24750002, text='OP doesn&#x27;t even say it was the case, and that &quot;I highly doubt thatâ€™s what actually happened&quot; - but that this was <i>the impression he got from the movie</i>. Hence it&#x27;s neither aspersion nor &quot;god of the gaps&quot; - unless theists commonly argue that they also highly doubt god exists?<p>So, Can I downvote you for assuming the worst about OP? Or for casting aspersion about HN and its &quot;-ism&quot;s?')
