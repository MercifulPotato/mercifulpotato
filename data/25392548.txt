The pandemic handling our government has implemented is very untransparent.<p>They made it very unclear which vaccine they ordered from. There were some statements that indicated the Russian one. I would gladly take any of the &quot;Western&quot; vaccines, but I do not really trust that the Russian or the Chinese ones work at all. I would rather choose medicine based on science, not politics.<p>We have a website where we can pre-apply for vaccination by filling a form with personal information (gov id, social security number etc). Nobody knows what the purpose of this registration is, because supposedly we already have a vaccination plan that would allow anyone to be vaccinated. A few days ago it turned out that the data entered to this website is handled by a shady company that supplied software for the last election and has close ties to the governing party.<p>The government has already been caught lying about many covid-realted issues, if my choices are &quot;blindly doing what they tell&quot; or not doing anything, then a &quot;no&quot; answer might be the lesser bad choice.')
