RBI of this type is specifically to mitigate vulnerabilities in the browser engine, the type of 0-day where you just click on the wrong thing and get owned. While these are a real threat, they are nowhere near 70%, more like less than 1% (and see my other comment about how the 70% number is just made up).<p>&gt; [2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.akamai.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;01&#x2F;a-death-match-of-domain-gen" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.akamai.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;01&#x2F;a-death-match-of-domain-gen</a>...<p>Domain generation algorithms are used for malware command and control, not in the browser&#x2F;phishing stage of an attack.
