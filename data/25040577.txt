When I tried the official demo, the thing that I immediately noticed is the jagged scrolling movement of the screen when I move around.<p>I understand the pixel art style (I love it btw) and that the map is actually discrete pieces of tiles instead of fluid&#x2F;pixels, but it&#x27;s really visually jarring as I move around. If I move by pressing arrow keys once at a time that&#x27;s fine, or if I even hold down arrow in one direction that&#x27;s still okay, but if I move by quickly changing directions (e.g. moving diagonally) it almost hurts my head to look at the screen while my avatar is walking.')
