I got puzzled expressions when I mentioned it.<p>Furthermore, one of them knew about it and quietly advised me not to do it because it is an extremely harsh and clumsy with scraping of glue and other such steps involved, some of which may inadvertently cause other damage, and so they recommended I just deal with it and upgrade eventually but they were happy to attempt it.<p>So my choices were to either live with the stains or risk the replacement based on what I was told. I use it with the stains till this day.')
