Thanks for asking.<p>&gt; They don&#x27;t have to pay anything<p>Yes, but they endured reputational damage, and companies hypothetically lying about it now could reasonably expect to have to pay something in future enforcements, which is what I was trying to get at in my previous comment. Reading it now, it was really sloppily worded by lumping together those things, but I&#x27;ll leave it as it was so that the rest of this thread makes sense.<p>&gt; they don&#x27;t have to actually fulfill their prior claims<p>Given that they don&#x27;t claim it any more, I&#x27;m not sure that they could be forced to start doing it -- put another way, not having E2E encryption is not a crime as long as you don&#x27;t claim to have it.')
