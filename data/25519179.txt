It seems that Robinhood would be better for someone not investing a lot of money. If I execute a trade for $1,000,000 a small difference in stock price makes a difference and its better to pay a straight $5.00 commission with the lowest price possible. However, if I buy a single share for $50, that $5 commission is now substantial. This seems like a very clever way to compete and offer a better service to poorer people.<p>Unless I&#x27;m missing something the boomer either didn&#x27;t catch that, or chose not to acknowledge it. As a millennial I&#x27;ll assume his best intentions and that this isn&#x27;t an attack on a successful company business model that he&#x27;s receiving a kickback for to de-legitimizing Robinhood.')
