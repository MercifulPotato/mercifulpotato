The process works like this:<p>1. I create diagrams&#x2F;other visuals from what seem to be important concepts from the book before reading it and <i>without</i> knowing what they are about.<p>2. I will use Anki to try and draw those visuals from memory. At this point, I learn the intimate details of the visual but have the constant question in my mind,&quot;what is this thing?&quot;. I try to time starting this process 3-5 days before reading the book.<p>3. I read the book as I normally would, and when I hit a discussion about whatever visual I memorized my brain immediately goes &quot;Oh! That&#x27;s what that thing was!&quot;. Those euroka moments are actually great tools for remembering concepts and with the SR system I also have a visual to tie the concept too.<p>Other things I&#x27;ve used SRS for:<p>- Internalizing life principles. Anytime I feel &quot;Oh thats important principle, I don&#x27;t want to forget it&quot;. Sometimes its been from a book, othertimes its useful feedback from coworkers, or just anything thats a principle I want to hvae top of mind.<p>- Associating faces with names. When joining a new company and meeting dozens of new people, using Anki to remember peoples names works well.')
