It&#x27;s probably 2020 table stakes for launching a hosting platform, ticking the &quot;up and running in 5 minutes&quot; requirement checkbox. (See also: Digital Ocean&#x27;s recently launched App Platform, same situation.)<p>But many of us walked away from GitHub and embraced GitLab in the last few years, probably a big wave in 2018. As far as I can tell, there&#x27;s not a publicly documented non-GitHub way to interact with Cloudflare Pages. Cloudflare folks: if you can&#x27;t launch with a full GitLab integration that&#x27;s understandable, but I&#x27;m tired of sitting these things out because they can only launch in simple mode. For my part, I&#x27;d rather fuss around with .gitlab-ci.yml now than start a project on my old GitHub account and deal with unknown migration pains later.')
