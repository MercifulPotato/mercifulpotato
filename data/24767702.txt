You&#x27;ll get to practice it with every sentence you ever use.<p>Conversely, you&#x27;ll only use &#x27;<i>ballon</i>&#x27; when you take about un ballon. I hope that&#x27;s frequently enough for you to remember the word &amp; its gender. At least it looks like the word &#x27;<i>ball</i>&#x27;, something you don&#x27;t get with Vietnamese&#x27;s &#x27;<i>bóng</i>&#x27; or Chinese&#x27;s &#x27;球[1]&#x27;<p>And you&#x27;ll still get funny looks if you say you&#x27;re getting ready to go to the New Year&#x27;s ballon, because substitutions fail with homonyms in both directions. And you&#x27;ll have to learn and relearn about ten thousand of these substitutions.<p>[1]maybe?')
