But we are talking here about exactly that, i.e. if you can intercept traffic in any other way somewhere close to a website or its nameservers - you can get a valid certificate and use it to MITM its visitors anywhere in the world where you can intercept traffic too. And in case of using big cloud providers for validation to &quot;improve&quot; security, this still likely pushes traffic from all of them through some big IX before reaching a datacenter with a website and at worst only adds a couple more points an attacker has to intercept traffic at to get the certificate.<p>This is where all that centralization is really bad for security. It basically makes https a protection only against low effort MITM of last mile ISPs.')
