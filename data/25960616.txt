Item(by='SllX', descendants=None, kids=[25960749], score=None, time=1611945013, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25959856, text='I was curious about its ratings in the App Store, so I took a look.<p>There are 2.4M ratings total, I don’t know how many there were prior to today or yesterday, but right now there are 2.4M.<p>If you sort by most recent, there are loads of 1 star written reviews.<p>You don’t need to write a review to leave a rating, you just need to “own” the app, meaning you have to hit Get on the free app. This acts like a $0 purchase. I stopped the download immediately after.<p>Now here is where my commentary becomes useless. I tried leaving a 1 star just to see if anything would happen. Nothing, so I start looking around for a way to undo because I don’t actually use Robinhood. Couldn’t find one before I made my way back to the page just to see the star rating I gave was removed.<p>Now one of two things could have happened, and the first is fairly likely.<p>1. By taking the actions I took in the sequence and time that I took them, Apple could have registered my rating as an attempt to bomb the score. That’s fine, I wasn’t intending to leave it.<p>2. Apple could also be monitoring scores and reviews.<p>Actually there’s a third possibility:<p>3. There could be a delay between when reviews are written and when they affect the score, so if a review was left yesterday, it might not act as a weight on the score until next Tuesday or whatever the delay is. I’m not familiar enough with the App Store to say.<p>It does look like there were a lot more reviews in the App Store than the Google Play Store to begin with, so it would take more negative reviews to significantly affect it.<p>Mostly I’m just curious why we’re seeing this in the Google Play Store but are not hearing anything about what is going on in the Google Play Store. Perhaps someone else with a history with the App could follow up on this that has actually used the App or is motivated to re-rate it to see if their rating goes through.')
