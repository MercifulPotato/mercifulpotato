For criminals, blackmailing is part of their M.O.<p>There&#x27;s an international market of brokers for zero days, but this specific vulnerability is less in demand.<p>I doubt that the information found at Facebook legal team could be used by nation-states (but perhaps I am not thinking creatively enough). I can imagine it being used as leverage by a nefarious nation-state, or informational by anti-trust dept. but it would be thrown out of court (therefore only viable for parallel construction). In the case of leverage the nefarious nation-state would feel the wrath of Facebook and&#x2F;or US government. A country where Facebook has near zero adoption <i>and</i> already on bad terms with USA while within power vacuum, perhaps. Russia has Vkontakte, North Korea and China don&#x27;t use Facebook either.<p>Regarding PGP, you don&#x27;t have to use your real name. You can use an alias. You can sign each other&#x27;s keys at a crypto party.')
