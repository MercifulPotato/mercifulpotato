Item(by='pc86', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606750305, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25254237, text='$2.5 million is enough for a six-figure salary in retirement, without touching the principle. Assuming there is post-tax money in there, you&#x27;re going to have a much lower effective tax rate than you did while working. And if you&#x27;re retired you probably have much lower expenses than you did before (most retired folks aren&#x27;t making a big mortgage payment even if they&#x27;re young).<p>Unless you want to live an extravagant lifestyle (nothing wrong with that) $2.5 million is more than enough to retire in all but the most expensive US cities. And let&#x27;s remember this is liquid, so real estate doesn&#x27;t really count in that. One or two properties you&#x27;re not living in could easily float that extravagant lifestyle for years.')
