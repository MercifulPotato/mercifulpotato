Wikipedia is articles that any one can edit, and when there is such an extreme ideological bias in the Humanities and Social Sciences, there is always the risk that the articles begin to reflect ideological conceptions of these terms, that don&#x27;t match the words that the terms contain, like &quot;institutional&quot; and &quot;racism&quot;.<p>&gt;&gt;I&#x27;m curious to know about what year you think, approximately, that systemic racism against black Americans ceased?<p>I think the end of Jim Crow laws was the end of most institutional racism, with some remnants of it existing in the social contract that was quickly dismantled in the 1970s, as society took a severe stance against anti-black discrimination.<p>But now we have institutional sexism and racism in favor of groups that are deemed to be disadvantaged, like women and black Americans.<p>&gt;&gt;You have just decided to entirely redefine the accepted definition of systemic&#x2F;institutional racism so suit your argument.<p>Accepted by who? I don&#x27;t accept the socialists&#x27; definition of &quot;slavery&quot; or &quot;expropriation of surplus value&quot;, to include workers earning a wage, and investors earning a profit, respectively, either.')
