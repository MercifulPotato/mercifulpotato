It came in a bang with slavery and has been going away, in fits and starts ever since.<p>How do you get from there to:<p>&gt; racism creeps into all of our institutions. Instead of thinking of racism as a yes&#x2F;no binary with intention, I think it&#x27;s more useful to think of it as something like &quot;fairness.&quot;<p>All? I think you should consider &quot;I&#x27;m not racist, there are much better reasons to hate people.&quot; Even if you find unfairness somewhere, and even if it&#x27;s intentional, how do you know a priori that it&#x27;s because of skin color?<p>&gt; It&#x27;s like starting the game of Monopoly when a bunch of the players have had dozens of turns of head start.<p>Right. American Descendants of Slavery (ADoS) really have a shitty position. Worse off from the start and sometimes still facing the racism.<p>&gt; So this can&#x27;t all fall on tech companies, of course, but as major pillars of modern society, they bear some responsibility of fixing the problems that persist.<p>If it&#x27;s our society&#x27;s responsibility to fight slavery, have you hunted a pimp? Or do you expect your tax dollars to fund the police who do such things? I expect Google to not try to make things worse, but I&#x27;m fine if all the good they do comes from taxes.')
