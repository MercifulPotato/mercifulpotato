We can’t guarantee 100% because our bodies are complex, but I wouldn’t characterize it as “significant increased risk” for people under (or over) 40.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;nrd.2017.243&#x2F;tables&#x2F;2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;nrd.2017.243&#x2F;tables&#x2F;2</a>')
