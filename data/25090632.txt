Companies at the lower levels of the hiearchy are centrally planned entities with managers assigning tasks to employees instead of using a free market to distribute them within the organization. At the middle layer, the free market links these centrally planned companies and force them to compete. It&#x27;s an open question whether having a centrally planned top layer to handle national economic strategy and steer market forces is better than letting the free market handle that as well.')
