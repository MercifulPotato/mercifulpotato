The analogy that is often used is fish upstream from a waterfall. At some point the current of the stream becomes so strong that the fish can no longer escape from the waterfall, but actually at that point nothing happens from the point of view of the fish, since it is carried by the current, you need a global view to notice that the fish is doomed past that point.<p>And similar in case of a black hole, you are falling through the event horizon and nothing happens, it is just that calculating what you need to do to escape, you note that it is too late.<p>To expand a bit on the molecule situation, when one of the atoms is inside the black hole, then parts of its electric field are still outside and influence the other atom. To have the other atom escape to infinity, you would need to break the part of the bond &quot;still outside&quot; and the gravity of the black hole.')
