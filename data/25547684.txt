On the technical side, as soon as some code needs to &#x27;dlopen&#x27; something (e.g. a plugin or a system driver), you can run into trouble due to multiple instances of glibc or other dependencies running together.<p>But if none of those are a requirement for your use case (or you have workarounds), I agree that statically linked binaries can be a nicer solution than Docker.')
