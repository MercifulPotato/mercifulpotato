Though our daily jabs have gone from appallingly low to only embarrassingly low, we are actually going to go backwards now that it turns out the “strategic reserve” Trump promised to release last week is a phantom.<p>Being under-40 with no kids or seniors in my home, easily working from home, I expect to get vax sometime this summer.  This is fine, I’m happy to let seniors, medical and frontline workers get it first.  This of course includes teachers so they can open schools for good come August.<p>Glad to see it’s been opened to most of these prioritized people now, and it is intelligent to have a mix of appointments &amp; walk-ins to take out the excess inventory daily.<p>That said, the whole distribution is a shitshow.  And this started even before it moved beyond initial phase of medical workers getting it at work from their employers.  I know a lot of non-patient facing people in medical or medical-adjacent jobs who got it well before most nurses, EMTs, etc got it.  It seems if you are in management or have a PHD you could jump all the way to the front.. of course.')
