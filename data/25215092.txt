Especially for lower altitude &#x2F; shorter hops? It honestly makes no sense.<p>In a prop or turboprop application, the energy is sued to turn a prop, and waste energy (exhaust gases) don&#x27;t really play a role in energy generation.<p>In a jet, you accelerate the air in the core. Is it even REMOTELY efficient to accelerate air this way using electric power?<p>Boeing didn&#x27;t put that much money into them, if their tech was as amazing as they describe, why not go ahead and get other funders?<p>Finally, the go on about their patents. I took a quick look. Pretty trash - generalized system design patents.<p>&quot;System and methods for implementing regional air transit network using hybrid-electric aircraft&quot;<p>&quot;Systems, apparatuses, and methods for overcoming the disadvantages of current air transportation systems that might be used for regional travel by providing a more cost effective and convenient regional air transport system.&quot;<p>This is hardly the type of stuff that gives you a big breakthrough.')
