It didn&#x27;t matter much because I spent most of my time at work, and had access to a bunch of things in the city and the Bay on weekends. I also ate most of my meals for free at work, and I didn&#x27;t own a car.<p>Now, in IL, I have my own 1BR apartment, a car, and spend a lot more on groceries and takeout.<p>Also, I&#x27;m getting a fundamentally different experience. I have more space, but I&#x27;d love to go back to city living when the pandemic ends.')
