Just be cordial, preempt the typical IT Support stuff they always ask, DO NOT say its intermittent (initially, to the front line CSR; if given a chance to expand the issue after escalation, then add that bit), and get technical ASAP (it doesn&#x27;t hurt to throw in some parallel industry jargon). Basically, build a case where even the information you&#x27;re giving them is beyond a first-line CSR playbook, and they have to escalate.<p>&quot;Hi there; I&#x27;ve been observing some erroneous TCP packet bit flipping on HTTP requests which route through one of AT&amp;T&#x27;s data center in Oakland. I&#x27;ve tried restarting my computer, I&#x27;m seeing the same thing on my phone, and I actually swapped my router out for a spare one I have, but its still an issue.&quot;<p>(that last sentence exhausts <i>literally</i> every playbook a front-line CSR has. it sounds so easy, right? there are four variables in any front-line CSR diagnostic equation: their network, your router, wifi&#x2F;ethernet, and the endpoint. you just crossed off three of the four variables in one sentence).<p>(Wait, a data center in Oakland? How do you know this? You can tracert a bad request and geolocate the first IP outside your network, but, lets be realistic: You don&#x27;t. You&#x27;re fronting; demonstrating knowledge that a front-line CSR can&#x27;t disprove. You may think this is misleading to whoever this gets escalated to, but it isn&#x27;t; their tools are FAR more advanced than yours, and they&#x27;re used to 99% of customers being incorrect idiots, so they&#x27;re going to be validating and reconfirming every word you say anyway.)<p>Ron&#x27;s Parks &amp; Rec example above is crass. But here&#x27;s the magic bit: frontline CSRs generally look for an excuse to escalate, you just need to give them enough CYA to check their job as done, and the higher tier CSRs&#x2F;network engineers will love you for actually knowing what you&#x27;re talking about. Its a win-win; be cordial, be forceful, strut what you know.')
