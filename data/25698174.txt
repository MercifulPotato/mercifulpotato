An E to K mutation is changing the surface charge from negative to positive so it shouldn&#x27;t be surprising that it reduces antibody&#x27;s ability to recognize, assuming it&#x27;s in the most recognized pocket.  Hopefully this will be a relatively easy cut and paste into the existing vaccine cassette if it turns out to spread really widely.')
