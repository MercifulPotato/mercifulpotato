Item(by='newacct583', descendants=None, kids=[25115903], score=None, time=1605553630, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25114340, text='&gt;  No one would even care if the Hunter Biden related emails passed DKIM except for the widespread allegation that they were fake, and no one still cares because conversation about them passing DKIM is widely suppressed (including on HN, unfortunately, where a post about it was immediately flagged).<p>Uh... no RFC822 headers from the Hunter Biden emails were ever released, certainly none with a passing DKIM signature.  I read that Post article with a microscope. This never happened.<p>And in fact, the transparent truth that these appeared to LACK the trivially producible authentication layer is one of the big reasons that the more right-leaning entities among the tech community stayed far away from this subject.')
