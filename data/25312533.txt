Respectfully, what is wrong with a study that might show a synergistic or deleterious effect involving taking these compounds together compared to them taken individually?  Since a study like this is a QA of sorts for scientific truths shouldn&#x27;t tests involve as many permutations as possible?  Also, it&#x27;s not like they could corner the market even if this study went viral. I can buy each of these compounds in bulk and cheaply at my local Costco.')
