I honestly get the impression you&#x27;re caught up in some narrative that has very little substantiation, just a fear that macOS will become iOS.<p>&gt; I rather watch their actions.<p>And which actions are those? Gatekeeper and the Apple T2 are not enough to make the Mac not an &quot;open computing platform&quot;, let alone something close to iOS. I&#x27;d argue they&#x27;re not even on the way there, just like Windows SmartScreen isn&#x27;t on the way there. And note that the T2 is even gone from Apple Silicon Macs.<p>Apple deserves all the added scrutiny in this area because of their attitude on iOS [1]. But there&#x27;s absolutely no reason to believe that Apple&#x27;s direction towards locking down Macs is either &quot;clear&quot; or &quot;inevitable&quot; in my view.<p>[1]: There are some identifiable explanations as to why iOS is so locked down whereas the Mac isn&#x27;t, but let&#x27;s talk about that some other time.')
