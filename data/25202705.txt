Without 8h of sleep sitting in front of a computer for a few hours would give me a massive headache.<p>2) Moving my computer from in front of a window to a different location.<p>3) Using blue light filtering glasses.<p>Now I almost never get a headache, I think 1 and 2 were the biggest improvements.  I&#x27;ve also started experimenting with having fake green plants around my monitors.')
