Most religious dogma is more sensible. There exist vast swathes of &quot;savings&quot; that are not significant (including, IMO, watching SD video). It is in fact counterproductive if it means that people sacrifice in a variety of ways to fulfill their mythic &quot;every bit of savings is significant&quot; duties while taking part in behaviors that contribute to climate change. (And this ignores the central dogma that all climate change is necessarily destructive and will have no benefits to humanity or Earth whatsoever.)<p>My favorite nonsense recommendation in the article is to run all computing in the cloud - I guess the Google donation is paying off[1]. ARM is listed as another donor, so if Apple joins, expect buying M1 Macs to be yet another way to help the planet! Sarcasm aside, we could consider things like nuclear energy, traveling by train (it&#x27;s quite affordable and enjoyable), &quot;trillion tree initiatives,&quot; and a host of other programs that might actually make an impact assuming climate change seriously concerns you (it&#x27;s only of mild concern to me).<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;royalsociety.org&#x2F;about-us&#x2F;funding-finances&#x2F;support-us&#x2F;our-donors&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;royalsociety.org&#x2F;about-us&#x2F;funding-finances&#x2F;support-u...</a>')
