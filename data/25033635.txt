I worked a bit (and am currently writing part of my PhD about it) on declarative Programming on EV3.<p>You can find Prolog-bindings provided by me on the EV3Dev website, which are about as fast as the JS bindings and make for quite a fun weekend, combining declarative planning and plan execution in the same language. You can find my paper on that here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dx.doi.org&#x2F;10.18420&#x2F;inf2019_ws41" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dx.doi.org&#x2F;10.18420&#x2F;inf2019_ws41</a><p>And if you have a lot of spare time on your hand, you can get both HUGS (a Haskell implementation) and PureScript (using the JS bindings) running on the EV3. What you should not do, is try to run clojure, as the runtime is too massive. You can try other JVM languages, but I would suggest you don&#x27;t.')
