How can we <i>own</i> this? and they devise strategies.<p>I think the strategy is seamless integration for us AND screwed up standards that make it hard for others to seamlessly integrate.  Maybe it&#x27;s a proprietary standard, maybe it&#x27;s a &quot;security&quot; certificate, maybe it&#x27;s a &quot;quality gate&quot;, maybe it&#x27;s dark patterns, maybe it&#x27;s a hard login requirement (that&#x27;s harder with GDPR).<p>You should read the halloween documents.<p>The end result is -- you the customer will get fewer, more expensive, less private choices in the end.')
