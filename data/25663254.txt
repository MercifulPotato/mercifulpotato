If they worked as you say, there would be no reason to have hearings for the majority of rape&#x2F;abuse accusations. The courts are there to have a formal process which would determine whether provided evidence and witnesses have weight and elements of truth, and whether additional investigations are required. it would also be required to establish whether anyone who signed the affidavits had to be prosecuted for perjury, because the just process would have to <i>determine</i> and <i>prosecute</i> the lying side (as that side is not known beforehand). None of that took place, there were no hearings, and the filings were dismissed without the required due process.')
