Is it really because of police, or do they help? How will some radical restructuring reduce it?<p>There are many questions here.<p>Preventative policing, while effective in social democratic countries with low inequality like the Nordics, isn&#x27;t on the table when we see violent crime that mirrors African and South American countries. Disincentivizing homicide in a country rife with inequality and materialism is a harder task than we imagine.<p>There are ~900,000 police officers in the United States, and 240 million 911 calls, and 50 million police-public interactions. That&#x27;s an average of over 50 interactions per day for a police officer.')
