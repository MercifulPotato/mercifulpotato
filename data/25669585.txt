You can plug in one monitor via HDMI and another one via the docking station though, which is not optimal but still ok. Anyway, as others have pointed out, using a single large external monitor is usually better than using several, and most of my colleagues already switched to 42 inch curved widescreen monitors recently. I&#x27;m still using two 3k&#x2F;4k external monitors as they&#x27;re still in good working condition, next time I upgrade I&#x27;ll get a single large monitor as well though.')
