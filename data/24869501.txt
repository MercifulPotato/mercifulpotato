It&#x27;s pretty easy to find a fan curve for a small fan (e.g. under 12 inch diameter) but very very few will also have an available turbine map.  As far as I know, there is no way to convert a fan curve to a turbine curve (I&#x27;d be very interested if such a thing existed!).<p>Does anyone have any help or suggestions?')
