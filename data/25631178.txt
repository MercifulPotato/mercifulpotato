I don&#x27;t think we can treat public employee unions and private employee unions the same.<p>Public schools, police departments, etc., are usually &quot;political&quot; entities, run by elected officials such as school boards and city councils. I would say there&#x27;s no guarantee whatsoever in these cases that the leadership of those entities are even interested in compensating&#x2F;promoting the &quot;top performers&quot; among teachers, or police. There&#x27;s no direct financial incentive. The &quot;outcomes&quot; of a school — student education — don&#x27;t provide much of a feedback mechanism to the financial performance or governance of the school. Likewise with police departments, etc. If anything, poor performance by these public entities may lead to calls for increased funding, standing the incentives on their heads.<p>Part of the reason for public employee unions is to protect the members specifically from <i>political</i> interference. The alternative is not necessarily &quot;merit&quot; based compensation but rather political favoritism and retribution.')
