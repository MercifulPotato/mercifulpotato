I did it with floating numbers, pure mathematical implementation. When it came to usability was something like 1 frame every 30 seconds for resolution of 640x480 with 256 colors only.<p>The problem with ray tracing isn&#x27;t writing one, the problem is its usability, to get the most realistic AND fast enough. Mine was very realistic for that resolution but the snail FPS was something unbearable. Despite my best efforts at the time, hardware was not ready. I remember the talk between us (prof. assistant, basically a master student and rest of wanna be programmers) and we&#x27;re so sure it would take maximum 5 years for ray tracing and photo-realism to become every day commodity. We were wrong only by 20 years. Good times.')
