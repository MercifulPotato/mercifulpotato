Smoking in public in large metropolitan areas should have laws around it. Especially in built up areas. Walk a mile in New York City these days and you will constantly be in range of Pot or Cigarette smoke. Either passing by people smoking or being stuck behind them walking. It&#x27;s a civility issue but unfortunately by and large we can&#x27;t trust people to be civil in our cities unlike large metropolitan areas like Tokyo for example, therefore we need some quality of life laws around this and more importantly the expectation that they will be consistently enforced. There are plenty of laws in big cities such as New York that are never enforced invalidating the existence of the law in the first place.')
