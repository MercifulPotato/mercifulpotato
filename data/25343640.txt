Not China-hard, but pretty hard. Cases surged again.<p>In Australia, hard lockdown looks like the following:<p>1. International borders closed to all non-citizens, permanent residents or essential travelers<p>2. State borders closed per 1<p>3. City &quot;borders&quot; closed per 1 — happened in Melbourne<p>4. You can&#x27;t leave your home for any reason not deemed essential<p>5. If you do leave your home for an essential reason, you must stay within 5km of your home, or have a job&#x2F;emergency&#x2F;essential imperative to travel further away<p>All of the above is enforced by police officers.<p>In Melbourne, they even closed off a high-risk, high density building for a while, just because the health authorities deemed it a risk.<p>Could you expand more on what these European &quot;hard lockdowns&quot; mean? Because at no point during this pandemic has any of the above happened in any American state or city, at least not to my knowledge.<p>The Australian federal government also enacted Job Keeper to suspend work hours yet keep working people employed, and took additional steps to ensure as many people as possible could remain on lockdown without a source of income. This was as important as — if not more important than — the hard lockdown enforcement measures themselves.')
