I made an account and followed a few that I thought might be interesting but it just didn&#x27;t really engage or entice me enough to make it a daily habit.<p>I&#x27;m not at all fannish though and I think Twitter appeals most to those who are. It gives them a connection to celebrities and that&#x27;s a very deep seated aspect of our cultures.<p>I&#x27;m more into learning and we can learn something from everyone so I spend my internet time more on long form media that dives deeper into subjects that interest me. Sometimes a tweet I&#x27;ve seen will lead me there so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worthless, but most of those I see are referenced somewhere other than Twitter.')
