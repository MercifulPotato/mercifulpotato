So this place is the source glacier for...well about a 100 million people of so.<p>Nobody has kind of died. And yes, we do have a semblance of a free press in India. Which is fairly strange - 12 researchers working on nuclear devices in the past decades dying is not a big deal. But how come not even a few thousand died downstream? Plus this place is religiously significant. Given Indian religious beliefs are around dunking your children in holy waters...it&#x27;s very surprising really.<p>The other &quot;not so popular&quot; theory is that India has an active base towards China positioned here. Which is a diplomatic shitfest because of Nepal, Pakistan, China..etc. However most of India&#x27;s strategic advantage is about geography - we have higher peaks on our side overlooking roads. So it&#x27;s kinda advantageous to have nobody poking here.<p>Nanda Devi could be the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Tower gas leak&quot; of India&#x27;s nuclear deterrence towards China.<p>India has a pretty awesome mountain climbing culture and a huge tourism industry (fueled by the best weed in the world).<p>You can climb everywhere...except Nanda Devi.')
