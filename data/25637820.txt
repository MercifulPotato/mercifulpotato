(I.e. changing a process or labeling may be more effective than a control and punish model) It&#x27;s also very difficult to communicate for free societies on why a restuarant or bar ban still needs to be in place when the black market succeeds [underground raves&#x2F;parties etc]. (Sigh &quot;studies that claim most of the transmission in a household vs bars&quot; (well where did that household interact with a different household... ))')
