If the majority decides something they can always do it, worst case by creating a new organisation which they then all join.<p>The US is very racist and such attitudes persist even in the labour movement. Historically, US reformist unions used to exclude non-citizens from membership, which is why the IWW started organising all workers including immigrants. The result of this democratic struggle is that US unions now organise all workers.<p>You&#x27;re not losing anything by joining a union. It&#x27;s possible that you may not gain as much as you&#x27;d like because of bigotry where you work, but that can also be fought against.')
