Is that the source of your grievance? I think that developments like women&#x27;s suffrage and racial desegration should be included in discussions of &quot;progress studies&quot;, whether or not they led to improvements in measurable metrics. Collison neglects to include examples of this type in his article, but it&#x27;s not clear to me that he considers them unworthy of study.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;we-need-new-science-progress&#x2F;594946&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;we-need-...</a>')
