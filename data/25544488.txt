They would save money on support staff&#x2F;legal fees&#x2F;etc. The could charge a couple of pounds&#x2F;dollars&#x2F;euros more per ticket and probably cover all compensation costs. We know that “no win no fee” claims services exist. They know they exist. They know that we know that they exist, so what the fuck are we all doing wasting our time here?&quot;<p>The answer is simple: You automate the things that earn you money. You don&#x27;t automate the things that make you pay money to others - perhaps with the exception of your supply chain or other resources you need to maintain business continuity.<p>The author is thinking like an engineer, not like a businessperson. Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with thinking like an engineer where it&#x27;s called for, but airlines are profit-seeking businesses.')
