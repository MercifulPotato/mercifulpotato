They simply lack the knowledge, which is unforgivable when you realize that the original sources are just a &quot;google search&quot; away.<p>For people interested in the Original sources, i highly recommend starting with; <i>Roots of Yoga by James Mallinson and Mark Singleton</i> to know the primary sources and then actually reading them.')
