As I recall, a scientific TI calculator was still about $200 in 1975 dollars.<p>But calculators were dropping quickly in price and a couple of years later I was able to pick up a discontinued HP-55 which I used for years until I picked up an HP-41CV with financial pac for going off to business school. (I probably had one of the horizontal format HP RPN calculators somewhere in there too.)')
