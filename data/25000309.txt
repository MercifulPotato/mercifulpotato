Useful for some things I suppose.<p>My wife drove rural postal delivery for years. The <i>longest</i> routes would be 150 miles, most of the routes were less than 50 miles. This was rural, low density delivery areas. In cities and suburban areas, routes are even smaller, more like 10-20 miles round trip.<p>A contractor might have a job site 20 miles from home and make 3 trips to various suppliers during the day.<p>Seems like that&#x27;s the sort of service these trucks are targeting and they will have plenty of range for that. Longer haul routes would require a different type of vehicle, but most companies that do both long and short haul have dedicated long haul vehicles regardless.<p>&gt; Wonder what the cost will be for a battery that can haul a 44 tonne truck for 180 miles.<p>Big trucks are expensive to maintain. While the initial expense might be higher, ongoing maintenance is much lower and reliability higher. Not having to deal with vehicle downtime is a big issue when that vehicle brings your profits in.')
