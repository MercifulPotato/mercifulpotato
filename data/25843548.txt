Experience was great. SUPER easy. Took me about 2 months. Cost $300, filled out one form online, and sent a copy of my USA 2020 tax returns showing my income. Super, super easy.<p>If you&#x27;re even KIND OF thinking about going I&#x27;d just apply today. You have nothing to lose and don&#x27;t have to go if you don&#x27;t want to.
