Your love of the subject comes across clearly, and it&#x27;s a nice explanation!<p>My background is in algebra; these things excite me as well, but it&#x27;s quite challenging to share the drama, beauty, and excitement with non-mathematicians.<p>Regarding the cyclic groups, they don&#x27;t need to be constructed from a &quot;trick&quot; any more than the other finite groups. Think about the rotational symmetries of an n-sided polygon!<p>A lot of these finite simple groups have similar visualizations as symmetries of some geometric object. One of the tantalizing things about the monster group is that we haven&#x27;t found anything like that for it. We don&#x27;t know <i>of what</i> the monster group is a symmetry group.')
