From identifying a dead mouse my cat apparently hunted to creating a makeshift talking LCD display by pointing your phone at it.  There are OCR apps of course, but they dont always work in some situations.  It is a total relief to have a pair of human eyes in your pocket available at every time of the day.<p>Thanks Be My Eyes, you changed my life!')
