If you make it fair and count the code that goes into the frameworks specifically for it, it&#x27;s still tens of megabytes at the most. There is a huge part of it running server-side to support it, of course, but it is difficult to say that it is not a complicated app. Or consider the Mail app? It needs to deal with IMAP, and has custom flows for a number of named mail services (Gmail, Yahoo, etc.), and then it has to have special code to handle all the edge cases of &quot;what happens if the user deletes a message here but it didn&#x27;t sync, or Google sends us 503s sometimes if we do this, orâ€¦&quot; You can make arguments that maybe it is slightly less or more complex than Uber, but it is just a couple dozen megabytes and not hundreds.')
