My code has been used in high end audio software.  Sometimes it&#x27;s faster and easier to write the simple for loop that draws lines or splines on a canvas than to incorporate a &quot;full-featured&quot; charting library that has to support every kind of chart, plot, graph, network, 2D, 3D, etc. imaginable.  A charting library that takes an array and makes lines is not that hard.<p>And yet I still had a dev get pissed off by my offer to help with a charting problem.  &quot;Yeah, but was it D3?&quot;<p>I&#x27;m generally an advocate for buy-before-build in software, but I don&#x27;t trust the kind of dev who won&#x27;t even acknowledge that the easy part of a problem is easy (or that true experience isn&#x27;t framework specific).')
