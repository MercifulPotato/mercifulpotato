Now you are bringing things like political assassinations. Can you go the part where almost we talk about how almost 50 million people starved to death due to the ideology of the Great Leader, or how the country has 300 million excess men because of the one-child policy which led to sex-selective abortions and plain brutal infanticide?<p>Second, you seem to be the under the impression that I defend the things done by the US State. I do not. It is <i>precisely</i> because I do not like the US State that I do not want to give it more power than it already has. In fact, it has been quite a bit amusing to see your cognitive dissonance of talking about all the horrible things that the US Government has done and <i>yet</i> you want me and everyone else to &quot;Trust the State&quot; with social media. It&#x27;s almost as amusing as the cognitive dissonance you show when you say you want to take things out of control of &quot;private entities&quot; and put them to the control of the state that you so clearly (and justifiably) loathe.<p>&gt; Do you really believe you can go from 700 to 115 by hiding the deaths?<p>Take just the million Uighur in &quot;re-education centers&quot; and call the thing by what it really is - a concentration camp - and suddenly this number already goes up quite a bit.<p>However, what you are failing to understand is that there is no point in comparing a country that has established (however flawed) democratic institutions with a country whose authoritarian rulers have unchecked powers. The numbers are meaningless if the masses are subjected to tyranny and indoctrinated to never question the authority of the leaders.')
