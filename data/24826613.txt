All these &quot;realistic examples&quot; make me wonder whether people did not normalized huge amount anxiety for themselves. Or they are made up.<p>This seems really committed to pigeonholing the motivation for this functionally. All I can say is my partner and I use it all the time. We have irregular schedules and are not always checking our phones to respond to the other&#x27;s &quot;hey where are you text.&quot; We use Apple&#x27;s version of this which is VERY clear that someone else can see your location, and requires explicit opt-in. The use case is convenience, not anxiety.')
