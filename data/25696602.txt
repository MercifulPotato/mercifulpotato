Gandhi who undertook to criticize all sorts of things about Hinduness didn’t deserve assassination for it nor did he cause Partition. How about separate drinking glasses all over the country for separate religions in railway stations, how about Hindus handing out water in Lahore supposedly to Brahmins but keeping a dirty nasty cup aside for any Muslims who happen to ask, how about my 8 year old grandfather in Karnataka being treated as if his touch defiled neighbor’s tin and brass pots like untouchable because he was Muslim. Those are very much issues with Hinduness and I suspect you need to have a little powwow with your parents.')
