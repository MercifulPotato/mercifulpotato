Instead in some cases they were even regarded as wise as a result of this. Think about alchemy for example something like that could only have been tried by very very mentally ill people and if they werenâ€™t so at the beginning their handling of mercury sure made them crazy after a while. Modern society easily ditched the mentally ill. However they can give a lot and if that makes a couple companies in the internet mad so be it.\nI recommend you watch the following video on Foucault <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?list=PLwtCVTcEu-8-3urANmn5Tm6coTfl1NdQO&amp;v=BBJTeNTZtGU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?list=PLwtCVTcEu-8-3urANmn5Tm6coT...</a> it is an over simplification but it will help you understand.\nI also recommend reading the anti edipous from Delouse and Guatari to get an insight in how the current system hides and destroys the mentally ill in spite of how much they have given to history and humanity. The truth is without mentally ill a people society would be different and thus anti mentally ill sentiment of modernity is but a depravity as non neurotypical variations are for memes(social culture and the academia for example) what mutation is for genes')
