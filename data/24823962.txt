Under normal conditions this would be their parent, which is desirable as it keeps them out of trouble.<p>(As an amusing aside, a similar imprinting is used in some security mechanisms, where the device allows the first use without authentication, but then trusts the first user to be the privileged user).<p>The important bit is that this is not &quot;training&quot;, but a single stimulus that they need to figure out who mom is. But it turns out that mom can be also abstract things, like &quot;similarity&quot;.<p>Now if you compare this to a neural net, you can&#x27;t get it to recognise anything after showing just 1 image, let alone the notion of similarity.')
