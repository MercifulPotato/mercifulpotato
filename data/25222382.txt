I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s only at v0.5, but I don&#x27;t quite understand what that means since the Read Me&#x27;s stats suggest it&#x27;s production-ready. If that&#x27;s true, the version number seems like a disconnect. (Or am I the only one for whom pre-1.0 version numbers suggest &quot;for development only&quot;?)')
