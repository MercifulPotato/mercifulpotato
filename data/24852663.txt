My point is that it&#x27;s their right to do so if that&#x27;s their wont, not that it would necessarily be the best business decision.<p>&gt; If one advertises &quot;absolutely free email hosting&quot; but means &quot;we will read your email, analyze your behavior and sell your information to those who can effectively hound you with ads&quot;, people should push back. And &quot;it isn&#x27;t free to run&quot; is not a valid defense.<p>Show me a single freemium service anywhere that advertises itself using such exaggerated language.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why people complain about <i>free services</i> like this.  You can&#x27;t eat your cake and have it too.  Choose if you want the ad-supported free service or the paid service and then quit complaining about the choice you&#x27;ve made.  You&#x27;re not ever gonna get an ad-free free service that offers all the same features as the paid service.  That would be corporate malpractice of the highest order; they&#x27;d have $0 revenue!')
