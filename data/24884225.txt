For example, see Russia, which has been under exactly those kinds of targeted sanctions and yet which continues to openly murder opponents of the Putin regime across the globe.<p>Russia is almost a semi-hermit State unlike China. Russia was never an &quot;export powerhouse&quot;. China is. Russia doesn&#x27;t have the kind of population China has. Russian population is less than half of USA. Sanctions don&#x27;t have a major impact on Russia as US was never its major trading partner. But sanctions on China will be a huge blow as US was China&#x27;s main trading partner. You can&#x27;t compare Russia and China. They are not the same.')
