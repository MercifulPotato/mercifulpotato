Ditto for people taking care of senior citizens.<p>There is a fundamental efficiency to rideshare.  And it will continue to get better.  As I said in the prior comment -- we already have self-driving cars.  I push a button on my phone and somebody drives me somewhere.<p>For now, the self-driving tech is just a big distraction that makes things fantastically more expensive and unreliable.  (This could change, but again I see that as 20-30 years in the future.  I don&#x27;t price it in for sure)<p>Also, drivers seem to love Uber and Lyft for the work flexibility, at least when I talked to many of them in 2015-2018.  Those jobs were really valuable to a diverse set of people.<p>-----<p>I&#x27;ve heard the viewpoints you quoted in the media, but I don&#x27;t think they are painting a balanced picture.  It seems like a message that somebody wants to get out there, not a neutral viewpoint.<p>Of course the whole idea that Uber would reduce their costs with self-driving was also a fantasy meant to sell stock.  I don&#x27;t think the market ever priced that in.  It&#x27;s clear now that this area was a disaster, and the stock didn&#x27;t crash because of that.<p>I think Uber&#x2F;Lyft will be creating value for 10-20 years to come.  People in SF seem to be bearish on them, but I think that&#x27;s sort of provincial view.  We might be on to the next big thing, but valuable tech is rare, and it takes years&#x2F;decades for valuable technology to be adopted everywhere that it makes sense.<p>People are still buying iPhones for the first time, even though it was released in 2007.  It&#x27;s hard for me to imagine, but there must be people using Google for the first time too in 2020.')
