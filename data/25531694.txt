Pehaps you pay a &quot;very expensive&quot; teacher $50 and make a &quot;large time commitment&quot; of 30 minutes for a single lesson. (Btw-- what&#x27;s the going rate for even moving an upright these days? I&#x27;d bet it&#x27;s more than $50)<p>The teacher asks you where you&#x27;ll be practicing, and on what type of instrument. Suppose it&#x27;s the old upright. As a professional responsibility, that teacher is going to find out <i>exactly</i> what shape that piano is in, if it&#x27;s in tune, if it has a broken soundboard, etc. Based on what the teacher finds out, they will give you valuable feedback on whether it&#x27;s even <i>worth it</i> for you to devote learning on that instrument (perhaps it&#x27;s woefully out of tune[1], which you wouldn&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re just a beginner). As well as whether it&#x27;s worth paying a piano tuner to have a look at the instrument. Tuning costs more than $50, so on that detail alone you may have gotten your money&#x27;s worth.<p>Now imagine that instead of an old dusty upright, you have access to a grand piano practice room at a college with a well-funded music dept. You again pay your astronomical fee of $50 for the long duration of 30 full minutes. But the teacher spends the last 10 minutes of your lesson talking about dusty old broken uprights, and all the problems you&#x27;d run into <i>if</i> you happened to be playing on that instead of accessing the college&#x27;s practice rooms.<p>As a beginner, that last ten minutes would clearly be a waste of your time, right?<p>Now extend that waste of time over, say, 1&#x2F;3 of the total time you attempt to learn the piano.<p>That is pretty much the problem you run into with online&#x2F;self-study. Either the guide gives you so much material that&#x27;s irrelevant to your context that it slows your pace of learning, or-- probably worse-- it leaves out crucial details that you need to know in order to progress efficiently.<p>Finding a human mentor through a web of trust avoids those problems.<p>In fact, it gets worse over time for the online&#x2F;self-study because you&#x27;re entirely dependent upon your <i>own</i> opinion of your progress, which-- as a beginner-- is guaranteed to be flawed. This is an easy route to burn out. Perhaps you feel your progress stunted, whereas a professional could tell you that you&#x27;ve simply underestimated the increase of difficulty of a particular skill. Not to mention setting reasonable expectations for progress in the first place, and a hundred other considerations that a mentor can immediately discover and provide feedback for.<p>[1] More exponential explosion-- there are various ways in which a piano may be out of tune. A teacher can tell you whether that happens to be imperfect yet usable, or whether it renders it completely worthless as a practice instrument.<p>Edit: clarification')
