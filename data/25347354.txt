My airpods pro switch devices intuitively, but when I pair them to my windows laptop with bluetooth things don’t work so smoothly anymore and they are just as cumbersome as any bluetooth headset. I think the core problem of bluetooth headsets is the bluetooth spec itself makes it impossible to deliver a good UX.<p>This isn’t just apple either. My logitech mouse is paired to my laptop via their dongle, and to my desktop via bluetooth. On the laptop the connection is rock-solid, on the desktop it loses the connection once or twice a day for a few seconds.<p>I’m convinced the problem is bluetooth itself, not the device makers.')
