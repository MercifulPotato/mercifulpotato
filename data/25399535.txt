So, if you were the lover, would you open the right door as your princess demanded, or would you open the left door?<p>My own answer is that it is best to open the left door. If your princess is true you will show that it is better to face death today rather than go a lifetime without her affections. On the other hand, if she happens to be a vain jealous creature, what best act of defiance to foil her murderous intent that to live long and prosper with somebody else.')
