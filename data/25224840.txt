So the premise is fundamentally wrong.<p>Are there non-type ways to improve program safety? Maybe. But since we all understand types and types can cover all the cases we&#x27;ve managed to find so far, I&#x27;d stick to types unless and until we can demonstrate a need for something else. Yes, handing out fundamentally unsafe APIs like array-access-by-index is a bad idea - but trying to put types on those APIs is the easiest way to see that they&#x27;re the wrong abstraction. If you insist that your APIs be type-safe, you&#x27;ll naturally be guided away from APIs like get-at-index and towards APIs like map &#x2F; fold &#x2F; find.')
