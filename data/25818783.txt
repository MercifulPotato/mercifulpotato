We do this thing (vaccination) we expect will work, on some fraction of a test population, and then we wait. Some other tricks could work, in theory but they&#x27;re often unethical and unlike this experiment they aren&#x27;t a direct model of the real world. &quot;Does it actually work?&quot; is an incontrovertible test.<p>But it should take <i>years</i> to do this, because obviously hardly anybody is going to get some horrible deadly infectious disease right?<p>Unless, as happened in most of the world, you have exponential pandemic case growth as measures to prevent spread are half-arsed or just not implemented at all.<p>Then it turns out - good news - that&#x27;s a great environment for proving your vaccine works quickly. Shame about all the dead people though.')
