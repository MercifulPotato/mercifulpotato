The two are inextricably linked.<p>In the case of second-order logic, although it seems like we&#x27;re getting a precise, single semantic model, in fact all we&#x27;ve done is push the ambiguity to the metatheory which we use to interpret the semantics of second-order logic.<p>For example, there&#x27;s the infamous &quot;CH statement&quot; of second-order logic, which has a model if and only if the Continuum Hypothesis holds in the metatheory. I mean sure that&#x27;s precision if you believe that the Continuum Hypothesis has an absolute truth value (that is you can confidently say &quot;yes CH is true&#x2F;false in reality&quot;) but that&#x27;s really just the same thing to me at the end of the day as choosing a particular model for a first-order theory and saying &quot;yes that model is the one true model&quot; (which I don&#x27;t really philosophically agree with in the first place since I&#x27;m usually not a strong Platonist).<p>Even the choice to use full semantics instead of Henkin semantics (an example of what is essentially multi-sorted FOL as @pron refers to) is an ambiguous choice one must make in deciding second-order semantics.')
