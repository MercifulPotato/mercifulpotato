Funding: UK has 3-4x total deal volume compared to Germany [1]. I&#x27;ve heard somebody say UK (London) is comparable to NY, which is a 2nd tier US VC market.<p>2. Tax incentives: Early-stage investors get significant tax reliefs under the UK government&#x27;s Enterprise Investment Scheme (S)EIS. They made a big difference when fundraising, almost every startup I know has used EIS. I see nothing of the sort in Germany.<p>3. Policy backing: My understanding is that around 2010 the startup sector was seen as a strategic investment both by UK and local governments, in particular the City of London. Which lead to the establishment of Tech City (&#x27;Silicon roundabout&#x27;) as we know it today. In Germany, on the other hand, most politicians aren&#x27;t aware of how bad the current state is. Of course there is a lip service, but in a way the success of the &#x27;Mittelstand&#x27; (SMEs) never made it a necessity to foster startups.<p>4. Culture: One factor is risk aversion, for certain, but also how Germans perceive innovation plays a big role. I would describe it as an incremental view of innovation rather than disruptive technology, like a new type of car paint that dries 30% faster.<p>I&#x27;m not a pessimist at all, but that&#x27;s really one of the things that makes me bearish for Germany going forward.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.crunchbase.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;european-venture-report-vc-dollars-rise-in-2019&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.crunchbase.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;european-venture-report-vc-...</a>')
