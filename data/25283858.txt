Item(by='root_axis', descendants=None, kids=[25284246, 25285459], score=None, time=1606956370, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25276765, text='It&#x27;s simply too risky and will be for the foreseeable future. The liability cost for a semi-accident is huge, not just in lives but in cargo and in the truck itself.<p>Highways have decent network coverage but nothing close to the levels of reliability necessary to satisfy the actuaries. From a risk perspective, failure mitigation strategies like slowing or stopping are largely hamstrung by the same reliability concerns that prevent the vehicle from simply driving on its own, the vehicle may simply not recognize that the situation is dangerous until it&#x27;s too late, that&#x27;s without factoring in the reality that stopping or slowing can actually be extremely dangerous and can&#x27;t be relied upon as a catch-all fallback. Additionally, I think you&#x27;re greatly underestimating the practical problems involved in operating a remote emergency-on-call driver system, there&#x27;s also some questionable economics around the idea of paying to keep someone on call when you could just pay them to drive the truck.<p>On top of all that there are various other hard problems that need solving like fueling and security. You can be sure that automated trucks hauling valuable cargo will find themselves regularly waylaid by sophisticated criminals who will be greatly encouraged by the lack of a human element to resist their efforts. Truck drivers don&#x27;t really get paid that much money, the risks just aren&#x27;t worth it.')
