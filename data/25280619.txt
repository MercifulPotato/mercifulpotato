(None of Google&#x27;s messenger churn has the excuse of being an acquisition.)<p>Yammer is a social network and if Yammer counts for Microsoft as a &quot;chat app&quot; then Google gets to add Buzz, Reader, Orkut, G+, Wave, etc to the list.<p>Groove wasn&#x27;t exactly a chat app either. It was more the P2P bastard child of Lotus Notes (or a P2P relative of SharePoint, sort of, in Microsoft terms). Chat was a feature, but it wasn&#x27;t the emphasis of the app, the emphasis was more on shared workspaces (folders, documents). Some ideas that have resurfaced elsewhere in O365 and even Teams, though not in the P2P way without big cloud internet services that Groove attempted.<p>Windows Meeting Space was the last rebrand of NetMeeting, apparently. There&#x27;s also evidence according to Wikipedia that SharedView piggy backed on the Windows Meeting Space codebase and in some ways was a &quot;trial version&quot; of Windows Meeting Space with different internet services backing it and paid for by ads.<p>Kaizala is in the process of merging into Teams, and the Lync line (last Skype for Business) is considered to have already merged&#x2F;migrated. (Except for support of on premises installs which still has a few more years on the clock. Another contrast to Google who has never supported on premises installs, much less for years after the projects died&#x2F;moved on.)<p>Qik was a Skype off-shoot&#x2F;relative.')
