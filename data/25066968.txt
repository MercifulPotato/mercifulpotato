It doesn&#x27;t now, never has, and never will own the market nor does it desire to sell cheap enough machines to do so.<p>This includes a massive number of corporate desktops which often Apple doesn&#x27;t really compete with.<p>&gt; The cheapest desktop option is $6000 with an 8 core cpu or 8000 with a 16 core.<p>?? The Mac mini is $600 with an M1 which is likely a far faster computer than most $600 Windows desktop computers. Likely significantly faster.<p>I don&#x27;t think Apple is going to eat Windows alive, too many businesses have massive piles of Windows apps. I do see the potential Apple to increase market share significantly though.')
