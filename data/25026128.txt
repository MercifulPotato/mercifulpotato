GitHub disables forking of private repos by default, but even if you enable it you can still revoke forks of private repos from people later. Obviously people can manually clone your repo using git, but that’s no different than any other git scenario. The idea that using GitHub will lead to people accidentally making your code public is just not true.<p>&gt; That would be silly. I wouldn&#x27;t like it if someone applying to our company showed us their current&#x2F;previous employer&#x27;s IP. That would be like someone showing nudes of their current&#x2F;former partners to &quot;prsospective&quot; partners. It just does not compute, unless if the context were precisely about that. A lot of this is based on trust in my opinion.<p>It’s silly, but it’s also a shockingly common impulse among some junior developers. When I was mentoring juniors, it was not uncommon for young people to feel like they had some ownership of the code they wrote for a company, or a tool they wrote to help their work. I spent a lot of time explaining the concepts of work-for-hire and IP ownership. Many young devs just don’t even like the idea of IP ownership or the fact that the company literally owns work they did.<p>You’re exactly right that no sensible company wants to be exposed to IP from another company, but usually the people who do this don’t understand IP ownership in the first place. I know it sounds hard to believe, but they literally think they have the rights to the code because they wrote it.<p>The only real defense is to take the time to educate employees during onboarding. Don’t assume that everyone understands how IP ownership works. Many junior employees don’t.')
