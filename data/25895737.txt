Normally these would have launched from Vandenberg airforce base in California in the past because there is a clear path towards south from there.\nSo, how is SpaceX doing that now? They are conducting a so-called „dog leg“ maneuver. The trajectory of the rocket leads it a bit more out to the east over the ocean before it turns south. This is to avoid to fly over land&#x2F;populated area. This hasn‘t been done in decades if I remember correctly.')
