In the past these would have launched from Vandenberg airforce base in California because there is a clear path towards the south from there.\nSo, how is SpaceX doing that now? They are conducting a so-called „dog leg“ maneuver. This trajectory leads the rocket further out to the east over the ocean before it turns south. This is to avoid to fly over land&#x2F;populated area. This had not been done in decades if I remember correctly.<p>More stuff: the first Starlink satellites for polar orbits also launched on this flight. As I understand these were the first ones to have inter-satellite laser links too.<p>(I can’t imagine what an improvement cheap and high bandwidth satellite Internet must be for stations in Antarctica.)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;elonmusk&#x2F;status&#x2F;1353408098342326276" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;elonmusk&#x2F;status&#x2F;1353408098342326276</a>')
