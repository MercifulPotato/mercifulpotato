English literacy is rare in China even though it is a mandatory subject, so the bar to becoming a teacher is quite low. Often, they&#x27;ll have an excellent breadth of vocabulary, while being unfamiliar with many idiomatic expressions and cultural references that come naturally to a native speaker.')
