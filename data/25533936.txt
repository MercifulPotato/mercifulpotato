I appreciate your comments here.<p>I would add that people who are desperate will drag you down like a drowning person. I have been on both sides of this, and I have had to overcome this &quot;total reliance&quot; on others that makes them go away.<p>But, the best advice I have ever gotten (paraphrasing) was &quot;face YOUR problems&quot;. It didn&#x27;t matter what or how they said it. If you don&#x27;t want things to be better, they never will get better.<p>The problem is that hopelessness _feels_ permanent. I have just gotten where I can be helpful to others after decades, and I am seeing that _extreme_ patience, caring and understanding allow that difficult discussion about change to happen.<p>Keep saying what you are saying. It was people like you that helped me start facing things on my own. Bravo and peace and love to you.')
