It&#x27;s not well-suited to large projects. The dynamic-ness of it and awkward parts of the language (macros, protocols, ambiguity of laziness, etc) end up inevitably getting used in ways they aren&#x27;t intended.<p>The idea that you need &quot;wise programmers&quot; is a really big problem. People leave, institutional knowledge is lost, and then the code archaeology is just more difficult than it would be where types exist as guard rails.<p>I think Clojure looks favorable in comparison to Java still (though perhaps less so). But with Kotlin and Scala as mature alternatives -- and Clojure without a real niche -- it&#x27;s not what I would reach for.')
