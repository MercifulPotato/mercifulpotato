Item(by='yesenadam', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610282935, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25713887, text='&gt; That guy is just unreadable, I wonder if he was schizophrenic.<p>I find him among the most readable of philosophers, maybe the most readable. I can&#x27;t think of any philosopher who is as readable. I don&#x27;t care for <i>Zarathustra</i> or his poetry, but everything else he wrote I&#x27;ve read numerous times, with a lot of pleasure. Often he&#x27;s very funny.<p>Only his last book <i>Ecce Homo</i> seems really nuts, and even that has a lot of good stuff in it besides the grandiose claims.')
