The name of the service is sort of misleading advertising. In reality what you get is protection from theft of a card number when shopping online (this is what happened to make me decide to use the service), spend limits on reusable cards (for something you pay a recurring payment for, this comes in handy when a merchant raises their rates and doesn&#x27;t tell you) and you can use any name and region and so protect your identity from being sold by merchants to advertising firms.<p>Your bank still has access to everything (and they sell everything, of course) and the service itself also has access to everything. But all in all it is a good layer of insulation from merchants and vendors and has some useful features. Think of it like a VPN service for card payments.')
