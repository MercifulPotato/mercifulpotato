I submitted my project (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;try.yax.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;try.yax.com</a>, &quot;tiny websites with free hosting&quot;) and paid the $20 to have it promoted to the #3 position in the listings. That was about 3 hours ago and I&#x27;ve had a steady stream of visitors (thanks! my $20 was well-spent) but no comments so far. I definitely want a way to gather comments before going to Product Hunt or Show HN with my project.')
