Normal businesses don&#x27;t get big. This is an anomaly, an edge case. We need regulation that will be dividing companies when they become too big. Just like cells divide in nature. We also need to review offshore ownership and make sure they pay the same tax as smaller businesses. You cannot have a small struggling shop paying 40% and big guy only 1% if anything.')
