I still think they&#x27;re too bright. With a CRT you could set everything to white on black and you had almost no light coming out of the screen. Also brightness meant brightness and you could turn it way down for when working in dim light or darkness.<p>Of course i&#x27;m talking about text work here.<p>Maybe when OLED monitors become affordable we&#x27;ll go back to monitors that aren&#x27;t basically a lamp shining into your eyes all day. At least the oled on my phone looks like it doesn&#x27;t put out light where it shouldn&#x27;t.<p>For gaming, i&#x27;m not latency sensitive, but then i don&#x27;t play twitch shooters any more. I&#x27;m more the kind that buys mid-low range video cards and turns on the fps limiter where it&#x27;s available.')
