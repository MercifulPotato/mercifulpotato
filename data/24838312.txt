I don&#x27;t know why HN doesn&#x27;t want me posting anymore, so I guess I&#x27;ll just abuse the edit feature to get my voice heard.<p>In reply to zuesflight:<p>&gt;  What if the feed manipulation was per-user?<p>My understanding from Matrix&#x27;s blog post is that is half of the filtering equation. 1. Users and 2. Servers can filter 3. other users via reputation. It sounds like these filters will be inspectable, so, I would imagine that if you don&#x27;t like how a server is filtering, you&#x27;d just not use it. I don&#x27;t really have a strong understanding of Matrix (is it a protocol, a company?) so this is just me firing from the hip from the blog.<p>I also think the filter &quot;Merge&quot; thing is all about making &quot;multiple points of attack.&quot;<p>None of this is implemented from what I understand, all they have now is a sort of binary banned&#x2F;not banned list they share with mozilla. Very pie in the sky but if it works as they write that&#x27;d be cool!')
