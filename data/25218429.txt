If it&#x27;s rigidly attached to the tether, I don&#x27;t understand how it would stop spinning after being released. The rocket itself would spin very quickly, and due to conservation of angular momentum it would keep spinning upon release. Am I missing something?<p>Or do they somehow counter the spinning of the tether, so that the rocket&#x27;s orientation remains static? If there&#x27;s another bearing at the attachment point, I don&#x27;t see how just the outer bearing would withstand the friction at 10000g.')
