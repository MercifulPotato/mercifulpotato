You cannot produce fermions (e.g. electrons, protons, neutrons) out of thin air like this.  To make an electron, you need to also produce a positron or do something else that satisfies the various conservation laws.  You <i>can</i> make an electron-positron pair in a collider, but doing this in large amounts takes absurd amounts of energy.')
