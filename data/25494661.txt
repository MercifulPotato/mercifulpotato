So while trials haven&#x27;t been done yet to verfiy the vaccines are still effective, I&#x27;m assuming the spike protein has been observed to be the same so there&#x27;s no reason to suggest vaccines wouldn&#x27;t be effective.<p>EDIT: Actually, sounds like a couple of the mutations <i>are</i> in the spike protein and there is some evidence of reduced antibody effectiveness against the mutated version.')
