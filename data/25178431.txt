It&#x27;s not just censorship, it&#x27;s also high fees and lack of customer service and lock-in &#x2F; barriers to entry created by vertical integration.<p>And this isn&#x27;t a natural monopoly like the power grid. Federation gives the same economies of scale as long as the dominant network <i>is</i> federated. So the better solution to these companies isn&#x27;t to mess with Section 230, it&#x27;s to break them up.')
