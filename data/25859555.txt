Which is to say, if Google is the one decrypting all your TLS traffic on your PC (which it is), it&#x27;s very happy to push TLS, because it gates out other network providers from analyzing your network activity the way they actively do. Google is extremely financially vested in killing off Comcast and Verizon&#x27;s advertising businesses.<p>Furthermore, Google&#x27;s been utilizing that stewardship of Chrome to set up a situation where they dictate terms to the entire PKI industry, including their ability to unilaterally terminate certificate authorities... while conveniently setting up their own root CA as well.<p>Which is to say, yes, TLS is just another strategy Google has to take over complete control of the Internet from formerly decentralized approaches, and it should be considered a direct threat to everyone.')
