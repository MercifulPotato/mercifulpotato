Sometimes at the end you get nothing but a wet handshake. Think about vim: it is cryptic, does everything different than everything else out there , but it gives you something in return.<p>If you make your tool less inutive, but give users nothing in return, you are doing it wrong. If the interface of your tool does it one way in this corner and another way in that corner — so if you are inconsistent without good reason — you are doing it wrong.<p>Interfaces are about clear communication. Interfaces are the difference between a rugged 50k$ Arri Alexa cinema camera and a 200$ camcorder: the more Alexa has physical buttons and knobs for important things precisely in the locations where they should be, precisely behaving in the way they are expected. The cheap camcorder has buttons, encoders and levers sprinkled over it seemingly random.<p>The interface of a tool is good when it can be used intuitively even under stress, in bad weather and on drugs. This is ehat we all should aim for imo: tools that are more powerful&#x2F;expressive AND more intuitive at the same time.<p>I like reading manuals, but not for things that could have been totally obvious if somebody spent a split second thinking about how to communicate it clearly.')
