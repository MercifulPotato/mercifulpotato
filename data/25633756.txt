My mom got accused by another nurse of intentionally hurting a patient. Without the union she would have been on her own to deal with HR and management who would have just gotten rid of her as a matter of their convenience. Nothing of substance was found out of the investigations. The union worked. It will also protect her against any future political repercussions arising from the accusations and investigation. The police were involved and everything, no way in hell an employee would survive that without union representation.')
