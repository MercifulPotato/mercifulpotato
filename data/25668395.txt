You have the right to vote for whoever you want but you don&#x27;t have a right to do whatever you want. Democrats haven&#x27;t taken over the federal government. They were voted into office, just as several republicans&#x2F;whigs&#x2F;federalists&#x2F;anti-federalists&#x2F;literally whoever.<p>When I talking about democrats taking over the federal government, I am talking about court packing, senate packing (by adding states), and other tactics to establish they will use to establish a permanent majority.
