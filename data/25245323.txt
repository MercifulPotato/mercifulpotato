Intel provides the CPU to suit. Apple is choosing TDPs which are too small and then providing thermal solutions which only just meet that spec. They could provide better thermals <i>without hurting anything else in the machine</i> and get a higher base clock.<p>I assume they do this for market segmentation; see 2016 Touch Bar vs. non-Touch-Bar Pro. One fan vs. two.<p>The TDPs look appropriate for M1 parts. They&#x27;re too small for Intel. I&#x27;m guessing that (a) Apple predicted the M1 transition sooner and (b) Apple designed ahead for Intel&#x27;s roadmap (perf at reduced TDP) which never eventuated.<p>So, unfortunately, Apple have shipped a generation of laptops with inadequate cooling.')
