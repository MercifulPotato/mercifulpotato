Item(by='phil21', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606692444, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25243348, text='&gt; If monthly profit on each of those 30 condos&#x2F;homes can average $200 per month, that&#x27;s $6,000 per month right there.<p>I assume your calculations include a full-on property manager?  I have a single unit (wife&#x27;s pre-marriage condo we held onto) and even that is a minor job sometimes at the most inconvenient times possible.  A kitchen sink doesn&#x27;t care that it&#x27;s 10pm on a Sunday night before a huge early Monday presentation.  It&#x27;s gotta be fixed now.<p>30 units would be full-on full time 40hr&#x2F;week job  while also hiring a part time assistant for larger jobs.  If you have 30 units, I guarantee that 3 major things will break simultaneously during a holiday weekend - it&#x27;s just the way the business goes.<p>33% down here won&#x27;t get you into profitable territory with a property manager taking their cut.  Certainly there are areas of the country where this is very possible, and if you put a little effort up-front you can make it a quite sustainable business - especially if you can get to the point you can hire a full time (cheap) property manager&#x2F;handyman and you simply run the books.<p>Just want to reiterate to those reading this that what is described is essentially a second career.  Certainly not passive income in any sense of the term.  You would be trading your tech career in for that of a landlord which indeed is actual non-trivial amounts of labor.<p>That doesn&#x27;t even get into risk.  I&#x27;m renting in a city with evictions paused but no mortgage relief to be seen for my profile.  I&#x27;m fine, but if had been just starting out in my landlording adventure I might be close to bankruptcy.  Can you survive a year or two with 50% or less income?  This can and will happen in the form of either vacancies&#x2F;non-pay, or major unexpected structural repairs.<p>I&#x27;m actually considering picking up a few more units in the neighborhood simply to have a diverse income stream for when I do decide to step back some and &quot;retire&quot; to an easier&#x2F;part time job in my chosen field.  But, I do this knowing I&#x27;m also lining up &quot;things to keep me busy&quot; at the same time.')
