You can&#x27;t aim up or down because there is no up or down. You shoot at a guy at the top of a stair case and it will hit, because it&#x27;s actually the same level. There&#x27;s only one level. All the up&#x2F;down perspectives are faked. In the original doom, you could never have a room above another room.')
