I bought a bunch of tools and built a workbench (err, well, I finished 90% of it, I never cut the final boards for the bottom shelf) and then... did nothing. I need to finish the workbench and move it to the back of my garage (once I move it I can&#x27;t put in the bottom shelf without moving it back). Does anyone have any good starter-projects or good things to do to &quot;flex&quot; the &quot;muscle&quot; of woodworking?')
