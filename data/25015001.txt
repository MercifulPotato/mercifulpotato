Why do you think it&#x27;s an improvement? A lot of the time people argue GraphQL is better than REST, what they actually mean is that they didn&#x27;t want a set of conventions but rather an opinionated framework that made the decisions for them. REST gives you a lot of freedom to do it wrong. GraphQL on the other hand makes some assumptions and decides a few things for you. This makes it easier to use if you don&#x27;t want to dive into the complexity of designing and building proper REST APIs. The outcome will be more or less identical.')
