No single manufacturer has anything close to a monopoly and there&#x27;s no legal duty to make it the printers compatible with third party modules. At best, some consumer might argue a case that there was an expectation of third party compatibility when they purchased their printers. Even that would be difficult to prove though.<p>Vote with your wallet and buy something that will work with third party ink. Go a step further and avoid all HP products. That&#x27;s the only way this will be solved.')
