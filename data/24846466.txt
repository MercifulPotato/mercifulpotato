False. And it&#x27;s important to note that none of this data collection was ever explained or even disclosed to users. We had to discover it by reverse engineering. Extremely shady practice by Apple. It doesn&#x27;t matter if the &quot;intentions&quot; were good. Secretly collecting data is never acceptable.<p>And let&#x27;s never forget, Apple has been actively collaborating with authoritarian governments to shut down pro-democracy activism. That&#x27;s not just a theoretical possibility, it actually happened.<p>The very possibility of Macs phoning home for every shell script would have been considered a crazy conspiracy until we discovered that&#x27;s it&#x27;s actually a real thing. So it&#x27;s a bit ironic to suggest that Apple&#x27;s exploiting this data is just a crazy conspiracy theory.')
