This, for me, is a perfect summary.<p>I am perfectly fine with working from home but the mental toll of having virtually nowhere to go outside of my four walls is starting to wear on me.  It makes me upset and frustrated and I start projecting those emotions onto the actions of others and it becomes a downward cycle.<p>I&#x27;m not particularly social.  In fact, I&#x27;m almost anti-social (I do not like the interactions like &quot;how are you doing?&quot; in the shops &#x2F; &quot;hello there!&quot; while walking in a park &#x2F; &quot;how&#x27;s your day going?&quot; entering a takeaway place, and I will absolutely never strike up a conversation at the bus stop or on a train), but this is starting to feel suffocating.<p>Yet I&#x27;m still going to avoid unnecessary trips and minimize contact because until we have some effective shots to go around, that&#x27;s how I avoid the consequences of this stupid virus.')
