My wife likes Chicago and since we&#x27;re in Ann Arbor we go about once a year. I refuse to drive to Chicago because it just makes me mad, so we take the train. Hop on in Ann Arbor, we bring some snacks. I spend three hours reading&#x2F;surfing the web, then we get to downtown Chicago. I&#x27;m not angry and tired so we can go out and enjoy the evening or activity.')
