So a highly sensitive sensor can handle less light before clipping (which makes sense).<p>This trade-off can be tweaked by changing the size of the photodiode (bigger diode -&gt; more sensitive), but also electrically - simply add capacitance in parallel to the photodiode. This requires more energy, i.e. more photons, to change the voltage over the photodiode, which is what the readout measures.<p>Dual native ISO sensors simply add another transistor (as a switch) in series to extra capacitance; this allows them to switch between low-capacitance (high sensitivity, but saturates faster) and high-capacitance (lower sensitivity, can handle more light).<p>Edit: Haven&#x27;t watched the whole video but his core explanation in there seems to be that Dual ISO means the sensors has a PGA (programmable gain amplifier) -- almost <i>all</i> sensors use that approach, and that&#x27;s what is controlled by the ISO setting in them.')
