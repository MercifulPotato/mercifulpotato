But whenever I notice that he doesn&#x27;t have his time logged in the system, he says &quot;yeah I&#x27;ve been slammed all day&quot; or something similar and promises to get it done soon... and then doesn&#x27;t. And he genuinely is getting a lot of work done so there&#x27;s no foul play or anything.<p>The issue isn&#x27;t just logging his time either - he&#x27;s also not great at taking detailed notes, writing accurate scope of work documents, etc. He&#x27;s very good with clients, has a lot of knowledge and experience with the tech stack, but is a &quot;cowboy engineer&quot; if that makes sense.<p>The way I&#x27;m thinking about this is that everyone has different strengths and weaknesses, but for this one person, said weaknesses are directly affecting the company bottom line so they are impossible to ignore. :)')
