I feel like to be successful, you have to be really, really good at a couple things. For us that was engineering + design. For another team it might be that they&#x27;re good enough at sales that they can close big deals right off the bat.<p>Being great at engineering + design meant we could build the best product in our market, with a robust codebase that&#x27;s free of errors (unit tests, CI&#x2F;CD) and easy to scale.<p>&gt; b) Looking back, what skills would you have liked to acquire before starting up?<p>Hmm. It might have been good to work at an early-stage SaaS startup before starting one. This would have given us a lot of context into pricing, sales, marketing, recruiting, etc. Problems that we kind of just had to figure out from scratch.<p>&gt; c) How much of startups is marketing and networking compared to product and growth?<p>Most of our success can be attributed to a) building a great product, and b) getting it in front of people. B is all marketing. Ads, SEO, content, etc.<p>Now, some startups rely entirely on product + sales, and some startups are able to attract all of their customers with just product (esp consumer). It really depends on your product&#x2F;market&#x2F;company, and how your customers want to buy.')
