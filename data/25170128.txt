But I guess an octagon is pretty clearly defined as a planar object.<p>Something the article didn&#x27;t touch on but that I think is fundamental when trying to construct proofs: Often, you can get further in a proof by trying to prove the opposite. Assume that what you&#x27;re trying to prove is impossible and try to construct a counterexample to the original proof. You will reach a point where the construction can&#x27;t go further - examine closely what invariant prevents you from completing the counterexample and you will happen across something that will advance your actual proof. Note that this need not result in a proof by contradiction - it&#x27;s usually more about illuminating the way forward.<p>In a sense, the octagon problem is teaching exactly this step. That is, the &quot;real&quot; problem here (and the proof that the students should arrive at) is &quot;prove that you cannot construct a convex octagon with 4 right angles&quot;. How do you do that? You assume that it&#x27;s wrong and try to find a counterexample to the original proposition - a convex octagon with 4 right angles. The ensuing &quot;productive struggle&quot; leads exactly to the insights you need to prove the original proposition, as detailed in the article.')
