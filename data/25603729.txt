The Buchla synthesizer featured it in the 60&#x27;s.<p>But the critical feature of FM synthesis that made it usable as a musical element was <i>linear</i> FM.  Early synthesizers (like, I presume Buchla&#x27;s) sported &quot;FM&quot; but it was <i>exponential</i> due to volt&#x2F;oct.<p>&gt; John Chowning refined the concept, moved from frequency to phase modulation, and brought FM into the digital realm.<p>?? Chowning&#x27;s paper doesn&#x27;t mention phase modulation at all, does it?  His equation is for frequency modulation.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.eecs.umich.edu&#x2F;~fessler&#x2F;course&#x2F;100&#x2F;misc&#x2F;chowning-73-tso.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.eecs.umich.edu&#x2F;~fessler&#x2F;course&#x2F;100&#x2F;misc&#x2F;chowning...</a><p>I would presume that the relationships between phase and frequency modulation were known a half-century before Chowning.<p>&gt; Given 1983 technology, it was very difficult to implement digital audio filters, which require millions of multiplication&#x2F;accumulation operations a second.<p>This seems high? A second-order digital filter requires what, about 4 stores, recalls, and multiplies per sample?  This would seem to be in the same level of complexity as six carrier&#x2F;modulator interactions; you have to do a multiply to do a lookup after all.  Or is the issue that the multiplies had to be 12-16 bit?<p>&gt; Maybe it was an accidental choice of words in the article, but I would also say that the DX7 was, indeed, one of the most important advances in terms of musical engineering.<p>I think it&#x27;s easy to argue that the DX7 was the most important synthesizer in history.  People forget that the DX7 caused a near-death experience for the industry as a whole as analog synth makers were put out of business by the DX7 and its progeny.  It also heralded the arrival of commercially viable FM, and created a revolution not just in synthesizers but in PC sound cards, (ugh) ringtones, you name it.')
