Nobody will necessarily repossess your car, sure, if you fail to fix a broken headlight or seat-belt, but you can still be fined or jailed for it. (Though even repossession can happen as those fines&#x2F;jail time <i>can</i> in turn cause repossession of your car as a secondary effect, depending on your loans&#x2F;liens&#x2F;bonds and the state in which you live.)')
