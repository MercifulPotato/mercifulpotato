Retail trades are more likely to express real demand. When a retail traders puts in an order for 135 shares, say, it&#x27;s most likely that&#x27;s an accurate and complete signal of that traders intentions: they are looking to buy 135 shares. For institutional players, it could be an iceberg order: once the 135 shares are filled, the refill the order with another 135, again and again. So the actual orders they submit are less representative of their actual intent, making handling their trades much more risky.')
