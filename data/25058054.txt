Records audio, maybe even transcribing it (if high enough quality), while also tracking how the notes relate to the audio across the time of the lecture.<p>As for lectures in the past, it is a shame we may have lost them, as it seems to me (purely speculatively) that the lectures from the 70s and 80s seemed to make a whole different class of programmers to the ones of today. Or maybe it was the tinkering and not the lectures, who knows.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paircast.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paircast.io&#x2F;</a>')
