We&#x27;ve built bespoke storage and processing pipelines for this data because existing options in this space both didn&#x27;t fit our needs and also would bankrupt our company while we tried to sort it out.<p>Having &quot;cost&quot; on the board as a factor we were actively trying to optimize for during design pulled us in a direction that is quite foreign compared to off-the shelf solutions.<p>That last paragraph rings true -- one of our big challenges specifically was in ingesting and indexing data that needs to be queried across multiple dimensions, things like aircraft or drone position telemetry. But once we found a workable solution for that, it specializes quite well to simpler workloads very well.')
