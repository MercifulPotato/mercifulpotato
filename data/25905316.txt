I&#x27;ve had paper voting receipts for at least 15 years.  Probably longer.<p><i>Is this standard now, or on a state by state basis?</i><p>There are no voting machine standards.  It varies by state, and in some states by county.<p>Some people see that as a flaw.  I see the diversity of voting systems as a security plus.  There was even an article in the newspaper shortly after the election stating that certain foreign governments looked into hacking America&#x27;s voting systems, but it wasn&#x27;t worth the effort because they were all constructed and implemented differently.')
