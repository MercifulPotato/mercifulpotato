It pulls air from the outside in through your house, then exhausts it into the attic.  Even on very hot days, as long as the humidity isn&#x27;t crazy it is very effective at keeping you cool.  I routinely go without running AC into days that go into the low 80&#x27;s.  Living in the mid Atlantic I&#x27;ve been pleased about just how much I have been able to use a whole house fan.<p>They have come a long way too.  I have one from QuiteCool Systems - instead of a fan bolted directly to the attic rafters with crappy metal louvers that rattle and don&#x27;t block out drafts when not in operation, it has a powerful fan on a segment of ductwork - when you install you install it so there is a 90 degree bend in the ductwork and it attenuates the vast majority of fan noise.  Indeed, I hear more from the motor rumble through the rafters in the attic where it&#x27;s mounted than I do from the fan&#x2F;air noise.<p>It comes with an insulated and highly efficient damper too.  The system took less than an hour to install and I was easily able to pull power from an outlet in my hall, put in a switch then continue to the attic with the fan.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quietcoolsystems.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quietcoolsystems.com&#x2F;</a><p>Mine has more than paid for itself - less than 650 watts vs over 2800 watts if both my AC units are running.  The only problem I have is my house is a little over 2800 square feet and if I let it get warm (say I am not home and close the house up then come home hours later) the single fan I have is not powerful enough to cool - I need to add a second unit so I have better peak air flow.<p>I think I will add the unit that has two smaller fans, then at night when I still would like a little airflow but not a hurricane I can have more a gentle breeze.  Needing to have more control over airflow at night is something I didn&#x27;t anticipate.  I have tied my home automation system in - I can read the temperature from my Nest thermostats and turn the fan on&#x2F;off as needed.  I also have the scripts check the status of windows&#x2F;doors through my alarm system.  One danger is if you have gas appliances that are not direct vented you can back draft them - my water heater is in my basement and it&#x27;s not direct vented - it relies on a flue so you need to be careful you don&#x27;t reverse the flow in the flue.  I have a couple of extra CO2 monitors in the basement and after five years have never seen a blip but it is something to be aware of with any gas appliance.  Heck if your house isn&#x27;t balanced a bathroom fan can cause a backdraft in a flue.')
