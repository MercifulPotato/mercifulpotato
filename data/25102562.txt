Especially people with an analytical personality.  Their go-to emotional coping mechanism for bad feelings can become to try to analyzed and problem-solve.  And while you can do that if your depression has an obvious cause. . . there are tons of people who are depressed for no obvious reason - OR - there is no way to get out of the situation that&#x27;s causing it.<p>The solution in those cases is to not try to solve it, but instead to let the &#x27;emotional&#x27; part of the brain do it&#x27;s natural function and simply process the emotions.  It&#x27;s difficult because the emotional part of the brain does NOT have the ability to use language.  It evolved hundreds of millions of years ago, and is the deepest part of our central nervous system, and absolutely necessary for our survival. It can not be shut off or ignored. And in the case of depression, it may or may not be &quot;normal&quot; - but it is doing it&#x27;s job.')
