I find it more likely Orwell was spoofing Wells and Basic English and all of the post-1918 utopian attempts at &quot;simplifying language&quot; or auxlangs, than that he would be pretending to any originality.<p>It&#x27;s not newspeak that causes crimestop. It&#x27;s that &quot;quiet desperation is the english way&quot;, it&#x27;s the middle class attitudes of the title of &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot;, etc. that cause crimestop. Orwell was aware of crimestop from his own experiences, and he was aware that he lived in a world with, admittedly, bureaucratese, but without newspeak.')
