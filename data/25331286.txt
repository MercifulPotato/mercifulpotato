A more likely explanation might be that police agencies have limited resources, and and as a result have to prioritize their enforcement activities for actual crimes.  There simply aren’t enough police, jails, or courts to arrest random people for leaving their homes with a mask on.<p>Further, by advocating for aggressive enforcement, you are also advocating for the ultimate super spreader event: filling jails with people that don’t belong there, where the virus already runs rampant.  Most of these people would be booked in, get the virus, and then bail out or be released by a judge a few days later.  Then, they would take the virus out into the community and spread it further.<p>These restrictions are a fun exercise in virtue signaling, but are impractical and actually enforcing them would increase the spread of the virus.')
