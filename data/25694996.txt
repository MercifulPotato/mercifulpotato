Ohio. I&#x27;ve always found it funny how SCOTUS, during the early 20th century, has upheld laws limiting the freedom of socialists to say things like &quot;compulsory military service is bad&quot;, but then had a change of heart when the motherfucking KLAN argued that fomenting hate was free speech.<p>It&#x27;s time for change. Hate speech is not free speech. If you foment hate, spread antigovernment lies like the vote fraud narrative, or are complicit as a platform in doing the same, you should be punished.')
