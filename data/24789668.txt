It often these extreme views that provide unique insights and the most valuable information. So how - and moreover why - should Youtube try to sift through a physics lecture on metallurgy and attempt to differentiate it from a physics lecture on metallurgy.<p>There&#x27;s often no way of knowing whether the lecture is being given by a college physics professor or a 9&#x2F;11 truther, except by examining the contents - and both might be telling the truth. Heck the college physics professor could be a 9&#x2F;11 truther and the truther could be a college professor... that doesn&#x27;t mean that this lecture on metallurgy should be removed from the college&#x27;s account.<p>The fact that some people can&#x27;t tell the difference between an Einstein and a wannabe Einstein doesn&#x27;t mean that we should censor them both.')
