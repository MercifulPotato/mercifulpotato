A company might need a solution and only research a couple of days. I think it&#x27;s not a matter of better marketing, just different marketing. In my industry niche some companies have fixed pricing per month, some per usage, some per seat, some target &lt; 100 USD customers, some have only a free tier and the first paid tier is already 250 USD. There&#x27;s no one pricing strategy that captures every customer. I have customers that only work with me because we&#x27;re based in Europe (different data protection legislation), not related to anything in the product or pricing itself.')
