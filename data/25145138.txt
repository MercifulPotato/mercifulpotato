That’s a big percentage.<p>Anecdotally, there was a step function between 3 lb ultraportable laptops with 12-13” displays and the 2.2 lb 11” MacBook Air.  It was the most grabbable, portable computer I’ve ever owned with enough CPU power to handle my Computer Science coursework.  It changed my relationship with my laptop.  It no longer felt like a lump in my bag that needed to be handled carefully, like all the previous plastic bodied things I’d owned.<p>I have since used a 13” Air, Pixelbook, Samsung Galaxy Chromebook (until it died), and I’m typing this now on an iPad Pro, and I still miss that laptop.<p>The HP Dragonfly looks real nice, maybe if I put Linux on it.  It’s also $2200 for decent specs though, whereas the 11” MacBook Air was a comparatively reasonable $899.')
