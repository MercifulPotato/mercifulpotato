The OP really did shoot themself in the foot by using the word &quot;coding&quot;, where what they most likely meant was doing simple alterations to computing systems that require understanding some basic control flow structures - conditionals and loops. Things like, &quot;I seem to be doing the same repetitive sequence of steps 100x a day, let me automate this somewhat&quot;. Think Tasker and bash, not JavaScript and C++.<p>&gt; <i>this piling up of expectations just lead people to give up and pay for services rather than learn all that</i><p>A small bit of knowledge can save you a lot of money in services. I can get why wealthy wouldn&#x27;t care, but most people aren&#x27;t wealthy. Also, I feel there&#x27;s more pressure from the sales&amp;marketing departments of services than from modern society&#x27;s demands on free time.')
