Some of these laws have strong teeth and can put abusers behind bars for years.<p>I have two dogs, and they&#x27;re both incredibly happy. They enrich my life, and I do the same to theirs&#x27;. I don&#x27;t want the state telling me I can&#x27;t have dogs. That&#x27;s a kind of liberal fascism that goes against the grain of this country&#x27;s ethos.<p>There are dogs suffering in shelters, but there is suffering all around, everywhere you look. Orphan children, homeless people, cancer. If you start passing laws against everything, we&#x27;ll wind up living in a bubble.<p>Find negative externalities and tax them if you want a better way of dealing with problems. Don&#x27;t ban dog ownership.')
