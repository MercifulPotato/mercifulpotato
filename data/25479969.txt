I think a lot of the campaigns against Apple these days are trying to attack the one thing that Apple holds precious: it&#x27;s Brand. I know it isn&#x27;t working but thats the idea. Apple is not a company that likes to conduct the business in public. The brand is for consumers and they spent a lot of money on that. This could just be away of trying to attack Apple using something they care about. Fortnite I think is similar. It sort of worked. We now have a big thread on HN about Apple fighting. Apple doesn&#x27;t want this, even if they look like the winner.')
