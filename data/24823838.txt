Does it only count if we agree? Call it a debate then if you must.<p>And yes the money does disappear. It&#x27;s called waste, a very common problem with how governments spend money. The quality of life and govt services in SF and CA are not commensurate with the taxes collected.<p>The wider point is that ratio of avg income to expenses is worse in CA than FL. This is what &quot;adjusted&quot; cost of living means, and is regardless of various specific niches and industries that you&#x27;re focusing on.<p>If you still think FL is worse than fine, just move to CA. You might love it here, but I doubt you will once you realize just how bad the politics are, which was what the original claim was.')
