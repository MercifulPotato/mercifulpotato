Books often contain leads for more information which can be contained in either more books or articles, of high quality, for good reasons.<p>Articles are often more contemporary in topic matter and so should be fit to your current purpose, rather than acting as your primary means of exploring topics (which is their most common use when reading feeds, if we call &quot;filling up time due to boredom&quot; a form of foraging). Books are better for both exploration and depth when it comes to understanding important and long-lasting ideas.')
