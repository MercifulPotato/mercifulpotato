A stipulation of this was that at no time would any one developer have their story point velocity assessed.<p>The purpose of this system is to provide the team with a powerful tool that it needs in order to set a realistic timeline on team deliverables, such as a launch milestone or a new feature. The ability of the story point methodology to have predictive power is destroyed when people are incentivized to gamify it.')
