If there was a flaw to Labour&#x27;s 2019 Brexit &quot;agnosticism&quot; policy, it was that it was not pro-Brexit enough -- Starmer&#x27;s former Brexit-hostility (such as his &quot;6 tests for Brexit&quot;) is gone, and he will probably use the whip to vote for almost any negotiated deal. I only hope there is a deal.')
