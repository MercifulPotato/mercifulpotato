Funny how they didn&#x27;t think of that in the CRL and app-blacklist cases. Perhaps they were worried the locally-cached lists themselves would be subject to attack?<p>*In my opinion, in the content-blocker instance the result is a much poorer user experience (ad-blocking effectiveness, flexibility) when compared with e.g. uBlock Origin, and one of the reasons I continue to use Firefox instead.')
