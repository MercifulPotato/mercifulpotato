E.g., a hypothetical racist might be comfortable around Asians because he thinks they&#x27;re subservient and weak, whereas he might be uncomfortable around black people because he thinks they&#x27;re angry and violent. If this hypothetical racist ran a company, it&#x27;s plausible he&#x27;d hire Asians, but not hire black people at all.')
