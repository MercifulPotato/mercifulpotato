Item(by='DoreenMichele', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604344395, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24971421, text='Historically, it was somewhat common for men to say to each other here &quot;You must be smart and competent because you have a lot of karma on HN.&quot; People tend to not say that about me and when I say that about myself -- &quot;Look, this is a metric right in front you that gets used to say other people here are smart and competent&quot; -- it generally gets ugly reactions, as occurred here.<p>I&#x27;m trying to walk away from this discussion at this point. I haven&#x27;t had enough sleep and I&#x27;ve been on HN over eleven years and the degree to which I still get treated like &quot;Shut up woman, there is no sexism here!&quot; is a point of personal aggravation and there is no good means to combat it.<p>Ideally, <i>someone else</i> should be telling people &quot;She&#x27;s probably the only woman to have ever spent time on the leader board and a respected and valued member of the community&quot; or someone else should be telling people &quot;She kicks ass. This is a list of her accomplishments.&quot; That&#x27;s generally how respected men get treated.<p>But that&#x27;s not happening and I end up feeling like I have no real choice but to defend myself at times, knowing that will also go badly and be used against me as evidence that I&#x27;m not actually important or respectable or smart and so on.<p>That&#x27;s the essence of sexism. It&#x27;s a damned if you do, damned if you don&#x27;t situation. There simply are no good answers for me. They don&#x27;t exist and trying to find them gets a lot of abuse heaped upon me.<p>I was openly homeless on HN for nearly six years. I remain dirt poor. I continue to get treated like I&#x27;m a loon who has no basis to claim any kind of competence at all.<p>And if I say that is evidence of sexism, well, that&#x27;s just more &quot;evidence&quot; I&#x27;m some crank.<p>Anyway, I haven&#x27;t had enough sleep. I have had more than I care to have of this type of conversation for today. I&#x27;m trying to walk away.')
