I used to like that I could run your software on prem and configure issue fields etc, but now, you have so many layers of crap and &quot;pretty&quot; that its not suprising you can&#x27;t tell what is fast and what isnt.<p>It is <i>not</i> your customers job to instrument your software. Your API gateway can provide precise and accurate figures on how long API calls take and there is nothing stopping you adding web page metrics that can provide client-side measurements as well.<p>Some examples are available on the publicly visible JIRA boards, like the one for hibernate. Just go click on all issues and then click on any issue in a private browser window and with the cache empty.<p><i>Every one</i> of the fields take seconds to load. That is not internet roundtrip time, that is your backend. Even when the issue is ~80% loaded (according to <i>your own page load bar</i>), there are still JS scripts that will load and reformat the page, causing the browser to reflow.<p>These are <i>not</i> cached, because loading another issue doesn&#x27;t resolve the problem.<p>So there are fundamental front end problems that <i>have nothing to do with the servers or backend</i>, they are entirely a problem of the JS and the in-browser activities.<p>Fix them.')
