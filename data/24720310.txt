By the way, the price was too high, and it kept having to slow down near every city.<p>Tokyo to Osaka, for instance, is a relatively short distance (300 miles), and both cities are larger than any city in the US, with Nagoya at the half-way point.  The quantity of humans that can serve is an order of magnitude higher than in the same distance in the USA, even on the eastern seaboard.<p>It just doesn&#x27;t work for us.  The dramatically reduced costs of infrastructure for constructing mounted tubes on pylons, with each section being a fungible, mass produced item, makes rail obsolete.  Understood that a lot of the tech is &quot;unproven&quot;, but it&#x27;s too promising to let curmudgeons focus on the stupid, expensive fool&#x27;s errand of high-speed rail in the US because they are too unimaginative to see what&#x27;s available to us in the future.')
