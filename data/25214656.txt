Not sure how much is being cached or what the bottleneck is...but there is something seriously wrong with the site&#x27;s performance. It has become so slow I honestly think performance is the cause of fewer and fewer Jira tickets at work (people used to make tickets for tiny isolated updates to track them finely, but now it all gets shoved into the commit-of-the-day) and fewer updates&#x2F;comments. People seem to interact with it only on sprint ends when they must do.')
