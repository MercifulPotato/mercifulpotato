Notably the idea of activation function and of backpropagation.\nBut yes clearly they&#x27;re too different in most cases to make valid analogies between them.<p>It&#x27;s still an open question why we can&#x27;t port a biological neural brain on regular CPU (a neumomorphic system)\nOne could say it&#x27;s because emulating a brain (e.g Blue brain) require too much compute and&#x2F;or that we lack observability (we can&#x27;t easily records all the state data that constitute a brain) but that doesn&#x27;t preclude emulating a simple brain such as the one of c ellegans (302 neurons whole nervous system!!) and I&#x27;ve never met a satisfying explanation as to why this is so hard and where can I track progress on this task.')
