Retina MBP screen pop nearly cost me £450 a few years back. When the option was presented I bought a second hand Lenovo T470 for the same money and sold the broken MacBook Pro as is on ebay and took the kids out for a couple of days with the change.<p>How did I break the screen? Well I dropped it three inches onto my sofa. Yes that fragile if you get it at the right angle. No thanks!<p>I&#x27;ve had several thinkpads and nearly beaten them to death basically and they just keep going. I poured an entire cup of coffee in one a couple of years back and fell over with it while running and it had a cracked keyboard footprint which was replaced for £15 from ebay. It still worked fine when I sold it.')
