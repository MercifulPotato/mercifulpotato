No, this wasn&#x27;t &quot;our 9&#x2F;11.&quot;  I doubt it&#x27;ll even be a topic of conversation in a few years, just like we don&#x27;t talk about 1983 United States Senate bombing today at all.<p>I have no doubt a few of the rioters really were planning terrible deeds and they should be prosecuted; the violence and property damage is inexcusable.  But most of these people just seem to be caught up in the moment -- taking selfies and LARPing around the capitol after hours.<p>What we need right now is de-escalation.')
