As someone with a degree in classics, I don&#x27;t have an intuitive understanding of how fast exponential growth can get out of control.<p>1. The death rate dropped from 9500&#x2F;week in mid-April to 300&#x2F;week in mid-July. And stayed below 300&#x2F;week until the end of September.<p>2. Our scientific&#x2F;medical advisors say we should keep things locked down - but it&#x27;s their job to be cautious, they&#x27;re medical advisors not economic advisors. I have to weigh up their advice against other interests.<p>3. Compared to at the start of the first lockdown, we now have more testing capacity and PPE. Face masks are now available for everyone not just medical staff, for example.<p>4. There are loads of industries saying if they can&#x27;t re-open they&#x27;ll need a government bail-out and we&#x27;ve already spent an eye-watering amount of money on the furlough scheme.<p>5. Some of these industries, like gyms and universities, point out that having them open is good for the nation. Keeping schools closed seems to be widening the performance gap between rich and poor children. People avoiding hospitals is leading to more cancers going untreated.<p>6. Countries like Sweden and America haven&#x27;t locked down at all.<p>7. We&#x27;re going to keep a lot of restrictions in place, with restaurants and theatres running at a fraction of their normal capacity, so it&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re going completely back to normal.<p>8. The prime minister&#x27;s own chief advisor is breaking lockdown rules because he&#x27;s bored of them, and punishing him isn&#x27;t an option, so it&#x27;d be a lot less embarrassing if we could make what he did allowed retroactively.<p>Between these inputs, our leaders convinced themselves that lowering restrictions was the right thing to do in August.')
