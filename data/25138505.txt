My standard of living had not gone up. Instead of being surrounded by an interesting, diverse set of generally sane people, and having many more job opportunities readily available in my field, I have COVID denying, borderline cultists who tried to assassinate the governor and generally make it unsafe for me to go anywhere without risking getting sick and stolid corporations that underpay and donâ€™t take risks. Thankfully, I still work remotely for a company in California so I can go back when this all blows over.')
