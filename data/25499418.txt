Which in practice usually means each party ends up paying their own costs. A large disparity in costs (as would probably be the case in the example you give) might change that, but it would probably end up having to be decided in court.<p>(Note that what I am describing would be the case under current law wherever jaywalking is illegal, not just under the hypothetical law I described.)')
