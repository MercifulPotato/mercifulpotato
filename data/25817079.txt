The divisions are fairly arbitrary, there&#x27;s no real way to figure out what group you belong to, and sometimes the splits completely destroy the community that was built up.<p>Belltown, in Seattle, got split into 3 (4? I can&#x27;t remember) communities and there&#x27;s still questions about which group people belong to because they&#x27;re not sure if they&#x27;re covered by one or another along the boundaries. Some of the resulting communities are far more active than others, too.<p>I moved from there to Greenwood in North Seattle and I quite literally have no idea what my new group is because there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a map and all of the Greenwood groups end 2 blocks south of me.')
