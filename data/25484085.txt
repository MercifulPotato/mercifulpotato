If it takes significantly longer to do locally than it takes to input into the cloud provider&#x27;s interface, something&#x27;s not right.<p>I can tell you where most companies go wrong here though. It&#x27;s in excessive specialization. If you put separate people in charge of provisioning, networking, logging, etc. then you create a ton of friction to do anything because you need five different humans to touch it and they all have to coordinate. One person can do all of those things, as you&#x27;ve learned when one person does it interacting with the cloud providers. And when one person is doing all of it, it takes only seconds to do.')
