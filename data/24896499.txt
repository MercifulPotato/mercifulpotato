You are right that probably a very small minority of Trump opposers are actually stealing yard signs. However, a larger component are advocating for censorship of opinions and facts that disagree with their worldview, and many more will readily shut down any opposing discussion about immigration policy or international trade, supporting police, or even simply wearing a red hat, with strong and viral accusations of &quot;racism&quot; - signalling to their allies that this person should be punished, and many of those allies are happy to comply in whatever way their position in society allows them to.
