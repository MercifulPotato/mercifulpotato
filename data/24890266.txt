I think I went through every keyboard on Amazon and found only one. If you use a USB wireless keyboard, well, there goes one of the two USB slots on the laptop.<p>It&#x27;s not just the monitor being big, I want lots and lots of pixels. I&#x27;m currently running 3840*2160, and have a second monitor attached set up in portrait mode (so I can display a manual page while I work on the other one).<p>Of course, I&#x27;d get an even bigger monitor with more pixels if they didn&#x27;t cost so dang much :-) How big, you ask? A wall size retina display! I&#x27;ve wanted one for 40 years.')
