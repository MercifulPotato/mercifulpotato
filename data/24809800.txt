Take the example of websites of local sport clubs: they all had a proper website with all info and news and stuff. Now they haven&#x27;t any more, they&#x27;ve changed to a shitty Facebook page with everything mixed together into an incredible mess. (By the way, the traditional website is typically still running fine without maintenance, it just hasn&#x27;t been updated since around 2015-2017.)<p>I don&#x27;t think the people from your small town random sport club, who built and ran the site in the 2000s, had special computers skills or time compared to those of today.')
