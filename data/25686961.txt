If you have to send so many to overwhelm and bypass all the countermeasures, the cost and complexity of make it a much less practical and appealing solution than just doing it the old fashioned way. I can&#x27;t see how brass, lead, and gunpowder will ever be more expensive than light weight plastics&#x2F;composites, electronics, sensors, motors, batteries, plus the actual lethal component. Add to that the required time&#x2F;complexity required to configure and deploy, situational considerations such as weather, sensor viability, terrain&#x2F;environment factors, etc... and we&#x27;re back to going back to guys with guns. Could there conceivably be a scenario where this might be the best option? I suppose, but in my estimation it would likely be the option of last resort.<p>If an enemy force has already made up its mind to kill, I don&#x27;t see this making it any easier&#x2F;more reliable&#x2F;more effective than well-established alternatives.')
