When you build the Facebook of coding, you get the Facebook of coding.<p>The author has this spot on. Everyone who has ever emphasized things like &quot;your commit graph&quot; and metrics like &quot;number of PRs opened&quot;, or who uses GitHub star count to judge a project&#x27;s popularity is collectively responsible for this kind of problem.<p>GitHub is a good tool, but its social aspect does not optimize for meaningful coding contributions, it optimizes for <i>visibility</i>. I agree with the author that sr.ht would likely avoid this problem since it&#x27;s optimized for actual problems that programmers need to solve.<p>That being said, I think there are two other factors at play here:<p>1. I had a lot of internal debate about whether or not to say this, but calling it out for what it is – there is a bit of latent racism inherent in this outcry. A lot of the people making the requests seem to be male and South Asian, and I think this triggers people&#x27;s inbuilt resistance to South Asian names. They will fall over themselves to advise `alina_stravinsky599` on the best way to make a typofix, but will yell &quot;shitoberfest!&quot; when `navinshah53` makes the same PR. [1]<p>2. Digital Ocean seems to want to juice metrics and use Hacktoberfest as a PR marketing move, so they have no incentive to actually offer personal mentorship that can enable anyone to make meaningful contributions to Open Source. Their &quot;Beginners&quot; page (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com&#x2F;details#beginners" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com&#x2F;details#beginners</a>) recycles generic information about making PRs.<p>---------------------<p>[1] A personal, optional perspective regarding this: If you are a fellow South Asian man like me who actually wants to contribute to Open Source, remember that OSS maintainers will consider your PR as guilty until proven innocent. This is not fair, just like life. Your PRs need to be non-trivial, typo-free, and have perfectly passing tests. If you feel like submitting a simple PR to fix a typo or something, avoid the temptation and just leave it for others to participate in this feel-good fest. Consider spending that time writing closed-source code for money instead.')
