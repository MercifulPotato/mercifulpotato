If you need a piece of UI implemented, you copy&#x2F;paste the markup with the required classes added. There is no `modal` class that completely modifies specific nested HTML. And if it&#x27;s a complete palette&#x2F;padding change, then that happens in the config.<p>&gt; ...how do I prevent the same m-1 to have two different values, one from the shared component library and another from my own application?<p>`m-1` should never have different values in different contexts of the same project, unless the set of classes suffixed by `-1` is adjusted as a whole (ie- letting users resize the UI outside of the built-in browser magnification).<p>&gt; how you would use the &quot;purgecss&quot; feature in a large project<p>Purge should happen in deployment, not in development. That way if a class is added that has never been used before, it makes it into the site without issue.')
