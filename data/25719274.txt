Nix is not a &quot;package manager&quot; and I think it&#x27;s better at first to not think of it as one because you&#x27;ll assume how it works incorrectly. It <i>is</i> a package manager, but it doesn&#x27;t have the same workflow as yarn or etc. That trips a lot of people up.<p>2. You <i>need to read</i> the Nix Pills documentation. It is not long and guides you through every abstraction so you understand from the basics how it works. Nix is actually pretty self descriptive. I setup my home&#x27;s Linux Router entirely by just hacking and searching through the nixpkgs repo without understanding things, but if I&#x27;d read the Nix Pills things would have been so much clearer to me. Especially when debugging or reading through what a derivation was doing.')
