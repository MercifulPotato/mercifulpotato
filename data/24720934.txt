The Power architecture allows, for example, &quot;1st-class citizen&quot; status to GPUs w.r.t. main memory access: They can access main memory using NVlink. NVIDIA has therefore had some on-mainboard, non-card GPUs available mostly (solely?) in IBM power machines.<p>Obviously this is not enough for an entire cloud business but they&#x27;re not just an &quot;also-ran&quot; cloud offering.')
