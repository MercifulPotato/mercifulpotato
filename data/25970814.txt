For example, you shift-click your desktop, click &quot;Open Linux shell here&quot; and run imagemagick or ffmpeg to your heart&#x27;s content.<p>You can alias subl to your Windows sublime install and then subl ~&#x2F;whatever will work as expected.<p>I don&#x27;t experience any of your other problems. Apt is very quick, copy and paste works fine, typing latency seems lower than Linux (but I do have a 144hz G-sync monitor). I agree that Windows Terminal is a bit spartan, but I was never one for excessive terminal customisation on Linux either so it doesn&#x27;t really bother me, I guess.')
