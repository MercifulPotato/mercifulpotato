FinCEN regulations exempt from the definition of money transmitter those persons providing “the delivery, communication, or network access services used by a money transmitter to support money transmission services.” This is because suppliers of tools (communications, hardware, or software) that may be utilized in money transmission, like anonymizing software, are engaged in trade and not money transmission.<p>In simple terms, the Monero developers are providing software (the Monero network, nodes, and wallet software) that can be used for money transmission, but the developers do not need to register as MSBs unless they also have a side company that conducts money transmission.')
