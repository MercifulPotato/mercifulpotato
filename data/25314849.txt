I imported a couple of git repositories that ended up on <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;seedling.radicle.xyz&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;seedling.radicle.xyz&#x2F;</a>, so I thought I did it right, but then if I try to add projects from that very page it keeps searching and never finds anything (they&#x27;re stuck in &quot;keep looking&quot; mode).<p>Also I don&#x27;t see how you can create issues. Is it not implemented yet?<p>It&#x27;s an interesting project but it feels like very early alpha-grade to me. The client gives very little feedback on what&#x27;s happening and what you can do.')
