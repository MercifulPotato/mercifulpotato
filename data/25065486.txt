I suppose I had a similar feelings at the beginning of the year but then in March or early April I started to see for the first time the company I’ve built and run for the last 10 years losing momentum and this really caused me to re evaluate my life for many years I focused on “this time next year x bigger” but for me at the start of the year x had become big enough  and so with the prospect it maybe stalling I decide it was time to finally put my 4 year old 3D printer to good use and actually learn electronics.  A neat thing happened business started growing again and I feel much better.  I still have some down days but I feel like solving issues with the business is more fun and spending nights soldering and printing designs has been a great way to separate from the extreme stress for running a business... I think in my opinion you should find a hobby and start a new business ... it really is not about the money it’s about the problem and that wonderful high from solving it (ok it’s never solved but today it’s a little more solved then yesterday)<p>[edit] or buy a sail boat that could be a lot of fun')
