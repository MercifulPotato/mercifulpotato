Most people on HN and the tech community have asked for this, it&#x27;s been years in the making. Slowly, anyone watching has seen this coming and it&#x27;s not the end.<p>There&#x27;s a reason we (the tech community) used to be and generally do lean libertarian. It&#x27;s because we had to think ahead as we program, develop, we used to be innovators. We had to accepted people like Richard Stallman or Steve Jobs for that matter, because despite their faults, they contributed and drove things to a new level.<p>There may have been more of a &quot;frat&quot; style attitude, maybe. But from my experience the &quot;old guard&quot; was more nerds who didn&#x27;t know how to communicate well. Often this was off putting, there were inappropriate jokes, etc. That definitely needed to be redressed.<p>HOWEVER, the solution has been not been merely education and punishing those who are abusive, but a propaganda and indoctrination campaign. I&#x27;ve witnessed men being forced to apologize to an audience of their peers, literally saying &quot;I am sorry for being a white male of privilege.&quot; I&#x27;ve seen this at University and now it&#x27;s coming to corporations.<p>I&#x27;ve been in meeting and trainings where I&#x27;ve been ordered to only target minorities during hiring. When asked, &quot;why are we not recruiting from the ACM or IEEE clubs?&quot; I was told, diversity is a more important target, everyone graduating will have roughly the same skill level anyway. These are the now corporate entities running NumFOCUS.<p>The reality is now everyone wants a &quot;safe space&quot;. Which is not a &quot;safe space&quot; for discussion, but a &quot;safe space&quot; from feeling uncomfortable.<p>Today, we&#x27;re more concerned about the petty politics than building a future. For looking the most &quot;diverse&quot; or &quot;inclusive&quot;. The sacrifice has been a robust society or organization. We can&#x27;t have differing opinions without being excommunicated.<p>I&#x27;m done being silent.<p>I want to build a future I&#x27;m proud of and this isn&#x27;t it.<p>I wrote about it in my blog post titled &quot;On Committing Suicide&quot;[1], titled as such because saying any of this can <i>get me fired</i>. It can get me <i>banned on social media</i>. It&#x27;s eventually going to kill the United States. In the words of John Adams,<p>&gt; Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide. It is in vain to say that democracy is less vain, less proud, less selfish, less ambitious, or less avaricious than aristocracy or monarchy. It is not true, in fact, and nowhere appears in history. Those passions are the same in all men, under all forms of simple government, and when unchecked, produce the same effects of fraud, violence, and cruelty. When clear prospects are opened before vanity, pride, avarice, or ambition, for their easy gratification, it is hard for the most considerate philosophers and the most conscientious moralists to resist the temptation. Individuals have conquered themselves. Nations and large bodies of men, never. - John Adams, 2nd President of the United States<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;austingwalters.com&#x2F;on-committing-suicide&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;austingwalters.com&#x2F;on-committing-suicide&#x2F;</a>')
