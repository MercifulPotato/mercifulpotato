I believe I generally keep tabs on up and coming technology companies and never heard of Zoom until mid March. They kept popping up in media perhaps due to marketing effort? I still prefer Google Meet.<p>Edit: I am getting downvoted within seconds. This is just me asking an honest question. Hmmm...guess CCP got to keep Zoom alive.<p>Edit: My intention was not to be conspiratorial. I am genuinely curious how they rose so fast and what other factors played into their success.')
