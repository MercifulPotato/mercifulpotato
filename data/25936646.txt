You can take a CCS1 (J1772) cable and plug it into a car with a CCS2 port. And yes, the J1772 (CCS1) is by far the standard connector in the US market. I see that connector everywhere.<p>And yes, Elon could easily say &quot;Tesla is moving all production to CCS2, all future Teslas manufactured after today will be CCS2, all Supercharger stations will be retrofitted with CCS2 cables&quot; and we would be living in that standard where pretty much <i>every</i> car on the road can receive power at pretty much <i>every</i> car charging station. Pretty much every car in the US sold with CHAdeMO also supports CCS1 (J1772), I don&#x27;t know of a single model which doesn&#x27;t. We don&#x27;t live in this world because Elon would prefer for everyone to be locked into proprietary cables and a proprietary network. This is the *only reason* why. Sure, things were different 10 years ago when CCS was barely even on paper. As it stands in the market where I live there&#x27;s many more CCS chargers around than Superchargers, and many more J1772 cables (going by data from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.plugshare.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.plugshare.com&#x2F;</a> ). And yet articles like this tell everyone that this is not the case, that if you buy a non-Tesla you&#x27;re not going to be able to have any luck charging it out in the world, so no point in buying anything that&#x27;s not a Tesla.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s a straw man because no one is saying &quot;it&#x27;s preferable for consumers for Tesla to have a proprietary connector&quot;. And it&#x27;s not Tesla&#x27;s desire for a proprietary network to support its EV sales that causes fast charging to be a disaster in the US for non-Teslas.<p>By buying a Tesla you&#x27;re supporting the notion that proprietary connections are good. You&#x27;re choosing to buy a car with a proprietary connector. You agree earlier that Tesla wouldn&#x27;t move to an industry standard unless they were forced by regulators, and yet you also think they&#x27;re not purposefully pushing their proprietary connector for vendor lock-in reasons. It seems you&#x27;re trying to argue it both ways; that clearly it would be better for the consumer to have an industry standard connector and yet its a good thing for Tesla to continue to push their proprietary one continuing to split the market. You&#x27;re supporting a proprietary connector and pushing for that in the market while suggesting that nobody is pushing for proprietary connectors. How is what I&#x27;m saying a straw man?<p>I do agree fast charging is a disaster due to poor investment by the incumbent auto industry. They were hoping the 3rd party market for DC fast chargers would grow faster. A lot of 3rd parties have been slow to roll it out due to not having as much capital and not having as much of a market to cater to, as a good percentage of electrics being made and sold today in the US are Teslas. But, don&#x27;t you think if Tesla supported CCS2 we&#x27;d see a ton more third party CCS2 chargers spring up? Currently third parties are completely unable to build Tesla charging stations. You can buy a Tesla charger and freely offer it to your customers (and try and shoo away moochers), but you cannot build your own to sell electricity. There isn&#x27;t a 3rd party market for Tesla chargers, all Tesla chargers exist to push the Tesla brand and push vendor lock in. Sure, you can use an adapter to plug in a J1772, but you&#x27;ll never be able to use a CCS2 cable for fast charging and we&#x27;re really talking about fast charging here. On top of that, I&#x27;ve known a few Tesla owners who were unaware they could use an adapter to plug in to J1772 ports; they saw the cables were different and assumed it didn&#x27;t work.<p>An answer to the vendor lock-in exists today. Tesla can switch at any time. Continuing to support Tesla is continuing to support vendor lock-in. But they won&#x27;t, because then articles like TFA won&#x27;t scare people away from looking at anything other than a Tesla.')
