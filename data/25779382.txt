If we can&#x27;t do it here, I honestly don&#x27;t know where else I can do that.<p>I agree that it&#x27;s become a flame war, and IMO part of the issue is that at times people promote (up&#x2F;down) vote based on agreement, and at other times people vote based on promoting a good conversation.<p>I really want to see two voting mechanisms, an I agree woot, and another button that indicates is a well constructed argument that I think deserves conversation and views because it will promote healthy conversation.  I&#x27;m not convinced people would use these appropriately, maybe they sit behind a &quot;vote&quot; count or you only get 5 votes a day or something, IDK.<p>We&#x27;ve gamified agreement on these platforms, and I see things swing based on who shows up.  I&#x27;ve seen my votes swing wildly based on what I&#x27;m interpreting as someone of a particular ideology come through.<p>Either way we need to gamify conversation and not agreement, I don&#x27;t know how to do that, but I think HN would be a great place to experiment with that idea.')
