Also, finding a dock with reliable 2 monitor output has not been easy, and at the end I pluged both monitors to the laptop and call it a day. That the laptop has to power up the discrete graphics for running external displays and goes crazy with the fans while you are just browsing is something that exasperates me, but not being a really fan of apple, I&#x27;m not blind and see that what they have accomplished with the M1 is an exceptional product, and sooner or later I will ditch my 16 inch for one of those. The only thing is that almost nobody will want to buy an intel macbook and those aren&#x27;t going to maintain their value like before.')
