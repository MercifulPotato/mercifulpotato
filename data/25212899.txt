This current one assumes the signal must be from intelligent life and found a candidate that might possibly have intelligent life that might possibly have caused the Wow! signal, with no explanation for why said (possibly existing) intelligent life has not caused any additional signals since then. At least the comet explanation offers an explanation that fits the facts.')
