As an SRE, half the time my current company splits something off into its own service its for performance reasons driven by us. It’s just as often us working with the devs because we need X service off the primary database or Y service the ability to scale on its own as it is them having created a separate service of their own accord. Plus as an SRE, it’s a lot easier to wrap my head around what each service does on its own and what responsibilities are broken when its down than it is to understand the full workings of a monolith, and building monitoring around the smaller chunks is easier.<p>Obviously it’s possible to overdo it. Generally it seems that splitting out services as appropriate is more intelligent than just sitting down with the thought “we’re going to build a microservice architecture.” Goes back to the idea that gets banded around a lot that you should start with something as simple as possible and if you get in a situation where you are at the scale to need to rewrite then that’s a good sign for your business.')
