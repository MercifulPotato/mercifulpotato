Look at COVID 19, commerce (measured in restaurant reservations and retail purchases) dropped like 90% before the government lockdowns. The way to improve the economy and provide &quot;commercial freedom&quot; is to defeat the virus. The way to defeat the virus is though, amongst other tools like masks and vaccines, lockdowns. You could remove all the restrictions you want and things won&#x27;t go back to normal for business or their patrons until the risk serious illness from a disease is small enough that you don&#x27;t need to think about it when making evening plans. Additionally, when you reference &quot;banning cars&quot;, cars used to be extremely dangerous. We have cumulatively spent millions of hours and hundreds of thousands of human lives developing engineering solutions to make cars safer. Things like masks are like seatbelts, and &quot;suspending indoor dining&quot; is like adding a crumple zone to the front of the car and we do ban cars that aren&#x27;t sufficiently safe.')
