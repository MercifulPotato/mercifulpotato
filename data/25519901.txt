This has the effect of building a deep tree of different channels related to each other through the channel section. The user will only have to specify how many layers of the tree he would like to have so the algorithm can stop there.</i><p>Your proposed algorithm wouldn&#x27;t work for me because the <i>majority</i> of the good videos I&#x27;m exposed to in education&#x2F;science come from channels that are <i>not listed</i> in the channel sections of my subscribed list.<p>E.g., here&#x27;s a channel about machine learning that doesn&#x27;t list any other channels:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;YannicKilcher&#x2F;channels" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;YannicKilcher&#x2F;channels</a><p>Here&#x27;s another machine learning channel that doesn&#x27;t reference any other AI channels:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;K%C3%A1rolyZsolnai&#x2F;channels" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;K%C3%A1rolyZsolnai&#x2F;channels</a><p>Neither of the above channels reference each other but both have videos that are relevant to my interests.<p>Because the Youtube algorithm didn&#x27;t depend on building a &quot;channel tree&quot; from whitelisted channel listings, it can suggest quality videos from both of those channels that your algorithm would miss.')
