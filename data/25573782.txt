Every school child in America is getting vaccines. With very narrow exceptions, if you are off the exact timing (ie, you get a 12 month vaccine a bit later, you get the second shot 14 days later) which by the way happens ALL THE TIME because doctors and parents are busy etc - there is no evidence that the first shot is wasted or that you need to restart vaccination.<p>So please provide a citation for the &quot;first shot wasted&quot; claim.')
