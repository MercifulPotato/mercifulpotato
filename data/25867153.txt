Classical methods (under the auspices of “SPC”, alluded to in this post) are very outdated, but also, very ingrained in manufacturing circles.<p>I’m disappointed to see this only applied to a “toy” example...the real value is proven (or not, as is often the case) when the “rubber meets the road” and is applied to real problems on the factory floor. A POC like this is a nice demo, a fun exercise, but a <i>long</i> way from “productionized and used by real manufacturers.” The lack of a real example suggest to me this hasn’t actually been used in the field...<p>I’m also curious how one would communicate a very technical&#x2F;abstract model like this to existing practitioners of eg Six Sigma. My experience has been there is a lot of friction in introducing new methods in such an old-school setting: not only do old habits die hard, but quality engineers are often hired explicitly to do particular six sigma analyses. The difficulty is in convincing a client that these methods (a) can be useful and reliable in the context of traditional methods, and (b) aren’t intended to replace their role. I’ve seen the most traction w methods that connect directly to established SPC procedures, while also pushing the limits of these known and _interpretable_ techniques.')
