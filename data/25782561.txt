People come up with all sorts of weird off-the-cuff justifications for things. Medical staff, various home contractors, grocery-store staff all wear masks for extremely long shifts. HN logic seems to be: Poor people less-likely to social distance and wear masks -&gt; HN responds with all sorts of supposed sociological factors why they don&#x27;t and why it&#x27;s acceptable. Meanwhile, lots of poor people (who work in the aforementioned professions) actually do wear masks and safely practice all the precautions, so the HN peanut gallery just end up being patronizingly insulting to poor people.')
