Item(by='veddan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611605246, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25907338, text='The ASS format has some basic animation with the \\move command (moving subtitles using linear interpolation) and the \\t command (changing various properties of a line with the possibility of quadric interpolation). This takes care of some cases, but is often insufficient for complex stuff.<p>Aegisub however has good automation support, and has (had?) a pretty active scripting community. Scripts can do a lot of stuff and often has simple dialog-box UIs. The base scripting support is in Lua, but a lot of scripts are written in a Lua variant called Moonscript. I&#x27;ve never seen it used anywhere else. And, as was mentioned in a sibling comment, there are scripts for importing motion-tracking files into Aegisub.<p>The ASS format lacks support for a bunch of stuff that people want to do, or the native support is deficient in some manner, so scripting is very important for Aegisub. For example, a line can be given  a color gradient by make a one copy of the line for each shade in the gradient (this can be 100+ times). Each copy is then given a different color according to the gradient, and a \\clip command is used on each line to only show a 1-2 pixel wide slice of each line. If all those slices are lined up properly and the lines are displayed simultaneously, it gives the impression of being a single line with a color gradient. Tricks like this can actually cause performance problems in rendering the subtitles!<p>I think this is an interesting little programming niche, but there isn&#x27;t much complex typesetting being done these days. Tastes have changed, and due to licensed releases there&#x27;s less need for fansubbing on all but the most niche titles.')
