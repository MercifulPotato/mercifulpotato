I have always had shoulder pain, and tightness in my triceps.  No matter how much I worked on ergonomics .. mouse position, height, etc.  I have very broad shoulders&#x2F;chest, so putting my hands on the keyboard always bowed my chest in and rotated both shoulders slightly forward.<p>I use the UltimateHackingKeyboard (UHK) now for over a year, and my shoulder and arm pain have all but disappeared.  The UHK comes with a relatively short 3-4 inch cable to connect the two halves, and I found that was even to close together. I&#x27;ve since replace with a 12 inch cable and each half of the keyboard sits directly in front of the corresponding shoulder.  This lets my arms, pecs,triceps, and back muscles all be in a relaxed position.')
