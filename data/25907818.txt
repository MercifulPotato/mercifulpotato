It&#x27;s for certain that there will be some amendments to the GDPR and ePrivacy directive regarding the way cookies and tracking are handled for websites. In Germany the Bitkom is a good place to start if you want to make your voice heard, they have a working group on data protection that comments on the EU legislation process (you&#x27;ll be a bit late to the party regarding the ePrivacy regulation though, not sure if there&#x27;s still much room for change).<p>I don&#x27;t think a citizen initiative will be likely to succeed as the regulation has been in the works for a long time and will probably be passed in one form or another, and I really doubt the EU would want to amend the handling of cookies a third time.<p>BTW I develop an open-source CMP (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kiprotect&#x2F;klaro" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kiprotect&#x2F;klaro</a>) and the problem is a bit more complex than honoring the DNT header, as the user needs to grant or decline his&#x2F;her informed consent for all non-essential third-party services. In the long run I think this functionality should be implemented directly in the browser, but again this will require more than a single header IMHO.')
