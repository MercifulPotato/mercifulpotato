I hope your dreams come true.<p>- Do not fall in love with any ideas. Once you have a couple of people play-test something, if it doesn&#x27;t appear to be fun, be ready to discard it. A lot of things sound good in theory but generally don&#x27;t work in practice. Some things will work with some changes but you should always be ready to let go of something and move on.<p>- For gameplay, keep the implementation as simple as possible. It might be tempting to implement a &quot;generic&#x2F;abstract&quot; idea of something to get a clever implementation which works for many cases (which do not yet exist). Please think about the kind of bugs the resulting complexity could cause and whether they would be a pain to debug. Simplicity of implementation also makes it easy to refactor it later if you feel that it needs to be changed.<p>- Do not underestimate the work that goes into &quot;finishing&quot; the product. Once you have the basic concepts of the game working, you&#x27;ll need stuff like UI, save&#x2F;load&#x2F;replay, high scores etc. This is not overly complicated but it&#x27;s not trivial either. If you want to implement save&#x2F;load&#x2F;replay features, you may want to think about it in advance.<p>- I do not at all like Unity and love Unreal (no connection except unhappy and happy user respectively). However, just pick the one with which you will be more comfortable developing.<p>Again, I wish you luck and hope you have a lot of fun and learn a lot from your efforts.')
