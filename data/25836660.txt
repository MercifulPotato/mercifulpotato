And some clans certainly are criminal.<p>While a large criminal syndicate would be a combination of families (that act like a clan), a clan by itself does not need to be part of a criminal syndicate. Also if a person from a clan robs a bank then this doesn&#x27;t mean the clan is the cause (or the problem). Especially not when the group consists of a 600 or 1000 individuals who are part of that tribe. (whats your chances of bad apples over several extended family trees in the UK&#x2F;US&#x2F;France with such a size).<p>My point specifically is that the media will 100% of the time criminalize the word clan and by extension anyone who is born into it.<p>related: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;commentisfree&#x2F;2019&#x2F;nov&#x2F;13&#x2F;priti-patel-demonisation-gypsies-prejudice-bigotry" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;commentisfree&#x2F;2019&#x2F;nov&#x2F;13&#x2F;priti-...</a>')
