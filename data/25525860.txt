But despite Japan intaking a lot less, people who meet the &quot;baseline requirements&quot; (basically, college degree) can be consistently assured that they can get a work visa and not get arbitrarily kicked out of the country.<p>Similarly, even the smallest companies (like miniscule, 5-people startups) are able to get visas for people who meet the college degree requirement with basically no issue.<p>Also, they don&#x27;t tie your work visa to your employer[1], so you don&#x27;t get indentured servitude or the threat of getting kicked out of the country after being fired.<p>Meanwhile I have heard countless horror stories from many people trying to do even the most basic stuff when it comes to immigration in the US. And it sure sounds like you are, at a basic level, treated like a suspicious person who might be a criminal.<p>You can say &quot;oh look at the numbers&quot; but I have heard roughly zero positive things about the American immigration experience. And (what I think is the most important thing), I have heard many stories about the opacity and randomness of the American bureaucracy.<p>And, you know what? Most countries _don&#x27;t_ just kick someone out on the first crime they commit. And they don&#x27;t try to hold it over the head of the person. It&#x27;s possible to have an immigration system that doesn&#x27;t treat the people coming in as indentured servants.<p>[1] HSFP visa non-excepting, but if you can get HSFP you can get a standard working visa')
