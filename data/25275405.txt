Can you point me at countries that are widely accepted to have done a better job?<p>My own experience of the NHS (as a non-Brit who lived in the UK for more than a decade) is that it is inefficient at the small things (sitting in a waiting room for an hour - but being shamed if I show up 10 minutes late for my appointment) but brutally effective at big important things (treatment for life threatening diseases - worked well, but the biscuits were rubbish). I know this isn&#x27;t data, but I also know that British people love to carp about the NHS, and having lived with health services in two other industrialised countries, I quite liked it.')
