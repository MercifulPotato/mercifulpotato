Trust is all or none.  If you allow a switch in {x} country to connect to your switches, then they can spoof calls.  All it takes is one shady company with an SS7 link and they can resell access for all manor of spoofing.  The SS7 network really has no concept around levels of trust or banning specific connections from specific types of messages.  It&#x27;s a very ancient system, much older than the internet.  It&#x27;s only newer than the even more ancient &quot;A&quot; series mechanical phone switch networks.  To overhaul such a system on such a large scale would require building out a new system in parallel in my opinion.  I can not even fathom the level of bureaucratic battles, legal battles required for such an undertaking.<p>Back in the day, I wanted to nix a SS7 link to a shady vendor that was spamming cell phones.  I got in trouble for that.  &quot;They are paying their bills, leave them alone and keep your nose out of it&quot;.  That is another aspect of the problem.  Even if a telco wanted to stop abuse on their own network, it would not be permitted unless they are legally obligated to do so.  Even then, telco&#x27;s have more lobbyists than all the silicon valley big tech combined, no exaggeration.   That is just based on my very dated experience.  I have long since left telco and very happy I did.')
