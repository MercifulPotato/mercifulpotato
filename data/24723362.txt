That hasn&#x27;t caused the company to behave any differently. When approached by IBM to help my company build out our cloud infrastructure, we had salient measured targets and the reps (and subsequent &quot;technical people to answer our questions&quot;) who presented were woefully inept. I was the Director of Engineering, what did they think they were doing pitching me butterflies and rainbows? What IBM has done for decades, like all the other parasitic remnants of industry (Oracle, Yahoo, arguably Apple, etc), and no CEO is changing that culture.')
