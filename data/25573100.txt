You&#x27;ll be working less, so you can maybe expect to get paid slightly less than a 40hr salary. On the other hand, you&#x27;ll pay less tax, meaning your effective hourly salary will increase.\n\n    Maybe instead you should ask yourself: &quot;do I want to work more, or live more?&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThis is a bad pitch. Just tell people that it&#x27;s less and by how much and why. The last thing that people want is for someone to talk down to them, to give ambiguous non-answers or to suggest that they ask themselves different questions, especially when it comes to salary.')
