He certainly said a lot of outrageous or false things, but policy-wise he didn&#x27;t really make any horrible decisions.<p>So many of you want to desperately believe that the abnormal situation in the US can be pinned on one man and that once he&#x27;s gone everything will go back to normal, or if not the situation will normalize to a certain extent. That just doesn&#x27;t seem possible.<p>Trump is just the convenient scapegoat for the disastrous globalisation which hollowed out American industry, for the race but especially class conflicts which were <i>never</i> really settled and for the ultra-aggressive capitalism which creates many more losers than winners and for the two party system which is fundamentally vulnerable to corruption.')
