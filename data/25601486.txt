I loaded up on folks in my industry only to be blindsided with a barrage of insanity. Honestly think that 75% of the people in my feed in serious need of a wellness check. I can&#x27;t imagine the damage being done to young folks observing the behavior of adults on that platform.<p>Twitter&#x2F;Reddit are always, Always, ALWAYS wrong about everything.[1]<p>... and thank God for that.<p>As one whose political and cultural beliefs are, like yours, mostly opposite that of Twitter&#x2F;Reddit&#x27;s as a whole, the sites&#x27; existence (including subreddits like &#x2F;r&#x2F;politics, &#x2F;r&#x2F;news, and &#x2F;r&#x2F;worldnews) is gratifying and validating.<p><i></i><i>If the mass of Redditards&#x2F;Twitter users agreed with my opinions I&#x27;d carefully reexamine every one of them.</i><i></i><p>As bloodraven42 wrote in response to a pretty cringe-inducing example of a Redditard (who was agreeing with an even more cringe-inducing example (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;np.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;AskReddit&#x2F;comments&#x2F;urodq&#x2F;british_guy_here_considering_a_job_in_la_but&#x2F;c4xxeny?context=3" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;np.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;AskReddit&#x2F;comments&#x2F;urodq&#x2F;british_guy_...</a>)):<p>&gt;Please note the fact that you&#x27;ve gotten this impression from &quot;reading Reddit&quot;. I assure you, reading Reddit gives you about as accurate a portrayal of reality as reading North Korean &quot;news&quot;. Did you know Kim Jong Il is literally a God?<p>As Anal_Justice_League added:<p>&gt;So wait, your world view comes from reading <i>Reddit?</i><p>&gt;Do I even have to explain how catastrophically stupid that is?<p>And as 1foryes said in another thread (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;np.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;canada&#x2F;comments&#x2F;be2p5a&#x2F;cbc_predicts_ucp_majority&#x2F;el2rfl2&#x2F;?context=3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;np.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;canada&#x2F;comments&#x2F;be2p5a&#x2F;cbc_predicts_...</a>):\n&gt;But fortunately, reddit does not represent reality. If it did, the ice caps would have melted years ago and we&#x27;d all be fighting in WW6.<p>[1] Except bacon')
