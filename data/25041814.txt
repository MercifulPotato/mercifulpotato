I use FreeBSD for my network storage. I find them to be a massive net savings admin hassle for those roles, but it&#x27;s way, way too much hassle for any web server I have now and there&#x27;s just no way I can tolerate either as a workstation. I might as well run Windows... Even MacOS is too much of a hassle to use as a main workstation. Linux offers &quot;locally run all your stuff exactly as it is on prod&quot;, in exchange for a kinda janky desktop experience. It&#x27;s worth it to go MacOS on the laptop as it&#x27;s just so much slicker in exchange for not being able to do everything on the go. But I guess it all depends on what kind of stuff you&#x27;re supporting.')
