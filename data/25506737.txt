I think 50% workers around do not negociate..<p>(Even equality comes from power struggles: it&#x27;s a concept invented by poor &#x2F; not powerful people to unite behind a concept and creat a &quot;group power&quot;.)<p>It&#x27;s the cold harsh reality to me.<p>I come from a left wing family where class awareness was present so it&#x27;s a concept I think would be nice at a society level to have more equlity.<p>But where I don&#x27;t have any sympathy to people who earn less, is that in the engineering world, when you try to explain this, most people get angry or tell me that I&#x27;m an asshole. Also they don&#x27;t want to make unions and refuse to engage in any power struggle. I am not an asshole, I&#x27;m trying to be realistic. However in that caae they are the literal clich√© of the &quot;nice guys&quot;. Well let&#x27;s say I tried. Now I don&#x27;t care being called an asshole, it&#x27;s even a compliment to me. You want more ? Fight for it, don&#x27;t be just &quot;offended&quot; or &quot;sad&quot;.')
