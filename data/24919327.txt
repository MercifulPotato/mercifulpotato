Actually I&#x27;m going to assert this is only true if your friend is referring to hidden back doors that he believes exist. I don&#x27;t believe any employee of a chip company is aware of a back door knowingly added to their own product (with one exception see below).<p>I say this because NSA seems more clever than that, and because any scheme to explicitly add back doors is bound to be eventually exposed.<p>Instead they do things like have their former employees and contractors hired into tech companies, and those folks add innocuous bugs that can plausibly be denied as back doors. Also I bet they look for bugs that can be used as back doors, given access to source code and chip design data, then fail to fix them.')
