Item(by='l0b0', descendants=None, kids=[24956978], score=None, time=1604191571, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24954511, text='In terms of price and quality there is just a huge gap between IKEA and other furniture sources (at least in the Western countries I&#x27;ve lived in). Basically, it&#x27;s virtually impossible to find products of similar function at the <i>same</i> price, and even at <i>double</i> the price it&#x27;s a toss-up whether the quality will be better than IKEA. Sure, if you can afford to spend a fortune on furniture you can obviously find better stuff, but most of us can&#x27;t.<p>For example, my 15-year-old IKEA leather couch has gone through three moves already, and is basically as good as new. I could afford it in my first job out of college. The Billy bookcases look a bit janky sagging under the weight, but are holding up even without extra support.')
