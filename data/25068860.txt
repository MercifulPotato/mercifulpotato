They can provide discounts which Apple will not do directly to the customer, and which other resellers can&#x27;t do because they don&#x27;t turn enough units.<p>That&#x27;s true of many other common goods worldwide.  Unless you can buy a locally made item in a lower purchasing power country, you will usually pay a currency exchange equivalent price for the item.  Actually you often pay more because the local shop selling the product cannot get bulk pricing and pass along the discount to you.<p>Finally, when you add the local taxes - 23% in Portugal, for example - the price can be much higher compared to Alaska, US (&lt; 2%).  That last bit is really not Apple&#x27;s fault.')
