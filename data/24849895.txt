I had a pretty robust answer then[1] with lots of details.<p>The short answer is: the Amlogic chip&#x27;s ARM &quot;Bifrost&quot; GPU is still basically unusable, because ARM has a huge problem upstreaming anything, but that could maybe change some day. But the rest of the platform is what I would classify as &quot;fantastically well supported&quot;, and will run excellently with a mainline kernel (and also with fantastic uboot support)[2].<p>We&#x27;re still some time away from boot-systems being standardized, so uboot is &quot;the&quot; way to go pretty much now, which targets embedded systems, but eventually we all hope the Server Based Boot Requirements[3]- which mandate ACPI and UEFI support- will become semi-standard, such that we can use better secured &amp; more capable standardized bootloaders.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24813526" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24813526</a><p>[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;linux-meson.com&#x2F;doku.php#kernel_mainlining_progress" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;linux-meson.com&#x2F;doku.php#kernel_mainlining_progress</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.arm.com&#x2F;iot&#x2F;b&#x2F;internet-of-things&#x2F;posts&#x2F;arm-server-standards-part-2-sbbr-specification-released" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.arm.com&#x2F;iot&#x2F;b&#x2F;internet-of-things&#x2F;posts&#x2F;arm...</a>')
