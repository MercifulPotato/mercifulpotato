You&#x27;re completely and utterly wrong. You don&#x27;t understand.<p>I&#x27;ll reiterate my example a SQL string is pure. Just like the IO monad is pure. However when you&#x27;re coding the sql string in your &quot;pure&quot; haskell program you have to account for imperative side effects related to the SQL itself.<p><pre><code>   sqlString = &quot;UPDATE X SET X.Y=2 WHERE X.Z = 1&quot;\n</code></pre>\nsqlString is technically &quot;pure&quot; but that doesn&#x27;t mean you can treat the UPDATE command in the string as a pure concept.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter how &quot;pure&quot; your language or sqlString is... the concept of a mutation leaks over into the language and the programmer still has to deal with the concept.<p>Like you&#x27;re original post said. The interpretation of the monad is different, and the programmer still needs to account for this in how he composes things together. The concept leaks across boundaries.<p>edit&gt;&gt;this whole karma thing is unfair. Posters can&#x27;t vote down responses. I simply state my opinion the person responds then votes me down because he disagrees. What&#x27;s the point of even having a discussion?')
