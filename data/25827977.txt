The step-by-step format using code diffs made everything very clear and easy to follow along. If you&#x27;re a beginner or intermediate Rust developer, Phillipp&#x27;s series of tutorials can also be useful as a guide to structure a moderately feature-full codebase in a way that is easy to grok. Great work and I&#x27;d love to see a similar series like this on other topics like building a Markdown parser or basic key-value database for example.')
