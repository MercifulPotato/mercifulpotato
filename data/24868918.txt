Likewise - if you were in the office for 9am, <i>why</i> log on at 8am at home?<p>If the only thing stopping some people from overworking themselves are simple environmental cues, that sounds like something that needs to be solved, and solved quickly for homeworking (and by any non-asshole manager). It&#x27;s unlikely it&#x27;s not going to be a major part of knowledge working in the future. For a lot of us, we&#x27;re already <i>months</i> into doing this full time by now, and likely, months away from even venturing back into the office part time.')
