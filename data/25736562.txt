It caused so much migraines, eyes pain and nausea that I had to stop playing it. Never had a game capable of switching so fast and erratically in the range 900p-700p and 28-15 fps to actually cause physical symptoms on my body.<p>I got a refund, bought the xbox version and played on xbox series s and it was actually pretty good even with graphics clearly &quot;old gen&quot;-level compared to the pc version.')
