India is far far more employee friendly than Europe and most parts of US.<p>The point of what you are talking about from a legal system is inapplicable to labor laws. I can throw the same Black-Lives-Matters issues in US courts to you and ask you to go and check New York courts for the same.<p>In the same vein, I can throw Anthony Levandowski case and make the claim that California is unfriendly to employees. Neither of them is true and neither is the fact that India is at all unfriendly to employees.<p>Quite the opposite we have a rich ecosystem of employees founding startups - Flipkart, Ola, Unacademy, Paytm are the new founding &quot;mafias&quot; of India. There is exactly zero cases of employees have lawsuits by their employers.<p>Indian (and the US) legal system and their myriad problems are true - with all its racist vs religious biases - but that has nothing to do with California employment practice or the Indian ones')
