E.g I just published a novel,and Amazon did not in any way validate that the ISBN I have them actually belonged to me - I had not yet registered the book data, so what I told them would not have matched anything they might have looked up.<p>In this case, based on the reviews on Amazon, it looks like someone changed the description of an existing product, and that the ISBN probably actually belongs to a book.')
