Normally I use a card, but on a few occasions I have left it at home or forgotten to top it up, and bought a ticket with the app.<p>When it wasn&#x27;t scanning and I took my phone off the scanner, I briefly glimpsed the Apple Pay screen before it animated away, so I realised I was &quot;holding it wrong&quot;, and was able to get it to scan by holding it at a different angle to keep the NFC sensor at the top of the phone away from reader, but I can imagine a less technically minded user than myself might have serious problems.<p>I don&#x27;t know anything about the scanner or NFC standards used by this system, sorry.')
