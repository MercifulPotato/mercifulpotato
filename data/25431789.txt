Item(by='WA', descendants=None, kids=[25434687], score=None, time=1608049823, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25431613, text='&gt; &quot;Their account&quot; is their account on your platform.<p>You mean, the Apple account on my platform? How does it get there? I don&#x27;t have the Apple account of a user. I just have an email address.<p>&gt; &quot;Their device&quot; is a device that they own and that you are collecting information about.<p>I don&#x27;t collect information about their device. But you still didn&#x27;t answer the question. What is &quot;their device&quot;? Is it a unique device ID? A fingerprint? What is it?<p>&gt; Are you linking it to _ANYTHING_ else ? Yes or no ?<p>I use the email to create an account on my backend. Users can backup data to their account. But nothing ties to &quot;identity&quot;. They could fake all of it. I don&#x27;t care. I send transactional emails, such as a reset password email.<p>&gt; Or are you collecting an email address (or hash of an email) as part of broader set of data you are collecting from the user ?<p>Not PII data, just stuff they enter in the app.<p>&gt; Or are you collecting an email address (or hash of an email) and then sending it off to Facebook or other API in an attempt to build a picture ?<p>No.<p>But the details of your questions show, imho, that the concept of identity is non-trivial.<p>I can summarize it very simply: users sign up for an account, identified by an email adress (I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s real), as a service for the user to have an online backup and an easy way to sync data between devices or move them to Android. The goal is NOT to personally identify a user. But could a user be identified by the email address alone BY SOME ENTITY? Yes, probably. Do I do it? No. Do I share the data or offload it to a third party for data processing? No. Or does my rented self-managed VPS, where the backend runs, count as third party? I don&#x27;t think so. But of course, I use a transactional email service to send emails to users. What about that? I do have a GDPR-compliant data processing agreement for that. But not sure what Apple wants from me in this case.<p>Thing is: It&#x27;s not trivial and Apple&#x27;s guide is insufficient. That&#x27;s all I&#x27;m saying.<p>Edit: And to clarify â€“ if it&#x27;s complicated, data collecting entities such as Facebook could say &quot;well, we did understand this differently&quot; and simply don&#x27;t tell the truth about the data they&#x27;re collecting. I guess that is another point in this whole discussion: What if someone lies about their data collection practices? Any consequences? Are there downsides to lying about it?')
