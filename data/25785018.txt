Item(by='Gaessaki', descendants=None, kids=[25785516], score=None, time=1610669380, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25783152, text='I’m working on a restaurant delivery cooperative: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;radish.coop" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;radish.coop</a>. It’s basically like the other delivery platforms, except that it is owned by its users (so restaurants, employees and consumers) which vote on its direction and partake in its proceeds. I’m a restaurant owner&#x2F;programmer who felt that things could be done more equitably and feared that the continued dominance of the current crop of platforms would lead to a quasi-monopolistic&#x2F;monopsonic situation like for Uber and the taxi industry and Amazon in e-commerce.<p>Late 2019, some colleagues and I quit our jobs to move onto other endeavours with this as a side-project and since then it’s become a full time gig.')
