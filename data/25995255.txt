Environmental conditions are probabilistic. And we&#x27;ve been trusting our safety to physical products operating in the real world for a long time.<p>Whether physical or ML or whatever ... There&#x27;s always some process that you can&#x27;t characterize to your liking. So you explore mitigation options until you can make a decision about whether to accept the risk. Standards and regulations enforce that you went through those steps to get a reasonably trustworthy result.<p>Then liability law applies in the usual way. Actuaries and accountants tell you what it&#x27;s going to cost you, and market research tells you how much it might sell for.<p>Inability to control or understand what you built doesn&#x27;t absolve you of any fault or responsibility. All it does is change your risk acceptance criteria.')
