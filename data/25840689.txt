Item(by='matwood', descendants=None, kids=[25840835], score=None, time=1611100575, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25837542, text='&gt; and your group is not making every effort to expel associations with said nazis<p>This was the most bothersome part to me. Trump talked about wanting to punch protestors, but tip-toed around actual Nazi&#x27;s supporting him and coming to events. He would eventually denounce violence or hate after being prodded, but never seemed to be able to state plainly if someone is a Nazi, then GTFO.<p>Personally, if I&#x27;m in a group and literal Nazi&#x27;s are also allowed in the group, that&#x27;s not a group I&#x27;m going to remain a part of.')
