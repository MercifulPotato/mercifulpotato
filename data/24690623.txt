That&#x27;s at least 3.5 million over 90 days, or 40k a day <i>on average</i>. Peak was likely double, maybe even treble that, given lockdown on 23rd of March dramatically cut infections.<p>We&#x27;re likely testing somewhere in the region of 50% of actual cases. There&#x27;s the non-symptomatic cases where about equal to the number of symptomatic cases, so double the absolute number -- some with symptoms will refuse to be tested because they don&#x27;t want to miss work, some without will be caught by contact tracing, those two groups probably cancel each other out.<p>As such I&#x27;d expect 50k&#x2F;day to be the &quot;March equivelent&quot; - with doubling every 10 days that means another 2 or 3 weeks.<p>It&#x27;s not just about absolute cases though. Cases have been doubling roughly every 10 days, as have deaths. Deaths lag cases by 2-3 weeks, so I&#x27;d expect deaths in 20 days to be continuing to double even if we all stayed in an isolated booth from now.<p>Ultimately the concern is we&#x27;re heading into flu season when hospitals are stretched, and cases, hospital admissions, and deaths are all increasing.<p>Hopefully flu season will be milder due to social distancing and due to more vulnerable people having been killed off, but either way we need to get a grip soon. Or just abandon any pretense of trying to stop its spread.')
