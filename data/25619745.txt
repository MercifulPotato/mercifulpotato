But with each attempt my admiration for them just kept growing. Cause these fuckers with their spec of dust sized brains keep chugging along the next day morning as if nothing at all happened. Its like every calamity is just a minor interruption to whatever they are upto. \nSo I just use their model. My mantra over time has become - &quot;Dont sit around appreciating the pain. Get back to work&quot;<p>But the caveat here is, as with the ants, you must have a goto list of things to do. When I was younger I had no idea what I wanted to do so the mantra worked terribly. But the older I have gotten the list of things to do has grown. So like the  ant no matter what happens theres always something to do.')
