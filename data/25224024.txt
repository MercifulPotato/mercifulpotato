I found that flipping back and forth between the lilypond &quot;source&quot; and the rendered result was too slow. I read music notation much better than lilypond&#x27;s &quot;musical LaTex&quot; notation and I found it hard to remember the nuances each time I came back to it. (Adding lyrics to an existing piece was the last straw).<p>I switched to Musecore. Although I generally eschew GUI apps I much prefer it to LP: I can see my editing changes directly without the &quot;compile, run&quot; steps. My efforts are less DRY, to continue the programming metaphor (eg copy&#x2F;paste the chorus) but that&#x27;s acceptable. I don&#x27;t plan on writing any massive symphonies. As @rekado elsewhere on this page, I don&#x27;t have to act-as-programmer when I&#x27;m making music.<p>Musecore has had lots of criticism of its design but that area has apparently improved a lot recently. It might be &quot;Word for music&quot; but it&#x27;s a mostly-complete-but-simple version (so... Word 6? AbiWord?). Works for me.')
