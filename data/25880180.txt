Epic Games Store), then they have boosted PC revenue by 32.5% (accounting for the 60% of Epic games owned by Tim Sweeny) just from this single change.<p>Now admittedly this is just the PC portion of sales, which probably account for roughly 50% of total sales.<p>These economics are the same for all other acquisitions by platform holders. If you don&#x27;t like it, then agitate for Valve, Sony, Microsoft, Google, Apple to reduce their commissions to 10-15% - or for Governments to do it for them.')
