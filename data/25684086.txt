The entire argument seems to hinge on this but it is not (as far as I can see) explained.<p>Are people accepting Tether in trade for BTC under the assumption that Tether will always be exchanged 1:1 for USD when this is not actually the case?<p>EDIT: The answer seems to be yes Tether is 1-to-1 with &quot;I O U $1&quot; and enough people are accepting these IOUs in exchange for BTC that the market is moving because of this.<p>That last part (&quot;the market is moving because of this&quot;) seems so unbelievably stupid to me that I don&#x27;t actually believe it.')
