Then it added a yellow strip at the top, &quot;Message deleted. [Undo]&quot;. So, instead of double-confirmation, GMail implemented Undo more thoroughly.<p>This was better in two ways:<p>(1) It wasn&#x27;t a pop up! I hate pop-ups. I don&#x27;t think anyone likes pop-ups.<p>(2) A computer asking you &quot;Are you sure?&quot; is as annoying as a human being questioning everything you say. It is nice every now in then, when it really was an accident. But most of the time, it isn&#x27;t. Another metaphor is a mechanical device that is failing. You press the button, and it doesn&#x27;t work. You have to press it again.<p>The whole approach breaks your flow, implies contempt, and by definition is frustrating.<p>The approach of &quot;just let you do it and provide an undo&quot; isn&#x27;t recent anymore, and sadly, Google seems to be drifting away from it. I see more and more pop-ups and &quot;Are you sure?&quot; messages.')
