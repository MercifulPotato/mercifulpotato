And really I don&#x27;t want to waste my time trying to parse if this is yet another bait and switch to keep the funding rolling.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s not possible, but our surface navy is a bunch of sitting ducks to a semi-modern state military like China. Missile guidance can seemingly be adapted in so many ways to bypass point defenses, from raw speed, pop and drop, decoys, swarms, and other techniques.<p>Finally, I bet cruise missile tech can be adapted quickly to drop torpedo warheads for the &quot;last mile&quot; if the aerial point defense is that effective and a 40-50mph ship actually is that hard for guidance to target.<p>RE: swarms, I still remember the... was it the Millenium war exercise where a general used swarms to defeat the &quot;good guys&quot; and they basically stopped the exercise and forced them to restart and not use swarms?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Millennium_Challenge_2002" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Millennium_Challenge_2002</a>')
