The annoying thing about that, unlike highways much of the funding for residential and commercial roads is paid for by local taxes.<p>When I think about transportation I think about a paper I read about development of rail. The US and UK&#x27;s experience is you run into market failure with private rail. The broad based benefits and network effects are diffuse, too many people and businesses benefit indirectly. Which means you can&#x27;t charge high enough fares to pay for a optimal system.')
