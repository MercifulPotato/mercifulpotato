Item(by='floatingatoll', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610933924, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25808021, text='&gt; Matrix operations are ubiquitous across heavy-weight computation, including stress analysis, physics simulation, machine learning, video and sound processing, compression, ray-tracing.. why would Apple limit their market?<p>Apple offers frameworks that accelerate the relevant operations, and has over time shown an ongoing willingness to limit their market, even when that’s seen as unpalatable or unprofitable or unhelpful to themselves or their users. I assume that the frameworks offering acceleration will expand their uses somewhat over time. I expect those frameworks to be the only compelling solution for having portable matrix acceleration across the complete spectrum of Apple Silicon hardware revisions over time, especially if Apple revises their undocumented operations and updates their frameworks annually (which they can easily do, since each year’s hardware release already demands the latest macOS to boot at all).')
