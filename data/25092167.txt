It&#x27;s your problem if you become entrenched in their (or Apple&#x27;s &#x2F; FB &#x2F; whatever) services.<p>I have a google account to test my devices &#x2F; emulators. Never logged in gmail with that account, never will. If they cut it off, I can make another.<p>Same with Apple. I have an Apple free ID for running virtual machines with MacOS &#x2F; iOS and that&#x27;s all. I tell my customers to create their own Apple ID and I deliver them the sources + dev environment and they make their own binaries and publish on Apple store. My job is done once I make the app run on emulators and I tell them from the start of the project this.<p>I have a FB account to talk on FB mess with parents from school and that&#x27;s all. I don&#x27;t even have them as friends there, I am just in 3 lists and that&#x27;s all.<p>Also i use protonmail currently as I&#x27;ve started migrating from yahoo 2 years ago (old e-mails still there, I open that e-mail like once per month).<p>Do the same, you&#x27;ll be free. Also you can use an e-mail account outside of google domain to actually create a google account, if you really need one.')
