Then lots of nice to have stuff such as, shared_ptr, threads, lambdas (make STL a lot more usable).<p>Personally I&#x27;d not want to be maintaining a C++98 style of code base at this point.<p>That being said you have probably already written all of the &quot;nice to have&quot; stuff so there&#x27;s no real value benefit to go and replace it as such. So I understand your POV as well. That being said I&#x27;d probably modernize the code as I go whenever I touch any part of the codebase.')
