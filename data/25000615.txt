Item(by='ertian', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604600946, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24996846, text='&gt; Much of this boils down to &quot;IPv6 sucks because it&#x27;s so different from IPv4&quot;<p>In fact, &quot;IPv6 sucks because it&#x27;s not broken in the same ways as IPv4&quot;. NAT, for example, was only ever a hack to get around limited address space, and the fact that it &#x27;hid&#x27; your internal network was an accidental side effect. People started architecting their networks around that, and now are annoyed that IPv6 isn&#x27;t broken in the exact same way.<p>Saying that IPv4 gave you network privacy for free is like claiming that old-school single-line home phones were an advantage over personal cell phones because they gave you some amount of extra privacy &#x27;for free&#x27;.')
