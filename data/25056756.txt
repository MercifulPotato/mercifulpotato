I do concede that you have found something which says the definition is not the same for everyone. Otherwise the definition you listed in quotes is about intentional use of force. The other definition is specifically called &quot;psychological violence&quot; in the part you quoted. There too, I have on complaint and no disagreement. That, however, is not the same as &quot;violence&quot;. To be able to communicate the concept you had in mind, without conflating the two, that part you quoted specifically adds the qualifier &quot;psychological&quot;. With that qualifier, I think it&#x27;s just easier to communicate and we probably wouldn&#x27;t even be having this long exchange.')
