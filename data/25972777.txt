We had found equivalent fingerprintability with deep-learning classifiers when eavesdropping on the traffic through Wireguard. It&#x27;s interesting though to see the stark difference they found between fingerprinting HTTP&#x2F;QUIC and HTTPS when using only the first ~40 packets. The trends in those early packets had also allowed us to easily differentiate between the two types of traffic over the VPN.<p>Our paper, in case you want to read more on this area: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;petsymposium.org&#x2F;2021&#x2F;files&#x2F;papers&#x2F;issue2&#x2F;popets-2021-0017.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;petsymposium.org&#x2F;2021&#x2F;files&#x2F;papers&#x2F;issue2&#x2F;popets-202...</a>')
