My gf is liberal, I&#x27;m conservative. We have lively debates about it, but we respect each other and never let politics get in the way of the relationship. It&#x27;s as simple as that.<p>But over the last few years friends called me a nazi and a racist, coworkers ostracized me for having unfashionable political views, many people cut contact entirely under the premise that I &quot;support&quot; white supremacy. This isn&#x27;t some shit you easily forgive, and it isn&#x27;t something you ever forget.<p>This wasn&#x27;t just about politics, or teams, or policy preferences, or red vs blue or whatever. This is people denying your humanity on no grounds whatsoever, and when you point it out they say &quot;well, minorities have always felt this way, so shut up and take it.&quot; That&#x27;s fair enough, but it isn&#x27;t about groups of people oppressing other groups of people. It&#x27;s about Bill and John and Sally-- people who used to be friends and colleagues-- treating me like I&#x27;m a monster for no reason whatsoever other than a mass psychosis. That&#x27;s not something you can ever come back from.')
