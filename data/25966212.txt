Sev0 exploits, RCEs, and the like, well, those updates still get pushed down unless you have a corporate install with policies disabling all updates.<p>There is a trade off, and for decades (!!) Microsoft let users decide, but eventually &quot;1&#x2F;4 of Windows users just got their machine 0wned&quot; showed up in the press too many times.<p>Kind of like how every time there is a widely installed Android malware app, Google gets blamed. &quot;Why don&#x27;t they enforce their policies!&quot; Then soon as they do enforce their policies &quot;The Android app store should just be a dumb distribution mechanism!&quot;<p>I get it, different people expressing those sentiments (I hope...), but balancing &quot;keeping people from having their bank accounts cleared out&quot; vs &quot;user choice&quot; is not the easiest of decisions. After many years, MS has gone full force on the auto-updating side of the debate.')
