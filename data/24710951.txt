Had another one at 20, when I realized that not getting into a FB internship would probably set me back permanently from my goals.<p>Now I&#x27;m 24, work at Amazon and widely considered a disappointment to people in OP&#x27;s social circles. The pain has waned a bit, but the crisis is just constant now, like the roar of an engine on a long airplane flight in coach. Eventually the discomfort of the resting your head on the window and the anger you feel at the people with lie-flat seats paid for by Google and Facebook overpowers the rest.')
