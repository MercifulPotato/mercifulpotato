I think solutions to certain problems are universal and the way we implement those solutions is the interesting part. Of course my library was never optimized for large-scale DOM mutations or other such real-world issues, but it’s always fascinating to see someone develop similar solutions. So why did I even write my own library? It was more out of curiosity than  need. I also like to understand how “magical” things work, and for me, the best way to understand something is to try to do it myself, even if I don’t end up fully completing whatever “it”\nis. Discovery is a powerful benefit that I feel modern software engineering doesn’t provide as much as it used to.')
