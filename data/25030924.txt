This does appear to be a single isolated case and not a widespread issue.<p>&gt; That’s not a coincidence, it’s the slope of the line when the left encourages an insurrection<p>I can see how you&#x27;d make a slippery slope argument here. However you&#x27;re mixing it with some serious hyperbole that diminishes your argument. The left in the US isn&#x27;t some homogenous, well organized group. You&#x27;re taking millions of people, many of whom would not be consider &quot;the left&quot; in other countries, and lumping them all together. That&#x27;s a huge oversimplification.<p>Can you show me where there are calls for insurrection? Most of the protests in the US in the last year that I&#x27;m aware of have been non-violent or were intended that way by their organizers. Some have had violence break out. While I&#x27;m sure some of the people involved have been on the far left wing you can&#x27;t blame all of the violence on the left wing protesters[0][1].<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;virus-outbreak-race-and-ethnicity-suburbs-health-racial-injustice-7edf9027af1878283f3818d96c54f748" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;virus-outbreak-race-and-ethnicity...</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webcache.googleusercontent.com&#x2F;search?q=cache:bGtLQhSsS8IJ:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;22&#x2F;who-caused-violence-protests-its-not-antifa&#x2F;+&amp;cd=6&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webcache.googleusercontent.com&#x2F;search?q=cache:bGtLQh...</a>')
