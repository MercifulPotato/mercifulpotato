Albon is in the back seat at Red Bull and he is in the same position as Raikkonen when he was at Ferrari: as far as everyone at Ferrari was concerned, it was 90% Vettel, 10% Raikkonen. In that sense, Albon is pretty much alone. Giovinazzi on the other hand made a very big mistake initially - he had Raikkonen of all people to learn from. Even beyond the experience, Kimi is quite possibly the most knowledgeable driver out there, not only as far as setting up a car but also sportsmanship. And it seems Giovinazzi eventually figured that out. When he started off, he acted like a truck, not an F1 driver. These days he is a lot more composed and is getting really good results, considering he is in one of the slowest cars out there. I&#x27;m pretty sure he has Kimi to thank for that.<p>Hamilton is a very different story - let&#x27;s face it, he is the silver spoon boy. I really don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a single person in F1 history who had it as easy as he did. While Michael was always riding with one foot over the edge of the rules.<p>It&#x27;s not to say that all of them aren&#x27;t incredibly talented. But it does seem to me that for most of them circumstances played a much bigger role than their actual skills. Hence the reason why I wouldn&#x27;t rule out either Albon or Giovinazzi as potential champions.')
