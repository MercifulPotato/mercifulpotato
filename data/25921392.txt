Item(by='zmmmmm', descendants=None, kids=[25922526], score=None, time=1611697202, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25918717, text='It&#x27;s interesting, Gitlab is one of the products I most want my organisation to pay for but am constantly defeated by their pricing plans.<p>It sort of maps onto this decision because what I consistently found was that Bronze offered almost no value in terms of features but the step up to Silver was so big that there was no way we could dive in at that level. So we just lived on the free tier and by and large get by with that.<p>Part of the problem is having a lot of users who interact with the system at a fairly casual level. To license everyone at Silver&#x2F;Premium would be really prohibitive. But licensing a small number up to Premium and leaving the rest on free or bronze doesn&#x27;t work either.<p>Gitlab is one of my favorite products so I really want it to succeed.')
