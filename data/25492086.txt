No one is saying the USA doesn&#x27;t have a problem with racism. Racism is something that infests the American way of life totally. The obvious being said, the voices that speak for black people will find racism everywhere even if they have to create it themselves. Their victimhood is always the center of the universe. Even in this article which is about racism toward asians we are talking about black people. The most racist people I&#x27;ve ever met in my life have been black people. The only time I&#x27;ve been physically harmed because of something I&#x27;ve said has been due to black people. I&#x27;m so fucking tired of the world acting like they are perpetual victims when so many of their problems are self caused. Black activists always tell me injustice anywhere is injustice everywhere but when it&#x27;s their own racism no one blinks an eye. Lebron James can&#x27;t shut the fuck up about racism but he&#x27;ll throw the Chinese under a bus to sell shoes. Black people have no problem with racism when it helps them and they are not then final arbitrars of racial justice.')
