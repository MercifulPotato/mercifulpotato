It was not meant to be compared to the specific issue of AWS &amp; Twitter. It was meant to draw our attention to the fact that we wholeheartedly endorse many systems (e.g. roads) that absolutely facilitate immoral and criminal activity. And that&#x27;s ok to do. Thus I claim that it&#x27;s similarly ok to endorse absolutely free speech without limits, <i>despite</i> the immoral &amp; illegal activity that it might incite.<p>Roads <i>encourage</i> bank-robbers. Honestly who would rob a bank if you could only flee on foot? It&#x27;s ok though that it encourages and facilitates bank robbers. We should not close the roads because of it.<p>We need to be OK that certain things (free speech) can have huge negative effects and criminal elements.')
