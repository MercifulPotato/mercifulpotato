All sets of conditions for which data is available form only a tiny subset of all possible conditions, so increasing the training data from (say) 0.1% to 0.2% of possible inputs is not going to move the needle much.<p>In this instance in particular (mortgage default prediction), generating better predictions will produce shifts in the very conditions observed. The possibilities for emergent behaviour in a system as complex as the mortgage market are very large.')
