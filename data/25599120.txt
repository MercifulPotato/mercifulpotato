Item(by='simonblack', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609461203, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25594361, text='A better way of specifying &#x27;train&#x27; would be to add &#x27;or part thereof&#x27; to the definition, especially with those tiny image fragments they give you. So yes, part of one railway car is defined as a &#x27;train&#x27;.<p>Another part of that problem is that the images given are usually US-centric.<p>Many of us from other parts of the world expect to see those boxes where we post our letters as not blue, but red or yellow, or perhaps something different again. A blue box is just as likely to be a rubbish bin for us &#x27;foreigners&#x27;. And our taxis might not be yellow, but black, white or some other colour.<p>Unfortunately, where acute vision is required to differentiate items, faulty vision will often lead to bad selections. Maybe spectacles can fix that, maybe they can&#x27;t.')
