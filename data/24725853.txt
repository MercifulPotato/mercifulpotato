App errors are handled the normal way.<p>I usually try to avoid 500 and 400 errors in my applications, but for something like a network error, that obviously <i>has</i> to be handled client-side since, well, the server isn&#x27;t available.<p>So you can write a three liner to handle it:<p><pre><code>  htmx.on(&quot;htmx:onLoadError&quot;, function(evt) {\n    htmx.find(&quot;#error-div&quot;).innerHTML = &quot;A network error occured...&quot;; &#x2F;&#x2F; or whatever\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThis isn&#x27;t code that would be hit regularly, unless your application or the network is in pretty bad shape.')
