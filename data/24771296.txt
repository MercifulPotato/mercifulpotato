The primary market for this device is people who already own an iphone. They already have lightning charging capabilities in their bedroom, in their car. A new charger is pretty optional for the &quot;main&quot; market.<p>There is a minority of people, like myself, who are basically entirely on USB-C and can charge my laptop, ipad and android phone all on the same cable. Including lightning to USB-C is... well, honestly, it&#x27;s not that stupid because most of my charging ecosystem now is USB-C, so this very slightly lessens the blow. Slightly.<p>Who am I kidding, I really wish it was just USB-C.')
