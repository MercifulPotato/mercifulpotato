And with fuel at 10 cents to 20 cents per mile assuming a $2.50 to $4.00 per gallon fuel cost and 20 miles per gallon, and insurance is another 5 cents to at most 10 cents per mile ($600 to $1,200 per year for 15k+ miles), you should be able to get the cost of a mile down to somewhere between 20 cents to 40 cents.')
