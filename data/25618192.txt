I&#x27;ve been in VFX around ~6 years and was in the sw industry before (and the hw industry before it).<p>I find VFX really fun as far as job! Sometimes I do think about leaving mostly for Pay reasons but the pay has been decent enough recently (basically FAANG base pay without RSU&#x2F;Bonus...).<p>It is interesting how we have a lot of big scale problems that goes unrecognized, I find the problems really challenging. Compared to when I worked in the software industry we had a team 10x as big for a problem 100x simpler.<p>Outside of some big tech companies, biology, oil industry and finance, I cannot imagine many companies having such a big scale on number of cores&#x2F;memory&#x2F;disk.<p>Working in Pipeline I haven&#x27;t found crazy hours yet, has been mostly a 8h&#x2F;day job that I can disconnect after I am done. Also with Covid some people even switched to 4 days weeks which is quite interesting.<p>Anyho, thanks for sharing your perspective!')
