I chose Feedbin because it is 1. A paid subscription, I forgot what I paid, but $50&#x2F;year I want to say and 2. A ton of RSS apps support it. I like the clear cut relationship and expectations of being a customer, not merely an entitled user with a free account, and I like that Feedbin is effectively platform agnostic and not tied to a specific client as long as you have a client that supports it.<p>NetNewsWire is my preferred client, but this is as much out of complacency as anything else. I’ve used some version of NetNewsWire for close to 15 years now. The current v5 series of releases is a very neat client, has a good team led by Brent Simmons developing it, and while I’m not sure what the feature is called, has a neat reader mode that can load the whole post even in partial-post feeds.<p>I use RSS mainly for blogs and webcomics, but I have a couple of news sites loaded in there as well. Most of those also send me Newsletters which I have automatically forwarded to my Instapaper account from my Inbox. I skim most posts, read some others in NetNewsWire, but if an individual post is long and I want to do more than skim, it goes straight to Instapaper. If it’s worth keeping for reference or to read again, it goes from Instapaper to my Pinboard Archive. I mark the news feeds as read about once a week regardless of whether I’ve gotten to it or not because most of it has a shelf life and if there was anything important I probably heard about it on some podcast.')
