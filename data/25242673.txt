For incremental builds to work at all, you have to supply the smarts.  Having worked on a number of make-based projects (I am most scarred by buildroot), I can tell you that people make mistakes with build rules.  The project then devolves to doing a clean build for every change, turning what could be a few milliseconds of CPU time into a 30 minute rebuild.<p>The idea of these build systems like Bazel is that the rules are correct so that you don&#x27;t have to worry about writing correct rules, and you have a high probability of an incremental build producing a binary that&#x27;s bit-for-bit identical to one from a full build.  The result is that you don&#x27;t do full builds anymore, and save the latency of waiting for things to build.  (That latency shows up in the edit-build-test cycle, how long it takes to deploy software to production to fix an emergency bug, etc.  So it&#x27;s important!)')
