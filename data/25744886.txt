It&#x27;s fairly common to mix up stateful firewalls with NAT. You can have a stateful firewall without NAT, but you can&#x27;t have NAT without a firewall. It&#x27;s actually the firewall that is keeping track of connections.<p>The big difference here, though, is carrier-grade NAT. That means the firewall is not under your control and might have a tiny state table. NAT is bad enough as it is, but CGN should never have happened. It&#x27;s just depressing to think about, to be honest.<p>Even with IPv6 many ISPs are still doing it wrong. They&#x27;ll give subscribers dynamic prefixes which means having to use unique local addresses (ULAs) in addition to their Internet routable addresses because the latter keep changing. This kind of stupidity makes people at home want to hang on to their IPv4 LANs because they seem more under their control.<p>If only I could get an ISP like Hurricane Electric to provide me with a DSL line at home for a reasonable price. Consumer-grade ones are all hopelessly bad.')
