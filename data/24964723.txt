There&#x27;s rarely been an interruption where I personally thought it was justified.<p>The interruptions for clarification and false assumption are not the interruptions OP is talking about. In the example given, person B does not try to actively take control of the conversation, just quickly inserts a correction and allows person A to continue. So there&#x27;s no need for persona A to say &quot;let me finish my thought&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s not that women should be made to feel more comfortable giving these soft types of interruptions... it isn&#x27;t that hard to correct someone&#x27;s factual mistakes. It&#x27;s that interruptions are used by dominant people as a political tool to assert hierarchies and for control. Women do it too, it&#x27;s not a gender issue but I can imagine it more difficult in gender imbalanced teams and with gender stereotypes in play.<p>In my opinion if a person has to say &quot;can you let me finish my thought&quot; the interruption is never justified. Even if someone is rambling or mistaken, there are better ways to deal with that - for instance, asking them to be more concise in their presentation of their point. Being proud of a culture of interruption is admitting politics is how you make your decisions and how your team works together.')
