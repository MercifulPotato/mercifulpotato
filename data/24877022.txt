I would suggest that a better way to pose your point of view would be to ask, &quot;Are there ways to mitigate the automatic triggering of actions in smart contracts?&quot; Posing your point of view as a question like this would be more likely to foster a healthy discussion because there are certainly ways to mitigate the extent of automatic actions (multisigs etc...). And who knows, everyone might learn something as a result of the discussion!<p>Disclosure: I work in the cryptocurrency space and generally think hackernews doesn&#x27;t know how to have productive discussions about cryptocurrency.')
