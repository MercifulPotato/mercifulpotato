It&#x27;s a running joke with my wife that I&#x27;ll be leaking blood without even knowing I cut myself.  Or I know, and just don&#x27;t really care.  Several of my friends are similar.  It does lead to awkward explanations sometimes.  My wife still doesn&#x27;t really understand how I can have a great big scabbed over wound or a nice big purple bruise with not the faintest idea when&#x2F;where I did it.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m low on empathy, either.  But I hide it pretty well, bury it quite deep.')
