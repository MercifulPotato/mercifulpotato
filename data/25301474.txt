For lower-level classes such as calculus we all use the same book, decided upon by the department as a whole, but when teaching upper-level classes I generally choose as I see fit.<p>I am curious, what form does this expectation&#x2F;pressure take? At my university, if administrators tried to do this, my colleagues (at least the tenure-track&#x2F;tenured ones) would briefly chuckle, delete the email, and not remember it five minutes later.')
