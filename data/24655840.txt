Does this feel just as noble?:<p>... resort to rape to try to stay afloat<p>... resort to killing your son to try to stay afloat<p>... resort to beating their wife to try to stay afloat<p>Yea, it&#x27;s hard for them to avoid those actions but they still destroyed other people&#x27;s lives and opportunities. I think we should be helping troubled people before they become so desperately troubled that they resort to violent crime. That includes all the people who restrained themselves and don&#x27;t get the sympathy for being an ex-con but still have a terrible life and desperately need help.')
