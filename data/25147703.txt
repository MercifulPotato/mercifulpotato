It should also be noted that much of that money went to ultra-right-wing militant organizations, who have zero respect for democracy or freedom. Essentially, the USA bought itself a (fascist) private army to take control (or at least try to) over the natural resources in East Ukraine and Crimea. Russia responded rather predictably to that.<p>Some might even argue that they had every right to do so. I&#x27;d love to see Americans react, if Russia were to sponsor some kind of anti-US militia in Alaska, that would subsequently take control of state (military bases with missile launch facilities included). I&#x27;m pretty sure that US citizens would call that for what it is: an act of aggression.<p>No, the reason Russia doesn&#x27;t invade Poland or the Baltic countries isn&#x27;t because of NATO. Ironically, if those countries are at risk in any way, it&#x27;s probably rather because of NATO. NATO (and its members) keeps insisting that the organization is defensive in nature only, yet its actions tell a rather different story (and it has done so for a long time, at least since the &#x27;90).')
