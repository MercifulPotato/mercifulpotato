If you&#x27;re not happy, change job.<p>I try to be very stoic when dealing with other people&#x27;s code: you can&#x27;t control how things could have done in the past, so don&#x27;t make your happiness depend on the quality of a codebase.<p>Freelancing is going to be almost as boring as normal work: sure, sometimes you&#x27;ll be able to select a cool project, but most of the times it will be the usual boring stuff you do in the office.<p>Plus you have to chase invoices, sell yourself, market yourself.<p>Building your own product is not much different than freelancing (lots of boring tech) but you&#x27;re breaking the relationship between your time and money.<p>I think it&#x27;s entirely feasible to make a living with a small tech product - and it will allow to invest your time in more interesting and ambitious projects.<p>I suggest you to:\n - Collect small business ideas you can easily automate\n - Look at YCombinator startup school talks, ignore the part about doing a business that will make billionz but keep all the other tips on how to make money\n - Learn something about selling &#x2F; marketing\n - Look at levels.io presentation Bootstrapping side projects\n - Save enough money to be comfortable with assuming some risk\n - Try to build something that you like and that solves a problem\n - Indiehackers &#x2F; Producthunt are good places to chat with like minded people')
