The OP was dramatically wrong about Go being more verbose than C# when the exact opposite is true.<p>Go has support for assembly and supports SIMD intrinsics just fine. See for example <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bamiaux&#x2F;rez&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;vscalers_amd64.s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bamiaux&#x2F;rez&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;vscalers_amd64.s</a><p>My point is that if you want to KNOW which language is faster (as opposed to trying to PROVE that YOUR language is faster) you wouldn&#x27;t compare a C# code optimized with SIMD intrinsics with Go code that doesn&#x27;t use SIMD intrinsics.<p>The problem with BenchmarksGame is that it doesn&#x27;t try to enforce apples-to-apples benchmarks.<p>It&#x27;s fun thing to see how far you can push a given implementation if you&#x27;re willing to spend a lot of time on it.<p>It compares implementation of the benchmark code, not the quality of the compilers on the code that you&#x27;ll actually write in real life.')
