I can either set a high value on my land and pay to much in taxes, or pretty much guarantee that someone would by my land. Why wouldn&#x27;t they? They can buy the land, immediately place a higher value (they make the money on the resale) then charge a user few to cover the tax plus their income. \nAs a current homeowner about the only thing I can do is place a high value on the land myself. Enough that is someone buys it out makes it easier for me to move. But then I&#x27;m paying higher taxes. Of course I have the problem with the new house.\nEssentially this removes land ownership from the average person. Some might say that isn&#x27;t a bad thing, but it is when only the rich can afford land.')
