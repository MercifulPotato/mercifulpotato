This is a difference from traditional channels which have a distinct flavour and are subject to watchdogs (in my country, UK, at least).<p>No parent has time to watch TV with their child all the time up until they&#x27;re 18. You might say &#x27;well don&#x27;t let them watch TV&#x27; and that&#x27;s a valid choice. But other parents want to choose safe ranges of programming and have someone else police stuff to make sure it stays in that range.')
