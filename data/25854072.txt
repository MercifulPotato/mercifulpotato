It&#x27;s India&#x27;s state of the art. Dismissing the work being done here is a bit insulting to people working very hard to make it seem they do no work at all.<p>n for bjp accounts analyzed = 2,71,579 accounts<p>n for congress = 1,22,023 accounts.<p>Its fascinating stuff.<p>Also what you find is that internet forums usually get the people who are unhappy. The happy people aren&#x27;t online. During the congress&#x27; tenure you had EVERYONE crying against the congress and everyone was a BJP supporter.<p>Today the roles have reversed. I bet it switches if the BJP drops from power.')
