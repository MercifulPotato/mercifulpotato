It&#x27;s actually not universal at first.  It starts in 2021 offering seats to black, brown, illegal immigrant, teen parents and other traditionally &quot;disadvantaged&quot; groups first when it kicks off in 2021 and doesn&#x27;t ramp up to full universal service until 2030.\n There&#x27;s an additional tax increase that will take effect in 2026, that takes the marginal tax rate from 1.5 percent to 2.3 percent for single people making over 125k and joint filers making 200k.  On top of all that, the measure would over-pay teachers 77k above the market rate, which is 33K.  There&#x27;s also the additional rider that they will prohibit suspensions.    If you ask me, this bill only passed since it pushed the responsibility for paying for it to someone other than the majority of people in Multnomah county.  It would have been more fair if there was a sense of shared sacrifice and skin in the game with everyone contributing to it.   I imagine there will be more tax increases to help pay for all of the increase cost of a) people moving into the county for this free perk and b) people moving out of the county to not have to deal with this additional tax.')
