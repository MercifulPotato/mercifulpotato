Massive heatsinks give me the ability to turn off all fans and still stay at safe temps for anything that isn&#x27;t a taxing game like Red Dead 2. I also 3D printed a new GPU shroud in high temp PLA that allowed me to place some Noctua fans softly mounted on the stock heatsink (which was already massive).<p>The case itself is a Quiet PC case. Rock solid cases if you want one case to last you forever, even if you don&#x27;t want the quietness they are just very stout.<p>I usually overclock my PC once the parts stop being enough but I love the silence so much that I will probably just buy better parts this time around, rather than require over the top potentially loud cooling.')
