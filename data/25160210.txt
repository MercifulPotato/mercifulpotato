It&#x27;s about 45 minutes from alright skiing (Eldora) and 2 hours from great skiing in Summit county. Golden is closer to Summit county, and still close to climbing, but the climbing isn&#x27;t as good&#x2F;diverse.\n* In Utah, you can do some river stuff (not traditional surfing) in Moab and the climbing is darn good. You can also live in SLC and you are 30-60 minutes from climbing and 15 minutes from Alta (depending where in the city you live) which I hear is world class.<p>Boulder, Denver, and SLC all have great SWE job markets.<p>I don&#x27;t know any place in the USA that has all three. Maybe Hawaii (not sure about the climbing, but I&#x27;ve heard of folks skiing in the morning and surfing in the afternoon)? Maybe southern California?')
