Priority goes to the high impact low effort stuff first, and low impact high effort generally goes the way of the bin. Strategic alignment is also import whenever priority is evaluated.<p>&gt; Hint: good PMs won&#x27;t just base it on gut feelings or anecdotal evidence.<p>Sure, good PMs tend to collect great evidence from customer interviews, usage data etc. However, getting too hung up on data is sometimes a trap. I&#x27;ve seen some great ideas from teams - some even fully implemented - shot down by other PMs because there was no research.<p>What if you don&#x27;t have the data, but the idea is something you know will generate massive value? This is the exact issue startup ideas face... no one knows if an idea is valuable until it&#x27;s tested and a product hits the market. But early stage founders and great product managers might just <i>know</i> something is the right idea yet have zero data to back it.<p>Any product a product manager has ever worked on was initially created from nothing. Data wasn&#x27;t generated until people took a risk and delivered.')
