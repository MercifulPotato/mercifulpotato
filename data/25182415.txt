Replace politics with religion to see why.<p>You can try to be clever by listing ways religion might relate to business, but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that businesses generally, and in many ways are legally required to, let people do their jobs regardless of their faith.  It works just fine.<p>Everyone knows it&#x27;s possible to make things more political.  Being apolitical means doing the opposite.  It&#x27;s a very simple concept from kindergarten, &quot;more&quot; and &quot;less&quot;.<p>Drawing some strained connection to politics doesn&#x27;t magically make it impossible for us to say &quot;try to have less politics at work&quot;.<p>If I followed you around all day complaining that you&#x27;re not vegan enough, you&#x27;d suddenly regain the ability to notice that some things are more political and more related to your job than others.')
