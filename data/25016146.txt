It only really started moving away from those plots in the second half of the second season - after the cancellation was already announced.<p>For SG-1, the finale of the 8th season was intended as a bookended series finale, it getting renewed was unexpected.  However, I think they handled it well, continuing the series long theme:  First, the Goa&#x27;uld who pretended to be gods with technology, then the Ori who truly had powers of gods.  Teal&#x27;c has a good line at some point where when talking to the other Jaffa he has to change tactics, changing his argument from &quot;they are not gods&quot; to &quot;are they worthy of being called gods?&quot;<p>I also find it interesting that you liked the SGU concept but not so much SGA, considering the part you called out has a parallel with that one:  For the majority of the series, Atlantis was a mystery not truly under control of the expedition.  They gained access to it bit by bit the same as the Destiny.')
