This self selects for getting screwed. I would go so far as to say it is not possible to invest in private markets responsibly, outside one’s employer’s stock, with solely $5 to $25k cheques.<p>This is different in the public markets where the burden for disclosure is on the issuer. There is still risk. But you can’t buy Apple stock that loses money when Apple goes up. Options are complicated. But the complexity is standardised. It is totally possible, on the other hand, to buy common stock in a company that gets restructured to zero, or invest in an SPV that loses its shares to third-party repurchase rights. No amount of Googling will save you because the terms on each deal are bespoke.')
