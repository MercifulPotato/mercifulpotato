Or that there are enough counterfeits in at least one of them to cause the average to drop so substantially? And that is a more likely outcome than covid affecting a substantial portion of the population causing a drop in reviews?<p>The reply this tweet thread is based on is from the seller&#x27;s own website themselves seeing a large increase in negative reviews from customers that state their candles have no smell.<p>I feel jumping to conclusions about a rise in counterfeits is unnecessary.')
