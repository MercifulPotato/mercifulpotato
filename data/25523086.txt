Singing, writing, learning a new language, surfing, volunteering as a firefighter, just to name a few.<p>I get it. Some people likes fixing stuff, building stuff with their hands, and it&#x27;s perfectly interesting to them. At the same time, it&#x27;s not that interesting to other people. Just like not everyone cooks, and that doesn&#x27;t mean they are not enjoying their meal.<p>Last week, I spent a few hours learning about plumbing, in an attempt to fix my disposal. My quest failed, and I had to call a plumber, who fixed it in under a minute.<p>Next time, I&#x27;ll call her directly.')
