They said the exact same thing for the v2 -&gt; v3 transition of VLC.<p>And then completely broke playback of my music collection, because the containing folders had square brackets in their name. eg &quot;[2015]&quot; or &quot;[FLAC]&quot;<p>VLC 2 worked fine with those folders.  VLC 3 <i>refuses</i> to recognise music files in those folders.  Because square bracket characters &quot;aren&#x27;t valid URL characters&quot;.<p>We&#x27;re talking about folder names, not friggin URLs.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trac.videolan.org&#x2F;vlc&#x2F;ticket&#x2F;19594" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trac.videolan.org&#x2F;vlc&#x2F;ticket&#x2F;19594</a><p>That was a regression right there, but they just ignored the problem and refused to fix it.<p>Grrrr.')
