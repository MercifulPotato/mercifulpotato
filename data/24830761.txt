Fingerprints are left everywhere, and can be lifted and reproduced with common household substances (tape, glue etc).  A face can be photographed, printed and presented trivially.<p>And so far, biometrics falls far short of a 4&#x2F;5 digit lock passcode. The entropy in most fingerprint sensors is a few bits. They are famously defeatable.<p>Nothing will change the fact that you cannot keep your face and fingerprints secret, cannot&#x2F;won&#x27;t change them, and they are always, always traceable to you. Using them to secure a &#x27;better&#x27; key is not security at all.')
