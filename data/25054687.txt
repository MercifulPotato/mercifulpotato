As some nobody I once emailed him directly because I&#x27;d discovered a bug in some framework thing with a reproducible example. He actually replied and cc&#x27;d in the relevant people at MS and after a short while there was a workaround and a fix and a KB article or something (it&#x27;s so long ago I barely remember). Impressed? absolutely. MS still have some pretty good and accessible folks, and I&#x27;m a huge fan of Scott Hanselman who&#x27;s a great brand ambassador for DevDiv (and not beyond a few self-deprecating MS jokes about the company&#x27;s past).')
