If you&#x27;re born in a place you will have a birth certificate and can get documents to prove you are supposed to be there. I&#x27;ve never been to a country where this wasn&#x27;t true. If you immigrate to a place you&#x27;d equally have documents to prove you should be there and can acquire things like a driver license or id cards to take with you. Barring complete war zones or jumping the border wall, I don&#x27;t know of a place where this wasn&#x27;t the case.')
