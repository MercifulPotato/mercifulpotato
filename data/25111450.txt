They are not saying parallels will run windows ARM. Read carefully and see what they&#x27;re actually saying. There is not even a hint that parallels will run windows ARM on M1 macs, but the sequence of sentences creates the illusion of one.<p>Parallels, like vmware, is depending on microsoft here.
