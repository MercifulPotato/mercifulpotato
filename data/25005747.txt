Services that would die in stupid ways. Painful configuration that would have been abstracted out were I running containers on k8s (some benefits might be realized with Docker compose, but docker on its own is much more brittle than k8s).<p>So much SSH-ing to a node to tweak things. apt-get fscking the server. Etc.<p>Oh, and logging being shitshow.')
