Sometimes literally lowest bidder gets the job.\nSame thing in Russia. In almost every startup i saw here in Cy started by Russians, founders have no idea how to code. They mostly siphon off cash from someone rich and dumb enough. Naturally technical part doesn&#x27;t matter all that much to them.')
