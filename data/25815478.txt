Failure of a unit implies failure of the leadership.<p>I&#x27;ve heard the same &quot;leadership principles seppuku&quot; and sure, this would be consistent with that ethos.  (In my experience, that kind of buck-stops-here ownership happens less often than not.)  But this isn&#x27;t the part of your comment I want to argue.<p>&gt; In my view, the right outcome happened here.<p>I disagree (if it was a subordinate).<p>If the responsible party was a more junior member of HR, I&#x27;d like to see the blowback land on the actually culpable party.  (That could be in addition, or alternative, to the leader&#x27;s resignation.)')
