A distinction needs to be made between &quot;big city&quot; and &quot;midwestern city&quot; - they aren&#x27;t mutually exclusive like some are alluding to (probably not on purpose). I think that it actually goes against the trend, since I&#x27;d consider it a &quot;big city&quot;. It is interesting that so many people are moving there, considering the hot thing these days is moving away from big cities. Of course part of that is the fact that it has a good COL, and a lot of big city perks')
