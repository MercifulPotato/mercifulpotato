There were stupid user journey things that I knew needed fixed. There were some features I knew needed added. And I knew the pricing was wrong.<p>I spent some hardcore time working on these things back in March &#x2F; April and since then my MRR has continued to grow.<p>My product is SongBox (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;songbox.rocks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;songbox.rocks</a>) - it&#x27;s an alternative to things like bandcamp and soundcloud for creators who need to share audio files privately.<p>I&#x27;m at a stage now where I&#x27;ve bottomed out all the work I&#x27;ve wanted to do and I&#x27;m looking for a fresh round of feedback. Would love you guys to check it out and see what you can think of.<p>Thanks!')
