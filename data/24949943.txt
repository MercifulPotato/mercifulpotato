It&#x27;s completely insane.<p>Preach it! I don&#x27;t know where this mentality comes from, but it seems to treat software as something that just magically solves problems and only needs a little upkeep to chug along.<p>The problem is that problems <i>change</i>, and a different problem is no longer necessarily a <i>solved</i> problem. It takes a lot of design effort to make something that can easily be adapted to changes in the problem space, and it still requires effort to make sure the software doesn&#x27;t specialize itself over time into a corner.')
