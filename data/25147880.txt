I never gotten why people replay for achievements or stats, and I get bored by online games that focus on leveling. Even multiplayer based on competition and community are not really my thing. My favorite games are story based, and I hate the recent trend of RPGs to have free world grinding and base building for no reason other than stats and achievements. I was one of those people angry at the online Fallout game, for example.<p>And that being said, I DO also watch stupid TV. Recently, my wife and me have been watching Gilmore Girls, which is an objectively &quot;bad&quot; late 90&#x27;s soap. I haven&#x27;t watched Emily in Paris yet, but I might!<p>So I think there are people who require these shows as because they need background noise, however I also think that sometimes some shallow soap is exactly what you might want to watch.<p>In any case, kudos to op for implicating the author&#x27;s dislike of Emily in Paris with the inability to enjoy Jim Jamush movies. A masterful troll move.')
