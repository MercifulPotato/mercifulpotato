I haven&#x27;t gotten around to watching <i>American Gods</i>, and <i>Westworld</i> isn&#x27;t my thing, but I also enjoyed the title sequence for <i>The Man in the High Castle</i>.  It isn&#x27;t one of the ones I&#x27;d watch every time, just because it&#x27;s so chilling, but I do very much enjoy it.  The show itself was incredible, of course, and also has a bit of a chilling feeling to it.  It&#x27;s a perfect fit.')
