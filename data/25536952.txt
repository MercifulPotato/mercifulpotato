It is extremely tasteless to offer this kind of incentive to employees especiay during a year where many are struggling financially. This would be slightly more acceptable if the bonus was actually given to the employees. People who really dont see the issue with this most likely havent been in a situation where a bonus can be a lifesaver.')
