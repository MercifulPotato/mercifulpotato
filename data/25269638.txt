That doesn&#x27;t include all the pre&#x2F;post work getting to&#x2F;from the line, paperwork to do and meetings to attend.  All of that is probably another hour or two every day.<p>&gt;&gt; two hours of commuting and personal hygiene<p>We don&#x27;t all live next to the factory.  I&#x27;d say two hours just for commuting.  As for personal hygiene, I leave it to the ladies here to comment on how much time they need to put in each day. I (military) can shower&#x2F;shave in under 10 minutes when necessary, but I get to wear the same clothes every day and certainly don&#x27;t worry much about my hair.<p>&gt;&gt; a full six hours per day to use however she likes.<p>Work emails to answer.  Kids to cook for.  Bills to pay. \n Paperwork to do.  Shopping.  Taking the car to the mechanic.  Dentist appointments.  Elderly parents to support.  Carpets to vacuum.  LIFE.<p>&gt;&gt;eight hours of sleep .<p>lol.')
