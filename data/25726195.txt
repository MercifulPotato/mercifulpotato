I really don&#x27;t see why a user would make a conscious choice to activate E2EE on Telegram but not verify the fingerprints on Signal. In both cases a manual step is involved.<p>As others have pointed out, there&#x27;s no good reason to have no E2EE by default in 2020.<p>Signal also protects against a whole lot of passive attacks (e.g. bulk collection), which Telegram doesn&#x27;t. Any vulnerability in Telegram&#x27;s servers and all your chat history is made public. I don&#x27;t know how Signal secures their servers, and I don&#x27;t have to care.<p>Security-wise there&#x27;s no good reason to use Telegram vs Signal.')
