The ESP8266 chip itself is obviously not open source but the module surrounding it is. But yeah I agree, these are pretty meh... I&#x27;ve actually used one of these Olimex modules and there&#x27;s nothing special about them. IMO, being OSH doesn&#x27;t really do all that much for you in this case, especially when the actual chip isn&#x27;t also OSH, and these modules don&#x27;t even have FCC pre-cert. They&#x27;ve also been around for a long time, from what I remember they were one of the earliest crop of modules with most&#x2F;all of the pins of the ESP8266 broken out that became available.')
