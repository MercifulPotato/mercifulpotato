The best thing was emailing and waiting for another week or so, hoping the case would be picked up by a human being that would take the effort to really look into the issue.<p>Now Apple doesn&#x27;t even allow you to access the logs to begin with and even if they would they can be royal dicks during the review process, but I was always under the assumption I was dealing with a human at every step from the initial rejection and once I een simply could explain what my business case was over the phone with one of their people instead of endlessly mailing back and forth. Nothing has been stuck for more than a week.')
