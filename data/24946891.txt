IRV doesn&#x27;t pass the favorite betrayal criteria. IRV also causes a weaker definition of what it means to be a spoiler[1]. Specifically you should look at monotonicity[2].<p>I&#x27;d encourage you to dig a bit into electionscience.org (they have some good YouTube videos as well) as they do a deeper dive on some of these topics. There&#x27;s a reason Arrow himself was a fan or cardinal systems. The other part is that we need to consider factors other than VSE and spoilers. A lot of people get hyper focused on VSE (typically Condorcet supporters) and while it is an important factor 0.5% isn&#x27;t a big deal (really a few percent isn&#x27;t). Also you might want to check out our (HN) resident voting expert&#x27;s[3] comments, because he links to a lot more information.
