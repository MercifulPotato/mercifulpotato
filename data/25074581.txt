For myself, I can usually install most things I need directly from apt-get using the OS&#x27;s built-in repositories. This route seems to take care of any dependency issues without manual intervention. Although if you&#x27;re using third-party repos, or installing software outside a package manager context, I can see how that would increase the chance of niggles. My only remark there would be to focus on distros which emphasise a well-curated set of reliable packages out of the box, designed to be compatible with one another (LTS releases, or even BSD if you are open to it).')
