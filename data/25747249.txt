Stickers<p>2. Status<p>3. Stories<p>4. Chat wallpapers<p>5. etc.<p>I guess it shows the different ways people use chat apps but I don&#x27;t see any use case for status or understand why people want stories in yet another app. I&#x27;m sure they have their reasons though. Quite an interesting thread of requests.')
