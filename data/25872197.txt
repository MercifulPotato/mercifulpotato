The red scare really did do a number on y&#x27;all.<p>Geopolitically speaking, opposition to colonialism and imperialism (and their neo- variants) are generally considered to be leftist ideals. Internationalism skews left and globalism skews right, despite American conservatives&#x27; pearl-clutching in that regard. Decentralisation of power (with the extreme including advocating for anarchic&#x2F;acephalous societies) also skews heavily left, with the flaw that without strong systems this often leads to the re-centralisation of power in the hands of one or a few (conversely, hierarchism which skews heavily right often leads to codification of power in de facto aristocracies).<p>Economically, capitalism is unambiguously a right-wing economic theory (note that capitalism is not the same think as markets - another thing that people would rather remain cheerfully ignorant about). If your politico-economic system involves capitalism, you&#x27;d be very hard pressed to describe it as anything further left than centrist at best (as most mixed economies are). Actual leftist economics would include the somewhat vague blob that is left-libertarianism, encompassing everything from Georgism (often criticised as capitalism lite) to syndicalism, mutualism, anarcho-collectivism and the (of particular interest to me) various schools of African socialism. Opposition to capital&#x2F;private ownership&#x2F;wage theft takes many forms, not only that of the communist bogeyman.<p>Why do people want to think of themselves&#x2F;be thought of as being on the left so badly when they&#x27;re completely unwilling to actually engage with what leftism means?')
