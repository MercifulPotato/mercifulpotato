That includes ad free youtube and ad free youtube kids.<p>Youtube kids (with proper video&#x2F;channel whitelisting) is the main thing my toddlers watch. It has BBC shows (peppa pig), PBS kids, and 2 great kid friendly content crators (Blippi and Steve and Maggie).<p>Of course there is lots of good &quot;IRL&quot; kids content, but propery setup, Youtube kids is pretty good and fairly priced in my opinion.')
