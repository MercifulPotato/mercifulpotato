I also think they&#x27;re not a scapegoat insofar as they&#x27;re responsible for their actual bad practices. It&#x27;s not really either-or for me: they&#x27;re blamed for things they really are responsible for, but I also think they catch a lot of flak in general for things that are largely beyond their control. I&#x27;d like them to be accountable for the bad things they actually do while keeping our eye on the broader problem, which I&#x27;m not as convinced as you are that everyone is doing already.')
