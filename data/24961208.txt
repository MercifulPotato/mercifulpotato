Societal progress has tended to move away from repressing personal identity in the workplace. Just a generation ago this conversation would have been about whether gay people are allowed to be open about their sexual orientation or if they should just not allow any expression of their sexual identity to be present at work. Lots of people would respond with extreme homophobic comparisons like saying, “but I don’t bring my heterosexual identity to the workplace” and there would be comparisons with the military “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy.<p>As a society we’ve mostly progressed past that bigoted point of view, but now we face similar battles about trans people being able to just be themselves and let their natural identity exist in the workplace. It is similar with many aspects of religious identity or political identity. Inclusiveness does not mean “we all equally avoid any reference to unique identity” rather it means “unique identity is encouraged and allowed to openly flourish.”<p>This attitude you express:<p>&gt; “ Trying to redefine work from something it has been for all of human history (a place where you do work) into some sort of personal self expression is what is arrogant and harmful.”<p>is repressive and frankly anti-human. “Why can’t we just go back to the good old days when all the snowflakes would just shut up and do their jobs” - that is 100% not hyperbole - that is literally the level of regressive attitude you are endorsing under the disingenuous guise of “workplace professionalism.”')
