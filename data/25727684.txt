Item(by='pdimitar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610365583, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25727522, text='As far as being able to put a timer on a message and see it disappear for both sides, how do you know that the &quot;self-destructing&quot; messages claim is a lie? Genuinely curious, I am likely missing something.<p>&gt; <i>This is a lie, you can even pull someones telegram message history by sim swapping them FFS.</i><p>Well, the mobile telecoms still have no solution for SIM swapping and most software uses SIMs as a way to uniquely identify users. I&#x27;ve heard of -- and used -- messengers like Signal and Matrix and the added inconvenience for <i>not</i> using a SIM is definitely off-putting even for me as a techie. So I can&#x27;t blame Telegram or any other app for using SIM identification -- it&#x27;s flawed, that&#x27;s well-known in the tech community, but I suppose somebody made the call to risk this because they wanted adoption and didn&#x27;t want to make onboarding too hard?<p>---<p>I can agree on a generally somewhat misleading marketing being a reason for negativity. Even a functioning backdoor might still mean that messages are safe from most hacker attacks though; the backdoor is only used on demand (it&#x27;s infeasible to use it all the time, that would take too much server resources and would put the onus on the eavesdroppers to provide extra infrastructure I think?) and the unencrypted data is served to whoever asked for it behind closed doors. That does not mean that any hacker can get their hands on it though, right?<p>But even a somewhat misleading marketing can&#x27;t explain the violent reaction of most of HN when Telegram is mentioned -- at least it can&#x27;t explain it to me. There&#x27;s so much popular and very shady software out there and somehow Telegram eats all the flak while many other software packages receive very generous benefits of the doubt.')
