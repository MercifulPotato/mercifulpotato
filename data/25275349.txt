(Though to be fair, there wasn&#x27;t much in the way of first-party deployment tooling at the time, so it was a hand-rolled Helm chart and at least 50% of the issues were likely my config).<p>In comparison, the first-party Victoria Metrics Helm chart worked straight out of the box, the maintainers have fixed multiple small issues within hours of me reporting them and we&#x27;ve thrown an extremely large amount of metrics at it with zero problems.')
