I’ve become more sensitive lately about providing external services my data.<p>While I can’t avoid Google completely, I don’t use their web or mobile apps. Same goes for other services, though the issue with google connecting the dots on my online interactions is probably higher than with a small service. There on the other hand security is a higher issue than with Google with many SREs on call if something happens, so at the end of the day  I prefer an offline service&#x2F;program to parse my emails for the inscribe button.')
