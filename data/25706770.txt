Post-docs are typically in their early 30s so you won&#x27;t stand out like you would for an undergrad degree. Someone in my own cohort once asked me what year of my PhD I was in, and I was like, how did you not notice the middle-aged balding guy in all your first year classes, which consisted otherwise of nothing but 23-year-olds?<p>Outside of insecurities about age, it&#x27;s the same for everyone. All that really matters is what you accomplish and how respectable you are. Many advisors actually prefer older students since industry experience usually results in much more productive students (at least in biology, I don&#x27;t know how other fields work).<p>Financial considerations: pay is crappy, so it&#x27;ll be tough to support a family if you haven&#x27;t saved up. Health problems can also get expensive if you&#x27;re in the US and they&#x27;re only going to get more likely at your age. Make sure the insurance they provide is good when you&#x27;re interviewing.<p>Otherwise: totally worth it. You can be 40 with a PhD or 40 without a PhD, but you&#x27;ll be 40 no matter what.')
