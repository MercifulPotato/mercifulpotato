In fact followup mutations in such an epidemic always mutate to less severe variants (lower IFR) with sometimes higher infection rates (higher R). Because the patient doesn&#x27;t recognize it as such, and therefore it can spread more.\nThe mutations loose critical parts all over.<p>Damaging is the only the reemergence of the cold weather, people staying inside.')
