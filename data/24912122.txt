Ideally other file formats like word documents, latex documents etc. should also be supported. But that sounds very hard, basically makes the whole thing an infinte pan zoom graph based window manager (with all the other graph related features).\nHm.. Maybe this all really is on the operating system level.<p>I favor html as base technology for the reason of easily including different &quot;apps&quot;, like code editors, pdf viewers, webgl content, etc.<p>But thats just because I don&#x27;t really want to develop this at the window manager&#x2F;operating system level... Honestly I feel html is too slow for what I really want. There is a reason I use sublime and not VSCode, even it is just a millisecond or so.<p>I hope more people think in similar directions with the graph based interface. May one day some hero actually succeed with what we envision. \nI encourage you to be that one!')
