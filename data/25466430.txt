Please be more charitable in the future.<p>Second, I have the same disagreement with you as I do with the other chains.  Which is that, <i>de facto</i> paying for reviews is currently a rule in the system.  I can tell it&#x27;s a rule because it&#x27;s happening, and there&#x27;s no rules or punishment appearing stop it.  In video games, the rules are explicitly coded and nothing beyond that code is permitted.  This is why bugs vs intended behaviour becomes a conversation of <i>intent</i>, because the code is obviously allowing it and the code is the ruleset.<p>But that&#x27;s not true in real life.  And that&#x27;s the part that all responses like yours are missing.  There&#x27;s a game being played at Amazon, where boosting your review stats correlated with boosting your sales stats.  Except the permitted ruleset is <i>everything not explicitly prohibited and punished by Amazon</i>.  Complaining about people buying reviews is just being a scrub not understanding the rules.  The correct conversation to be having is the same as when an apparent bug is found in a game:  Is this intended behaviour from Amazon&#x27;s perspective, and if not what <i>active action</i> are they going to do about it?')
