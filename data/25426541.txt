They&#x27;d probably need to physically stalk some Instagram employees, but getting the TLS certificate key pair would be the difficult part.<p>On a related note, what do MS Windows&#x2F;OSX&#x2F;Android&#x2F;iOS&#x2F;Linux do when they see a WiFi AP with an SSID (and maybe even MAC) they recognize, with a WPA2 key they know, operating without encryption?  Will they still auto-connect in the clear?  In other words, if an attacker cloned the SSID of someone&#x27;s work&#x2F;home network, with a strong enough signal, could they trick devices into auto-connecting to an unencrypted AP?')
