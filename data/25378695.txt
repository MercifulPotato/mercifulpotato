I heard the affiants speak.  Each one provided testimony with a consistent pattern: the Republican poll observers were harassed, kicked out, and not allowed to do their job.  This would be in direct violation of state law (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.legislature.mi.gov&#x2F;(S(d3swxbgf3srsrnw20ak5uthw))&#x2F;mileg.aspx?page=getObject&amp;objectName=mcl-168-733" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.legislature.mi.gov&#x2F;(S(d3swxbgf3srsrnw20ak5uthw))&#x2F;...</a>).<p>Nowhere in the judgement does the judge address the affidavits.  The footnote for that statement (6) just calls it a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; without addressing the substance of the affidavits at all.<p>This is generally the case for most of the judgements I have read.  Other judgements are denied based on technicalities&#x2F;standing.<p>Not a single judgement I have read has addressed the actual substance of the affidavits that have been provided.')
