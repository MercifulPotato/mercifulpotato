We expected the price of imagery to decrease, but what we&#x27;ve found is that as the resolution increases, the value of the imagery is higher for a larger number of businesses, and therefore, imagery providers like Bing (now Azure) have 10x&#x27;d the price, focusing on customers with lower demands, but more dollars to spend.<p>The question I have is regarding diminishing returns of satellite vs aerial at high resolutions. We&#x27;re one example of a service that needs large areas of high resolution imagery, but most use cases as we understand them, are focused on areas in the sub-kilometer range, and therefore can likely be well serviced by drones in the near future.<p>Planet Labs, as an example, seem to now be focusing less on the source of the imagery, and mixing satellite with aerial in order to get the best result, using the right tool for the job.<p>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve thought deeply about this, and I&#x27;d be keen to understand why you think theirs is the wrong appraoch.')
