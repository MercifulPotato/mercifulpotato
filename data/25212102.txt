These are clearly dedicated servers not true peers.<p>The contact info for these servers appears to be retrieved via the DNS rather than the DHT. This isn&#x27;t surprising because browser clients can&#x27;t participate in the DHT, but the DHT is currently one of the biggest weak points of IPFS. IPFS&#x27;s DHT is so chatty that it consumes over a megabit of throughput just to maintain an idle node. Lookups are excruciatingly slow and often fail completely.')
