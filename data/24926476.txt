Only trust this service as much as you trust the company.<p>- Picture of a picture or other staged pictures<p>In short, there&#x27;s no way they could deliver on what they promise.  It would also break in more pedestrian ways, like if you want to take a photo somewhere you don&#x27;t have good network access.<p>I think only a device manufacturer could get closer to providing this, signing the raw camera buffer and metadata with  a device-specific private key. You could use lidar or other sensors to capture more of the scene, to make it harder to duplicate. And even then it would not be 100%<p>I guess the question for this company is whether there&#x27;s enough of a business model in the improved security that they can provide over just normal exif data.')
