I haven&#x27;t waded into that in any of my comments and don&#x27;t intend now.<p>you literally began this thread by posting under the comment that questions the degree of &quot;responsibility for the costs of the measures they [authorities] take&quot;, and you proceeded with defending authorities&#x27; actions and stating that they have their skin in the game and that they follow the science. Your comment was about politicians making political decisions and enacting certain rulings regarding the lockdown.<p>&gt; Lock down measure do restrict the spread of covid - that I won&#x27;t refute - and that is scientific in nature and if you are of scientific worth you can&#x27;t deny that.<p>What lockdown measures are you talking about? Generic lockdown measures or particular measures like enforcing &quot;face coverings&quot;?<p>&gt; It&#x27;s merely physics - if people don&#x27;t see each other there is no ability to transmit the illness.<p>If people don&#x27;t see each other, there&#x27;s still a physical world they interact with.
