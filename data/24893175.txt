But I still love using my thin laptop.<p>My solution: run desktops at home as your own private cloud and use them in various ways from you laptop or phone. Create your own services or use oss services to fulfill your needs from your thin internet devices, no middle man&#x2F;woman needed, use your desktop&#x2F;s anywhere. This won&#x27;t solve your uefi problem if you use modern laptops, nor will it solve your usb 2.0 problem if you stick to old laptops. But set up your own services, don&#x27;t let them take over! It&#x27;s quite a bit of work to setup, but maybe it&#x27;ll get easier if more people take on the challenge. (Disclosure: this is my personal pipe dream, and I&#x27;m in the early stages of working this out myself.)<p>On a side note, the open laptops you refer to can be more pricy, but if that&#x27;s what you believe in, then support the cause!')
