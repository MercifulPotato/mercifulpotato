I don&#x27;t get that or maybe miss some crucial parts or maybe it&#x27;s just a too enthusiastic statement. I understand the security issues of running external code. Those security issues can be reduced with a sandboxed environment like a WA runtime.<p>On the server side the vast majority of the industry is running their own code. There are already many options like lambda-functions, hosted container environments, hosted VMs or of course running your own. So why take this extra step? Running plain binaries of your code is easier, faster and more reliable. Building, distributing and running a Go service is actually one of the easiest parts in the whole development and operations chain. Same is true for Rust or .NET Core. Even with Java where you need a runtime I don&#x27;t see how a WA runtime solves a problem at all when running your own code.<p>I see great potential where you need to run untrusted code. Customer plugins for some edge server. But that is really a niche in terms of overall market.')
