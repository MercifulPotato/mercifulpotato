Item(by='echelon', descendants=None, kids=[25843411, 25843554], score=None, time=1611125415, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25843231, text='&gt; How much more mental gymnastics do we need?<p>&gt; I am from China and I have family in China.<p>Would you publicly curse Xi and denounce the CCP?<p>Please realize also that many in the West (myself included) are freaking out about China and are trying to counter its rise. This is a narrative that fits into their world view.<p>I&#x27;m more worried about CCP fascism and hypersonic nukes than I am about climate change.<p>I&#x27;m worried about what happens when Chinese software developers outnumber us, and all of our tech has been cheaply duplicated and sold around the world. When we have no other advantage, what then? Do we implode?<p>I&#x27;m worried about our companies and politicians adopting capitalism and democracy with Chinese characteristics.<p>---<p>Edit: downvotes trigger HN&#x27;s post filter, so I&#x27;m including my replies below<p>---<p>&gt; That doesn&#x27;t seem to fit the narrative that people have the agency to think differently from the status quo Americans would like to impose upon the world.<p>Last time I was in China, a good third of the people I spoke in depth with openly discussed the corruption and expressed dissenting views. This was in private, of course.<p>There were more than a few die-hard pro-CCP folks, but the talk of corruption was far more pervasive.<p>You&#x27;re still probably right.<p>&gt; Is this Great Replacement propaganda?<p>It does sound a little like it. That&#x27;s not at all my intention.<p>I think it&#x27;s appropriate to worry about a country copying tech that has a much larger, more productive population to sustain growth. Their protectionism doesn&#x27;t help.<p>But really this is all rooted in the single-party fascism. I&#x27;d be fine if China were a democracy. I might even move there myself.<p>I don&#x27;t care about my genes or my race or my progeny. I want the world to grow freer with every passing year. The CCP represents a major stumbling block in my worldview and sense of security.<p>&gt; You sit down and try to succeed on merit rather than privilege for once in your life<p>Okay, that&#x27;s a good point. But I&#x27;m working my ass off as it is, so I don&#x27;t know how much latitude for adjustment I have here.')
