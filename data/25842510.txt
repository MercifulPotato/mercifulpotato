I have been on &quot;self lockdown&quot; since March, in the USA.  I&#x27;ve been observing all of the following since then:<p>&gt; - 8pm-5am curfew (you have to be at home)<p>Check.<p>&gt; - no visitors<p>Other than my girlfriend, who broke up with me 3 months ago, check.<p>&gt; - 5km radius (this lasted for what felt like 6 months)<p>Not really all that practical, but I certainly haven&#x27;t been travelling about to strange places.  I&#x27;d say my radius has been about 90% within the 5km, except for things I couldn&#x27;t do within that radius, such as buying things that literally aren&#x27;t available within 5km.  In any case, I take my own car, by myself, and always wear a mask, so it&#x27;s no more dangerous than going to the grocery store 1 mile away from me.<p>&gt; - you had to wear your mask as soon as you left your house (this went for months, we still have to wear masks in shops (even though we have zero cases))<p>Check, mostly.  I don&#x27;t wear it when I take my dog for a walk, but I also never run into anyone else when doing so.<p>&gt; - you could only go to the super market once per day, and you had to go by yourself<p>Check.<p>&gt; - you were only allowed outside for exercise for 1 hour (with 1 person)<p>Check, mostly.  See above dog walks.<p>&gt; - no gyms, hospo, group events, activities etc<p>100% been avoiding all of these things since March, except for a trip to Tahoe in June with my then girlfriend, where we met up with her best friend.  Other than said best friend, I was never within 6 feet of anyone else, although I was really nervous about how few people were wearing masks.  We probably should not have made that trip, even though none of the three of us got sick.<p>I <i>wish</i> they had just done these things for 2-3 months:<p>&gt; - lots of shops forced you to give your details over and some demanded that you sanitize your hands (these are two things I didn&#x27;t want to do for my own reasons)<p>&gt; - increase of police powers, fines around $1600<p>The police bit is the part that really pisses me off.  Technically, it&#x27;s a misdemeanor to have a social gathering right now, but local police won&#x27;t do shit about it.  There have been 2 gatherings in my 6 unit apartment building during the time it&#x27;s been banned.  I don&#x27;t want to get COVID because other people in my building are idiots.<p>Proper use of lockdowns would have been to reduce cases to the point where contact tracing and testing could take over.  Unfortunately, we haven&#x27;t implemented <i>those</i> measures, either.  To quote <i>Death to 2020</i>, &quot;I&#x27;d say it was a train wreck and a shit show, but that would be unfair to trains and shit.&quot;')
