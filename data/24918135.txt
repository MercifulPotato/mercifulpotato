It came out in 1946, so was copyrighted until 1974. The owners (RKO) didn&#x27;t renew the copyright, as it was a failed film, it was well before home video, so why bother I guess.<p>Thus in 1974 is became public domain, and all the networks could play it as many times as they wanted with no cost, and did so - making it a very popular film in the American cultural zeitgeist.<p>In 1993 this was all undone though, and now only the owner (which is NBC) is allowed to show the classic film, because it was based on a story that is copyrighted (and NBC acquired the copyright)<p>Copyright length are ridiculous. Any implication (we need copyright otherwise people won&#x27;t create) that Philip Van Doren Stern wrote his story in 1943 because he felt he could capitalize on the rights of a derivative film in the cable tv and streaming era is laughable.')
