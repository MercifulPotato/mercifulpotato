A venomous animal injects toxins into its victim&#x27;s body by bite or sting. A poisonous animal, on the other hand, produces toxins that are poisonous once inhaled or ingested. Medical literature shows that human - slow loris injuries come from slow loris bites and not from ingesting their toxins. So are slow lorises venomous? Well, not quite.</i><p>...<p><i>Reports of slow loris bites are rare in literature. However, based on these published reports, it seems that slow loris bites are not venomous (Kalimullah et al., 2008; Wilde, 1972). Due to the high degree of similarity between the brachial gland exudate of slow lorises and the Fel d 1 allergen in domestic cats, the anaphylactic shock expressed by victims is probably just a reaction to the exudate&#x27;s allergen.</i><p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;primatology.net&#x2F;2010&#x2F;10&#x2F;19&#x2F;are-slow-lorises-really-venomous&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;primatology.net&#x2F;2010&#x2F;10&#x2F;19&#x2F;are-slow-lorises-really-v...</a>')
