Item(by='neogodless', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605905247, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25164056, text='My first &quot;real&quot; experience with Linux (setting aside weird things like Lindows&#x2F;Linspire, or the partial Linux experience of WSL, or the sort of &quot;Linux-like&quot; experience of using macOS and using bash and command line to do most of my work, aside from VS Code, communication apps and web browing) was installing Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on a pretty old (maybe 8 years) Dell 11 3137. I hadn&#x27;t realized the release of 20.04 LTS had just occurred; I was just trying the latest&#x2F;newest. I put it on a USB stick and did the Try option, and it all loaded up and everything worked. It gave me confidence, so I did a full install. No trouble with WiFi, touch screen, brightness, touch pad. And I was able to install so many of the same cross-platform apps I use everyday that I could get work done on it. (But I prefer a much bigger screen and keyboard.)<p>I was so impressed, I installed it next on a ~2 year old Asus Flip, and everything worked except for the fingerprint reader. Battery life was about 2&#x2F;3rd of what I got in Windows 10 (which was already not great) but I used it for a couple of weeks, sometimes getting work done on it, and sometimes playing around with things like Steam - I could play Torchlight on it, or stream Torchlight II from my Windows 10 desktop. Neat! Ended up going back to Windows for better battery, but aside from gaming, the experience was very much on par with Windows, with some things better and some things worse, but no huge differences.<p>I&#x27;m very comfortable with Windows 10 and WSL, and I don&#x27;t expect Linux to take over as a daily driver any time soon. So I guess in a way, I did &quot;give up&quot; on switching over, but if an employer handed me an all-Linux machine, I think I&#x27;d be perfectly pleased to use it all day for work, even if I head back to Windows when I want to play StarCraft.')
