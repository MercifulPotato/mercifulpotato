Energy intensity of GDP has been falling for decades. The carbon intensity of our economy is falling faster.<p>Both can be true, energy intensity of GDP has been falling even worldwide. But GDP and energy consumption is still correlated, i.e. you can plot a nice regression line in this plot:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;grapher&#x2F;energy-use-per-capita-vs-gdp-per-capita" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;grapher&#x2F;energy-use-per-capita-vs-...</a><p>There is some debate as to the direction of the causal link, it&#x27;s probably dynamic and context dependant, but the correlation is definitely here.')
