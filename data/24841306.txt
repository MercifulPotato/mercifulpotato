Candidates get verified by taking multiple mock interviews (more data points).<p>Other competitors, such as Triplebyte, still have a recruiter in between interview and company. Even after you get verified and have good performance on the Triplebyte quiz and interview, there is still a recruiter who acts as a gatekeeper. That recruiter can prevent you from speaking to companies even if your interview performance was 99% percentile.')
