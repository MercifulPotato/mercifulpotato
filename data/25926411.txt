Each vote allocates 1e12 &#x2F; 1e8 = $10,000. So voting is clearly worth it.<p>But that $10,000 doesn&#x27;t end up with the voter, it ends up diffused across all of society. $10,000 is the society-wide payoff of your vote. Your individual payoff of your own vote is only 1e4 &#x2F; 1e8 = $0.0001. Your vote barely affects yourself.<p>So there&#x27;s an altruistic payoff to voting, but not any egoistic payoff to speak of. And we&#x27;re specifically talking about individual reward here.')
