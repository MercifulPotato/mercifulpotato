I still have a couple disks I made, with no way to play them back.<p>My apartment was burgled in 2003, and the insurance payout covered an iPod to replace the stolen minidisk player.<p>Night and day, no comparison, that iPod was the coolest thing I owned at the time, and stayed that way for many years. It&#x27;s in storage right now, but the last time I plugged it in, a couple years ago, it still worked. The battery is toast, though.')
