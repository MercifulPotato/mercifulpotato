Item(by='RickS', descendants=None, kids=[25784386], score=None, time=1610664804, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25783152, text='At home:  \nExperimental tools that connect max&#x2F;msp(ableton) and arduino (LED control).<p>Think highly general max patches that automatically export realtime audio, midi, and automation data to a central hub, with a GUI that allows you to assign that data to visual properties that are then sent to a neat LED setup I&#x27;ve built. Akin to the mod table in a synthesizer like serum&#x2F;thor, but with all of ableton&#x27;s data on one side, and a light show on the other.<p>I started building this in react out of familiarity, and because I really want the visual feedback, but this has introduced 100ms+ of round trip latency, which is enough to break the effect. It has to go max -&gt; JS runtime within max -&gt; socket.io listener -&gt; react app -&gt; listener -&gt; arduino, which is goofy as hell. Trying to figure out a lighter, faster stack for this without having to learn both a new language and domain in tandem.<p>I&#x27;d love examples of projects in this space, if anyone has favorites.<p>At work:  \nA GUI&#x2F;IDE&#x2F;DSL for cross platform design system management, to service one of the largest design systems in the world.<p>We (Adobe) are about to start hiring an additional technologist to work on this. Potentially relevant experience: typescript, cross-platform UI dev, building version control systems, graph DBs?, visual programming (scratch, nodebased, etc), anything related to IDE dev or expansive config management tooling. That&#x27;s off the top of my head, don&#x27;t take the list too seriously. My email is psteele@, feel free to drop a line and I&#x27;ll hang onto your info, but won&#x27;t promise anything beyond a &quot;we&#x27;ll see in a bit&quot;. I&#x27;m not the hiring manager, just the primary IC.')
