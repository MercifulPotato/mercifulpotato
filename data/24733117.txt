At the time I was checking Pebble&#x27;s site on a daily basis because they had short-term sales not announced anywhere.<p>AdSense then proceeded to push just that one &quot;Pebble Smartwatch&quot; ad on me, everywhere. Even a page with multiple ad blocks just had several of them -- sometimes all of them -- the same text ad for Pebble. It became more annoying than helpful because I was already going to buy one, it just tried to push me to buy it for a higher price.<p>I turned ad personalization off again and now any ads I get are mostly just related to the current page&#x27;s content.')
