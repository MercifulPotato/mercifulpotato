Item(by='dralley', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603469634, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24869658, text='&gt; Mozilla seems to disagree, as the Megabar change has shown. Not only have they introduced a meaningless but annoying change, but they actively want to prevent people from disabling it.<p>The reason they rewrote the URL bar code was that the previous version was written using XUL &#x2F; XBL, and they are in the process of removing XUL &#x2F; XBL from the browser.<p>Writing a new version while leaving the old version around would defeat the entire purpose, which was deleting the old code to reduce technical debt.<p>Now, my personal preference would have been that they rewrite it without re-designing it - but &quot;actively prevent people from disabling it&quot; is a very inaccurate description of what happened.')
