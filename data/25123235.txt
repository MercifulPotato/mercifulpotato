It&#x27;s not that bad and not that hard to use.  Occasionally I have to look up how to do something, usually involving git-filter-branch.  But that&#x27;s no surprise, because what I&#x27;m trying to do is usually inherently complex.  I don&#x27;t think a different interface would solve that.  For most other stuff, git is simple and easy to use.  It was a bit slow to learn, but most really good tools are (e.g. vim).')
