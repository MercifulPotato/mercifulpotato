Item(by='aaron695', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604269420, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24962130, text='&gt; Is it okay to downvote without explaining why?<p>Yes.<p>The Russians (ie IRA)  on here for instance want to promote disinformation and conflict. The best way to do this is would be up voting and down voting.<p>Once you get into comments it is quite time intensive. But it is also easier to get caught, the community can&#x27;t self regulate voting, it&#x27;s invisible.<p>Different topic, I think a reason for down-voting with a 100 drop down options <i>including</i> options not allowed&#x2F;encouraged(ie they are a Republican, I disliked another one of their comments) would be a very interesting experiment.<p>It might kill HN, so HN won&#x27;t do this experiment since they have a working site. But there does need to be another evolution done by someone.<p>[edit] Probably wouldn&#x27;t help, but HN should have a private &quot;downvoted comments&quot; to complement the private &quot;upvoted comments&quot; link in the admin panel so people can see their behaviour.')
