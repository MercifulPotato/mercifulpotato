Slack is a close second, and Teams a distant third. If Slack can figure out their infrastructure issues, and undo many of the poor UX decisions from the past 12-18 months, they can beat teams. However, if Discord decides to move into the business world and offer a competitively priced product, I could see that doing very well. I honestly don&#x27;t know why they&#x27;d do that, but a business version of Discord is very attractive to me at least.')
