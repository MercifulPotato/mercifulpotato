Some social media company might try to filter what you post but we&#x27;re not in Mao&#x27;s era.<p>Also it&#x27;s kind of circular and meaningless to elevate the US above China simply by holding up American values. Someone in China could say the same, &quot;hey look over there they can openly mock the president and spread conspiracies on the internet, they&#x27;ve turned into idiots, you can&#x27;t equate China with the US!&quot;')
