The justice system just moves slowly. Many people spend upwards of years before going to trial. This is nothing unusual.<p>And getting married while awaiting trial is allowed because the accused hasn’t been convicted (hence, <i>accused</i>). (see edit below)<p>What would be unusual is for the charges to be reduced or even dropped. But, as it stands, she’s facing 20 years in prison. Possibly more after this incident.<p>EDIT: I wasn’t saying she wouldn’t be allowed to get married post-conviction. I was saying that, even if the right to marriage was removed when convicted, she’s still not convicted.')
