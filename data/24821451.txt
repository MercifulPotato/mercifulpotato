A horizontal line in this model wouldn&#x27;t indicate an orbit, but rather a completely stationary object. It would then make sense for the world line to curved because it must be accelerating in order to resist the attraction of the body it&#x27;s near.<p>By definition, the world line of a stable orbit would be a line in curved spacetime.')
