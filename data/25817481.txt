One holds a loaded gun aimed at the other’s chest, his finger on the trigger. He tells the other man to bite off all his fingers or die.<p>The man on the other end of the gun certainly <i>has</i> a choice, and a negotiating position—they just aren’t very good ones, through no fault of his own.<p>I personally would prefer to live in a society where those with power don’t have moral carte blanche to treat those without power as badly as they like, as long as the unfortunates are technically given <i>choices</i> and&#x2F;or some articulable market forces can reasonably be said to have been causal contributors to the current configuration of their reality. But I guess a lot of people, particularly people used to having power, may not agree with my preference.')
