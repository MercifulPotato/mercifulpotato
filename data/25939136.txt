Its not really possible to use the scientific method without ensuring that your experimental subjects are indistinguishable. The reason I’m gatekeeping is because its not the same method, it would be pseudoscience. Like doing experiments on football games.<p>&gt; I would propose as an alternative that we work to improve general scientific literacy so that the general public might be more familiar with the methods used in each field. For example, if more people knew how regression analysis worked they might be better able to understand it as the foundation for many of the conclusions in the social sciences, and so might be better able to understand the generalizability and potential limitations of what they are seeing when they are presented with a conclusion in one of these fields.<p>I think it would be great if people understood these things better, I guess I see this distinction as a way of articulating those fundamental differences in the mind of the public.')
