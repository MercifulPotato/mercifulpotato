I understand it is not easy to fix, Ruby fixed in 1.9, Python in 3.0, new languages (Rust, Elixir) come with UTF-8. Microsoft Windows has code pages, UCS-2, UTF-16.<p>The best and most compatible answer is moving JS to UTF-32. JS engines already save space by encoding strings internally as latin1 instead of UCS when possible (even around 90% of text from Chinese sites is still latin1). IMO they should have made backtick strings UTF-32, but that doesn&#x27;t exactly transpile well.<p>&gt; No, every Ruby object contains variables and has a link to a class which defines instance methods, we call it singleton_class<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mccraigmccraig.files.wordpress.com&#x2F;2008&#x2F;10&#x2F;ruby-eigenclass.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mccraigmccraig.files.wordpress.com&#x2F;2008&#x2F;10&#x2F;ruby-eige...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.stack.imgur.com&#x2F;FPPdI.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.stack.imgur.com&#x2F;FPPdI.png</a><p>or adding all the things with a few instances, .constructor, etc<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.stack.imgur.com&#x2F;HvzDP.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.stack.imgur.com&#x2F;HvzDP.png</a><p>I&#x27;ll let you decide which implementation is easier to work through, but I have a definite opinion that Ruby&#x27;s system is more complex (and Python layers their OOP on top of what is basically a hidden prototypal system).<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve red through ES5 to be sure there are no hidden traps left.<p>You&#x27;ll love newer ES versions then. The upcoming private fields are an even bigger mess.<p>JS needs a &quot;use stricter&quot; mode which really slices away the bad parts. Even better, just add a `version=&quot;es20xx&quot;` requirement to use newer features and have browsers ignore what they don&#x27;t know, so you could even compile and link to multiple compilation levels of the same script and have the browser choose.<p>In truth, JS would be in the best place of any top-20 language if Eich had just been allowed to make a scheme variant as he had planned.')
