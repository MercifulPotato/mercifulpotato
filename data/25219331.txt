Item(by='TeMPOraL', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606393307, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25219116, text='200ms sounds surprisingly high. I can imagine it being hard to press a button two times in a row in &lt;200ms with a cold start, but if you already have a controller in your hand and it&#x27;s even minimally ergonomic, pressing the same button 5 times with average &lt;200ms delay between each should be relatively easy for most kids and adults.<p>My guess is, whoever came up with that threshold has never played any console game.')
