AI can easily scan every face at a football game. Humans can&#x27;t.<p>AI could easily scale to watch everyone who walks through every intersection downtown. Humans can&#x27;t.<p>If AI makes a much smaller percentage of mistakes (which is itself a questionable thesis), it will still make orders of magnitude more mistakes because it will be making orders of magnitude more evaluations.<p>Also, for better or for worse, people tend to trust that computers are &#x27;logical&#x27; and correct. This is especially troubling because a human can explain their mistakes (&quot;the person was wearing similar clothing, had a limp, etc.&quot;), while AI generally can&#x27;t give you a reason that you can easily understand.<p>&gt; Computers are only a tool. Humans have to make the final decisions. Under those circumstances, what exactly is the problem?<p>Humans are bad at evaluating computing systems. Have you heard the stories of people driving their cars into lakes because a GPS told them to? Now imagine the line was even fuzzier (&quot;We think this <i>could</i> be our suspect, but we&#x27;re not sure. The computer positively ID&#x27;d them though...&quot;)')
