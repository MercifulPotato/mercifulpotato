I didn&#x27;t see anything different.<p>On neutrality, that&#x27;s unsurprising, largely because nothing has changed with stability sufficient to justify major expenditures. Neutrality was an FCC policy goal pursued&#x2F;enforced by different means for a long time, and even before the repeal went into effect there was talk of legal challenges and state replacements to it; several states in fact have adopted there own net neutrality laws, and the legal challenges to the FCC repeal (which failed to negate the repeal itself, but did strike down the attempt to preempt state neutrality laws) didn&#x27;t end until the middle of last year. So, just as before, the status quo is most fixed broadband providers acting basically neutral with comparatively modest (and not systematic across the market) deviations, waiting to see how the regulatory landscape eventually stabilizes and trying to avoid provoking negative responses that might tip the balance against themselves, and many mobile providers being decidedly non-neutral (even where the most recently repealed Open Internet Order would have imposed some requirements on them, though previous neutrality approaches did not.)<p>&gt; What changes will I see as an internet consumer with this new appointment.<p>Well, basically none, because the FCC isn&#x27;t going to take any new policy direction other than perhaps in response to new issues without strong partisan divides when it&#x27;s 2-2, no matter who the chair is.<p>When the vacant seat is filled, then you might see some policy changes.')
