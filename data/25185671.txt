In either UI you have to hover over buttons if you&#x27;re not sure what they&#x27;re mean, and it&#x27;s telling that the iconography is essentially unchanged from the 1990&#x27;s. Except for one quite important aspect: Word 95&#x27;s icons use <i>colour</i> to help the eye read them and distinguish them from one another. I know what the Pages icons mean but it&#x27;s harder to quickly find the right icon when the only difference between the icons is shape.<p>By the way, if you really want that more spaced-out and verbose vertical list of formatting options, Word has it too, at least in 97 (haven&#x27;t used 95). It&#x27;s available as a dialog box and actually offers more formatting options than Pages does.<p>Moreover, the Word 95 UI&#x27;s compactness is valuable. You can quickly find all the formatting options you&#x27;ll ever need without clicking around in menus. Most of the screen space is occupied not by UI text and padding but by commonly-used commands and useful information about the document. Since the icons are laid out close together and horizontally rather than vertically, it&#x27;s also easier for my eyes to quickly scan them than in Pages.<p>It&#x27;s not nostalgia speaking when I say that I&#x27;d much prefer to use Word 95 on a daily basis than Pages.')
