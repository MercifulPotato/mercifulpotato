Qpdfviewer does have those features, but lacks proper text selection. Okular requires a big installation and KDE libraries, which are fine if you use KDE, but I don&#x27;t. There are many other minimal readers, but they are too basic for my needs. Session persistence in a PDF reader would be nice too.<p>Which one do you use? How do you like it?<p>I think there is big room for improvement in this space. Nothing comes close to PDFExpert on the iPad...')
