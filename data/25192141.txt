I&#x27;d use a SATA M.2 if needed to save 40% of the cost on the same size SSD. Or just a random thumb drive I have around.<p>The Pi4 compute unit has a PCIe x1 slot, I think, and that could better put an NVME drive to use. But at that cost, for the drive and Pi, I don&#x27;t see it being widely used outside of hobby or home use.<p>I&#x27;m excited about this and how the official Pi4 firmware now supports USB boot. Maybe if you used the Pi to run a NAS and wanted the NVME drive as accelerated cache (it can do H.265, 4kp60 decode, and H.264)?<p>But can a Pi even process an NVME drives bandwidth via it&#x27;s CPU&#x2F;etc or Gigabit Ethernet&#x2F;USB 3.0&#x2F;GPIO add on?<p>Edit: This guide is basically 1. Put SSD in adapter and 2. Set up USB boot then clone SD card to SSD. How is this article not just a forum post like the dozens of others that provide the same information and process?')
