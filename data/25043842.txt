They let it be while Ukraine was pro-Russia, but everyone who understood how things work, was sure that Russia would take it back immediately if Ukraine ever turns to NATO. I&#x27;m actually surprised that it took over 20 years to happen. Russia needs to control black sea to survive. And I think that in the end it was a good outcome. No blood was spit. Population in Crimea is Russian, despite what you might hear from western propaganda, the majority really voted for Russia in 2014 referendum and happy with the outcome.<p>Other than Crimea, Russia did not get any new lands. I think that in the future they&#x27;ll join eastern parts of Ukraine and it&#x27;s also likely that Belarus will join Russia, but for now I don&#x27;t think that there are any more serious claims. Of course Russia will continue proxy wars and support pro-Russian countries, just like any other major power does.')
