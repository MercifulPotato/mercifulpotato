There&#x27;s actually two layers of protection:<p>1. You can&#x27;t deprotect the content for a purpose that would violate copyright law (this is the &quot;DMCA exception&quot; process you hear about every 3 years)\n2. You can&#x27;t provide tools that deprotect the content for any purpose<p>Both provisions give DRM the force of law, though the latter poses specific risks for anyone who merely wants to run DRM content within it&#x27;s protected bounds. There <i>are</i> loads of well-reasoned exceptions to DMCA 1201, but they&#x27;re very restrictive and special-cased. You&#x27;d never be able to get away with just releasing a Widevine-compatible plugin, even if it did all the validation and security in exactly the same way as Widevine. This means that, practically speaking, the only legal way to actually play Widevine-protected content is to license Widevine and comply with the inevitable litany of restrictions they place upon you for access to that plugin.')
