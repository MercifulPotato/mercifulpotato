You need to make something that works before you can make something that works better.<p>The only fusion devices humanity has yet gotten to produce net power are thermonuclear bombs. Laser fusion tries to replicate those conditions as best as possible without detonating a fission primary. Yes, this means laser fusion is good for validating nuclear bomb models, but it&#x27;s also the only route to fusion where we know for a fact that every issue is strictly an engineering problem.')
