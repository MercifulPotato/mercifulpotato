Whether you&#x27;re doing film or digital imagery, you&#x27;re not capturing reality. With camera sensors, the raw data you capture (RGB brightness for each pixel, for example), needs to have some color&#x2F;brightness&#x2F;contrast curve applies to make it look realistic (i.e. linear will not look like reality at all). Each manufacturer picks their own curve, and then also has options (vivid, etc) - and some of them do pick less realistic options for defaults as customers think they make for better photos.<p>Not to mention tricks to fix overexposed pixels, etc. There&#x27;s quite a bit of manipulation done before you get the JPG.<p>Cell phone cameras are akin to cheaper digital cameras that used to be (and perhaps still are) on the market - where you <i>don&#x27;t</i> have much control on this. This is not new to smartphones - it&#x27;s just that smartphones have more processing power to do more.<p>Long time photographers know this. It&#x27;s not &quot;capture reality&quot;, but &quot;how much deviation from reality am I willing to accept&quot;, with 0 not being an option.')
