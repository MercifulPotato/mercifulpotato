But as this comes to an end, eventually, the cost of mining will be borne by anyone making transactions on the network through tx fees.<p>Somebody has to pay the electricity bill on all these ASICs.<p>EDIT: One could try to argue that high transaction costs are not a problem because nobody wants to trade bitcoin, people just hodl it.
