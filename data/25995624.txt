It&#x27;s funny, but I liked it mostly because of the way subtitles were displayed. MPC-HC always seemed to get the job done perfectly, and when I had to use VLC at the time, I&#x27;ve always run into some problems.<p>I kept using MPC-HC for about two years after the development was halted. When it was time to look for an alternative, I gave VLC another try and was pleasantly surprised. The problems I remembered running into were no more, and the project seemed more mature overall. I&#x27;m enjoying it ever since.<p>Thanks to everyone involved with the project!<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mpc-hc.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mpc-hc.org&#x2F;</a>')
