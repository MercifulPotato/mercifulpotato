Item(by='darekkay', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605632359, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25121657, text='&gt; I&#x27;m not an idiot, but I don&#x27;t fully understand git. I am coding for a living, and I use git every day. I probably could sit down for a couple of days and fully understand how git works, but I&#x27;ve never needed it, I understand how basic git operations work, and I stay away from commands that I don&#x27;t understand.<p>That&#x27;s a great summary for the majority of Git users. I am still motivating people to spend the time to learn it &quot;properly&quot; if they&#x27;re using Git daily.<p>First of all, it will make them more efficient. I&#x27;ve seen too many people literally redoing their changes, because a cherry-pick&#x2F;rebase is &quot;an operation they don&#x27;t understand&quot;.<p>Secondly, they will be able to solve most issues when (not if) they occur. Sure, I am more than happy to help my colleagues solving their issues. From &quot;why are those changes in my PR&quot; to &quot;our Jenkins job went rogue and now we&#x27;ve got hundreds of MB of data in our repository that we would like to remove&quot;. But the time of me explaining things the &quot;learning by doing&quot; style would be better spent actually learning Git.')
