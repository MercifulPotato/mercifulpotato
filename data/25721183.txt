Can&#x27;t remember seasoning it, but probably did way back in the day. I just wash it out with hot water and a bit of liquid soap and a scourer to remove the occasional bits. As good as teflon, cheaper and less poisonous. My favourite pan. I think the main thing is to use it a lot, and don&#x27;t overclean it. The type of oil seems not to have mattered much, but it&#x27;s mainly olive, sunflower or rapeseed. As always YMMV.')
