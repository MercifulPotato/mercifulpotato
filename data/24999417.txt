As I said have been a fan of this project (sidenote: love the name and simple, well designed site).<p>I have played around with a language dubbed WWT (for &quot;World Wide Types&quot;) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jtree.treenotation.org&#x2F;designer&#x2F;#standard%20wwt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jtree.treenotation.org&#x2F;designer&#x2F;#standard%20wwt</a>). Instead of starting with the type system and working my way toward the user have gone the other way starting with the &quot;what would the simplest language look like for building types&quot; and worked my way toward the type system (just compiles to TypeScript for now). My thought is it should be editable in Excel.<p>What I think needs to happen for TypeDefs (or similar) to nail this, is to create a type language that solves the &quot;last mile&quot; problem. Every organization in the world has their own perspective on things, and will need to extend&#x2F;modify some global CommonTypes repository. So a great type language would be something that worldwide CommonTypes could be defined in, but that is easy for a dev at the local real estate agent&#x27;s office to write some code and extend. An &quot;HTML for Types&quot; in that sense. Just a guess.')
