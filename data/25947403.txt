My experience with working remotely, on globally distributed teams, for about 20 years now is:<p>* Synchronous high-bandwidth communication (read: meeting, ideally with a shared whiteboard) is pretty handy sometimes.<p>* Timezones really do matter.  If you want a sync meeting that includes people in Europe, the US, and APAC, someone will have a bad time.  If you want quick turnaround on code reviews, having 8-12 hour time zone differences is a significant barrier.  Even a &quot;4-hour&quot; difference for meeting time purposes can be a huge problem in this sense: it&#x27;s 9pm on Thursday where you are (US West coast), but your coworkers&#x27; weekend has started (in New Zealand), so any code reviews you ask for on Friday morning you won&#x27;t see until you get back to work on Monday.  And any code reviews they ask for on their Monday morning won&#x27;t happen until you get back to work on their Tuesday.<p>* Language matters.  Even if everyone involved speaks English to some extent, it&#x27;s a _lot_ easier to follow some accents than others, especially on an imperfect (read: teleconference) audio feed.  Which accents depends on which people.<p>* Shared context matters, just in terms of understanding requirements.  This can be developed, but it takes time.  People from more similar backgrounds often require less time to get to mutual understanding around this sort of thing.  This needs to be weighed against blinkered thinking and lack of diversity in perspectives, of course.<p>I love working remotely, and am used to the scheduling issues around this sort of thing, but there are a _lot_ of issues that come with hiring someone halfway across the globe that you don&#x27;t get with hiring someone also working remotely but in the same city or at least speaking more or less your accent of your language and within an hour or two timezone distance.  The fact that the latter works for a particular position does not imply the former will.')
