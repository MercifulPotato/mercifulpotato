Out of ~18,000 people total across 3 countries (UK, South Africa and Brazil), there have been 3 reported events requiring a pause, of which two involved people who got the real vaccine and one who got the placebo.<p>Keep in mind they pause anytime anything serious happens to anyone in the trial to give them time to make sure the vaccine didn&#x27;t cause it. Pauses are a good thing - they are a sign they are following the protocols and not just pushing something through.')
