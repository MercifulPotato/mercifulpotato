In no other country is one as likely to end up in prison as in the US.<p>Neither can I think of many countries where police are more heavily armed, literally militarized [1], while killing people at rates that can only be estimated, as there are no state or federal statistics on that.<p>Still doesn&#x27;t stop some US Americans from seeing the &quot;police state&quot; everywhere, except at home.<p>Even after over ten thousand people were arrested, thousands injured, many maimed, protesting against exactly that police state and its violence that disproportionately affects black people and other minorities.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-rights-un-usa-torture-idUSKCN0WA2B8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-rights-un-usa-torture-idU...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Law_Enforcement_Support_Office" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Law_Enforcement_Support_Office</a>')
