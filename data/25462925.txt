This is because all the lighting would be calculated during development and be &quot;baked in&quot; to the level. Up until dynamic lighting became feasible (doing it real-time is very expensive computationally) the games that had shootable lights had to resort to clever programming, at the very least, to get it working<p>And in any case it takes additional logic to make a light be destroyable, in addition to needing the proper flags to be set in the level design process. I can&#x27;t think of very many games where all lighting is truly dynamic like you are thinking, and up until recently a lot of graphics cards could not handle more than a few dynamic lights at a time<p>When DOOM 3 released, part of its technical wow factor was how it was able to get dynamic lighting working using early 2000&#x27;s graphics tech. I remember being blown away watching the light change as an overhead lamp was being affected by physics')
