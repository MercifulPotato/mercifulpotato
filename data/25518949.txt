New music discovery is one of my favorite things.  Eventually, though, it stopped giving it to me.  Despite having over 100 stations, I started hearing mostly repeats.  Also, of the artists I liked, they were only playing me a small fraction of their work.  And I missed albums.<p>Spotify has been a breath of fresh air, I switched a couple years ago.  It is missing some stuff here &amp; there, but I haven&#x27;t hit too many bugs like others have (on Windows or Android), and their catalog is <i>much</i> bigger than Pandora&#x27;s was when I was using it heavily.  Turns out, what I needed was more content.  What once seemed like Pandora&#x27;s best strength - that &#x27;special sauce&#x27; recommendation algorithm - is now clearly being done to a similar or greater level of competence by damn near everyone else in the space.  And like you say, the podcast stuff has been solid &amp; gotten better, too.  These things never turn out how I expect.')
