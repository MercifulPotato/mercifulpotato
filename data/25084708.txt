You mention a “car attack” in Seattle. In actual fact, the incident I assume you mean was by all outward indicators a tragic accident, not a planned attack such as Charlottesville in 2017.<p>Driver Dawit Kelete (who is black, and not politically affiliated) was high on pills when he plowed through BLM protestors occupying a section of the freeway in the middle of the night. Tragically, one protestor died and another was seriously injured.<p>Most “car attacks” this summer have turned out to be simply reckless or confused drivers caught in the middle of unplanned, unannounced, often heavily-armed and aggressive street protests. Armed protestors have shot or shot at several such drivers, such as in Provo, UT and Aurora, CO.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.deseret.com&#x2F;utah&#x2F;2020&#x2F;6&#x2F;30&#x2F;21308526&#x2F;gunman-shot-driver-then-hid-weapon-continued-protest-provo-police-say-blm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.deseret.com&#x2F;utah&#x2F;2020&#x2F;6&#x2F;30&#x2F;21308526&#x2F;gunman-shot-...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.denverpost.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;03&#x2F;man-charged-murder-shooting-protesters-elijah-mcclain-aurora&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.denverpost.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;03&#x2F;man-charged-murder-sho...</a><p>By my reckoning, the actual count of “car attacks” this summer where a politically-motivated driver rammed a BLM&#x2F;antifa protest can be counted on one hand. There has been a greater number of unprovoked attacks on drivers by protestors. This is the product of extreme paranoia among armed protestors, amplified by social media.')
