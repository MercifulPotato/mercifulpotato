For example out of the many GitLab installs I&#x27;ve seen - I&#x27;ve not once seen anyone use or care about the Kubernetes&#x2F;Infa orchestration and monitoring features. From what I can tell people mostly care about MRs and the workflow around them, CI&#x2F;CD, Security Scanning, code Issues and Kanban and Wiki functionality.<p>I feel like as a product - it&#x27;s trying to do too much and really what most people want is an alternative to Github, Jira and Confluence.')
