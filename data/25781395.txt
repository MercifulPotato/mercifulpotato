As someone with over 20 YOE, I&#x27;ve always eschewed the &quot;2-page&quot; resume guidelines.  My full resume ends up being 4-5 pages, even with rigorous attention to only a 1 sentence description of each role, avoiding duplication of facts, and keeping and bullet points in the form of &quot;Did X, resulting in Y&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve always wondered if a longer format helps me more with automated resume scoring.  Also, does LinkedIn come into play here?  I feel like when I show up to an interview, there&#x27;s a 50&#x2F;50 chance they&#x27;re holding my resume vs. a printout of my LinkedIn profile.')
