I&#x27;m sure you don&#x27;t need to go and adjust your clock now to convince yourself of this.<p>I never stated otherwise.<p>&gt; The only single reason I can think to choose one clock over another is that one synchronises with the solar system and one does not.<p>Why are you being deliberately obtuse? Having extra daylight in the morning (i.e. pre-12:00) and the afternoon (i.e. post 12:00) are reasons. The amount of light before and after school&#x2F;work&#x2F;etc. has real effects.<p>&gt; ...there is nothing else to consider.<p>This is factually untrue. You may not consider other reasons as important as your own, but stop pretending they don&#x27;t exist.<p>By the way, you are an extremely irritating person to discuss with. I started this conversation specifically to hear your side and you are taking the opportunity to ignore and belittles ideas other than your own. It&#x27;s pretty childish honestly.')
