Email never goes away unless you archive the thread.  If you have a bunch of things that are going on, you open your inbox and realize just how behind you are, every time you open it.  Slack, conversely, scrolls up and always looks the same.  If you miss something, the world moved on without your input, and you feel the same.<p>The article is right that the problem is when the information doesn&#x27;t want to be deleted.  Now you have to do extra work.  (Specific example; a long time ago, I figured out how to get Github to notify me on Slack when a code review was assigned to me.  It is not easy to find in the UI and took me a while to set up.  I wrote down the instructions in Slack... and that helped people that were reading it then, but it doesn&#x27;t help me tell someone how to do it that asks me today.  Should have written a runbook!)<p>Remembering to persist information is always something you have to do, and it&#x27;s not specific to Slack.  Your shell history is useless to your coworkers.  Your design discussions is useless to someone that just joined the team today.')
