Another HN UFO and aliens thread.<p>People often ask what HN was like in the good old days. I don&#x27;t remember drivel like this in the first 5 years.<p>I think the underlying reason for these types of threads is that HNers want to virtue signal that they&#x27;re interested in science, but too lazy to do the actual study and work to understand and contribute. Pro tip: just follow the Twitter NASA channel. You&#x27;ll get pretty pictures, with no real effort.<p>An analogy is when the Linux kernel team started a kernel newbie project, and got nothing but white space patches. So the project had to be abandoned because of low quality and the burden of wasting time for, you know, actual kernel contributors.')
