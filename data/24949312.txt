Every human will need to carry around a charged (or HAL-capable) phone to be able to identify themselves? What happens if you lose your phone, it runs out of battery, you have to lend it to someone else, it crashes, etc.? And if you have to turn on your phone, now you have to enter its decryption password in front of the very person (quite possibly a police officer?) who&#x27;s waiting for you to approve their request?<p>And how in the world is law enforcement on board with this? Will police officers be amused if they have to wait around for you to reboot your phone or something?')
