There&#x27;s enough there that I don&#x27;t doubt bad behaviour, but there&#x27;s also some odd points in there - if they asked her to &#x27;resign&#x27; then that&#x27;s actually a polite way of being fired. Why didn&#x27;t they just fire her? Seems odd.<p>That would make a fun case to look into.<p>Finally: why do Senior Directors and VPs accept this? What kind of VP wants this kind of garbage going on under them? Why not dump the manager? Odd.')
