I don&#x27;t actually know if your messages will still be in other peoples&#x27; backups even if you turn off iCloud Backup, but I also don&#x27;t know enough about the security model one way or another to be able to say, and I haven&#x27;t seen evidence provided. I&#x27;m willing to believe that they are, just for the sake of argument.<p>What I was trying to say is that Apple is trying to make it as easy as possible for people to recover their messages, because this covers most peoples&#x27; threat models, which do not include protecting data from subpoena. Signal is great technology but the fact is it doesn&#x27;t sync messages between devices because they haven&#x27;t figured out how to do that in a way that&#x27;s fully secure. This is a feature that tons of iPhone users want and are not willing to sacrifice for higher security. What am I missing?')
