From what I can tell, Bitcoin seems largely to be an engine for fraud: fake value is injected into the system via dollar-pegged tokens like Tether, retail &quot;investors&quot; pile in to chase rising asset prices, and then the bottom drops out, amidst &quot;liquidity issues&quot; at major exchanges which prevent people from pulling out at the top.
