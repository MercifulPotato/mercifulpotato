Item(by='temperaterealms', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608942507, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25540017, text='1) How would teaching people a language that compiles to JavaScript help them to avoid issues with JavaScript&#x27;s stack and tooling?<p>2) JavaScript has an elegant and simple subset based on closures and functions that return functions. You can avoid much of the language&#x27;s complexity by avoiding prototypes (except for special cases needing performance optimization),  constructors, &quot;class&quot;, and &quot;this&quot; and focusing on that subset instead. Teaching students this subset would cause a problem when they are exposed to codebases that heavily use prototypes, constructors, &quot;class&quot;, and &quot;this&quot;, but wouldn&#x27;t this happen with ClojureScript as well?<p>I probably just need to know more about what the quirks and problems are, more specifically, that Chris Oakman is trying to avoid.')
