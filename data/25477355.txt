They might have increased the margin since then.<p>A $60 game is sold to a retailer for $38-45. The publisher takes 20 of that (nintendo in this case) and the advertising &amp; developer take the remaining 20. So nintendo probably takes 40 dollars profit from first party games like Zelda.<p>Margins on consoles used to be lower, $10-20 and they&#x27;d make $40 on the controller sales. The joycons on the switch cost 45 to make and sold for 50. The margin is back into the console as a whole again.<p>Digital sales on ingame items are likely close to pure profit.')
