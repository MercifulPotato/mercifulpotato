People, myself included, don&#x27;t want specific harmful for society groups to be allowed to speak free, not that nobody&#x27;s allowed to say anything.<p>Yes, nazis should not be allowed to speak free. And no ramblings about privacy here on HN will ever change my mind.<p>In fact, I&#x27;d be happy to sacrifice my own privacy if we can root out the evil of racism, nazism, terrorism, and other things that absolutely everybody agrees are bad.<p>That being said, I think the frameworks used to prevent that at the moment have a lot of potential for abuse, especially from private companies. And it&#x27;s something that should be improved upon, and normal people should have privacy as much as possible.')
