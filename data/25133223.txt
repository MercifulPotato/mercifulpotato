The issue is, even when you are at a stage where you realize what works and what doesn’t, you still wouldn’t know what to write exactly. The only option you have is to write up sentences, then check whether you made a mistake and, if so, write up a different sentence and reiterate. I would need a book which would tell me how to construct sentences which are in accordance with all the rules and concepts. But, it doesn’t seem to be possible to write such a book, since writing really is an art. After all, there also isn’t any book which teaches you how to paint like Da Vinci, but only those which tell you which rules you can apply to his paintings.')
