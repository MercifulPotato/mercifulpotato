Especially with everyone working remote and odd hours these days. We use both email and Slack, but most conversations tend to be asynchronous regardless and I frequently wonder why we even have an <i>instant</i> messenger.<p>That said, I find that even if a message is asynchronous, it is much easier to track conversation flow via slack than email. Reply chains and indentations get messy and become an eye sore to navigate. If I write, &quot;Hey, did you do that thing?&quot; and don&#x27;t hear &quot;Yep, it&#x27;s done&quot; for a day, I can more easily see the flow of thought in Slack.<p>Though, I would appreciate a more standardized practice around, &quot;If Slack says you are available, we can expect you to respond <i>relatively</i> quickly&quot; than seeing a green dot and not hearing back for hours or a day.<p>I still hate &quot;Hello&quot; and &quot;Hi&quot; messages though. It baits a response without putting in any groundwork for me to understand what a person wants. Just say what you need.<p>&gt; Them: &quot;Hello&quot;<p>&gt; Me: &quot;What&#x27;s up?&quot;<p>&gt; Them: &quot;Are you available now?&quot;<p>&gt; Me: &quot;Yes... What do you need?&quot;<p>Flows like this make me come off as an asshole because I&#x27;m annoyed by the tedious nature of the conversation. Tell me what you need so I can know how to respond.<p>&gt; Them: &quot;Hey, when you have minute, can you take a look at the database?&quot;<p>&gt; Me: &quot;Sure thing. Can do in about 15 minutes&quot;<p>^ this is <i>way</i> easier to work with for me')
