You tell it which container you want it to run and how many copies and off it goes.<p>If you have an existing cluster somewhere (say a managed cluster from AWS or GCP) that you want to run your webapp on, just copy&#x2F;paste a YAML from any of the hundreds of guides on the internet and off you go. The k8s docs themselves are also pretty thorough. Your app will run with automatic failover and rolling deploys and whatnot right out of the box.')
