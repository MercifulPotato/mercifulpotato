But for me it&#x27;s one of the first tools I reach for when I find a bug or confusing code, trying to understand the intent. I see that as a fundamental difference in how the problem space is viewed and that they&#x27;re stuck with a Github-first point-of-view. To me, even with merge commits, the history should be a statement of intent and treated as a first-class citizen, or even the primary output. Pushing a branch with threshing is like sending an email with visible backspaces.')
