Journalists not understanding the way scientists speak was vaguely understandable ten months ago, but after a year straight of science being the number one news maker in the world it&#x27;s obvious that the media is just use it as an excuse to scare-monger and increase their clicks.<p>Literally every day in the last few weeks I&#x27;ve had to explain to someone that vaccines will almost certainly have a profound impact on if people can transmit the virus because the news articles keep taking the &quot;We don&#x27;t have data yet on how it impacts transmission&quot; and reporting that as the worst case scenario, when in all likelihood it will profoundly diminish people&#x27;s ability to transmit the virus.')
