Most of analytics&#x2F;ab testing software are just giving data (which is sometimes not even accurate) to customers, so that the people in the analytics team have a job to do. But the reality is that only a very small fraction of those teams know how to use the data to drive more revenue. So if you want to work in analytics there is this HUGE market which today is not addressed by anyone, its how to make more revenue from a website.<p>Segment is not even doing analytics, it has created its own market because no players in analytics has any interest if you want to make more money on your website. As website owners spend their time changing analytics tool, why not make a tool to make changes tool easier ? And that&#x27;s Segment, they are even more useless than an analytics tool but well yeah nobody see it')
