You&#x27;re confusing the system with one particular ideology.<p>Changing incentives, standards and cultural norms absolutely is possible within a capitalist system. In fact, it&#x27;s required. Otherwise, capitalist economies quickly descend into oligarchies with skewed markets that favor those with all the capital.<p>If profit were the <i>only</i> motive without any other rules in play, that wouldn&#x27;t be capitalism at all. We need interventions in order to preserve a healthy system. To suggest otherwise is to defend an ideology that isn&#x27;t capitalism itself.')
