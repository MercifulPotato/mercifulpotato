Most of the talented people are employed on big salaries by a relatively small number large companies with huge budgets for specific applications (e.g., ad targeting, risk assessment, algorithmic trading).<p>But outside of that, not much is happening, so I think there are big opportunities to apply data science in new fields and make the benefits more widely distributed.')
