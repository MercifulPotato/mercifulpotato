Squircles have been the default iOS shape for over 13 years and I wanted to change that. Using a neat trick, matching the iOS wallpaper with the outer background of the app icon, I was able to modify the default icon shape into these playful rectangles.<p>I originally intended just to make a few icons, but then one lead to another and another, and then over 120 â€“ with more in the works! So I have decided to release this properly as a full pack, including instructions, icons and wallpapers for all iOS 14 devices.<p>To celebrate the launch today, use the code `hackernews` at the checkout to get $5 off.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supernotes.app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supernotes.app</a>')
