Rust by itself will not protect you from an sql injection, timing attacks, rainbow attacks, poorly configured TLS, Unix path drilling.  You might have coded an infinite loop that &quot;zero-cost abstractions&quot; has turned into a cpu hog so that a single malicious user can use to DDOS a node.  Did you build in the ability to failover across nodes?  Or will all of the tenants of that node get nuked when kubernetes misses it&#x27;s health check and nukes it?<p>So if you actually care about these things, rust might be really poor, because you are spending time fighting the borrow checker instead of thinking about the security surface area of your system, and the language is optimizing for speed in a domain where the bottleneck is usually the network.')
