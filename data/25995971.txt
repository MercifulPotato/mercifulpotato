Oracle is the company that develops OpenJDK in a similar sense to how Google develops Chromium. Sure, other companies and individuals contribute, and some contributions are big impactful features, like the wonderful Aarch64 port by Andrew and others, but the lion&#x27;s share of the work is done by Oracle.<p>Also, OpenJDK has <i>always</i> been the name of the open part of Sun&#x27;s, and later Oracle&#x27;s JDK; it&#x27;s just that Oracle has made that part 100%. It&#x27;s not some separate implementation. If you go to the OpenJDK homepage and click the download link, you will get the OpenJDK builds by Oracle that are free and come without support. &quot;Oracle JDK&quot; is the support service. Yes, it&#x27;s great that Oracle open-sourced the entire JDK, but its investment in developing it has <i>increased</i> not decreased.<p>Now, OpenJDK has no notion of LTS whatsoever. LTS is a service offered by any company for any version, although most companies offer it for the same versions Oracle chooses. In any event, you weren&#x27;t referring to LTS but to OpenJDK Updates. Oracle <i>leads</i> the bug and security-fix updates for all versions for six months. After which, other contributors may step up to continue <i>leading</i> the maintenance of updates for old versions for as long as they won&#x27;t, but they don&#x27;t do original maintenance, but rather backport patches from the mainline.<p>~90% of the full-time OpenJDK contributors are employed by Oracle, and close to 100% of the changes to the specification are done by them (you don&#x27;t have to take my word for it; you can look at the list of teams and projects, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;openjdk.java.net&#x2F;census" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;openjdk.java.net&#x2F;census</a>, and get the people&#x27;s company at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;db.openjdk.java.net&#x2F;people;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;db.openjdk.java.net&#x2F;people;</a> <i>all</i> active projects and teams are led (and mostly done) by Oracle employees, except for some ports, Shenandoah, and backports to old releases. Don&#x27;t get me wrong -- we work with contributors from other companies every day, and they do more and more and that&#x27;s exciting and amazing -- but we also do more and more.<p>Anyone can build and distribute OpenJDK binaries, but to do so under a <i>different license</i> from the OpenJDK license requires obtaining the code from Oracle under a different license.')
