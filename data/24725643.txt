But I don&#x27;t think the situations are all that similar. If an individual recipe is non-copyrightable because it describes a &quot;process, procedure, or method&quot; then a mega-recipe created by combining other recipes together will still be non-copyrightable for the same reason. That&#x27;s not quite the same thing as curating a set of recipes into a cookbook and thereby exercising creativity in the &quot;selection, coordination, and arrangement&quot; of those recipes.')
