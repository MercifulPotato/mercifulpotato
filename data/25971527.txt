Give equal representation all states in the upper house as in the US senate(2 senator s from each state).<p>This is a terribly unfair system in the US, resulting in a voter from Texas (population 29 million) having 2% of the representation in the Senate as a voter from Wyoming (population 579000) or 5% of the representation in the Senate as a voter from Hawaii (population 1.4 million)<p>The system has its origins at a time when only land owning white men (by definition a minority at the time) had the right to vote, and senators were chosen by state legislators, not residents.<p>Only under that backward system could the <i>current</i> Senate seat allocation be seen as remotely rational, although it can in no way be viewed as just.')
