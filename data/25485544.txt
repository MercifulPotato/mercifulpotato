I frequent various freenode channels (#elixir-lang, #python, #django, #postgres, #kotlin, #centos and various others) and the people there are really helpful and friendly, asking all kind of noob questions even if they have been asked many times. I also try to be helpful on topics I&#x27;m familiar with (f e Django).<p>Being able to ask or answer more or less anonymously without the points&#x2F;gamification thing is liberating for me! And of course I feel better that I have stopped feeding the walled gardens line slack and friends.<p>Now with the help of services like irccloud or even just by using a web client you don&#x27;t have any excuses to not use IRC. Just try it and thank me later; I&#x27;m serafeim on freenode :)')
