They are not the same.<p>Dumping bonds is not just an economic decision, but also a trust decision. You hold bonds because you trust the US. Dumping bonds means you no longer trust the US ability to pay back those bonds with dollars worth anything; that you lost hope of ever getting repaid.<p>And of course you lose your nominal amounts of dollars, who&#x27;s arguing that? You still dump them because you are taking your loses today instead taking more tomorrow.')
