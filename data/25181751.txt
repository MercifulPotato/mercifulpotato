I set it up with Lubuntu and the streaming was done using default Firefox.<p>[2] it was long ago so I don’t remember the details but I am pretty sure that on my first Pi, which must have been a Pi 2, I was able to watch YouTube no problem. I also remember reading articles at the time where people were raving about how good video playback was for such an affordable device.')
