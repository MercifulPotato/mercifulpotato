For the 1% where performance matters, it&#x27;s usually a bit more involved that simply using a map or fold, and hopefully already packaged as an off-the-shelf library. To have measurable gains from parallelism one has to be very intentional in balancing communication vs computation. Think carefully designed libraries like cuDNN.')
