One might say that if it&#x27;s Relevant then it should be motivating, but when I ask them if it&#x27;s motivating I often get an honest no. I find if the person doesn&#x27;t like the goal despite it being SMART, then they tend to avoid it.<p>The other question I learned to ask for Attainable is &quot;do you think there is an 80% chance or better you&#x27;ll hit your date--if not it&#x27;s good to dial the goal back.')
