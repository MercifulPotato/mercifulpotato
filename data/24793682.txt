How do I get my random opinion broadcasted to a newspaper audience? I would probably have to write an opinion column and send it to the journal, then they would read it, and decide whether or not they want to publish it. \nIf it&#x27;s the NYT for example, you can be sure that no matter how well written your piece is, they will never publish something that pushes the theory that COVID-19 is a plot by Bill Gates to put chips into everyone.<p>But you can probably find a sketchy, low-audience journal that would.<p>Well it&#x27;s the same thing, a well known community was banned from Reddit to prevent them from using Reddit&#x27;s amplification mechanism (&#x2F;r&#x2F;all etc), but they now have their own clone of it, with a smaller audience, that you are free to consult.')
