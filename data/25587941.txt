Not being combative, just not sure. If we are in a simulation, then why do things like energy matter? Who says those are meaningful in the &quot;real&quot; world. We can only perceive the simulation, so our idea of physics is whatever the simulation creator thought would be nice, no? May be there are things we can infer from this &quot;simulation&quot; about the world one abstraction above, but in nested simulations that would be arbitrary as well.')
