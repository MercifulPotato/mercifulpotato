As an exception - if you receive any amount of BTC from a blacklisted walled, you have 7 days to send the same amount (or greater) to [this government wallet] and that will erase all your legal liability and make your wallet whitelisted again. We can even automate the process for you if you trust us enough to give us your wallet keys. Alternatively, register email&#x2F;phone numbers with us and we&#x27;ll notify you when your wallet is blacklisted, and tell you how much BTC you should pay us&quot;')
