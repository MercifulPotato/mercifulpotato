One of the problems is often at the backbone of self hosting is a NAS containing sizeable files such as video. Most internet connections are quite limited speed wise and having it internal to the network works a lot better. The one exception being offsite backup.<p>The big cloud providers are also all far too expensive and complicated to be worthwhile for this sort of hosting where substantially cheaper and less capable providers will do the job more than adequately. Smaller and cheaper offers like from Hetzner and Contabo VPS are much more likely to be used in my experience with the self hosting community.<p>I host a bunch of stuff on my home NAS&#x2F;server and ultimately did away with google and a lot of other cloud services and restored my privacy over the past couple of years with software like NextCloud and FreshRSS.')
