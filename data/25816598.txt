Those &quot;new space&quot; companies will struggle to re-use their vehicles with such technologies.<p>Rocket Lab, Virgin Orbit and SpaceX Falcon use keralox (re-usable, with some coking issues), and Blue Origin and SpaceX Raptor uses methalox (cleanly re-usable).<p>All those providers (except Virgin as far as I know) are pursuing re-usability and SpaceX and Rocket Lab are succeeding at recovering the first stage (with SpaceX far ahead at actually re-using them).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;I-Space_(Chinese_company)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;I-Space_(Chinese_company)</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Galactic_Energy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Galactic_Energy</a>')
