While China is by far the biggest trade partner of us Australians. Australia actually has a low proportion of trade as a percentage of GDP and the products being blocked by China are all fungible (perhaps wine being the least fungible). At worst this will cause harm to some sectors for a few years, or drive down the the Australian Dollar or Australian commodities and give China&#x27;s competitors an advantage. I can&#x27;t see it having a large impact on Australia being more pliable to Chinese demands or the Australian economy as a whole. I don&#x27;t think it will even serve the purpose of disuading other countries from taking actions Chinese finds provocative. They are alienating so many countries at the same time, including; Sweden, Czech republic, India, Japan, South Korea, United States, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Canada at once.')
