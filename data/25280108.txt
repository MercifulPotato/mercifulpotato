San Francisco, where I live is perhaps the worst managed place on earth. The way the Chinese are able to complete infrastructure is something we should seriously study, in addition to how they operate their government to support such projects.<p>In San Francisco for example, we are undertaking a street repair of 19th street that will take an estimated 2 years. My best guess is that it will actually take a decade to complete, like the van ness project. This is simply a modification of a sewer system and a street re-pavement - nothing new. China could complete this in a week.<p>The west is slow and we are in decline. China is growing fast.')
