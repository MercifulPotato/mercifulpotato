My guess is that some homeless were put into hotel rooms, which is why there are fewer on the street. I don&#x27;t know how sustainable that is or what will happen when the pandemic is over. Will they be allowed to stay there indefinitely? Who will pay for all that? I have a hard time believing that the homeless population actually decreased during COVID with all the generous social programs going on.')
