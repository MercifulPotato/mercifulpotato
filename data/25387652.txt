Everyone voted for reasons inside their own little bubble, and forgot the wider impact their choice will have.<p>I can&#x27;t blame the individuals entirely, as people were left to vote with very little information, and instead got &quot;Money for the NHS&quot;, &quot;tighter borders&quot;, and &quot;we will control ourselves&quot; painted on the side of buses.
