Applications range from benign factory automation to Boston Dynamics police dogs patrolling your neighborhood, to your walking in downtown Tokyo and being (virtually) greeted by AR entities.<p>What is it that WiFi can not do but 5G can? 5G’s much lower latencies allow for R&#x2F;T CnC (which enables all of the above).<p>So, for example, your factory floor bot’s camera sees something that it’s local AI can’t categorize, so a central node with greater computational power and storage capacity can (in R&#x2F;T) make decisions and send operative commands:<p>Do the roundtrip latency calc for below for 4G and 5G:<p><pre><code>    node -&gt; base station -&gt; fast network —&gt; central control</code></pre>')
