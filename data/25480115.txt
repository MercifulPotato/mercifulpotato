Item(by='_dibly', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608404579, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25476176, text='&gt; Its objectively the most detailed city in a first person action&#x2F;RPG. It objectively has the most detailed quests:quantity.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s gorgeous and the on-rails scripted side-quests are fantastically written and animated, but driving around the city just makes me realize how empty it all feels because only the handful of vendors actually programmed to have an inventory are capable of interacting with you.  But then on the other hand, they didn&#x27;t animate half of the immersive shit you actually can do, like buying a drink from a bartender.  It feels like a game that wants to be an immersive sim, but the second you try to immerse yourself in it you realize that it&#x27;s just a massive facade.')
