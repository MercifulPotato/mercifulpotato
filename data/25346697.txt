Glass intended it to be like Indian classical theater where you can get up and walk around whenever you want. I stayed except for a bathroom break, while friends left to smoke. I think Glass was trying to make a state of mind, not just have people hanging onto every note.<p>Even during Mozart’s time, opera was such a social event that people complained you could hardly hear the music.<p>I’m all for careful listening, but we shouldn’t invalidate people who listen to Glass the way he intended.')
