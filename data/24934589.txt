Now, the press puts out a story that an anonymous source said X, and then another press outlet &quot;confirms&quot; it - and in this sense, the use of the word &quot;confirm&quot; means &quot;we also asked the anonymous source and they told us the same thing.&quot; This is a trick: &quot;confirming&quot; a story <i>used</i> to mean that actual journalism was practiced, where the liklihood of the claims were vetted and determined to be likely true, given multiple independent sources or other evidence. It used to take time and effort to &quot;confirm&quot; stories, that was the job of a journalist, now the term is just used to artificially bolster anonymous claims by having a second talking head talk to the same person as a way to &quot;confirm&quot; the other media source wasn&#x27;t lying that they existed, or something.')
