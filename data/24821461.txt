If you <i>never</i> use any C functions that expect strings to end in a null character, maybe.  (In your approach, the strings end in newlines, including, critically, the <i>last</i> string in the buffer, so the buffer is not null-terminated either.)  So, your sort needs to not use strcmp, and your output needs to not use printf (or even puts).<p>I would argue that this is setting up for catastrophic failure.  If not when writing, sometime later when maintenance happens.')
