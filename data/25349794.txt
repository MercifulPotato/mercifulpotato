In addition to being available to run on AWS, it&#x27;s also available as a container image and in various machine image formats:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;amazon-linux-2&#x2F;#Resources" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;amazon-linux-2&#x2F;#Resources</a><p>AL has had enough work put into it over the years that, while it may have been inspired by CentOS&#x2F;RHEL originally, calling it a rebadged CentOS is not accurate these days. A full and competent team maintains it. While it&#x27;s clearly made similar architectural choices, those are also for compatibility reasons.<p>However I doubt that support is available for anyone not running it on AWS, at least not from AWS -- but then again folks running CentOS weren&#x27;t paying for support from RHEL  either.<p>I also wonder if the announcement is as bad as people make  it sound. I&#x27;m not an expert in Linux distros, but my understanding is that AL2 also uses a streams-like model, in that it provides long term support (patches for existing software) while also making new software available. My understanding was that, while it is inevitably versioned by making artifacts like VMs and containers available over CDNs ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.amazonlinux.com&#x2F;os-images&#x2F;2.0.20201111.0&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.amazonlinux.com&#x2F;os-images&#x2F;2.0.20201111.0&#x2F;</a> ), the expectation is that most users will always launch the latest version, relying on its backward compatibility. Perhaps someone who knows more about the specifics of its release model could comment.')
