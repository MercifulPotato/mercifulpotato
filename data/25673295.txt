The spam was harder and harder to manage - first local SpamAssasin was fine, the I had to tweak rules, then I tried distributed filtering (DCC)... and then I gave up and started paying for Fastmail. This ended up working much better than I could ever do.<p>Usenet was similar -- I remember looking at the newgroups which were at more than half spam (and some were 95%+ spam) and then just leaving for forums. (plus there were a major UX annoyance: unlike with email, there is no simple way to sync read status across multiple devices)<p>Our free(digital) land has been killed by a handful of bad actors. I no longer believe in &quot;free for all&quot; systems. The best we can do is many independent systems, each with its own rules and policies.')
