Most (not all) of the house and devices are networked over ethernet. I&#x27;m super happy that we have all the bandswidth because on most days:<p>- We have 2 adults working full time from home. We&#x27;re in the entertainment&#x2F;technology industry. We&#x27;re streaming video calls and transferring massive files&#x2F;repos _constantly_.
