The default compression level has always been &quot;off&quot;, but when switched on - the default has been lz4 for about 5 years. Zstd support was added less than a year ago and there are still a lot of things that need to be fixed before one could even suggest that it <i>might</i> be a sane default. I like zstd, but I like my uncorrupted data more. I know that compatibility between compressor versions and pools is a concern, and there are also the compression performance problems with the way zstd handles zfs block sizes. Thankfully lz4 works great for zfs and has for many years now.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;openzfs&#x2F;zfs&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;include&#x2F;sys&#x2F;zio.h#L147" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;openzfs&#x2F;zfs&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;include&#x2F;sys&#x2F;zio.h...</a>')
