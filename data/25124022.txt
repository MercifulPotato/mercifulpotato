It&#x27;s a set of primitives for building one.<p>The &quot;client&quot; is your knowledge of its data model, mental mapping of obtusely named commands and flags to things you want to do, and ability to visualize&#x2F;predict the outcome.<p>This isn&#x27;t clear to learners because git manipulates a flowchart with a CLIâ€”a graphical activity misrepresented and disserved by its nongraphical interface. It isn&#x27;t obvious they need to do the work themselves the software could be doing for them, or that they&#x27;re working at a different level of abstraction than they think.<p>Teaching the model first, before the commands or anything else, can prevent a lot of confusion.')
