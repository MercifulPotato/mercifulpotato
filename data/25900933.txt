Yes there&#x27;s &quot;micro&quot; in strategy games, but you can&#x27;t ever take control of a single pawn and play as them (I think the one game that tried to do this was Dungeon Keeper 2, where you could &quot;possess&quot; a minion and play a limited fps-style game in your dungeon).<p>FPS gives you a quick, short term escape from reality as you&#x27;re transformed into a different, perhaps more controlled reality with very well defined and measurable objectives.<p>Strategy and open world games like Factorio, Stardew Valley, Minecraft etc. let you go nuts, with no real objectives except those that you make yourself.<p>I&#x27;m guessing human brains like variety. So if you have to strategize too much at work, you&#x27;re likely to want a mindless romp through zombies with a machine gun. If you&#x27;re doing mindless enterprise coding, maybe you&#x27;re likely to want to plan, build and optimize a gigafactory in factorio to feel more in control of your world.')
