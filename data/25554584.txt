Not a lot but quite a bit.  Most people were putting a phone, gps, hand warmers, small housing and a canopy for when the balloon eventually burst.  I never built one but it was really affordable to do if you wanted.  Im sure there were  restrictions like launching next to an international airport but beyond that there really weren&#x27;t rules.  It was common courtesy to file a NOTAM, but wasn&#x27;t required.')
