I&#x27;m not projecting my own discomfort at sexualized depiction of underage girls on a phantom pedophile, since I would assume such a pedophile wouldn&#x27;t feel discomfort, but arousal.<p>&gt; I donâ€™t think this movie crosses any community standards<p>And if anyone disagrees, you speculate a bit, then say it doesn&#x27;t even matter.. yet think <i>your</i> assessment matters. These aren&#x27;t &quot;community standards&quot;, these are yours. The suppression of how &quot;the community&quot; actually reacts speaks volumes in and of itself.<p>&gt; like it needs the controversy in order to be viewed<p><i>I</i> don&#x27;t need anything for any Netflix stuff to be viewed. I simply call things as I see them.<p>edit: and for the &quot;men on Twitter&quot; thing (as if there&#x27;s not plenty men calling this a profound something or other), here&#x27;s shoe0nhead&#x27;s take: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GvFyhqSE51A" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GvFyhqSE51A</a>')
