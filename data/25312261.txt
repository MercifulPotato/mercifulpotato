It is incorrect to compare percentages or probabilities like this.<p>Here is a different example to try and illustrate the problem:<p>Is 10% larger than 5%?<p>It is not possible to answer this question if the basis on which the percentages are calculated are different.<p>What if I said the 10% was 10% of whatever you last spent money on, but the 5% was 5% of Google&#x27;s annual revenue. Which is larger?<p>The same thing is happening in the above - it isn&#x27;t okay to calculate the probabilities in two situations and then try to cross compare them for size.<p>Sadly this error seems to be cropping up quite a lot!  Matt Parker (Stand-up Maths) has an example of this and related to a recent election: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=aokNwKx7gM8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=aokNwKx7gM8</a>.
