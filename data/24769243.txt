They were nice, mid-range units and I was pretty happy with them. About a year after purchase, the plastic clips that held the handle on the dryer broke off. I called the phone number on my warranty papers and spoke to a human being in Tennessee. I told her what happened, and she asked me for the model number and my address. They shipped a replacement that arrived at my house two days later.<p>A mistake happened, the plastic was too weak (Or maybe I pulled too hard, I don&#x27;t know!) but I was able to contact the company and get it fixed.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter what mistakes are made if there is a way to fix it. If these systems are automated, fine. But if a mistake is made, why isn&#x27;t there a way to get it fixed? That&#x27;s where humans come in.<p>btw, Alphabet&#x27;s income is about 42 times that of the company that made my washer&#x2F;dryer. How is it that they can afford phone reps when Alphabet can&#x27;t?')
