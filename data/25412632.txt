Make sure the thing you are procrastinating is something you _actually_ want to do. If I&#x27;m truly passionate about something, I don&#x27;t generally find myself lacking in motivation (caveat below).<p>2.) Even for things I&#x27;m really passionate about, there are less interesting aspects of the work. My general strategy is to block off time (on my calendar) for 15 minutes a day doing X task. The following week I increase it to 30 minutes and so on so forth. Start out small so you guarantee success. Your brain will get addicted to it.<p>3.) Definitely make sure to only focus on one thing at a time. Your brain can only hold and retain so much information at a given point in time. Most ultra successful people focus on a singular area and go extremely deep on it. They don&#x27;t move on from something until they&#x27;ve mastered it. Very similar to the concept of progressive overload in weightlifting.')
