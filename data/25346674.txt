Item(by='satysin', descendants=None, kids=[25346815, 25349554], score=None, time=1607442176, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25344762, text='The price is high at $549 however given Apple&#x27;s proven audio engineering I will give them the benefit of the doubt on sound quality on par with similarly priced headphones from Sennheiser, etc. I mean have you heard the speaker quality on the 16&quot; MacBook Pro?! Literally no other laptop sounds as good.<p>My biggest concern is if they are user serviceable. I have a pair of Sennheiser that cost around Â£700 when I bought them <i>16 years</i> ago. Granted they are not wireless but I can and have repaired them with parts directly from Sennheiser.<p>I doubt I will be able to do that with the AirPods Max which is a concern. At this price point I expect them to last <i>at least</i> ten years and there is no chance a battery will last that long so if it is not replaceable I can&#x27;t see why I would buy these over an alternative in the same price range.<p>Sure they have some &quot;cool&quot; features but that does not justify a product that will most likely have a battery in need of replacement in 3-4 years becoming worthless.<p>Edit: OMFG They use Lightning for charging not USB-C?! WTF are Apple doing :(')
