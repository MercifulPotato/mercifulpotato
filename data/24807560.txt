The fundamentals- I feel- are quite fixed, although many auxiliary systems do change.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;TR&#x2F;DOM-Level-3-Core&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;TR&#x2F;DOM-Level-3-Core&#x2F;</a><p>&gt; control-intensive, and memory-intensive<p>latency to remote accelerators can be problematic for some control workloads. ideally the control plane can hopefully offload itself onto the accelerator too.<p>I don&#x27;t see memory intensive as a barrier. The 8 vdom+ processors probably come with sizable multi-megabyte caches. Perhaps they could be early on-ram processor architectures? after all it seems they have a fixed function diff pipeline. icd also suggest that perhaps the hardware representation might be very effective at using low bit-depth encodings, saving gobs of memory. keep text offboard &amp; encode attribute values via some columnar representation &amp; this could be a high throughput HTMLElement slinger &amp; differ!')
