Item(by='jvvw', descendants=None, kids=[24766732], score=None, time=1602603484, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24764755, text='I&#x27;ve got quite a bit of experience of doing coding stuff with kids - I set up the CoderDojo at The National Museum of Computing in the UK (paused at the moment), have run a Code Club at our local library, have two kids myself and am a Raspberry Pi Certified Educator. I&#x27;ve done quite a lot of Microbit sessions for kids and a handful of Raspberry Pi ones.<p>I really like Microbits for all sorts of reasons and they fill a very different place in the ecosystem to a Raspberry Pi. They are cheap and have a low entry threshold - I can get a kid doing interesting stuff on a Microbit in a matter of minutes, but there&#x27;s still interesting potential if you want to go in an electronics direction with them. They are also fairly indestructible so you can let kids tinker with them more. There&#x27;s not much you can do with a Raspberry Pi that you can&#x27;t do on other computers without buying something like a SenseHAT or going down the electronics route. It&#x27;s hard to do electronics with kids without close to one-to-one supervision.<p>I can see for older kids with tech-savvy parents who are willing to invest in electronics components etc. there are more possibilities with a Raspberry Pi and there is obviously lots of fun stuff you can do that you could never do with Microbits, but I definitely don&#x27;t see them as direct competitors.<p>The other thing I will say is that I have noticed a bit of a personality thing too - some kids get super-excited by making the LEDs on a Microbit light up and so on and some really don&#x27;t care. Different types of coding definitely appeal different to different children.')
