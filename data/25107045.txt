US foreign and economic policy have actually been exceptionally consistent up until very recently. Every one of the issues you brought up - NAFTA, TPP, the Paris agreement - these were all ripped up during Trump’s term. But remember that it was Lighthizer and co who gave Trump the scissors.<p>Other nations can think whatever they want about “US [...] foreign policy continuity” and can find whatever role models they like. The US just isn’t playing anymore - they neither aspire to nor are interested in being such a role model and the truth is that the rest of the world needs them a great deal more than they need it.<p>Multilateralism is dead in Washington and the US will continue to engage with the world, but piecemeal and one country at a time. Anyone can opt out, but it means foregoing the biggest consumer market in the world and the largest and most efficient finance markets in the world.')
