From the most locked down chromebook to Apple&#x27;s walled garden, these devices can and are exploited.<p>The idea that if somehow we take away enough of your freedom we&#x27;ll make the device safe is basically a bald faced lie. Not once in the history of computing has it worked out. Even my internet connected lightbulbs which literally have only an on and an off exposed are exploitable.<p>No amount of removing user freedom will make users safer. This isn&#x27;t a rocket surgery level conclusion, which means companies that continue pressing down this road probably have some other reason for doing so.')
