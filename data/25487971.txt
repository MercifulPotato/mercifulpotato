Item(by='nobody9999', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608485872, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25487289, text='&gt;Municipal broadband is an interesting idea but physical infrastructure inevitably needs maintenance and I&#x27;m not sure tax dollars should be used to maintain fiber optic lines to residences.<p>There&#x27;s no need to lease the fiber infrastructure, just provide interconnect nodes for ISPs.<p>Municipal broadband maintenance can be paid for by charging interconnect fees to the ISPs who wish to service that area.<p>Once the infrastructure is in place, barriers to entry for ISPs is very low.  All you need is bandwidth and connection to the municipal network.<p>Maintenance can be provided on a cost plus basis by an independent (i.e., not the ISPs) company that manages and maintains the infrastructure.<p>And surpluses from interconnect fees can be used for both network enhancements and other municipal programs.')
