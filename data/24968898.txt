The biggest complaint I&#x27;d have is that Meet sacrifices functionality for cleanliness; everything useful is hidden behind some menu or popover, and you can only open one popover at a time (otherwise whatever you had open closes). This contrasts widely with WebEx, where most things (participants, controls, chat) can be shown at the same time, but also hidden if you don&#x27;t want to see them. Meet seems complicated in comparison because views that are 0 clicks away on WebEx require 1-2 in Meet.')
