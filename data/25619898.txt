I&#x27;m not super diligent about it though and take it more often during times I feel tired since I think it helps. Depending on if I go outside in the summer sometimes I don&#x27;t take it for weeks. However when I got the blood tests I had been taking it regularly, which is why I requested it since I think vitamin D is not measured in the default blood test')
