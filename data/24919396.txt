There are 1Billion iPhone users, That is at least 1 Billion Lightning Cable, ( not counting possible tens if not hundred of millions sitting in the drawer ).<p>How many of those has USB-C Devices?<p>Most of the complain where from Mac users, Ahah, why cant I charge my iPhone with USB-C just like MacBook Pro?<p>There are 100M Active Mac Users, and I willing to bet there are at least 20M on Mac which dont have an USB-C port.<p>What you are asking is to change the port to something that barely gives any benefits for the convenience of a small group of users.  ( an iPhone with USB-C Port does not automatically mean it will support faster transfer, or higher Wattage charging, both can be done with Lightning Port, should Apple feels the need. )<p>I just dont understand it.')
