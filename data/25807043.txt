This is clear from the German version &quot;Willkommen&quot;, which is closer to the original proto-germanic &quot;wiljakumo&quot; and is directly related to the rather dated German expression &quot;Will [er&#x2F;sie] kommen!&quot; (&quot;Let him&#x2F;her in, or &quot;Will he&#x2F;she come [in]!&quot;), or even to English &quot;will ya come!&quot;. The connection of &quot;will&quot; and &quot;come&quot; signals the desire to receive the guest.<p>The french &quot;bienvenue&quot; seems to be a too-literal translation from wiljakumo [0]. A similar construction is missing in Latin.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wiktionary.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;bienvenue#Etymology" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wiktionary.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;bienvenue#Etymology</a>')
