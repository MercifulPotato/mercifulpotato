My question: how can it be changed? It seems to hurt American competitiveness (i read a legal analysis by a US law school which seemed to support this) by putting Americans at such a disadvantage to citizens of other countries living abroad. Anecdotally, when I lived abroad, there were easily 10x the number of Brits or Aussies or Canadians to every American.<p>Also, there was a report that the revenue generated by FATCA was outweighed 100:1 by the worldwide banking industry’s compliance costs.<p>So how does it get changed? Why does everyone act like it is a forgone conclusion that it will never change?<p>The law was meant to tackle wealthy American residents hiding money offshore, not normal people living offshore for whom banking services are “local” to them.')
