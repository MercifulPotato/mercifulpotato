CIELAB is based on 2 degree samples of color. Colors work differently at smaller angles due to the different densities of receptors, particularly the larger size and lower density of S receptors. Pixels on most recent monitors are about 0.02 degrees, 100x smaller in angle, 10&#x27;000x smaller in area than what the old color research is based on.')
