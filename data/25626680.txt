You still have an indirect jump to actually execute the instructions for the bytecode op. Or do you mean having a linked-list of direct jumps somehow?<p>2) Do you mean template JIT by replacing the jump to the bytecode op with implementation of the op?<p>Do you mean the tracing compiler? LuaJIT&#x27;s interpreter still uses a dispatch table.')
