Try the URL below, but don&#x27;t increase fps&#x2F;n params, as that will eat all your GPU cycles very quickly:<p>soundshader.github.io&#x2F;?s=acf3&amp;n=512&amp;fps=1&amp;acf.decay=0<p>It effectively computes the bispectrum as B(p, q) = F(p)F(q)F^(p+q) and runs the inverse 2D FFT to restore the triple autocorrelation. The results are interesting, but not impressive and very GPU intensive (NxNxlog(N) per frame is slow). In any case, I strongly believe that bispectrum is hiding something interesting and I just haven&#x27;t figured how to see it.')
