Too much potential business with them.<p>The upside of Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition of GitHub (and the entire strategy that resulted in the acquisition) is that Microsoft has created incentives for themselves to have GitHub being regarded as a truly open platform that you can depend on. Having repositories exposed to flimsy DMCA takedowns is not part of that.<p>Microsoft, very transparently, wants to make money by being important in how people develop software. If exposure to flimsy takedowns is a part of GitHub, then people will be  more motivated to send their money to GitLab, Atlassian&#x27;s stuff, or a bunch of other options. They have legitimate competition here.<p>Developer&#x27;s opinions of GitHub and Microsoft in general may be of more longer term importance to them than the MPAA&#x27;s opinion of them. I&#x27;m not saying that that is definitely the case (maybe they&#x27;re still getting there), but it&#x27;s worth acknowledging that Microsoft has legitimate <i>actual cold money</i> reasons to fight this. No need to rely only on personal convictions of the people at GitHub.')
