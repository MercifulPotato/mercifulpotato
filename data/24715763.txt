You think that it might be possible that vitamin D deficiency doesn&#x27;t exist at all and that people used to get rickets because of an unhealthy lifestyle.  You&#x27;re kidding right ...?<p>In case, it&#x27;s not clear, I repeat:<p>&gt;By the way, I&#x27;m not advocating for long-term, high-dose consumption (say over 2000 IU) consumption of vitamin D.<p>What I am advocating for is:<p>&gt;What we should be doing now is mass-testing the at-risk population to identify those people with blood levels below 30 ng&#x2F;ml and then do what is necessary to bring them up into the 30 to 40 ng&#x2F;ml range. ...<p>Actually, I agree that the evidence for supplementation with vitamin D for general health, and improving all-cause mortality isn&#x27;t there.  That&#x27;s why I wrote:<p>&gt;Ideally that could be done with sunlight, or food high in vitamin D - for example oily fish, liver, dried-shitake, ...<p>But there&#x27;s a sharp difference between the general health, then general respiratory disease, then COVID-19.  As Deva Boone writes:<p>&gt;But maybe Covid is different. Covid is a respiratory infection, and in meta-analyses severe Vitamin D deficiency does appear to increase the risk of respiratory infections. We also have a plausible mechanism through which Vitamin D could influence Covid. ...<p>OK, now you quote Deva Boone:<p>&gt;<i>No, not really</i>. There is suggestive evidence from a small pilot study. There is likely an effect,<p>Her position is disputed here [0] in the HN comments by kovach<p>devaboone\n&gt;Here is what the article states: &quot;Therefore, a multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to adjust the model by possible confounding variables such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus for the probability of the admission to the Intensive Care Unit in patients with Calcifediol treatment vs Without Calcifediol treatment (odds ratio: 0.03 (95%CI: 0.003-0.25) (Table 3). The dependent variable considered was the need to be treated or not in ICU (dichotomous variable).) CI:-0.30 - 0.03 p:0.08.&quot; The statement is worded in a confusing way, but that is a non-significant p value. Of course we should not put too much into &quot;statistical significance&quot; but it is interesting to note.<p>kovach\n&gt;The only reason that p value is a bit high in that second multivariate analysis is because of the uncertainty of how much all the different risk factors like hypertension, T2DM, age &gt;= 60 etc. affect ICU admission numbers.\nBut even with those variables controlled, the 95% confidence interval is 0.003-0.25, which at worst is a 4-fold reduction in ICU risk.\n&gt;\n&gt;We should also note that the Calcifediol treatment group had 14 patients â‰¥ 60 years old, and the non-Calcifediol group had 5. So the study looks even better with that in mind...<p>Another thing about this study, is that it&#x27;s actually megadosing.  IIRC, something like 100,000 IU on day 1, 50,000 IU on day 3.<p>That&#x27;s probably safe in the short-term in a hospital setting as devaboone states.  But further more, it&#x27;s probably <i>necessary</i> in the context of keeping COVID-19 patients out of the ICU.  <i>If</i> they have COVID-19 because they&#x27;re low in vitamin-D, then a 5000 IU capsule is probably not going to be enough.<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m advocating to mass-test the at-risk population, and supplement until they&#x27;re above 30 ng&#x2F;ml.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24410547" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24410547</a>')
