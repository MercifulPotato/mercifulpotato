T-55, while is near worthless in tank-on-tank warfare, is still a 100mm self-propelled gun, and armor that will withstand anything, but dedicated anti-tank weaponry.<p>Even from my dated high school military lessons from around 2004-2006, I know the official doctrine of Russian tank forces is to avoid tank on tank combat with equal, or superior tanks.<p>Anything more substantial than 3rd generation tanks will not be engaged with guns, but with few heavy ATGMs per target from 5+ kms away. All T-72 in Russian service can fire 120mm ATGMs, even T-55s are supposed to have some 100mm ATGMs for them.<p>A wide front-offensive will certainly decrease the efficiency of anti-tank weapons on the defending side, and let the majority of attacking force to pass.<p>Biggest anti-tank unit today is an attack helicopter, hence Russian zeal to develop things like Panzir SPAG.')
