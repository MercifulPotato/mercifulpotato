We are working towards a &quot;COVID normal&quot; holiday season.<p>We had stay at home orders, restricted access to shops (supermarkets remained open but most closed, with one trip per day per household), social distancing orders, and months of wearing masks, and 10-20,000 COVID tests performed per day (again, free).<p>Our Premier Daniel Andrews faced a lot of criticism for pushing this hard, and it was a lot of pressure on small businesses and the mental health of citizens, but ultimately it was the right decision -- the alternative was untenable, let it become out of control and watch our (universal, free) health care become overwhelmed, and no one would even be able to do anything -- an acceptance of the virus flourishing was not acceptable.<p>If you don&#x27;t have a leader capable of fighting this virus, get rid of them. It&#x27;s frustrating and sad watching from afar this virus run amuck in the United States (and the health care system failing you - I&#x27;d _never_ want your insurance system anywhere near me - but that&#x27;s another battle).<p>I hope and wish for the health of everyone affected by this pandemic.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dhhs.vic.gov.au&#x2F;victorian-coronavirus-covid-19-data" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dhhs.vic.gov.au&#x2F;victorian-coronavirus-covid-19-d...</a>')
