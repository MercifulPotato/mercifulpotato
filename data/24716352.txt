I am not an expert on  American history, but if you did, that escalated quickly :). The only rebuttal I have is, that no employee on Infosys is forced on a Lufthansa economy class seat to Newark airport. They do it by choice.<p>The whole &quot;their code is horrible&quot; is shifting of a goalpost. If that&#x27;s true (and it might well be), then stop hiring them. If businesses see the point you are making, they&#x27;ll stop hiring them.<p>On FAANGs adding value - I 100% agree. FAANGs add way more value than any Indian consulting company and that&#x27;s reflected in the market cap of these companies. But surely,one can appreciate that FAANGs add value and that they lobby to have laws created in their favor. My limited point is that I don&#x27;t think these American companies (which benefit from the new H1B rule) have any higher moral ground to claim with respect to their stance on immigration laws.<p>Also, A higher wage is an odd way to restrict hiring. A FAANG company can pay much higher wages for low-end coding job than Indian consulting companies ever can. So, if a FAANG hires the same Indian kid, at 120K&#x2F;yr and have him&#x2F;her do the same shitty job that the consulting company does, there&#x27;s nothing here that stops it (please correct me if I am mistaken)')
