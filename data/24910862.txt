FPGAs are basically an assembly line that you can change overnight. Excellent at one task and they minimize end to end latency but if it&#x27;s actually about performance you are entirely dependent on the DSP slices.<p>With PIM your CPU resources grow with the size of your memory. All you have to do is partition your data and then just write regular C code with the only difference being that it is executed by a processor inside your RAM.<p>Having more cores is basically the same thing as having more DSP slices. Since those cores are directly embedded inside memory they have high data locality which is basically the only other benefit FPGAs have over CPUs (assuming same number of DSP and cores). Obviously it&#x27;s easier to program than either GPUs or FPGAs.')
