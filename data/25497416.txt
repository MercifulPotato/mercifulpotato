I had written the company and the shares off and somehow in 2020 they pulled the nose up. Really looking forward to the final payout!<p>I feel really fortunate to have had what Steve calls a 20th century deal in the 21st century.  I was able to maintain an undiluted share of the company, which interestingly I was never able to do in the 20th century.')
