I was pretty sure the level of understanding and debate would be higher on the US channel (and I checked a few of them) but was astonished to see that actually there wasn&#x27;t any real concrete and intelligent political analysis (ok just one on numbers using stats) or even one ounce of debate  while on the french channel the debate invited experts, was intelligent, one side was conceiding things to trump and the others one fighting it using arguments rather than emotions.<p>It is just mindblowing as an outsider to see that you totally removed debate from the equation and that any kind of debate&#x2F;analysis is perceived as criticism or even worse racism&#x2F;[add any bad word there] if it concedes things to trump.')
