That will help you to solidify what you have learned into your brain.<p>That&#x27;s what boggled my mind when I read this.  There&#x27;s no way that he read multiple chapters of CLRS a night <i>and</i> did all of the problems at the end of the chapter.  I&#x27;ve done most of those exercises; some of them took a long while to get through.<p>I guess that&#x27;s why I take issue with the advice that is given in the article.  It is kind of unrealistic for any 30+ professional with a family, children, etc. to study this much for an interview.')
