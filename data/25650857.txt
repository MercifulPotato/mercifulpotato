That way we could have approved a 2-week dosing schedule and started giving out the first doses, and by the time the first patients are ready for their 2-week dose, the results of the 4-week dosing schedule would be ready, etc, etc. So we could push back the 2nd dose &quot;indefinitely&quot;, preventing this issue in the first place. (Assuming by the time the 2nd dose is really worth getting, we have already made enough vaccines that the scheduling details are less important)')
