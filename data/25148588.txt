I&#x27;m about 60% through the 720-page tome, <i>&#x27;Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst&#x27;</i> by Robert Sapolsky.  &quot;Electrifying&quot; indeed, as a blurb at the back of the book puts it.  The narrative structure is quite compelling, where Sapolsky starts by examining a behavior in the present and gradually zooms out, all the way back to evolutionary factors from millennia ago.  The book also provides helpful primers on neuroscience, endocrinology (important to understand the impact of hormones), and proteins.  Take a good three months to read it; really.<p>So far my only quibble is that Sapolsky cites the infamous &quot;priming&quot; study from <i>&#x27;Thinking, Fast and Slow&#x27;</i>, which the author, Daniel Kahneman, himself has retracted it elsewhere.  This is forgivable, as the retraction from Kahneman (Feb 2017) and the release of <i>&#x27;Behave&#x27;</i> (May 2017) were too close.  Though I&#x27;ll keep an eye for other transgressions.<p>Regardless of my quibbling, <i>&#x27;Behave&#x27;</i> has so far been an exhilarating read; it covers an insane amount of ground, all while not losing sight of its goal—a better understanding of human nature.<p>Don&#x27;t let the page count discourage you—you&#x27;ll quickly warm up to Sapolsky&#x27;s loquacious writing style, peppered with tasteful humor and a deep love for science.  And don&#x27;t skip the footnotes; plenty of interesting bits in there.  (Get the hardcover edition if you can, it&#x27;s much less unwieldy   during back-and-forth flipping, among other benefits.)')
