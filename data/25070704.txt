Do you mean the printer company and its management or an individual engineer who work for them? Speaking from the perspective of an individual, I think the hardware and software developers who designed the protection aren&#x27;t really interested in preventing people from using 3rd-party ink refills, they probably had no personal motivation to lock people out, perhaps they hate inkjet printers like everyone else on Hacker News. The only reason they implemented it is because they were being paid by their employers. So my guess is a &quot;fair enough&quot; response.')
