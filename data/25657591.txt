Republicans have openly called for martial law, and using numerous underhanded (but technically legal) tactics to overturn the election, and state governors have suggested secession and civil war.<p>The narrative he and the right wing have been building over most of the last decade - that America at all levels of society is being infiltrated and captured by leftist extremists as a pretext to some kind of communist&#x2F;globalist&#x2F;NWO takeover (so vote for God, Guns and the GOP) - is exactly the doomsday trigger scenario that American militias have fantasized about and wargamed over, and QAnon and many Evangelicals believe Trump has been sent by God to cleanse America of occult pedophiles and atheistic liberalism.<p>Sinclair Lewis may or may not have said &quot;When Fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross,&quot; in other words, by infiltrating American gun culture and conservative Christianity, because those are the forces that control the greatest potential for populist violence in the US.
