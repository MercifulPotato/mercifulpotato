GPS tells me that I need to turn left ahead, no problem I work my way over to the far left lane. However when I get near the intersection it turns out I needed to have turned into parallel side street a quarter mile back. Other times those side streets are really long freeway ramps or turn off before the left turn. Other times they stop traffic at the intersections and you have to turn left across multiple lanes that don’t turn left. It’s a wildcard every time.')
