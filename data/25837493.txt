Good lockdowns have had amazing impacts in many places.<p>Australia is a good example. Victoria had out of control community spread (~100 infections a day), so locked down for 3 months. This meant no visitors at home, no going to work unless one of a few specific reasons, no general retail, masks mandated at all times outside the house, no travelling more than 5k for any reason, no travelling for exercise.<p>They got rid of it. This is what lockdown means. This is what the science shows us is effective. Wearing a mask and office jobs being done from home is not a lockdown.<p>Saying badly implemented lockdowns don&#x27;t work so why bother is the attitude that is killing thousands of people a day.')
