If a metric can be gamed then I agree it&#x27;s a flawed or poor metric, but there are definitely good metrics that make good targets as well.<p>Concrete example:  I used to work in aircraft maintenance putting Search and Rescue aircraft into the sky to go pull people out of lakes or out of crevasses, etc.  One of our KPIs&#x2F;metrics was the number of hours spent in what&#x27;s called the &quot;Red&quot; state, i.e. you have no serviceable aircraft that can fly if a callout happens, meaning the region is lacking airborne SAR assets.<p>There isn&#x27;t really a way to (legally) game this metric.  Either your aircraft is serviceable or it&#x27;s not.  The only way you could cheat is to just lie on your statistics and release aircraft for missions that are actually not serviceable, but that&#x27;s going to bite you in the ass sooner or later, would require a conspiracy of 10+ people to lie on official airworthiness documents, and doing so is a federal crime not to mention a big ethical no-no.<p>Our monthly target was zero.  I.e. we tried to go each month keeping at least one serviceable aircraft at all times.  We only hit that target a few times while I was in that job but it was rewarding, and on months where the Red indicator was particularly large I would drill down with senior staff to determine if it was an anomaly or if there was a trend starting, and we&#x27;d address it.<p>And yet it&#x27;s still a good measure because it&#x27;s directly measuring what was our primary objective (i.e. can you put aircraft in the sky to carry out rescue missions or can you not?)')
