This has gone to 0% (almost no profit) because no one can offer good returns on the money.  Or the people receiving the money have so many choices that the lenders are forced to compete to 0%.  All the VC money sloshing around for free is because there is no more favorable place for that money to find profit and the 1-in-10 (?) shot that startups have is still better odds than average other opportunities.<p>Right now it seems there is too much money searching for returns.   And that money is not somehow just going to disappear over time.<p>To take the opposite hypothetical, if you consider the accumulated wealth of all countries now, and the relatively low growth of most of them, how could it be possible that <i>all</i> that money could find good investment return rates?  Except for isolated pockets of growth, need for investment, where will we find broad returns anything greater than a few %?<p>So, until something fundamental about the money supply changes, are we in for a long period of pretty much 0% returns?<p>I would love to know some more sophisticated ways to understand the situation.')
