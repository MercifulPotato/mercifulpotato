In Debian, the whole tree of packages has to be in sync. That works well for Arch, as it is a rolling release, but IMHO that slows down Debian it doesn&#x27;t use their manpower efficiently.<p>Longtime ago, when Nix was not popular, there was a discussion in debian-devel about adopting Nix. It was probably premature. This discussion has resurfaced a number of times. I think currently they would benefit enormously from Nix or rolling out their own tooling that implemented equivalent ideas.<p>With such a big community and large package set, packages should be able to be decoupled from each other so that they can depend on different library versions and move at their own pace. Also, Nix-like tooling would allow to automate and test most package updates when upstream changes, or find common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) automatically. Currently, there&#x27;s a lot of manual intervention needed to do this.<p>This would also be advantageous for end users, as they could mix and match packages from different channels. PPAs are an inferior solution.')
