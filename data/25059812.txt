The overwhelming majority of the party is ideologically opposed to the kind of large-scale social programs he advocates. With respect to point 2, working class voters, who still tend to vote Democrat, although less so than before, are reacting to the failure of the Democratic party to offer them any substantial improvement in their material conditions for the past 40 years. 2016 afforded them a chance to vote for someone who was at least promising positive change (as spurious as it was), and in addition to that, was free of the kind of sneering technocratic contempt that Democrats so often direct at the working class.')
