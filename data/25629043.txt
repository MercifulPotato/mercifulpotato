One of those burial sites spanned 9th-10th century, while the other was about 2 centuries younger.<p>The age profiles of the dead were rather different. The earlier cemetery had only a few remains over 37, while for the latter, the drop-off age was about 48. It seems that the more stable conditions of the High Middle Ages (including some improvement in agriculture) gave people about an extra decade to live.<p>Of course, this was Central Europe, very underdeveloped in comparison with the ancient civilizations in the Mediterranean.')
