The strategy is to let the computer generate a baseline and then hand-tune from there.<p>Humans aren&#x27;t really good at making an area feel wild or natural... we stink up the place with hidden order. So algorithms that generate terrain, tree placement, tree shape, etc are already outperforming humans because their form of pseudorandom is more natural-feeling than our own.<p>I don&#x27;t know how famiar you are with the industry so apologies if I&#x27;m over-explaining, but check out SpeedTree if you want to see one of these products.
