We were far worse in the past (see Draize test) and have gotten better at <i>not</i> performing really horrible experiments on animals. But it&#x27;s precisely because animal lives are seen as less important that we are willing to perform experiments with almost no benefit for humanity.<p>At the moment, the largest tragedy is meat consumption - we can focus on improving lab animals&#x27; lives too, but the meat consumption is orders of magnitude worse with respect to causing suffering to sentient creatures.')
