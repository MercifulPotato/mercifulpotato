You’re the one stacking the deck in that instance, not Apple.<p>Not really, if you look at it from the perspective of <i>software developers</i>.  If an Android developer no longer wants to be a customer of the Play Store (or gets rejected by them), they can go to a 3rd party app store or tell their users to sideload.  An iOS developer has no options besides Apple: they either stick with them or essentially `rm -rf AllMyIOsInvestment&#x2F;`.')
