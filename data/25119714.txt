People will be explaining where to go to do something, and I look around madly... only to find out that UI elements are hidden because I don&#x27;t happen to have permissions.<p>Knowing what access you need versus what you have is important, but just hiding stuff is not the right solution.  There should be some explanatory text like &quot;you need role foo.bar.baz to run this command&quot;.<p>(To be fair to Google, they try to do things like showing what API call or gcloud command you would run to replicate the UI in your own program&#x2F;script, which is very helpful of them.  Every UI should do this.  Some good ideas in there, some bad ideas in there.)')
