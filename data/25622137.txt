Every single one was repaired before being replaced. Roughly 7k â‚¬ down the drain.<p>Combine this with Endpoint Management crapware from my employer and you have a toxic combination. Esp. as said crapware is primarily targeted and optimized for WIN machines as the parent company is &gt; 500k WIN machines and only about 25k - 40k Mac machines.<p>Sad, as I really loved the pre 2018 MB Pros and it was a blast doing my data analysis work there.')
