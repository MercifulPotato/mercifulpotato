That will be shared by all car companies and isn&#x27;t something the car companies themselves manage.<p>That said, I think that in many cases they should share space. For example on a crowded downtown street, there should be standardized charging stations that can accommodate multiple types of cars. It would be annoying to have one parking spot for Tesla, another for GM, another for Ford. But that&#x27;s not a question of waste or resourcefulness and I don&#x27;t think that needs a government to step in to regulate either.<p>Tesla&#x27;s, along with pretty much all electric cars, support standardized charging as a matter of convenience to the user.')
