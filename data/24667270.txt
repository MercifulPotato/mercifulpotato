I mean, they might feel a bit bad, and all else being equal they&#x27;d prefer not to have it released, but no one&#x27;s going to lose their jobs or their funding just for that.<p>So the enforcement mechanism here has to be through the courts: some student or students will sue the district for negligence. Paying out millions of dollars in legal settlements <i>is</i> something the district will care about, and might cost someone their job, so it&#x27;s a good stick for the hackers to use if the district would lose such a lawsuit.<p>What&#x27;s the case law like here? Are they likely to lose?')
