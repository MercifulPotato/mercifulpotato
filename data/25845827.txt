Moreover, the more an organism has been aggressive, the less testosterone is needed for future aggression.  When testosterone does play a role, it&#x27;s facilitatory—testosterone does not &quot;invent&quot; aggression.  It makes us more sensitive to triggers of aggression, particularly in those most prone to aggression.  Also, rising testosterone levels foster aggression only during challenges to status.  Finally, crucially, the rise in\ntestosterone during a status challenge does not necessarily increase aggression; it increases whatever is needed to maintain status.  In a world in which status is awarded for the best of our behaviors, testosterone would be the most prosocial hormone in existence.&quot;')
