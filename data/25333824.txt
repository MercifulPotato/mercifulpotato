It&#x27;s just that during the weeks with these roll downs, the expected value of a ticket can be positive.<p>Effectively, players during weeks without rolldowns are subsidizing excess prizes for weeks with the rolldown rule in play.  This is probably a feature you don&#x27;t want in the game, but it&#x27;s not too different from games where when the jackpot is particularly high that the EV of a ticket can exceed its price.')
