There&#x27;s two reasons:<p>#1 Because the language provides no means to arbitrarily mock fields of a class, an entire design pattern and framework needs to be created just to do so. Why can&#x27;t the language just have such a feature?<p>#2 This actually temps people in building worse design, because instead of creating pure units that don&#x27;t have dependencies to begin with, it facilitates the opposite of creating deeply nested chains of dependencies, because &quot;DI framework wires it up for me&quot;. Where if you didn&#x27;t have that luxury, you&#x27;d be pushed towards pure units that don&#x27;t have state dependencies, and integ tests instead, which in my mind is much better overall.')
