Consider a one-on-one chat (either over an instant messenger, or face to face in person). The period of time after which it becomes an &quot;awkward silence&quot; is much shorter in person.<p>If I ask somebody a question in person and they take 5 mins to respond then that&#x27;s a pretty ling awkward silence. If I message somebody on Slack and they take 5 mins to respond then that&#x27;s not unreasonable.<p>You could argue that the &quot;Seen&quot; feature of chat is meant to lower the acceptable wait time online, and indeed it does, but still not by as much. If somebody has &quot;Seen&quot; my message but doesn&#x27;t reply after a couple mins, I&#x27;ll start to wonder why, but usually my reasonableness kicks in and I think maybe they just are busy or didn&#x27;t mean to click the notification or something. I&#x27;d still wait far longer for somebody to respond to a &quot;seen&quot; message than I would for somebody to respond to a &quot;heard&quot; question I asked them in person.')
