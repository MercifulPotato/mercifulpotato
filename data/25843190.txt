Even though there was no evidence of such, people just assumed it MUST be true because the CCP MUST be evil.<p>And before Jack Ma &quot;disappeared&quot;, people were worried about Jack Ma and Ant Group being a national security threat, because of his ties with CCP.

Jack&#x27;s criticism hit a nerve because it came over as a rich man trying to change society for his own benefit, rather than lifting society with him.<p>See Cyrus Janssen&#x27;s blog post about this:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cyrusjanssen.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;trump-free-speech-and-where-is-jack" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cyrusjanssen.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;trump-free-speech-and-wh...</a>\nCyrus is an expat who has worked in China for 12 years.<p>Does China have problems? Of course it does.
