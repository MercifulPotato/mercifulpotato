If programmers spent the time to optimize everything instead of gluing a bunch of inefficient libraries together, software would cost even more than it does now. So that&#x27;s even higher salaries because there is even more business competition for the same pool of available programmer hours in the workforce (and that doesn&#x27;t even take into account the fact that you would wipe out 90% of the programming workforce if writing assembly is required).<p>Moore&#x27;s law means that you can afford inefficient code, so it&#x27;s taking money <i>from</i> programmers and keeping it in the businesses that would have originally had to pay for a hand-tuned piece of code.')
