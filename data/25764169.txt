Item(by='albroland', descendants=None, kids=[25764541, 25765215], score=None, time=1610555144, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25763067, text='I found this quote from the article a bit confusing: &quot;wiping out parts of the economy where women dominate: retail businesses, restaurants and health care.&quot;<p>Specifically the claim that the health care industry was wiped out. Am I missing something? Anecdotally, I have friends who became travelling nurses during the pandemic, going from hotspot to hotspot under contract making SV software engineer money. ACA enrollments appear way up this year and insurance carriers all appear to be doing well. Hospital staff are definitely being stretched but hourly workers are looking at more money as a result. I know initially hospitals cleared most elective surgeries, leaving surgeons + their support staff in a pickle, but all the surgeons I know are back to business as usual on both the east and west coast. I suppose admin staff who&#x27;d otherwise be sitting at the desk answering phones for more typical primary care operations might&#x27;ve been squeezed as well, but I&#x27;ve been making ophthalmologist, dentist, GP appointments throughout the past year talking to humans so that doesn&#x27;t seem to match either.')
