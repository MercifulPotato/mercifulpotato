Thats what the various things like Corba tried to do: define meta-state about things.<p>I probably misapplied ORM above. It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if somebody said &quot;wrong acronym&quot; Copy on Write (CoW) is how you avoid duplicating memory for code or data which doesn&#x27;t change: when you do what unix does in fork()&#x2F;exec() your initial state is: things which haven&#x27;t been written are the same. So it is <i>zero</i> (kinda) extra cost. If you write to that bit of memory THEN it copies, so thats Copy, on Write. Then you have two, because one of them changed. So, If all electron backed apps means the 200+mb of electron crap is Copy-on-Write, its not 200 for mail, 200 for word, 200 for slack, its 200 for &quot;all of them&quot; until one of them writes to memory: it reduces the memory footprint.<p>DTRT is do the right thing.')
