Once the balance is 0, there is not extra cost.<p>It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m happy in particular, as I have account there also, and I had to transfer remaining money. I believe there is more cases like mine, that has PayPay to pay on some portals that accepts only that payment method, and we&#x27;re not willing to share credit card information.')
