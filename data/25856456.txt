I think this may have changed since I last saw a CloudFlare certificate with &gt;100 SANs for various unrelated sites on a client&#x27;s certificate around 3 years ago. The certificate from the post is not shared, and I can&#x27;t find any other Universal SSL certificates that are shared now. This support article still suggests they&#x27;re shared, however [0].<p>They likely didn&#x27;t give clients the private keys before simply to save costs by reducing the number of certificates they had to issue. Now that they&#x27;re not sharing certificates, it&#x27;s probably just a way to extract a little more money from customers.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.cloudflare.com&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;articles&#x2F;204144518-SSL-FAQ#h_293541339461548959928672" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.cloudflare.com&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;articles&#x2F;204144518-S...</a>')
