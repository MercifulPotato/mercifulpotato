The GPD family of Windows devices (Win&#x2F;Win2&#x2F;Win Max and Pocket&#x2F;Pocket 2&#x2F;Pocket2 Max) have pretty good hardware and somewhat decent linux support (they all have official Ubuntu Mate images), and the GPD MicroPC even has quite a few ports more than a modern ultrabook (ethernet, full size usb, 3.5&#x27; jack, even a RS232!). They have price points ranging from 400$ to 1000$, so there&#x27;s something for everyone as well.<p>Disclaimer: While I don&#x27;t work for GPD I&#x27;m a very happy owner of a Win 2 that I use for light gaming and game streaming with Stadia and Geforce Now, and I&#x27;ve started using it for &quot;computery tasks&quot; more and more as I just keep that and my iPad Pro in my backpack - not that I leave the house often these days, though...')
