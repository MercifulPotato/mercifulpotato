In which case it&#x27;s a bit of a cluster. It&#x27;s documented and I understand <i>why</i> - but it&#x27;s still a pain point (it makes the escape key not exit insert mode anymore, by default).<p>(nota bene:  I understand these things are hard to solve and I don&#x27;t mean to throw the stone without putting my own time on the line to fix it, but that&#x27;s one reason I&#x27;m not using VS code for clojure. Doom emacs with cider is still better, even if not perfect). If people know of someone I could throw money at to solve the integration for VS code, I&#x27;d be happy to do that.<p>If you find a good&#x2F;great experience for clojure <i>with vim keybindings</i>, I&#x27;m all ears.')
