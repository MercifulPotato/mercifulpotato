Item(by='bko', descendants=None, kids=[25904901], score=None, time=1611588326, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25903011, text='I agree that its a difficult problem, one that money won&#x27;t solve.<p>I think the more local the action the more effective. For instance, a neighbor can help out one person most effectively. That person may need shelter, food, mental health services, mentorship or something else. When you expand that out to a city, it makes it more difficult since the organization has less knowledge about the individual. And as you expand it to larger and more disconnected entities, the results become worse.<p>One argument could be that corruption and general incompetence may be lower on the state level as opposed to local, since state level is a more competitive political climate. In other words, I think governors are more likely to get voted out as local officials, many of whom are unelected, but I could be wrong. The other argument is that state has more shared resources and more experience that would overcome the fact that they&#x27;re more disconnected from the subjects they&#x27;re trying to help.<p>But the trade-off exists and I believe that the most effective way organizations are small local organizations as opposed to large top down state-level organizations. And since local organizations have failed, my impression is that higher level, more bureaucratic organizations will similarly fail. I think we should focus on re-thinking about how we handle the problem and not just throw money at it, because the moneyed interests may even be hindering the effort.')
