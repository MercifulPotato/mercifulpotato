It&#x27;s against the rules and isn&#x27;t constructive.<p>But I agree with you. Reddit is growing to be as hard-left as voat is hard-right. It&#x27;s not quite there because there are still a lot of old communities before everything got political who still use Reddit (&#x2F;r&#x2F;MechanicalKeyboards&#x2F; and such).<p>But honestly, everyone needs to get off Reddit and go back to the days of phpBB forums, individual blogs and RSS feeds. Aggregation sites like HN, Reddit, etc should be where you go to promote stuff you&#x27;ve found though following individual you like.')
