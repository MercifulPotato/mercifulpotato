It&#x27;s because the animation you linked to is misleading.<p>Work is the dot product of force and velocity. If the thrust is always orthogonal to the velocity, then the burn does no work on the rocket, and so it can&#x27;t increase the magnitude of the velocity.<p>In the animation you linked, it&#x27;s plotting out what would happen if you continue to burn due north for some period of time <i>as your velocity vector changes.</i> But you wouldn&#x27;t do that--if you&#x27;re trying to change your inclination, you burn perpendicular to your velocity, and as the direction of velocity changes, the direction of the burn changes too, such that it&#x27;s always orthogonal.<p>It&#x27;s easy to watch this happen in the game if you don&#x27;t use the maneuver node, but just use SAS to burn in the normal direction. The direction of &quot;normal&quot; changes during the course of the burn, and (except for small errors), your apoapsis and periapsis stay constant.')
