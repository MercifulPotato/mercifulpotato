As beautiful as those drawings are, atoms and molecules simply don&#x27;t behave that way.<p>As for the &quot;Stagnation&quot; narrative: I don&#x27;t see it. It seems to me that &quot;Stagnation&quot; is proclaimed by Dark Enlightenment types who measure progress by the height of the phallic buildings a civilization builds (ah, right, of course &quot;a set of towers a hundred kilometers tall with a magnetic accelerator to shoot payloads&quot; is not phallic imagery at all...), by the use of energy (most emblematic in proof of work cryptocurrencies, where value is created through the expenditure of energy for expenditure&#x27;s sake), etc.<p>I measure progress by ingenuity. I see a world where a wristwatch has more computing power than the a supercomputer had a generation ago; where in-ear headphones or hearing aids can perform highly sophisticated signal processing on the fly, and where neural network based algorithms are currently improving performance by leaps and bounds.')
