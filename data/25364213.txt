Item(by='gnomewascool', descendants=None, kids=[25366342], score=None, time=1607545315, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25363662, text='Yes, I totally agree that Manifest V3 solves some real problems â€” in the case of many webextensions, I would welcome the ability to manually control which domains the extension can run in.<p>However, the move to Manifest V3 also involves curtailing the power of extensions, including those that I trust as much or more than the browser itself. I want uBlock origin to be able to intercept and filter requests according to the logic that gorhill deems most sensible rather than however Chromium wants it to be done, since I trust gorhill far more than Google (and possibly slightly more than even Mozilla). I don&#x27;t think that any of the tiny extensions that I&#x27;ve written to scratch my own itch require any of the capabilities removed in Manifest V3, but if they did, I&#x27;d also want them to keep having them.')
