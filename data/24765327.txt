What does &quot;paying to invent&quot; mean, exactly?<p>Presumably the employer wouldn&#x27;t be happy if the designer simply had a bunch of nice design ideas and kept it in his or her head.<p>Instead, the designer should at some point write those ideas down and hand them over as a design document to the rest of the company. <i>That</i> process can provably happen during work hours, and the contents of the design document should be subject to the employment contract - since that&#x27;s what the employer is paying for.<p>The document could, for example, have a boilerplate legal heading with &quot;I declare all the contents herein are the sole IP of $company&quot; or some such. Or the contract could specify that any document produced during work hours should satisfy such requirements. That would seem a safer legal protection than simply asserting the right to what the designer came up with on the previous day.<p>After all, if the concern is that the employee could have invented the game in the evening and then submitted it during the day - well, he or she could just as easily have invented it before their employment began and submitted it afterwards, no?')
