With the ‘Streisand Effect’ in full swing, there are now probably more copies of YouTube-DL online than there ever were.<p>Did it though? Sure, the Streisand effect caused more <i>distribution</i> of youtube-dl, but that&#x27;s never really been an issue. Open source software as widely used as youtube-dl is mirrored in a hundred different places.<p>The issue here is what does <i>future development</i> of youtube-dl look like? It sounds like the rolling cipher stuff is going to have to go if development is to remain on Github, and that&#x27;s a win for RIAA.')
