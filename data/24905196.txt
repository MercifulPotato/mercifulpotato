It&#x27;s not surprising it makes you cringe, but please consider in context.<p>&gt; the quality drop; recompressing, non-matching frame rates, non-matching resolution--all the same goes for audio.<p>Are you trying to preserve quality or prove something? My response was in context for &quot;gathering evidence&quot; but not police work, and not archival quality. Would such a copy cause your problem to prove libel, copyright infringement, illegitimate disclosure, etc?<p>&gt; performance; must be done in real-time, cannot queue up multiple sources<p>Can most definitely queue up multiple sources. Just make a youtube playlist and record it. Yes, it takes &quot;real time latency&quot;, you&#x27;ll take 10 hours to download 10 hours of video in general -- that&#x27;s not an issue for evidence or gathering in a non law-enforcement context.<p>&gt; metadata, organizing, indexing; likely hand-typed separately, prone to error, prone to not knowing if you&#x27;ve done that video already.<p>Again - consider the context of my answer, NOT archival quality anything. The &quot;cc&quot; stream GP mentioned, which can be searchable etc - has also seen many revisions for many files when the Google STT algorithms are revised, and with corrections.<p>&gt; Chain of custody; grabbing the original video allows you to prove two identical copies match (using file hashes or other comparisons) screen recording makes that difficult to impossible to confirm--maybe with fancy AI you&#x27;d have to run by the courts?<p>You have <i>no</i> chain of custody. You can prove two downloads are the same, but YouTube does not guarantee they keep the file the same (indeed, they&#x27;ve modified files several times, changing formats and even remastering old &#x27;80s videos). If a  file is later pulled (which is what GP was talking about), what are you going to compare it to?<p>Chain of custody is law enforcement business. They&#x27;ll get the files from YouTube directly, with affidavits and statements about it and any modifications, if they need it in court. <i>You</i> are going to civil court, and youtube-dl is not making your evidence more valid than a screen recording.')
