Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[24681444], score=None, time=1601833957, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24680564, text='It&#x27;s straightforward to compare the net present value of overbuilt boondoggles to modern commercial architecture which trades dramatically lower initial construction costs for modestly higher ongoing maintenance. The reason private entities overwhelmingly choose the latter is not that they prefer to waste their own money.<p>Moreover, longevity is often a <i>cost</i>. How many overbuilt old post offices and municipal buildings are we now effectively stuck with in places where they&#x27;re no longer an appropriate size for the locality? The city&#x27;s needs are going to be different in twenty or thirty years than they are now, so there is no point in designing ordinary structures to last longer than that when it so often makes more sense to build a new one after that period of time consistent with the needs of today rather than a generation ago.')
