Item(by='bee_rider', descendants=None, kids=[25497009], score=None, time=1608569569, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25496446, text='&quot;Pay up or we&#x27;ll spy on you&quot; seems like it would have bad optics.<p>Also, they can&#x27;t sell privacy, just that they won&#x27;t track using their network. If your information is being taken by multiple parties and they are all pouring it into the same data soup, the value of paying any particular spy off seems pretty limited. Apple can try to sell privacy, because they are in the position to fight all the spies simultaneously (we&#x27;ll see how effective it is, seems like a really hard task but it is a good sign that they&#x27;ve got Facebook worried).<p>AlsoAlso it is possible that the value of tracking is non-linearly related to the number of people you are tracking (if three people are somehow similar I might be able to apply some insight gleaned from one to the other two). So, they might fundamentally want quite a bit more than any reasonable person would be willing to pay for their service, to stop tracking.')
