While the academics were top notch compared to basically any other public high school around, it definitely did not prepare you adequately for (formal) engineering school. That includes the advanced courses that you had to take. I suspect that there are very few public schools that prepare you for those actual demands. Additionally, it was extremely competitive with respect to academics (in terms of grades&#x2F;rank) and developing extracurriculars. It was no way representative of real life.<p>While I was not a good student in high school, and basically saw it as “doing time”, I was forced to get my act together academically when I became severely chronically ill my freshman year at university. My work ethic changed completely because not being a full time student meant no insurance. Also, if I did not have a job in the future with good benefits, it literally meant death (I require a blood product to survive). So, engineering school it was. But now I don’t live in the USA so this is less of a problem. It is nice not to have to worry constantly about healthcare and having to work a job just for the benefits—-as in to actually be free.')
