Initially when the internet came along we though &quot;great, now we can share ideas and knowledge with total freedom and not worry about governments or the media&quot;. Without realizing what that freedom allowed for abject the checks and balances that were traditionally applied (editorial&#x2F;peer review etc) and the sheer amount of exposure this gave to bad actors.<p>The past 5 years have shown us that as a society we have lost our common basis in fact (alternative facts, fake news etc.) and the whole thing worries me. It worries me even more that i can&#x27;t see a way out of it other than censorship. Short of a massive change in education to focus on critical thinking and evaluating received information, but that takes years and the problems we have now are destroying western democracy.')
