This rate was carried over into the definition of the compact disc.<p>The sampling rate for &quot;professional&quot; audio, 48KHz, was chosen because it&#x27;s an easy multiple of frequencies used for other common formats, e.g. 8KHz for telephones. It also happens to be fairly difficult to do a good conversion from 48KHz to 44.1KHz, which makes it harder to, say, copy an\naudio CD with a &quot;consumer&quot; DAT deck.&quot;<p>[<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stason.org&#x2F;TULARC&#x2F;pc&#x2F;cd-recordable&#x2F;2-35-Why-44-1KHz-Why-not-48KHz.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stason.org&#x2F;TULARC&#x2F;pc&#x2F;cd-recordable&#x2F;2-35-Why-44-1KHz-...</a>]')
