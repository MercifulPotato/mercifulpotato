Item(by='DyslexicAtheist', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610650677, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25779367, text='they could sneak it in now because it&#x27;ll get drowned out by all the other news, and the applause they get for &quot;cracking down on nazis&quot;.<p>but neither are good news for free speech. I&#x27;m glad twitter purges alt-right and Q accounts but then why use it as an opportunity to also silence a platform that is the biggest hit since the first time a human rights lawyer uttered &quot;Open Access&quot;.<p>pretty glad I left twitter in 2017. I still read twitter via other people&#x27;s list (those I used to follow) and via searches on nitter. If you know a great list you still have <i>doom scrolling</i>. But the good thing: when I get too angry (or even too much in agreement with the OP), there is no way to share it with the world. This is both frustrating (in the moment), but literally has no downsides. It has never been once that I woke up the next morning regretting I hadn&#x27;t already shared whatever my opinion was on literally any subject earlier.<p>The same platform shapes news today. Literally any subject there are weekly instances where a journo got their story through some &quot;influencer or thought leader&quot;. Elon Musk tweeted about Signal and the number of downloads increase within 1 day five-fold. Story is in the NYT and international news. Twitter is a surreal place that shapes way too much the news-cycle in partisan ways. Everyone complains about news being divisive but forgetting where the division comes from - there is simply no way a leftist journalist will have many followers from the right and vice versa. It&#x27;s been like this forever but twitter (and all of social media) amplified this a million fold. Blame journalism for sure but in the same sentence also damn these individuals requesting features that &quot;drive engagement&quot;. How the actual F should an algorithm drive engagement when there is no way of really telling what that engagement will cause. Twitter judged from history has never done the right thing when it could have been up to them. They always waited until enough damage had been done to justify what should be &quot;ongoing housekeeping&quot;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;signalapp&#x2F;status&#x2F;1349577579091566592" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;signalapp&#x2F;status&#x2F;1349577579091566592</a>')
