Assuming it is non-destructive, then there would be two &#x27;me&#x27;s around. The physical one that has continuity, and the computer.  \nAfter whatever brain-scanning this is, and I wake up as the physical version rather than the digital, I would likely be disappointed as the digital arrives closer to accomplishing the goal of immortality. Yet, I would also be glad that a version of me gets to live on.  \nEven if it is no longer the me on the physical side, it was still a me at the time of copying. It is giving a version of yourself chances that you may not get (immortality, whatever crazy experiences one can get when your brain is simulated, etc).')
