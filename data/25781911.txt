I know it took me a while, and I&#x27;m still bad at it.<p>I find it helps to make your points, while trying to maintain a pleasant tone (Easier said than done, and I&#x27;m not a good person to teach this). I also find it helps to add questions asking for either other peoples opinions or clarifications on their position, as that helps show that you&#x27;re not just talking, but also listening.<p>Edit: Also, the largest part for me at least is to remember that an attack on your argument is not a personal attack against you. I&#x27;ve had issues with doing this my whole life, and am still working on it.')
