If you want to learn X, you look for a teacher that is great at X <i>and teaching</i>. Teaching, writing, and other forms of communication are sort of meta-skills that you need to pair with some domain so that they have something to communicate.<p>The intersection of &quot;great at X&quot; and &quot;great at explaining&quot; is often very small. In practice, you end up having to make trade-offs like wading through poor exposition because the author is the real deal. Another common failure mode is what we see here: People that are so good at explaining, hustling, and branding, that they become popular despite likely having very little expertise at X.')
