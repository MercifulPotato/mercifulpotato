The short squeeze let them buy assets at dimes on the dollar. Assets which do not include GameStop shorts.<p>&gt; <i>which has informed partners it will not be fulfilling GME or AMC or BB trades</i><p>Former market maker. When trading got crazy we&#x27;d take profits. When it got inexplicable, we&#x27;d pull the plug. If we didn&#x27;t, risk would. In this case, there is the additional factor of political risk--you don&#x27;t want to be making millions of dollars off GameStop at its peak when that&#x27;s going to cost you tens of millions of legal fees in front of Congress.<p>A simple explanation for Robinhood&#x27;s behavior might be that their customers, the market makers, backed away from paying for this order flow.<p>All this said, I&#x27;d be highly pissed if my broker did this to me. But Robinhood customers have known since the beginning they weren&#x27;t the customer.')
