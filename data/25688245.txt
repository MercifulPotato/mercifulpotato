They can allow users to manage the encryption keys out of band. Users can use a password manager (or a piece of paper) to save the encryption key.<p>Anyone who is security&#x2F;privacy conscious to use Signal is also using a solid password manager and not reusing passwords as well as following good secure data backup practice, I hope.')
