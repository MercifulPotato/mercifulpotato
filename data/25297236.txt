The US gets a massive yearly influx of extremely smart students, many (maybe most) of whom want to remain in the US. Even if they do eventually return, they work for US research labs while they&#x27;re getting their degrees. China and India eventually get some of the students back, now with increased skills.<p>But it&#x27;s not as if China and India are in control of this process. Unless they&#x27;re going to take the drastic step of preventing young people from leaving, it&#x27;s not up to them to say how many students go to the US. They do increasingly try to get students to return, and any increase in xenophobia or restrictions on immigration in the US will make that easier.')
