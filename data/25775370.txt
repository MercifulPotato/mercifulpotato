(I permanently disconnected from Facebook two years ago, and today only occasionally check Twitter a few times a month.) There are a few things I miss out on not being on Facebook (mostly some groups that would be helpful for my actual, real-life networks); I miss absolutely nothing by being off of Twitter (and HN is like a quality filter for the tech industry Twitter crap).<p>So, indeed, even if someone could define an objective criteria for &quot;hate speech,&quot; everyone is still offended by their own consent.')
