This could naturally evolve into a multi-messaging tool like the old libpurple based ones (Pidgin etc).<p>Also, <i>please</i>, if you do a contact manager, let me store humans and businesses as separate contact types. My relationship with &quot;Ada L.&quot; is very different to my relationship with &quot;Amazon Business Customer Support Phone Number&quot;.')
