A volunteer test force is always going to be biased by the types of people willing to participate.<p>Personally, since a major Windows update or two ago I only have one settings panel I actively use that is still a Win32 dialog and not directly in the modern Settings app. That&#x27;s the Environment Variables dialog, and being a developer&#x2F;power user control panel I can see how that would be a lower priority to merge to the new Settings. Though it is still interesting to point out that the Environment Variables dialog was improved in Windows 10 over its Windows 7 counterpart.<p>It shouldn&#x27;t be surprising to anyone at this point that Microsoft is prioritizing settings updates and merging settings dialogs into the modern app in priority order based on available telemetry of what&#x27;s most commonly used. It never surprises me that most of the people still complaining that their pet settings that they care about haven&#x27;t migrated to the modern Settings apps are the same that disable telemetry and complain about it. Microsoft doesn&#x27;t know you are using that setting often if you aren&#x27;t giving them the telemetry to understand that, it&#x27;s pretty simple.')
