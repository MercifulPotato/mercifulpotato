Even if vaccines were able to confer protection from disease, they might not reduce transmission similarly.<p>&gt; Challenge studies in vaccinated primates showed reductions in pathology, symptoms, and viral load in the lower respiratory tract, but <i>failed</i> to elicit sterilising immunity in the upper airways. Sterilising immunity in the upper airways has been <i>claimed</i> for one vaccine, but peer-reviewed publication of these data are awaited.<p>Italics are mine.<p>&gt; These observations suggest that we cannot assume COVID-19 vaccines, even if shown to be effective in reducing severity of disease, will reduce virus transmission to a comparable degree. The notion that COVID-19-vaccine-induced population immunity will allow a return to pre-COVID-19 “normalcy” might be based on illusory assumptions.<p>I can&#x27;t sense any tone of favorable expectation in the link you shared.')
