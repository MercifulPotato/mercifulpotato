Getting a customer to pay 5x the gigabit price is great for margins.<p>I love fast internet and pay for 1gbps fiber but struggle to come up with scenarios where I would ever come close to saturating that connection in the next 5-10 years.  4k Netflix is 25mbps.  Estimates for 8k bitrate say it&#x27;ll be around 100mbps.  Maybe 10 years from all my household members will be hosting their hard drives in the cloud or something and 10g will offer marginal advantages but I just don&#x27;t see it right now.')
