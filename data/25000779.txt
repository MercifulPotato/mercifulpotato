The problem isn&#x27;t backwards compatibility, it&#x27;s <i>forwards</i> compatibility: v4 isn&#x27;t forwards compatible with larger address spaces, so it&#x27;s not possible to do what you&#x27;re suggesting.<p>There are various ways of making a bigger address space with backwards compatibility to v4 though -- and all of the ways which are actually possible and work are already implemented by v6.')
