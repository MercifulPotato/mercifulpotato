We&#x27;re currently trying to migrate a significant amount of stimulus code over to react.<p>Not knocking on stimulusjs, but just be wary that it does not grow well with increasing client side complexity. You&#x27;ll end up writing a lot of javascript boilerplate &#x2F; DOM manipulation code &#x2F; custom state management components. From my experience, it&#x27;s a nice lightweight tool for when you:<p>1. Just need to add some light interactivity (toggling visibility of components, any basic view filtering) that do not involve a lot of logic\n2. Don&#x27;t need j.s unit tests (stimulus has not been the most testable tool - we lean mostly on integration tests).')
