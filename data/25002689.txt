The main reason why I stayed sane was due to;<p>1. I worked on my side project <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;robotichead&#x2F;NearBeach" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;robotichead&#x2F;NearBeach</a>.\n2. I improved&#x2F;studied my knowledge<p>From working on my side project I was able to show a lot of companies the project. This actually gave a foot in the door and an eventual job. I am not saying start your own project, however if you see a project online that you want to jump in and contribute I would highly recommend. You can then use this experience for your CV&#x27;s STAR.<p>As for improving my knowledge, this is not just programming. There are many things you can improve on that can help, for example I noticed a lot of companies were using AWS or Azure. So I spent my time learning AWS - which was a second pillar for me getting my current job.<p>Those are the two main things that kept me sane during those 3 months. Good luck at getting a job - it is horrible being knocked back :(')
