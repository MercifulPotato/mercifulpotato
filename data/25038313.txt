This, as with any vaccine or medicament out there (or actual living for that matter) is a quest to hit a sweet balance:<p>- Yes, you can avoid covid and potential long effects of vaccine by living in a cave for the next 10 years.<p>- You can &quot;gamble&quot; on a 0.01% chance of getting any long-term effects from the vaccine in exchange of getting 90% safe from covid.<p>I take this &quot;gamble&quot; every year with a flu shot, because to me it sounds safer than getting flu followed by pneumonia.<p>If everybody waits for the other 99% of people to get vaccined before them, so we can a free-ride on the herd immunity, we would never reach herd immunity.<p>I don&#x27;t know of any drug that is 100% safe. Heck, even a tampon could send you to the grave. For this kind of vaccinations, we should have a margin of confidence that, being similar to other vaccines in composition but just changing the viral load, long term effects should be similar.
