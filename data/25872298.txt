Are the slides convincing?&quot;<p>...that just seems like an absolutely terrible way to decide between life and death.<p>I know that on the one hand we&#x27;re just talking about a file format, and the data has to exchange hands somehow. But it bothers me that the same tool I use to convince my bosses to, say, pay for a monthly subscription, is also being used by someone else to convince their bosses to approve killing human beings.<p>Perhaps the reason this bugs me is it breaks the illusion of expertise and sophistication. It proves, once again, that people are just people, no matter what job functions they happen to have.<p>(Also: It raises certain questions. Like: Is a person more or less likely to be killed if their powerpoint deck is ugly? Does typography impact these decisions?)')
