There are boots on the ground &amp; bombs in the air. Someone is fronting real resources. There is no possible return on these resources. In fact, the return is negative since the US is taking fairly normal Middle Easterners and presumably making enemies for life.<p>A situation has been set up that is even worse than borrowing resources to support an unproductive and unsustainable lifestyle. This is borrowing resources to ruin random strangers lives. Those resources could have been used for any inane project and literally everyone is better off.')
