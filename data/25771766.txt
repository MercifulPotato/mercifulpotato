In an erlangish approach you would mainly explicitly import and export functions from clearly specified modules.<p>If you specify a -behaviour (i know its not a perfect analogy but illustrates the point) that would not magically add extreme amounts of code paths but only force you to export the correct functions for what you try to do.')
