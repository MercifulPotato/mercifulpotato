And well behind the frontier, the government must also spend on the education of its populace so that they can actually implement the ideas revealed by the frontier, whether that means primary through education or technician type skills, which feeds into the free market pipeline to drive scale and lower costs.<p>Broad access to educational opportunity is something that  European countries do very well:  assuring that their population (AKA pool of labor) is skilled enough to implement technologies like solar and wind.')
