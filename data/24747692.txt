The artful response to my question said that Nuscale engaged with approximately 40 … pressure vessel fabricators worldwide and … determined that Nuscale will use existing factories … in lieu of building its own factory.<p>The major module subcomponents will be manufactured at multiple manufacturer locations and shipped to a single location for assembly prior to installing into the facility.” This signifies the failure of one of the major cost-saving features of the Nuscale project, which was to forestall this exact scenario.&quot;<p>The cost of that project has already escalated 70%, btw, with three towns dropping out and the output only 30% subscribed.   I think there&#x27;s a good chance it will never be built.')
