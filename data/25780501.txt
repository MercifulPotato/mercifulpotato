Farming actual food or other commodities provides value, and the better techniques allows you to provide more value.<p>I basically agree about pure land ownership though. Obviously this is one of the main leftist critiques of capitalist societies. I&#x27;m not sure if state ownership is any better on net though (in general, I&#x27;m fine with national parks or whatever), mostly for logistical reasons. There&#x27;s a lot of external factors to consider with land too. You don&#x27;t want people to do whatever and poison said land via poor management or irresponsible resource extraction.')
