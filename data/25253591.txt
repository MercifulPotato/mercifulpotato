However it has made watching high level tournament play really enjoyable. You can see in real-time the effect a players move has on the advantage. And of course when a amusing your own games you can see move by move how the advantage moved. And then comparing your comparatively very low level games to GM’s and really seeing, quantitatively how good GM’s are.<p>I’ve seen many games where advantage rarely moves at their level.
