Item(by='MattGaiser', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606493991, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25229807, text='&gt; Here, a 300-400sqft single-bedroom apartmant would be considered standard and suitable for a single or 2-person household with median income. A two-bedroom 500-600 sqft apt would be considered just fine for most families with 1 or two kids (esp. if those kids). Anything above that gets you into upper-middle class or above. Alternatively, a 4-member family with two minimum incomes could get by with 400sqft (it&#x27;d be cramped but wouldn&#x27;t be considered outrageously small).<p>As a Canadian, that seems like so little space. In university, I rented a condo with my brother and it was 900 sqft for two. I have considered what kind of property I would want for my first and 1100 sqft is probably what I would buy and my family might convince me to buy a full fledged detached (1900 sqft). Keep in mind that neither sqft figure counts any basement space. My parents have 1900 sqft and find that cramped with work from home.')
