The US space program is incredibly practical, particularly in the last 3 decades.<p>* An unbelievable amount of scientific data about biology and microgravity comes from the ISS. To say this is “aimless” only is true if you believe humans will always live on Earth and only Earth.<p>* A wealth of fundamental knowledge about the universe comes from spaced based telescopes.  These are helping us understand the laws of nature, some of the most raw R&amp;D.<p>* There are significant military applications to our space program. These range from GPS, surveillance, communications, and potentially weapons.  There are some government space launches that we know very little about their mission because it is highly classified.  The Space Shuttle had a use case for rapid troop deployment.  There is significant military applications to the engineering knowledge of rockets.  The difference between a rocket and a missile is mostly the application.<p>* Our exploration of our solar system provides possible future avenue for economic development.  There is more fresh water, raw minerals, and energy inside our solar system but outside of Earth than there is water, mineral wealth, and energy on Earth.  Certain things we consume are non-renewable, and we will need to find sources for them outside of Earth.<p>* It gives hope, inspires young people to become engineers and scientists, and gives us a feeling of awe as we go through the process of understanding our existence in the context of the cosmos.<p>EDIT: This isn’t to say there is major bloat inside the space program, and that NASA is not in need of a significant culture change.')
