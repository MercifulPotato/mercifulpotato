She&#x27;s also viciously anti-government in most ways.<p>A while ago she showed my our family tree. Half of it was suddenly wiped out by the Holodomor. And over the next ten years it was pruned away to almost nothing as most relatives where enslaved and then murdered in The Gulag (which most people also don&#x27;t know anything about). It&#x27;s not something you can really argue about with her.')
