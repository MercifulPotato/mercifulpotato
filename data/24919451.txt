Because that sort of runs counter to &#x27;everyone is invulnerable and immortal&#x27;.<p>Or about them running sentient hell-simulations for fun because they&#x27;re a sadist?  In which case, yes, that is a concern.  If you knew it was going on, you could presumably try countermeasures (up to and including threatening to run simulations that decrease the sadist&#x27;s utility function, if you know it).  Otherwise, maybe engage in trades with other  people where you refuse to cooperate with someone unless you both audit each other&#x27;s hardware?')
