Maybe I misinterpreted your point.<p>My central point was I see no reason for Apple to disallow altnernative browsers (not just shells around webkit) other than to gatekeep. Your points about safari being better or users not using a PWA for netflix don&#x27;t seem to relate to this I don&#x27;t think. I think Apple is only concerned about staying in control with regards to what users can install on their devices. I don&#x27;t think they want other browsers to be genuine alternatives to iOS safari so they&#x27;ve essentially neutered the competition.<p>I also think you flippantly dismissed that a very large portion of the world is mobile first (not just the third world anymore) and this to me makes having the choice even more important.')
