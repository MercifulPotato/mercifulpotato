The IR might come and go, and leaders or fractions might be opposed to Mosadegh for religious, ideological, etc reasons, but the hummiliation and harm that was instilled in the people by the action influenced later events (and even today).<p>&gt;<i>A war which brought a lot of power to the IR and especially the Guards.</i><p>Yeah, but that&#x27;s neither here nor there. It did a whole lot of harm to Iran the people - and to the Iraq the people for that matter, and it was fuelled from outside.')
