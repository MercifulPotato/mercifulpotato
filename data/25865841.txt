Exhibit A is this line from PEP 20:<p><pre><code>  Readability counts.\n\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m currently about a month into learning a legacy codebase that was written in a functional language. If I could single out one thoroughly egregious practice that has made this code far, far more difficult to read and understand than it should have been, it&#x27;s multi-line anonymous functions. In general, if a function is doing something complicated enough to need multiple lines of code, it&#x27;s doing something complicated enough to merit an explicit name.')
