There have been popular conspiracy theories for ages. Aliens abducted by the CIA, JFK assassination, Moon landing hoax, 9&#x2F;11 truthers, Illuminati, chemtrails, 5G, and the biggest one of all that you&#x27;ll never escape from - religions.

You probably believe in some things, even dangerous things, that are obviously wrong too without realizing it.<p>People worrying about Qanon might just be suffering from selection and recency biases. If you don&#x27;t quantify it and compare it to other conspiracy theories that you already tolerate, it might be an illusion.
