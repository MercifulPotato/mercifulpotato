You&#x27;re right that Conversations is about as good as an XMPP client can be, and it&#x27;s a joy to use... but it&#x27;s one of very few.<p>Among other things, my server has message archiving configured for MUCs, but Conversations is the only client I&#x27;ve ever been able to get to sync that history locally. That&#x27;s something I just don&#x27;t ever have to worry about with Matrix. (Not that I don&#x27;t have other complaints with Matrix.)')
