It was the same for me and I bet same for many others in this sub.<p>I always felt something was not right with me and took every opportunity to be normal, socialize, blend in.<p>In the end, I became a lawyer. The only computer skill I use for my job is Microsoft Office. The work drains my energy so I don&#x27;t have much much left for programming. Even though I try, I still can&#x27;t fully blend in, people notice something&#x27;s off with me.<p>I seriously suspect being a computer nerd is something inherent, we are drawn to computers because we are genetically coded this way.
