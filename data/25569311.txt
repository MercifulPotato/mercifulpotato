The problem is that Americans (and their cultural sphere) seem to hate the working class, I don’t know when this happened but it drips from the tongues of so many people even while they bemoan the conditions they’re forced into. You really fucked up somewhere. Working class jobs are not bad if they pay well and have benefits and time off. Any job sucks if it doesn’t. You don’t pay people based on economic value, they get paid what they can negotiate. I see a lot of negotiating happening in the future.')
