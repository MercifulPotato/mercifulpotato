On one hand, Borat has nothing to do with the real Kazakhstan. On the other hand, without the film maybe I wouldn’t have decided to go through Kazakhstan while traveling overland between Europe and Asia, and then I wouldn’t have discovered the real Kazakhstan with its authentic culture that has made me visit the country again several times since. Several other backpackers I have met in Central Asia told me the same. Borat maybe has done more good than harm.')
