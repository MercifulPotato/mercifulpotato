This comment breaks the site guidelines (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>), and I noticed that a lot of your comments are expressing indignation at something or other. This is entirely understandable, but it&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re shooting for on this site.
