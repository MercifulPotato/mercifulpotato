It&#x27;s higher among some populations (elderly as they are more likely to be home-bound, African American as darker skin inhibits UV absorption, obesity due to adipose tissue storage, etc). Those of us further North are more likely to be deficient as well due to decreased exposure during much of the year and being inside or bundled more in winter months.')
