What you&#x27;re suggesting would mean hugely increasing the amount of complexity in SSH. It makes far more sense to use SSH as the transport solution, using a separate system to handle drawing&#x2F;windows&#x2F;graphics acceleration&#x2F;user input into the GUI.<p>Not all servers support a graphical environment, and neither do all clients. This allows for lightweight servers and lightweight clients.<p>&gt; There is nothing about a CLI that says it has to only handle text.<p>The command-line itself should be a relatively simple canvas, not a complex rendering subsystem. It&#x27;s already rich enough to support TUIs, including mouse-click support. If you want more than that, use a proper GUI.')
