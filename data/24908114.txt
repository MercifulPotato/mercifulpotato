If there is no concept or idea backing up the words, it can hardly be called knowledge. Consider the case of the man who did not speak French, yet memorised a French dictionary, and subsequently went on to win a Scrabble competition. Just because he knows the words, would you say he knows the language?<p>A language model such as GPT-3 operates only on words, not concepts. It can make connections between words on the basis of statistical correlations, but has no capacity for encoding concepts, and therefore cannot &quot;know&quot; anything.')
