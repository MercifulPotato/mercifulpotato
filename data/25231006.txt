For example, from what I&#x27;ve read about SaaS business plans, the conventional approach is drawn from the experiences and data of hundreds (or thousands?) of SaaS companies. It&#x27;s not done with scientific rigor, but it&#x27;s not individual founders making hasty conclusions based on their own outcomes either.<p>Understanding the conceptual model behind a SaaS business plan, the kind of metrics that people find valuable and concrete techniques that other companies have found effective seems worth doing even if you have your own theory or approach that&#x27;s explicitly different—for the same reasons lisper mentioned for scientific knowledge, just at a smaller scale.<p>I single out SaaS not because it&#x27;s necessarily more systematic than other tech business plans—I suspect that it is, but don&#x27;t have a real basis for that—but because I&#x27;ve read more about that than other kinds of companies. I&#x27;m sure there is a lot of valuable collective knowledge for any sort of product or company you want to build and the advantages you get from learning that should outweigh any priming effect the knowledge has, as long as you are intentional in deviating from the &quot;conventional&quot; path.')
