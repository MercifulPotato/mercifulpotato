This is mass murder of millions. It is never necessary. Do what the king of France did and just abdicate and leave if you have lost power rather than engage in mass murder. Sure if there is a militia planning to attempt to overthrow you then have them arrested but don&#x27;t kill everyone with views to the left&#x2F;right.')
