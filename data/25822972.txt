Item(by='UI_at_80x24', descendants=None, kids=[25824999, 25824698], score=None, time=1610985367, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25821436, text='I am a recipient of a dual cornea transplant because of a condition called:   Fuch&#x27;s Cornea Dystrophy.<p>In 5-20 years I&#x27;ll need it again.<p>I&#x27;m not in as bad of shape as the person in TFA.  I&#x27;m damn lucky, but to be honest, I&#x27;m miserable.  I remember what it was like to have lazer-sharp vision.  Now I can&#x27;t work with electronics anymore.  My soldering iron is gathering dust.  I can&#x27;t do 30% of my job.  Hell I have to assemble PC&#x27;s by feel.  I can&#x27;t see the writing on jumper connections, and spend a lot of time taking a picture of a thing and then magnifying the image just trying to figure out what goes where.<p>It&#x27;s a shame I am not a mechanic, bolts are much bigger then jumpers.  Working by feel is a fucking bitch.')
