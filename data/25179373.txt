It is not ‘a little effort’ for me to worry about someone else might use this pointer mistakenly, so I need to think about that all the time. It shifts my focus from problem solving to preventing future undefined behavior bugs.  These bugs in the link, I don’t know C++, it is a big language which does a lot of things automatically, so it is already scary for me :) Maybe that is it, I write C server side code mostly(database) with very well defined ownership rules. Things are a bit more straightforward compared to any c++ project I believe. I just checked again, we don’t have any use-after free bugs in the bug history, probably that is because of %100 branch coverage test suite + fuzzing + sanitizers. So I rather adding another test to the suite than doing defensive programming. It is a personal choice I guess.')
