Item(by='reader_x', descendants=None, kids=[25954991], score=None, time=1611886574, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25951044, text='I agree with your conclusion that it’s more likely lack of competence.<p>I appreciate the article ending with the impossible NY website for COVID-19 vaccine registration.  The situation is the same in Maryland, except that one must register for three so as to be on a waiting list with the county health department and the private pharmacy and the local hospital (as there is no telling which might get supply first).  Not to mention the larger problem: the target group  is people age 75 and up!  No one seems to have thought that maybe an optional system of registration by phone, or through a call center representative authorized by the caller to register them on their behalf, is plausible.  Somehow, three bad websites is considered fine.  And one can’t blame this on ‘government’- the private pharmacies are as bad.<p>So is it incompetence, laziness, or sheer lack of concern whether the most vulnerable elderly get vaccinated?  Incompetence might be the most comforting interpretation.')
