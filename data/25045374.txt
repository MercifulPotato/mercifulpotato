My use case was scanning 1 or more pages into a PDF document. This was really easy to do with Apple&#x27;s &#x27;Capture&#x27; software. None of the alternatives (like VueScan) came close to the effectiveness of Capture.<p>I remember also being quite annoyed that I had to spend more money on a VueScan license, just because Brother refused to release a compatible driver for a scanner that was then still sold as new and &#x27;MacOS compatible&#x27;. This was not a cheap scanner, the least they could have done was to compensate the license cost of the piece of software that made their product usable.')
