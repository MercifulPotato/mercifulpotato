On a second viewing I said, &quot;Wait... WTF?  Why did the Empire ever bother with stormtroopers when this one droid is 10x smarter and stronger than a squad of them?&quot;<p>This revelation basically ruined the movie for me, and to some extent the universe, although that was already a garbage heap at that point.')
