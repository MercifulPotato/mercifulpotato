I don&#x27;t know about the desktops, but Macbooks from 2016 are not well supported hardware-wise in Linux - things like no WiFi even. There was a good GitHub repo tracking it for up to I think the first touchbar Pro, and basically it was dismal then and only got worse (according to repo owner who consequently stopped bothering iirc).<p>So.. depending what you want to do on these older machines, my point is that this may be the least of your worries.<p>^(though I think it&#x27;s fine, because it&#x27;s the reverse that would be a problem? Bad news for &#x27;hackintosh&#x27; if all supported versions of macOS can expect secure boot hardware, I <i>think</i>)')
