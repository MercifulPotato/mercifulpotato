The fundamental building block of the Southern economy was slavery, as your own quoted excerpts explain.  Take that away and their economy would collapse, along with the extremely comfortable plantation lifestyles of the Southern elite.  Their economy depended on slavery, not the other way around.  When slavery was threatened, they went to war to preserve it.<p>I&#x27;m from the South, we were taught in high-school that it was about economics, but later in life I realized that, for the South, slavery <i>was</i> the economy, and the root cause of the Civil War.  Southerners have to be honest about that, or they&#x27;ll never be able to fully move on.')
