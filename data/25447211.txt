The result is niche, impractical, templated, and, paper mill or no, does not advance the field in my mind. I wonder if the author learned anything new about security in the process, but that seems doubtful. What is really cool, though, is the equivalence of physical phenomena in the eyes of security. If a defender were to block certain emissions (e.g., acoustic), all that an adversary needs to build is a transducer. What is also cool to be reminded of is that computing machines are built around physical processes and that their abstractions can be thus stripped. This is hardly new knowledge, it is only new to the uninitiated.')
