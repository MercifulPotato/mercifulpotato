Item(by='hawski', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609696298, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25622895, text='I always wanted a tool to place a polygon (even just four corners) and ability to set an aspect ratio (custom or preset like 4:3, 16:9 and A-series) and have perspective fixed image or just move vertices around (just like you expect by having a textured polygon). I would like to have this tool as a part of GIMP and a standard around light image editing tools like many viewers are. Perspective correction tools are either designed for photography or I don&#x27;t really know how to use them. When you have this you can add edge detection and you&#x27;re almost done to do this automatically.')
