People won’t know which group chats to join, unless they are explicitly invited.  If you’re going to replace FB Messenger, then you have to have an established community that is the size of FB.  Or you have to have a really strong network effect that will rapidly build the size of your community to that range.<p>Things that I hate about Discord are that it forces me to have just one global account name across all servers, and one icon.  Sure, once I join a server, I can change my nickname there, but I still can’t change my icon.  But names (and nicknames) aren’t globally appropriate or useful.  Nor are icons.<p>But at least Discord servers have public forums, some of which might be announce-only, others might be discussion oriented, and then there might be private forums that are only available to certain people with a particular tag.  It doesn’t sound like your service is going to have any of this.')
