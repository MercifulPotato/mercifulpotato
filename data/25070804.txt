Oh and Silverlight. I&#x27;ve probably missed something. On yeah, WCF. And even WWF! Basically EVERYTHING web-related to C#. Plus enough work in PHP, Python, Ruby, Express, etc. to be able to compare different approaches. And even sometimes VB.net, I&#x27;ve maintained and then migrated entire code-bases from that to C#.<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure what more familiarity I need?<p>I&#x27;d also note that there are a lot of other people agreeing with my in that thread, almost all of whom show a decent technical understanding. And it&#x27;s got a lot of upvotes.<p>But, even if I &quot;misunderstood&quot; or have a &quot;lack of familiarity&quot;, that speaks of how poor the design&#x2F;documentation actually is.
