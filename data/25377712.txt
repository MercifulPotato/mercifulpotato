For example, in the driver app, a feature was added to ensure drivers are wearing face coverings. The backend for that does AI-based fraud detection to prevent shenanigans like photos of photos. The picture upload flow is just one small part of a much more complex project that had to be rushed out because the covid pandemic happened. There are a bunch of similarly large impact things that touch several of the Uber apps simultaneously, often in non trivial ways and with tight timelines (e.g. features for compliance with specific legal requirements)<p>The reason I think Linux seems like a bad comparison is that if Linux contributors don&#x27;t want to support some random driver for 3 years, that might be annoying but is generally just the way it is. Uber can&#x27;t really afford to not do some of the complicated things it does in a timely manner.')
