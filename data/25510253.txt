But people will give away all sorts of information all the time. That&#x27;s what the network is for.<p>If you want to publish a blog post on something, it&#x27;s really involved. You have to make your vendors look good, your engineering team look good, and then there&#x27;ll be this army of people on HN and Reddit who will nitpick everything so that you lose any of the good will you generate.<p>Wayyy better to just use private channels to exchange that information. So, if I&#x27;m considering data pipeline stuff I&#x27;ll just hop on Discord with my friends and ask them how it went at their company and they&#x27;ll just tell me.<p>Obviously none of us will tell the rest of the world, but we&#x27;ll tell each other. Heck, <i>strangers</i> will do that in SF and Silicon Valley in general. Most people easily understand what parts are MNPI and what is company-private IP and what isn&#x27;t.
