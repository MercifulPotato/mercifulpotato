Isn&#x27;t this a problem solved by technical certifications? I mean, if the Top 100 companies do the same tests over and over again, with a very similar mindset and process, why not delegate that to a third-party? Then you just hire people that have Certification X, which matches your lust of algorithmic puzzles or whatever.<p>I&#x27;m fine with meaningless tests that don&#x27;t prove anything, as long as I don&#x27;t have to do them for every single interview. I would gladly study for a certification, because it means I get to do it once and then I can prove everything you want me to prove in order to get a job to change button positioning.')
