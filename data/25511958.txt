A point of light moves and you get an output of ceros and ones, edges are supersharp.<p>There are lots of cheap chinese guns with the components already integrated.<p>If you have already a video camera and big microprocesor, QR are much better.Scanning barcodes with cameras is tricky, because barcodes edgess are blurry.<p>Professionals are going to use a gun anyway so it makes sense for them.')
