But I guess that in most cases where you have control over the `sendmsg()`&#x27;s calls flags, you&#x27;d also have control over its buffer, so you may be able to build the buffer in userspace in many situations, thus even saving multiple data-carrying syscalls.<p>The `setsockopt()` approach has the benefit that it works even when you have no control over the sending syscalls, e.g. when some library does it for you that you cannot modify or configure.')
