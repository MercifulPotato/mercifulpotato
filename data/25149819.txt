I think it is possible to enable them in Firefox for Android Nightly[1] by creating an &quot;add-on collection&quot;, which is kind of a pain and the first extension that I tried doesn&#x27;t appear to work correctly (Redirector) and the browser just crashed after disabling the addon.<p>Another way would be to stick with Fennec v68 from fdroid, but that is not such a great idea, but at least the extensions do work.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.mozilla.org&#x2F;addons&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;29&#x2F;expanded-extension-support-in-firefox-for-android-nightly&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.mozilla.org&#x2F;addons&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;29&#x2F;expanded-extensio...</a>')
