There is a reason why many organizations worldwide are working to forbid transporting certain species in and out of different habitats.<p>Potentially - all of them.<p>&gt;<i>And how do you know which genetic coercion methods pose a greater danger of mutating a non-invasive species into an invasive one?</i><p>Most mutations are deadly to the organism... and even among those that are not, it is possible that something similar has happened before and the eco-system has dealt with it (by rendering the mutations harmful to the ecosystems ineffective)... and the range of what is produced, even with mutations is limited. Sometimes, the mutations are dangerous and effective... but they are much rarer to the point that we can ignore it. GMOs are combination of already &quot;effective&quot; traits by design a lot of these combinations would not have occurred before.<p>If taking a species to a different island where it is not native to is bad enough, creating specific ones which have never existed anywhere ever is a major ecological disaster waiting to happen. This should not even be a discussion... but it&#x27;s a thing only because the organizations that are working to fix the problem of invasive species are not even close to powerful as those who want to push GMOs for profit... and therefore there is a lot of pro-GMO PR in the media.')
