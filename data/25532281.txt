Things are still moving a little bit, but it&#x27;s mostly cleanup at this stage, the maths are solid. The UI is also moving, as users discover &quot;weirdnesses&quot; (which most of the time are places where Pijul&#x27;s defaults differ from Git&#x27;s).<p>There are two things I&#x27;m working on at the moment, and when these are done I believe 1.0 will be super close:<p>- Future-proofing the formats. There is one major thing I&#x27;d like to address before calling it 1.0, and that&#x27;s code refactoring. It isn&#x27;t supported at the moment, and Pijul is perfectly usable without that, but I&#x27;d like to keep the possibility of implementing it in the future open. I believe the current formats allow that, but I still need to be 100% certain.<p>- Merging two giant histories takes a time linear in the size of the history on the remote repository. Of course this isn&#x27;t an operation you want to do very often, but it may become problematic for truly gigantic repositories, and I know how to fix that. This is planned to be a separate project at the moment, but it does require some support from the libpijul API.')
