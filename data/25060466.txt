Is AI sophistication the new &quot;income inequality&quot; since smaller companies that can&#x27;t wield that power get out-competed by larger players, leading to extreme concentration in the hands of few as time goes on?</i><p>Our experience as well. We built custom, turn-key, machine learning products for large enterprise for seven years now. One of our biggest frustrations is that our clients are exclusively huge companies because these projects are costly. I&#x27;ve had friends running companies ask me if we could do something for them, and I was embarrassed not to be able to help them build product because they wouldn&#x27;t be able to afford our services.<p>So what we&#x27;re doing to address that is to make our machine learning paltform[0] to reduce the time and effort it takes to build machine learning products. We feel that we can pull it off and we aim for 10x reduction in &quot;time to value&quot;. Given that our business model was that of an agency with the mythical &quot;engineer.day&quot; unit, dividing that by 10 could make it affordable.<p>Second, amortizing work that was already done into services people could use. For example, we have forecasting functionality where people could forecast time series (say for sales, capacity, etc.) with seasonality, etc.<p>Third, teams such as ours could benefit from not having to make the mistakes we&#x27;ve made over these years and start at <i>that</i> level instead. These lessons cost a lot to learn in term of time and money. All the lost productivity to find out which dataset was used to produce which model, and what parameters produced which metrics. All is embedded in there.<p>There are many other reasons and objectives to do that.<p>- [0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai</a>')
