Item(by='Jedd', descendants=None, kids=[25424253], score=None, time=1607982902, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25420455, text='We did the Paris -&gt; Barcelona night train back in 2013 - reading TFA this sounds like it was just before they stopped running them, though I recall back then that they&#x27;d only recently re-fitted out a lot of the carriages.<p>It was a 2-berth cabin, with big comfy chairs and a teeny tiny shower&#x2F;bathroom.  Boarded at around 9pm, disembarked at 9.30am.  On boarding they showed us to the cabin, then ushered us off to the dining carriage (while they converted the room to bunks).<p>The package was Â£289.00 for the two of us, but in addition to a quite fancy meal, as others note, that covered transport <i>and</i> accommodation for two people.   Part of the motivation of course was just to try something different.  But would, had we stayed in Europe, done overnight trains semi-regularly.   (The only other overnight train we&#x27;ve done was Mumbai to Bangalore - a profoundly different experience.)<p>More anecdata - the sleep quality was excellent, and I usually sleep very lightly &amp; poorly the first night somewhere new.')
