I run a (mostly) full Windows environment and I&#x27;ve had to use a monitor&#x2F;etc 2 times in the past 12 months, once after moving to a new apartment and standing things up and once after I replaced the boot drive in my NAS and moved to Server 2019 (ran the install and re-mounted disks with the PC on my desk).  I&#x27;ve actually figured out that my old, PoS, Sentio SuperBook &#x27;just works&#x27; with modern DisplayLink drivers on Linux or Windows so I have a tiny, battery powered screen&#x2F;KB&#x2F;mouse and USB port I can connect if needed.<p>I&#x27;m also not running any work or professional stuff, just Plex with array for storage, a Windows Domain (2x DCs), pihole in VM, and Ubuntu server for Unifi and stuff that works better on Linux. No websites or developer spaces though my uSFF hyperV box has free RAM if needed. Windows boxes prompt for updates once or twice a month as none of that is managed but reboots happen at 2am or so mid week and I don&#x27;t have issues other than I overlaoded a J5005 ITX and it took maybe 20 minutes to reboot due to VMs taking forever to shut down. Now those are all on the uSFF box with a 6500T and it reboots in a few minutes even with updates.')
