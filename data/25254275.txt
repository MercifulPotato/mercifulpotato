Documentaries like Gasland have gotten some deserved criticism because there is evidence of methane and natural gas coming out of water pipes&#x2F;wells way back at the turn of the century. But that doesn&#x27;t dismiss the other points of fracking fluid being incredibly toxic and how they will destroy watersheds (you can&#x27;t just pump that crap into the Earth and say &#x27;well it&#x27;s below the water table&#x27; .. how do you even know?!)<p>I do agree electric vehicles are a pretty big lie. You can&#x27;t buy yourself out of an environmental disaster. We can&#x27;t just consume more. The &quot;Green New Deal&quot; is about replacing tons of buildings and infrastructure that are perfectly fine, and will cause TONS of new waste in an effort to .. reduce waste.<p>The best thing you can do for the environment: don&#x27;t buy a new car. Just keep driving your current gas vehicle and maintain it (so long as it was made within the past 20 years with good fuel efficiency) and when you do decide to toss it for an electric: buy a used one if possible.')
