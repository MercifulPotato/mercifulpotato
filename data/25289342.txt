In that case, I just wouldn&#x27;t bother with CSS at all as you&#x27;ve got all the dynamics in your hand anyway to set styles as you please. Except pseudo-classes (even hovers), media queries, transitions&#x2F;keyframes can&#x27;t be specified in inline style attributes - just one of the many CSS blunders.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m more interested in HTML as a document format in the original sense. Limited as it is, I just can&#x27;t fathom the blackout moment where, confronted with a very basic HTML document plus a CSS stylesheet about the same size or more written in a completely different yet redundant syntax, somebody would say &quot;yup, that seems like a reasonable document format for exchanging most of the world&#x27;s text&quot;.<p>Edit: regarding your scoping requirement, isn&#x27;t just including the id or class of a component in CSS selectors or, when necessary, sass-like nested CSS rules enough of a scoping mechanism?')
