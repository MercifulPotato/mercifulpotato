Once upon a time I was in a Contract-to-hire position where the contract house (CH) was paying my salary&#x2F;etc until I was on-boarded.<p>However, this was a small shop, they had 3 people running the business and less than 2 dozen contractors under them at a time.<p>Between the Owner&#x27;s Knee surgery, and some health issues I had had years prior, the CH&#x27;s premiums were going to jump by 200$ (both on their end and the employee&#x27;s). Thankfully they were able to find another insurance provider, but it was a pretty clear cut example of how sick people in the pool can sway costs by a large amount.<p>That&#x27;s part of why a lot of US companies now will give you discounts for various wellness tasks. My BIL&#x27;s company offered an insurance credit just for taking a smoking cessation course (not even STOPPING.)')
