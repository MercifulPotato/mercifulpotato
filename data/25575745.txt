I think closing the door on ICF and doubling down on vertical integration is a mistake on Intel&#x27;s part (but likely forced because of their production issues), but the extent to which Intel should open up is a question likely only Intel employees knee deep in the R&amp;D can answer since it comes down to how integrated manufacturing is with the rest of the company.  There&#x27;s a continuum from ICF to Samsung-style conglomerate to GloFo, with different kinds of customers at each point.  Any point on that spectrum is a less risky place to be than Intel relying on Intel alone.<p>All told, I&#x27;d rather be Intel today than, say, SMIC today, and I&#x27;d much rather be the Intel of today than the AMD of 8-12 years ago.  Intel is down, but in no way out, and I find most of the commentary hyperbolic.  A full GloFo-style spin out might be inevitable, but I think Intel is sufficiently positioned to take it more slowly than AMD did.')
