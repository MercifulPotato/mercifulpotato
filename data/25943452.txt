But this is wrong, the constitution regulates the rights of an individual against the state&#x2F;government. That is, you have the freedom of speech against any government entities and cannot be prosecuted for exercising it. But if you come to my bar&#x2F;house whatever and I don&#x27;t like your opinion, I can show you the door and you can&#x27;t quote the constitution and refuse to leave because you are exercising your rights.')
