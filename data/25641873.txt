Item(by='f69281c', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609818923, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25640166, text='I&#x27;ve been institutionalized for suicidal depression a few times and aside from endorsing that video, I wanted to hijack your position in the comment hierarchy to express that a scary thing about the linked article is that a lot of people aren&#x27;t going to get any counter-information; they&#x27;re just going to get nudged into a lifestyle that they&#x27;ll probably contemplate sweet release from at some point.<p>Every once in a while I see an article from a major publication that makes me recoil. And I don&#x27;t know how to express it but the fact that someone&#x27;s gonna kill themself (long) after following the article&#x27;s advice isn&#x27;t the worst part of it at all.<p>Most people don&#x27;t actually kill themselves, they just desperately want out of a situation they can&#x27;t convey to anyone, can&#x27;t fix on their own, and makes no sense. It&#x27;s like if someone&#x27;s house got robbed and they got beaten into a hospital bed on every prime-numbered day of the month, but no one told them those rules and no one believed them when they talked about it. The day that poor bastard got fed up, burned their house down, and just started walking would be better than the thirty days before that, even excluding prime-numbered ones.<p>Anyway I&#x27;ll be holding my breath for an apology article from the new york times so I guess I&#x27;ll see you on the other side')
