Then they sued Google. Their argument is precisely that not going through the Play Store screwed them commercialy.<p>I actually agree with you on the fact that having other stores on iOS would not stop people from just sticking with the App Store. That’s true. My concern about forcing Apple to support other stores is the ‘forcing’ part.<p>People, throw around the term ‘forcing’ companies to do this and ‘forcing’ consumers to do that very liberally in situations where nobody is forced to do anything, but this is different. Apple doesn’t want to implement the APIs, security controls and services to support third party stores. Mandating that they do so would literally be forcing them to do development and testing work, and support features they don’t want to support. Presumably such a mandate would also have to specify exactly how such features must be designed and implemented in order to be compliant, so now we’d have government specified features and UIs. To me, that seems a few steps too far.')
