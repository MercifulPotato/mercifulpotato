There&#x27;s been several sites I&#x27;m paying a subscription for because I came across them in some search and found them really good. Like Ars Technica and some local sites. Besides paying for the content I like sponsoring them so they can keep doing the thing they do.<p>But usually those sites are the ones I open at least once a day to see what&#x27;s new. I don&#x27;t want to pay for every clickbait I visit.')
