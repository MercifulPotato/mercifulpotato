It&#x27;s not a signal ground but rather interconnects both devices cases through the shield. Regarding the contact wear issue, I&#x27;d much rather have my cable connector contacts wear off than the female connector contacts on the device. The cable is a less expensive replaceable part. So the mechanical and electrical design of the connector is sound.')
