Item(by='Guthur', descendants=None, kids=[25810191], score=None, time=1610856662, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25805335, text='HL to Cyberpunk 2077 is very much apples to oranges, on many levels.<p>* The team size required for a modern day AAA title is significantly higher than that of HL days.<p>* The games design choices are vastly different. HL was very on the rails, though hides it it really well by giving you the illusion of a large world, this a really great design trick and HL is rightly lauded for it. In contrast CP2077 aims to be closer to a true open world that tries to provide a linear storyline inside a large world with more open level design with many auxilary story lines and interactive world building.<p>* HL had a single platform focus (PC) for the initial development whereas CP2077 try to straddle two very different hardware generations and a multitude of platforms. If CP2077 had, in a hypothetical world, only focused on PC and maybe current gen consoles (PS5 and XBox S) it would not have nearly the same level of negative press.')
