What&#x27;s even cooler is that the iguana also only eats seaweed and algae<p>Seaweed and algae are organisms as well. Plants don&#x27;t want to be killed and eaten no more than animals do. I think Attenborough or BBC&#x27;s documentary on plants showed the lengths plants go through to avoid being eaten and communicating danger to other plants.<p>&gt; I am a firm believer that all of the war and crime you see in the world is driven by some biological wiring that most of us continental organism possess, from ants to humans.<p>It&#x27;s not just continental, it happens in the oceans as well. It&#x27;s not just animals, microbes&#x2F;bacteria&#x2F;etc also kill and eat. It&#x27;s even happening all over your body right now. It&#x27;s been happening millions of years before the dinosaurs.<p>&gt; If we had all evolved to be more like iguanas, I wonder if society would have made more (or less!) technological and societal progress, given that a lot of technological advancements come from the demands of war--<p>Probably less. The only reason galapagos iguanas exist is because they are isolated from competition and are adapted to a specific environment. Humans are more general while the galapagos iguana is specialized. It&#x27;s like the difference between a computer and a calculator.')
