Lots of jokes about &quot;it&#x27;s 5pm <i>somewhere</i>&quot; or &quot;the sun is over the yard arm&quot;, &quot;no drinking on a school night&quot;, etc. I think there are generally enough taboos around day drinking or being constantly drunk that most people are nudged away from veering into physical addiction.')
