(You can implement your own client software, and&#x2F;or your own server software too.)<p>It is why, I think IRC and NNTP are good (and have implemented NNTP on my own server).<p>I don&#x27;t use WhatsApp, Microsoft Office, Windows, macOS, Google Docs, either, and I also don&#x27;t want to use it. (Although, I have used Windows in the past, but now I don&#x27;t.)<p>I also think that really making a better web browser must be required (despite the difficulty of doing so), even if some things are not going to be implemented. Further, deprecating it should be done and using simpler formats such as plain text, NNTP, Gopher, Gemini, a small subset of HTML, etc.')
