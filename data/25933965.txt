In a short squeeze, the shorts buy stock on the open market at a high price and immediately return the stock. Some of this stock will find it&#x27;s way back onto the open market. The shorter can buy that same stock a second time at a different price and immediately return it.<p>The real key is daily volume vs. volume shorted.<p>Shares outstanding - about 70M<p>Daily volume - about 24M<p>So if shorts were the only ones buying, it would take about 3 days of normal volume to unwind their positions.<p>But with the price going up, many others are competing with the short sellers to buy shares right now. So volume will go up and&#x2F;or it will take longer to unwind.<p>Recently, the daily volume has gone up to 110M shares. A lot of those shares are being bought and sold more than once per day.<p>There&#x27;s nothing magical about 100% of outstanding shares.\nBut it&#x27;s a huge problem that the shorts outstanding are so high relative to daily volume.')
