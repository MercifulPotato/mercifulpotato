But there are a few outcomes that truly increase the company&#x27;s value. Obviously the brand&#x2F;marketing aspect -- lots of free marketing. New key board placements show that they are potentially restructuring&#x2F;refocusing and that potential strength is highlighted by the public messaging within WSB. (The messaging is obviously disproportionate and a reaction to negative valuations by the those that shorted it...but still influential.). It seems to be growing at about 1m+ per day. You have a lot of influencable eyes on content there.<p>What if GameStop gets essentially treated like a defacto co-op of sorts? What if WSB helps coordinated buys? What if it becomes the &quot;preferred retailer&quot; for purchasing&#x2F;selling consoles? (Even going so far as recommending against purchasing from other retailers). What if it gets championed as some sort of anti-corporation corporation. What if WSB helps guide whatever transition is necessary at the retailer (e-sports? some sort of wework-gaming hybrid? Sustainable? who knows). The brick-and-mortar retail space is going to be very unpredictable in a post-pandemic world.... There could be a certain pride and self-interest in helping drive gamestop&#x27;s business. A lot of the wit and intelligence gets overshadowed by outside reading of the memes. The mods over there are very smart and there&#x27;s potential for something well-organized to come out of this.<p>We might look at how WSB affects Robinhood as a business as some kind of indicator of the massive power of such an organized group.<p>The company has the potential to become as valuable as the &quot;inflated&quot; valuation.')
