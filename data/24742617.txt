As a product engineer I would like to think that making something one-of--engineering for engineers and scientists-- would allow me to focus on just getting the thing to work in one specific setting. No dealing with longevity or RMA or other similar constraints.<p>I guess it&#x27;s a fantasy about practicing &quot;pure&quot; engineering and design.<p>I call it a fantasy because I&#x27;m not convinced that that is how it would play out in the real world. I would love to hear from anyone familiar with this field.')
