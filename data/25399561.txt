I&#x27;ve been reading pg for 17 years, so I know who he is, what he&#x27;s done, where he&#x27;s coming from, his writing style... I can take his essays for what they are <i>with all that context</i>. Of <i>course</i> his opinions and perspective are what they are, because it&#x27;s literally his life&#x27;s work to identify potentially successful founders before they&#x27;re successful.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t suffer from that HN thing where nobody can simply consider an article, or do follow-up research themselves, without measurability, studies and citations, as if they&#x27;re petrified they might become epistemically infected and be wrong about something that probably doesn&#x27;t even impact their life in the slightest.')
