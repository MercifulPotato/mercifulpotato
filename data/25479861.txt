How to measure the value of a famous painting? What if the value does down? Is there a refund of wealth taxes?<p>The Netherlands has had a general wealth tax since 2001 and there have not been many practical issues AFAIK. There are separate regimes for (1) primary residence (which get yearly assessments based on comparable sales&#x2F;house price indices), (2) significant (&gt;5%) business ownership (businesses need balance sheets&#x2F;valuations anyway) and (3) all other assets taxed at around 1.2% of net asset value, first 30k exempt. There are no capital gains taxes. The value is assessed on 1 Jan every year. Whatever happens during the year is ignored.<p>For bucket (3) the vast majority are in practice held in financial assets (stocks, bonds, savings, loans)  and non-primary residence) real estate, most of these are pretty straightforward to value. There are explicit exemptions for art and science artifacts, pension investments (401k), movable property for personal use (cars, furniture) [1].<p>There&#x27;s a good degree of pragmatism is most of this. The tax authorities realize that trying to squeeze some drops of people with Picasso&#x27;s in their basements is largely a waste of time and effort. Rich people typically don&#x27;t hold a large part of their wealth in illiquid, difficult-to-appraise assets for obvious reasons.<p>[1] Here&#x27;s a list in Dutch: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.belastingdienst.nl&#x2F;wps&#x2F;wcm&#x2F;connect&#x2F;bldcontentnl&#x2F;belastingdienst&#x2F;prive&#x2F;vermogen_en_aanmerkelijk_belang&#x2F;vermogen&#x2F;wat_zijn_uw_bezittingen_en_schulden&#x2F;uw_bezittingen&#x2F;welke_bezittingen_geeft_u_niet_aan_in_box_3&#x2F;welke_bezittingen_zijn_vrijgesteld" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.belastingdienst.nl&#x2F;wps&#x2F;wcm&#x2F;connect&#x2F;bldcontentnl&#x2F;...</a>')
