We can look at entire states. 0.18% of the entire population of New Jersey has died from Covid. 0.17% of the entire population of New York has died from Covid. And does anyone think nearly the entire population of NJ or NY has been infected already? No....And, of course, incidence rates in the rest of New York state are lower than NYC. What does this mean?”</i><p>Any number of different things: it could mean that the deaths are overcounted (which seems likely in any case; we keep finding examples of “covid deaths” that are better described as “deaths with covid”). It could mean that there’s uncertainty on the IFR estimates, and it’s a bit higher than the point estimate. It could mean that New York City has a higher percentage of elderly and poor people who died at higher rates than average, which you can’t extrapolate to other populations. It could mean that the virus burned through the most vulnerable population already. It could mean that policy and medical decisions made early on in the pandemic were tragically misguided.<p>Or, it could be some combination of the above.<p>Point being, the Santa Clara study was a <i>lot closer to right than wrong</i>, and dismissing it, and the people involved, because of politics and methodological mistakes is a cheap shot.<p>When it came out, the media and “experts” were routinely claiming that this virus had a fatality rate as high as 3-5%. So I don’t particularly care if they were off by a factor of 3 (~0.5%); they were <i>much</i> closer to correct than anyone else at the time.')
