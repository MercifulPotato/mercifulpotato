Most programming languages themselves are younger than that: Python 1991, Java 1996, C# 2002, go 2012.<p>C++ and COBOL are ancient enough but niche.<p>If we look at tools&#x2F;frameworks, the story is even worse because they were obviously created later (plus some time to gain traction).<p>I think the industry will slow down and stabilize over the next 20 years. It will be fragmented in different area of expertise, but there won&#x27;t be another 10 new languages or another internet revolution.')
