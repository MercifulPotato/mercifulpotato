How many Ubuntu users have custom software sources enabled; how many of them are installing games from Humble Bundle that come as their own `deb` packages with statically linked assets? GoG installed Linux games don&#x27;t even use the package manager at all.<p>Heck, there&#x27;s a decent amount of Linux software being distributed right now as `tar.gz` files with an install script that just extracts the folder someplace and then modifies the user&#x27;s path.<p>Flatpak improves on all of that.<p>It&#x27;s one thing to look at the Linux security model and say that OSS authors should coordinate with distros, but OSS authors and general Linux developers already don&#x27;t do that today. So how is Flatpak making that situation any worse?<p>Developers were already abandoning the sane security model. Flatpak is a response to that trend, not the cause of it.')
