It&#x27;s the same situation as with starting to count from zero in most programming languages, and from the wikipedia page for &quot;0th&quot;, it appears to actually be the effect of an influence of those artificial language choices onto the mathematical concept of ordinal.  After all, it <i>is</i> in the end just a convention, and we <i>could</i> start calling the first element of a sequence &quot;the zeroth&quot; instead, but there would be no benefit for it at the language level - which is where it matters.  These artificial languages we&#x27;re creating should try to mold themselves to how we already use language, but the opposte is what&#x27;s been happening to some degree.')
