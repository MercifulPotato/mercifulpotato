The japanese warn of the three c’s: closed spaces, crowds, close contact. So like don’t go to a bar, but do go to a library where everybody has masks. Or do do go a park where everything is ventilated<p>* Lots of cases may be asymptomatic. But if you get an asymptomatic infection, who cares? People aren’t reporting their smell is a bit diminished. They’re reporting it is temporarily <i>gone</i>. It’ll be pretty bloody obvious.<p>To be frank, it sounds like you have inaccurately weighed up symptoms and transmission methods. This has led to a lot of behaviours in the physical world which reinforce your anxiety, but give you a reinforced inaccurate view of the state of the world.<p>I’ve read lots of covid papers. Have not heard of drooping face as a common sign.<p>I live in a completely locked down area with a surging virus count. And I’m pretty cautious....about a small set of activities which are highly risky. I’m not however worried in general, as the transmission vectors seem pretty known and there’s a whole swath of things I can do that are basically zero risk.<p>To give an analogy, it’s like you’re worried about a frame crushing car crash while driving in a school zone. Or fiddling with your seatbelt tightness and worried it may not be optimal for safety, when the main determinants of car safety are actually personal alertness, time of day, etc. But if you adopted a whole bunch of wrong behaviours while driving a car it would absolutely reinforce anxiety!<p>To some extent anxiety is an irrational process. But I do think it has some basis in the physical world and by really going over what risks are and what risks aren’t you can tame it and reason with it somewhat. Good luck!')
