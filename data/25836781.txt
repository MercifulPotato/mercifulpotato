Their approach was relicense to be AGPLv3 for their OSS license and allowing interested parties to pay for a commercial license. However, contributors had to license their code as both AGPLv3 and BSD if I remember correctly.<p>Does anyone using the above approach have any comments about  how well this approach is working for them?')
