Not to mention the fact that SPAs tend to be <i>significantly</i> more heavyweight in their initial download requirements than server-powered forms, taxing those poor connections before you even see a single line of text.<p>Again, the performance bar for SPAs has been set so low by top-100 sites (like Medium and other SPA blogs) that a server powered forms would have to work very hard to be worse.<p>As a side note, we can’t forget that even these “100% uptime” SPAs in the real world largely still rely on requests and responses from a server backend; still rely on prompt responses to their ‘XMLHttpRequest’ calls (hello, animated spinners!).')
