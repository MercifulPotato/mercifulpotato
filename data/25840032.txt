No company, or programmer for that fact, is immune to making mistakes. Some people like to think that if you&#x27;re a very good programmer you&#x27;ll magically write bug-free code, but that just doesn&#x27;t happen. This is why extensive testing and having multiple eyes look at something is good practice.
