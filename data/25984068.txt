If you do that at display level, you cannot move windows between displays, the application has to destroy and recreate them (out of all applications, only emacs can do that). If you want to use then per screen, how it is done today, then screens must have identical density.<p>&gt; the window managers need to implement some way to inform toplevel windows that they need to change scale (e.g. via a custom message), applications need to inform the window manager and the compositor that they support such scaling messages (e.g. via a window attribute) and compositors need to be able to scale windows that do not support this scaling (this will probably need a special window manager &lt;-&gt; compositor protocol for compositors that are independent from the window manager while still allowing the window manager to handle scaling without having to also be a compositor).<p>Defining the protocol would be the easier part; persuading application authors to support it would be the hard part. They would ignore it for years to come. And that&#x27;s for applications that are maintained or can be updated.<p>So when you have to make changes, you might as well as change the protocol and adjust for achieving multiple additional objectives - which is exactly what Wayland did.')
