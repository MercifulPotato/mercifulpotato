The term ganja, one of the oldest and most commonly used synonyms for marijuana in the English language, dates to before 1689.<p>I had hoped there would be a more direct association between the Hindi name and the underlying mathematics given Indian mathematics emerged as early as 1200 BC. Would make for a perfect reverse-psychology alibi.')
