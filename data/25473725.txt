Item(by='Irene', descendants=4, kids=[25476410, 25473959, 25474213, 25473842], score=8, time=1608337201, title="Ask HN: Did Google's AI run amok?", item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='4 years ago I uploaded an unlisted video on youtube  - video of a medical procedure, esophagogastroduodenoscopy. It did not have any views, I was keeping it just in case I need to show it to a doctor. Today I got an e-mail labeling it with adult content and warning about my channel (my other videos were of a Christmas tree and such, all unlisted). I changed video settings from unlisted to private and made it age-restricted - I understand that medicine is not for kids. I appealed since I wanted to help their AI (Remember Facebook&#x27;s AI labeling a photo of onions for &#x27;sexually suggestive&#x27; content?). I&#x27;ve just got another e-mail where they said that I lost my appeal, my videos are not safe and Youtube deleted them all. \nThey said they&#x27;ll forever label my content as age-restricted. Are we already in an Orwellian Dystopia?')
