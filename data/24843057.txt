But D was never designed as a successor to C++.<p>&quot;One of the earliest design decisions that Walter made about D was that it would be easy to use\nwith software written in C. Many widely-used libraries are implemented in C or have a C interface.\nHe wanted to provide an easy path for established software companies to adopt the D language. A\nstraightforward approach was to guarantee that users of D could immediately take advantage of\nany C library their project required without the need to reimplement it in D.&quot; from &quot;Origins of the D programming language&quot; by W.Bright, A.Alexandrescu, M.Parker.<p>D has an optional conservative mark-sweep Boehm GC which only gets triggered when you attempt to allocate something on the heap. If you don&#x27;t do that, it won&#x27;t bother you. Finally, you can explicitly disable it.<p>People generally ignore or miss the fact that D really shines when it comes CTFE, reflection and metaprogramming.')
