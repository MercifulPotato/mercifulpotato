The safety standards are pretty straightforward and they are very clearly spelled out.  And for me at least, no mass manufactured piece of furniture is even close to a minimum quality that I&#x27;d build myself.<p>On the other hand, a crib is a particularly annoying piece of furniture to build.  First, it has to be able to break down, so that is an engineering challenge if you don&#x27;t have experience with that.  Second, it is a particularly monotonous thing to build, especially if you go with spindles all the way around.  Cutting, sanding, assembling and finishing ~50-60 spindles is a lot of very boring work.  So you may have dodged a bullet on that one.')
