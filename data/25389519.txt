Item(by='wenc', descendants=None, kids=[25395673, 25389945], score=None, time=1607714200, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25387484, text='I owned a Macintosh Quadra 650 in 2001 -- bought it for C$60 from an outgoing senior -- and it was already long in the tooth when I had it (the original Quadra 650 was released in 1993).<p>It ran System 7.1. It was a beautiful machine but I couldn&#x27;t get any real work done on it -- the browser (IE for Mac) was too slow, and ClarisWorks was too simple.<p>I believe there are pivot points in computer technology. A machine just after a pivot will last a long time, while a machine just one year earlier will age badly.<p>My main desktop was a Dell Inspiron 530 Core 2 Duo from 2005-2020. The Core 2 Duo was a long lasting chip, and I could watch YouTube, browse the web on the latest Firefox, etc. with no problems at all the way up to the start of the pandemic this year (I recently upgraded to a 2014 Dell i7, which I&#x27;ll likely keep for another 10 years). If I had a Core Solo, I&#x27;d likely have dumped it.<p>I eventually sold the Quadra (and the Mac II, Mac SE, the Sun SPARCstation 1 pizzabox, and all the other vintage machines I had in my college apartment). They were fun to own for a while, but ultimately impractical to keep around.')
