Let&#x27;s say it was $10M&#x2F;year, that would still only be $250M.<p>But I doubt anyone could claim to have sacrificed a $1.5B&#x2F;year opportunity or that they were 100,000x better of a parent &#x2F; partner than someone that walks away from a divorce with $15k&#x2F;year of marriage.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unreasonable to put some type of cap on a divorce settlement based on projected earning power.')
