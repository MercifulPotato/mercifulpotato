We have this table that&#x27;s mostly ephemeral data, so rows are constantly inserted and then deleted after a certain amount of time. Due to a bug the deletion didn&#x27;t work for a while and the db grew very large. Fixed the deletion, but no amount of vacuuming actually allows us to fully reclaim that space so we don&#x27;t have to pay for it.<p>At the same time the extra cost is probably negligible compared to spending more energy fixing it..')
