Syntax and concurrency aside, passing a message is equivalent to calling a method.<p>The biggest annoyance I can foresee is discoverability. Object-orinented classes make it pretty clear what a given object&#x27;s interface is (just look at its public methods).  This is not true of actors in the languages I&#x27;ve used (not many), but in theory it should be a fairly trivial question of syntax.')
