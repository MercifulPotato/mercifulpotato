I agree: at the most fundamental level data types aren’t real; even pointers don’t exist, they’re just a convention. What I was trying to get at is that at the fundamental level everything’s a <i>value</i>; when comparing high-level and low-level memory models, the key difference is whether everything’s a value or a reference (though many high-level models still support some kind of value types). When you have value types, ownership <i>is</i> real, and reflects how the machine works. Because the real world of CPUs isn’t quite that theoretical fundamental level: there are instructions for dealing with pointers; the concept of the stack is built in; things like that. If you have a stack variable, it’s inherently owned by the one place (though whether the language freely permits mutation from multiple places is another matter). So yeah, in the end I maintain my position that ownership semantics more closely match how computers work at that low level.')
