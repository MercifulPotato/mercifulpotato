Cities were already bad for this in the first place, but I view them as the &quot;least worst&quot; option. Try leverage your existing network if you know anybody where you&#x27;re moving to, because they&#x27;re going to be in the same position. Hacker meetups, game jams, industry conferences or other hobbies work really well too -- though you might want to avoid being in the tech bubble because I&#x27;m totally stuck inside it.<p>Once you&#x27;ve got a few friends, you can leverage their social network to meet new people and explore new hobbies and stuff.<p>WFH does mean you can more easily keep in touch with college friends. Me and a few buddies have a Discord server where we co-work and we also have something similar within my company (where it&#x27;s easier to not worry about leaking secret stuff). This has been one of the few things that&#x27;s kept me sane over the last year.<p>Edit: Happy to share more if you&#x27;ve got something specific in mind.')
