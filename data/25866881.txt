I tried adding more &quot;apple-touch-icon&quot; resolutions.  Every &quot;is your favicon good?&quot; site I could find said it was fine.  It works just fine on my iPad (and every other non Apple device I have).  It works on my SO&#x27;s iPhone running the same version of iOS, and same screen size.  The iPhone shows the favicon when I go to tab-switch mode.  It shows the correct image if I create a link on my Home Screen.  It will not show the favicon on my favorites page.<p>And yeah, given how quickly the bug was closed that I opened, I&#x27;m guessing Apple decided I&#x27;m full of it too.<p>At some point, it&#x27;s not worth it any more.<p>I keep the link around on my iPhone for when I get bored and try to debug it from time to time, but really I&#x27;m mostly curious if iOS will ever decide to do the right thing.')
