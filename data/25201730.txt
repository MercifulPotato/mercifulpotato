This kind of monitoring is the purview of corporations like Amazon, Walmart, McDonald&#x27;s, and others who treat employees like machines. Defense and finance have highly skilled brain workers and they aren&#x27;t micromanaging performance metrics like this. They are tracking information access for security reasons where appropriate, and in the case of finance, tracking results insofar as it relates to risk and profit, but they&#x27;re not monitoring grunt-level input metrics the way you imply.')
