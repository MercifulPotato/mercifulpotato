Item(by='Broken_Hippo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611784777, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25930396, text='The issue isn&#x27;t so much that ONE drill or saw is so much more - though, there are specialized tools for furniture that I do not have, but I also don&#x27;t have a drill. The issue is that isn&#x27;t just me needing these things if you want furniture repaired. If you want folks to fix things at home, you need everyone to have access to them if not own them. Everyone needs space to work on things if needed. If it isn&#x27;t at the house, you need transportation. You aren&#x27;t even reducing the factory equipment on-hand because it still would need to be produced. Dining chairs, for example, tend to get abused just by use and break in ways that cannot be fixed (oops, leg broke in half and I can&#x27;t make this without woodworking tools and lots of training).<p>You are simply reducing manufacturing of one type of furniture with another (that doesn&#x27;t use the scraps in production) and very much increasing a lot of other manufacturing and increasing the space people need to have available to do these things.<p>Edit: I&#x27;ll mention that many folks are simply going to buy the cheapest tools to fix stuff: A decent drill isn&#x27;t cheap, but a cheap drill might get you by if you only use it lightly and occasionally. If people are using them more, I suspect more will be thrown away. At least the furniture is using some renewable products: Drills aren&#x27;t made of wood and pressure and glues.')
