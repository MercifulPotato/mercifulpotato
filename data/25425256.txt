Humans and other higher primates do not have this organ for sensing pheromones. However, the areas of the brain controlling essential behaviors are thought to be conserved in evolution in all vertebrates, particularly the parts of the hypothalamus that control feeding, reproduction, mating and parenting. It is therefore very likely that the neuronal populations and associated circuitry that we discovered in mice also exist in some forms in the human brain to regulate parenting behavior.')
