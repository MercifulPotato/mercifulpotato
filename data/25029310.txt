Item(by='ahachete', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604871413, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25025210, text='One of the main reasons <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;postgresql.conf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;postgresql.conf</a> exists is precisely to provide as much information as possible to <i>understand</i> how to tune PostgreSQL&#x27;s configuration. If generating a config would be as simple as filling in a form, this wouldn&#x27;t make sense.<p>It&#x27;s tempting to think it may be a good starting point. Unfortunately, it might as well be a bad starting point: form-based configurations may be totally counter-productive. For instance, max_connections is a parameter that may cause outages or very bad performance if not properly configured. And its value depends, if anything, on having or not a connection pool. work_mem heavily depends on the types of queries that you run. Plus I disagree with some of the other choices made by pgtune&#x27;s default behaviour.<p>All in all, I&#x27;d recommend to do a deeper study of the parameters, or seek some expert help, specially for production environments.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m part of the team behind postgresql.conf')
