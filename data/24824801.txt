I have a strong background (10y) in embedded development. I consider myself already t-shaped, as I worked in projects using bare metal microcontroller c to embedded linux c++17. My core focus is on Linux&#x2F;FreeRTOS C++.<p>As my opening question suggests, I&#x27;m currently not earning a six figure salary (annual). But as cost of living rises, I ask myself, how do I achieve this?<p>Is the only way to start a company? Or what are alternatives? Any besides Moving to SV?<p>Please any advice is welcome.<p>Thanks.')
