Even if you had created a huge world with a lot of different “stuff” in it, the textures wouldn’t have been a capacity problem either... because the N64 just didn’t have the memory to hold or render very large&#x2F;detailed textures. In its architecture, it was detailed [for the time] <i>meshes</i> that were cheap to load&#x2F;render, not detailed textures. That, combined with hardware support for Gouraud shading and a few other algorithmic effects, made “basic blocks of color with a few flourishes, over a well-made mesh” the only practical approach to 3D modelling for the N64. Which meant that a world with many unique 3D models could actually be quite cheap to store in ROM, as &quot;basic block of color&quot; textures were inherently reusable, and meshes themselves compress very well.)<p>Of course, this would never have worked for e.g. FF7, with its huge pre-rendered flat background scene textures; but imagine the FF7 we <i>could</i> have had on the N64. (The one that would look like the FF6 N64 demo, crossed with... Perfect Dark, maybe?)')
