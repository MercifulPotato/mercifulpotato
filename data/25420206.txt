Item(by='anti_discrim', descendants=0, kids=None, score=2, time=1607966563, title='On algorithmic discrimination during hiring', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='While in the interviewing process I&#x27;ve seen this worrying trend of having my personality judged by facial recognition in applicant management software and never interacting with real people.<p>Here&#x27;s a case in point for the level of personal destruction that can happen. I knew someone whose face became paralyzed from work-related stress. They can&#x27;t smile well. They will be scored negatively by facial recognition algorithms. For that matter, if anyone has been working a lot it&#x27;s hard to put on a performance (&quot;beauty contest&quot;), but why should we be judged negatively for something so arbitrary as smiling or how our eye muscles behave after a long day or work-related stress? This is messing with people&#x27;s livelihoods.')
