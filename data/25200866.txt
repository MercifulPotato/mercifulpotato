The book is available here:<p>Paperback from O&#x27;Reilly (use code DSWN20 for 20% off):\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;shop.aer.io&#x2F;oreilly&#x2F;p&#x2F;distributed-systems-with&#x2F;9781492077299-9149<p>Paperback from Amazon:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Distributed-Systems-Node-js-Building-Enterprise-Ready&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1492077291<p>Kindle from Amazon:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Distributed-Systems-Node-js-Building-Enterprise-Ready-ebook&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B08MTJ4H6L<p>My intent with this book is to prove that Node.js is just as capable as traditional enterprise platforms (like Java or .NET) for building services that are observable, scalable, and resilient. It&#x27;s very hands-on and readers will write application code and integrate it with tooling from various layers of a modern service stack.<p>For example, readers will encapsulate two applications using Docker, run a private container registry to host images, deploy to Kubernetes, configure health checks, scale the instance count, and allow the apps to communicate with each other. Readers will send logs to Elasticsearch, build a dashboard with Kibana, send metrics to StatsD&#x2F;Graphite, build another dashboard with Graphite, transmit request spans and visualize request hierarchies with Zipkin. They&#x27;ll even configure a CI pipeline, run unit tests, enforce code coverage, and deploy to a production server. And that isn&#x27;t even half of it!<p>I wrote this book as a Node.js developer who loves writing code that runs on the server but who doesn&#x27;t have much interest in frontend development. Node.js developers often get stereotyped into being frontend developers and I hope that this book can help bring an end to that.<p>Let me know if you have any questions!')
