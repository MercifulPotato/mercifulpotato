But not everyone needs all of them. I don&#x27;t see a problem with combining tools, which is really easy with Vim as it already runs in the terminal.<p>I installed a couple plugins in Vim. But those all provide\nfeatures I actually use and they barely affect performance. But\nmore importantly I just prefer the Vim approach: start out with a\nminimal UI and feature set and only add or tweak what is needed.\nNo weird and distracting auto-formatting while I&#x27;m still typing, more intuitive\ntabs&#x2F;buffers and nothing running in the background all the time.\nI might be an outlier because most editors and IDEs have\nstandard configs that I find distracting and frustrating, but I rather put a motor and bags on my bicycle than start\ncutting down a truck.')
