Their point was that the &quot;post-truth&quot; framing implies that there was some golden age of rationality where we cared about truth and now we don&#x27;t; but humans aren&#x27;t exactly rational on their best days, so in some sense we&#x27;ve always been &quot;post-truth&quot;.<p>No one is asking that you think that &quot;alternative facts&quot; are true; OP is just saying that there wasn&#x27;t significantly more truth in the media&#x2F;discussions in the commons 30 years ago (or whenever the fabled golden age of truth was supposed to have occurred).')
