A lot of places run in government institutions with lifers still work on paper. PAPER!<p>I interviewed at a government job in my area a several years ago before I got into tech and the guy I was talking to told me when he took over, he spent his first few months just converting everything to digital formats. All because the guy in it previously didn&#x27;t want to learn how to use a computer. Since the position was an agency arm of something in the penal system, there was no oversight besides the people that essentially paid him to make certain reports for higher ups to then make available to the public.')
