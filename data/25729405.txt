Taking the time to try and explain why location data being uploaded may be dangerous would similarly be met with yawns.<p>If I cannot get my non-tech friends and family to realize using the same 7-character password across multiple sites is a bad idea, nor can I stop them from answering Nigerian Prince emails; I&#x27;m not sure how to make them realize that EXIF data can be used maliciously.
