The whole coheres as a result of a confluence of interests and interactions, most of which are so minuscule they have no substantial individual impact on the whole and merely serve as reinforcement of the general pattern, growth. Some cells are more powerful than others, nerve cells have some ability to direct the organism as a group, as do billionaires in this economic organism, but in both cases are bound by the system and ultimately have the same interests as the organism itself.<p>The important note here is that these sub-units of the organism are not people in general. They are capital and its controllers. It is their individual interests which trend towards their own growth that result in the organism itself seeking growth as a whole.')
