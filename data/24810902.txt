Say you had been cranking out CRUD apps in Java and had a reputation for it and decided that you wanted to do machine learning all of a sudden. I think you would struggle to do that even in large companies. The best you could realistically hope for would be a promotion within your current silo. Unless you went somewhere you could start afresh.')
