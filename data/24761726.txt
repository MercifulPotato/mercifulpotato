Item(by='Supermancho', descendants=None, kids=[24761930, 24761812], score=None, time=1602557021, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24761595, text='Tracking exactly what individual db entries ran and didn&#x27;t run when there&#x27;s one of these &quot;serverless&quot; &quot;painless&quot; interruptions to an ETL, ensures that you have an endless number of ever-changing status columns and re-run processes.<p>Are you really sure that it all re-ran? No. You have to query your latest batch - which means you have to have arbitrary boundaries for when failures might have occurred like say, last 24 hours. If was a weekend, just query the whole database looking for any entry that&#x27;s missing the &quot;final&quot; status success. Try not to run anything while you&#x27;re doing this, unless your system is tolerant to the DB being locked for a full-table scan.<p>This is all very fragile and change-averse. Who would choose to run an ETL like this? I have worked for large companies who all end up with this rickety system. Every one, every time. God forbid you want to run tests with a mock set of serverless AWS services.')
