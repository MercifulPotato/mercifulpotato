Item(by='smsm42', descendants=None, kids=[25260746], score=None, time=1606778340, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25252860, text='&gt; fire bullets in public<p>You can fire bullets, provided you can guarantee you wouldn&#x27;t hit anyone or destroy any property. Usually this is achieved by either doing it on a range or in an open space far from other people and their property. Same for driving - if you&#x27;re driving in a desert where you can&#x27;t hit anyone, you can drive as fast as you&#x27;d like. If you&#x27;re on a road surrounded by other people who you could maim or kill, and&#x2F;or destroy their property - that&#x27;s another business. It&#x27;s not because I feel &quot;offended&quot; by you driving too fast - it&#x27;s because you literally could kill me if you drive too fast. I haven&#x27;t heard of anybody killed by a facebook post that expressed opinion they didn&#x27;t agree with. That&#x27;s why this is not your right to not see such opinions.<p>&gt; but it would be improved if my ideological opponents could make arguments with substance.<p>Maybe it would, but nobody owes you to improve your existence. The system where certain people were forced to improve other people&#x27;s existence, whether they liked it or not, existed once in the US. It was called &quot;slavery&quot;. After a while, people wised up and realized this system sucks. At least most of the people did. Since then, you owe everybody not to make their existence worse by violating their rights, but they do not owe you to make your existence better - not until you convince them to do it by offering them something in exchange, like money or hugs or whatever you agree upon. It sucks, I know, but better than the alternative.')
