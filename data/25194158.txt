I&#x27;ve been using mine as a webcam for a couple months now (among other side-projects).  You need a different lens though.<p>The 6mm fisheye lens is crappy and the distortion is terrible.  The 16mm lens is higher quality but the zoom makes it difficult to use as a webcam.<p>I bought the 6mm M12 portrait lens from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commonlands.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;portrait-6mm-m12-lens" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commonlands.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;portrait-6mm-m12-lens</a> which works much better.  Being M12 it&#x27;s not the best form factor, but it has a rectilinear picture and the framing is what you want for a webcam.')
