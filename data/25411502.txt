Item(by='arendtio', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607901753, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25410390, text='&gt; Unfortunately, Vimâ€™s default configurations lack several important usability features compared to popular alternative text editors, such as VSCode.<p>I find it odd, to compare Vim with VSCode and pretend that those 5 lines close the gap (especially when 3 of those lines are primarily about search). My own .vimrc has 166 lines (custom snippets, key bindings, plugin configurations (e.g. powerline, tmux navigator) and comments) and I try not to use more plugins than necessary.<p>I say that as someone who loves Vim. But not just for its features, but also for those that are not present (by default) and make it as fast as it is.')
