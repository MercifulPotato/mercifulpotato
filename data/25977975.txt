They are not accumulating wealth at my expense - they are creating wealth. As a byproduct of the wealth they produce, I have nice things like computers and the internet and can work at home and watch an incredible smorgasbord of stuff on TV and push a button and whatever I want gets dropped on my doorstep the next day. I can take MIT courses for free on youtube. Oh, and I get to talk with people all over the world on HN, for free.<p>Most of the boom is coming from the tech sector, as tech is revolutionizing productivity in all sorts of endeavors. They didn&#x27;t steal the money from you or I.<p>I can even buy shares in those tech companies for $0 commission and get a cut of the wealth they create.<p>We&#x27;re living in a golden age in the US. Even poor people have a computer in their pocket with instant access to the world&#x27;s information. How cool is that?')
