The only reason we know is that it is noticeable how much faster it is in manual testing.  Took him a few minutes to remove the function and run the tests. &quot;Cut API load time by 50% with optimization of Hibernate queries&quot; is true, but also ridiculous.<p>On my own resume, I have played with the words to arrive at the largest number possible for the scale of what I did. As we didn&#x27;t numerically measure anything, so it was massaging of a number into a number that was large. Recruiters seem to react well to it, but it is absurd that they do.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree that this works. I use it on my own resume.  I don&#x27;t think that is the problem HN has. It is just expressing annoyance that we have to play another stupid game to get hired.')
