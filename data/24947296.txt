Item(by='geofft', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604095314, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24946357, text='Fair enough - I think that in this fictional world where the CoC frowns on hurting others&#x27; feelings, you&#x27;d have a valid complaint, and I think that such a CoC would quickly break apart a community (especially an open community, where anyone can show up and then proclaim their feelings have been hurt).<p>I think the NumFOCUS CoC doesn&#x27;t say that though (although it&#x27;s ambiguous because it includes &quot;Be kind&quot; in the normative text, and I&#x27;d agree that&#x27;s a problem), and other CoCs are more interested in the objective (or, at least, <i>more</i> objective) question of whether a personal attack actually happened than the question of whether a participant felt attacked. The Contributor Covenant, for instance, prohibits &quot;Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks,&quot; to which &#x27;I&#x27;m sorry you felt insulted, but this was not an insult&#x27; would be an adequate defense.<p>It does appear that the relevant sections of the NumFOCUS CoC aren&#x27;t unique to them, though I can&#x27;t tell exactly where they came from, and you have convinced me that this is a problem.  (Geez, this is license proliferation all over again.) Thank you!')
