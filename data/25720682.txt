Proving your smartness _by_ making things people can work with, because they are simple. Creating a C++ template madness is not that smart in the end.<p>Really smart people invest time into making their code very readable and at the same time manage to give it the required layers of abstraction and flexibility in a way that does not confuse the reader. They make their code in a way, that enables them or others to write tests for it. They think about the concepts needed in the project. Find a good trade-off between simplicity and flexibility and if you are a true master of finding good abstractions, manage to choose a simple abstraction to get simplicity and flexibility at the same time. At least that is being smart to me.')
