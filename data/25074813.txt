Don&#x27;t ever say anything against the grain on Twitter (or really any medium that encourages media to go viral). But at least HN is (usually) a good, moderated forum where opposing viewpoints can be heard with judgement for the argument and not the arguer.<p>A difference the US has with the situation in the article is the Thai hotel was able to get law enforcement involved -- I don&#x27;t think the US has crossed that line yet.<p>Also you could view this TripAdvisor warning as a chilling effect against other establishments that might try to use the law to silence critics.
