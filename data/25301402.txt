Item(by='kwhitefoot', descendants=None, kids=[25301445], score=None, time=1607083659, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25300928, text='Those charts do not show any information regarding the effectiveness or otherwise of mask wearing.<p>There is no information about what proportion of the populations actually wore masks, how close people actually got to each other, what the population density and degree of urbanization is, etc.<p>In Norway we mostly have not had strict lockdowns and have not had compulsory mask wearing until very recently and our infection rates and death rates are lower than most other countries as shown on the charts.  But you need to be careful how you interpret that; Norway has a relatively low population density and a large proportion of jobs are of a type that can be done at home.  So pretty much everyone who could work from home immediately did so (a lot did anyway).  We also have a strong tradition of solidarity; unlike the UK &#x27;We&#x27;re all in this together!&#x27; is not just a slogan.<p>Our government has also been largely consistent in the advice that it has issued and, with a couple of exceptions, avoided overreacting which means that people are willing to adhere to the rules even though most are just advice and not enforceable.<p>Most charts from all sources, and especially things like the Federalist, should be taken with a shovel of salt; not because of what they include but because of all the information that is omitted.')
