However, the function that wiped the database was written whilst sober.<p>It was _written_ then, but you&#x27;re still admitting to the world that your employees do work on production systems after they&#x27;ve been drinking. Since they were working so late, one might think this was emergency work, but it says &quot;doing some late evening coding&quot;. I think this really highlights the need to separate work time from leisure time.')
