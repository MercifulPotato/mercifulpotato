In part, I think this is because they are scared of the effect that false positives will have on (already precarious) staffing numbers (just like the police -- which, owing to austerity, are horrendously under-manned).<p>That being said, <i>I haven&#x27;t installed the app</i>. I know I &quot;should&quot;, but I just <i>do not</i> trust it. I&#x27;ve completely and <i>utterly</i> lost all faith in the government, and although I have the .apk executable sitting in my downloads folder just <i>waiting</i> for me to disassemble it and read through it myself, I haven&#x27;t yet.<p>It&#x27;s almost as if <i>decades</i> of sophisticated spying and &quot;dark practices&quot; have conditioned the entirety of the UK to not trust their government, or something. I use a VPN (or three) at home, tor where appropriate, and root my phone and cut out the Google dial-home. It&#x27;s a very big ask to get me to install a government-developed application. I just have a deep, probably irrational, <i>fear</i> of it watching everything I do.')
