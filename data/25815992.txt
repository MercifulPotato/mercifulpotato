The fact that messages sent in private are now made public is itself quite concerning.<p>&gt; “Others have already said so, but I just want to say it<p>&gt; explicitly myself - I think that nazis were present at<p>&gt; some protests on Jan 6, and that it’s very scary to see<p>&gt; those ideas on display,” wrote one engineer in Slack.<p>I am yet to see evidence of Nazis being at the protests - I don&#x27;t think anybody openly displaying support for Nazi ideals would find wide support in a pro-America crowd.<p>Assuming there were some in the crowd, I am slightly concerned that what was actually meant was &quot;all of those people were Nazis&quot;, in which case this is dangerous rhetoric.<p>&gt; “100% Nazis were there, and 1000000000% Nazis are scary as<p>&gt; fuck and do not belong anywhere. PARTICULARLY AT GitHub!”<p>&gt; responded another.<p>This idea that any group &quot;do not belong anywhere&quot; is quite scary. Once you have gained the title of &#x27;Nazi&#x27; (which seems to be a more abused label in modern times), then there seems to be this idea that you have no place in society - and that you can have all services removed from you.<p>Even if you are a literal Nazi (or Communist, or &lt;insert bad ideology&gt;), as long as you abide by the laws of the land, you can be a functioning member of society, and as such need the same basic protections. These people should be allowed to open bank accounts, buy groceries, go to work, pay taxes, drink at a bar, etc. We can&#x27;t de-humanize people because we disagree with the way they think.<p>&gt; “Hubbers are free to express concerns about neo-Nazis,<p>&gt; antisemitism, white supremacy or any other form of<p>&gt; discrimination or harassment,” he wrote. “And of course,<p>&gt; we expect Hubbers to be respectful, professional, and to<p>&gt; follow GitHub policies on discrimination and harassment at<p>&gt; all times.”<p>I miss the days when it was taboo to mention politics or religion in companies. I used to work with a &quot;Nazi&quot; and a &quot;Communist&quot; (as well as a whole range of political leanings), and we worked together fine. I&#x27;ve also worked with alcoholics and drug addicts. Generally we all agreed that if we want to do these things, we do it off company time.')
