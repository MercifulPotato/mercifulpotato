You can sometimes use it for music But if there’s any changes based on game events mp3 is unusable. A lot of work has been put into optimizing mp3 including at os and hardware levels but that’s not usable in games. Commonly it’s some custom spin on vorbis which is<p>Additionally, there can easily be 20-40 sounds playing at once, more if you haven’t optimized yet (which typically happens in the last few months before release). These also need to be preloaded slightly, and once playing stream from disk, so source starvation needs to be handled and the codec needs to not be glitchy if missing some packets.<p>It’s also happening in a system that needs to be real-time and keep each frame timer on the order of milliseconds, though Moore’s law moving to parallelization has helped a lot. You’d be surprised how under powered the consoles are in this regard (caveat: I haven’t developed on the upcoming gen, which is getting better)<p>As for loading and caching on demand, that’s limited by memory, given the sheer amount of samples used in games, it’s just not practical. For specific example in a very well known game, there are over 1600 samples for boxes hitting stuff (impact sounds). What I’m building right now is meant to make generative audio easier and reduce the number of samples needed, so more tools to process sound could make this naive caching approach practical')
