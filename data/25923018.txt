Though they may pitch themselves at a certian audience, social media platforms don&#x27;t ultimately get to choose their users, and I&#x27;m not sure to what extent it is fair to judge them by their users. If we do judge them by their users (and I don&#x27;t mean to sound like I&#x27;m criticizing Gab&#x2F;Parler users here, it&#x27;s entirely hypothetical) then you can have perverse outcomes, eg one way to shut down a social media site would be to have bots purporting to be, say, militia members spam it with messages. I&#x27;ve not done a great deal of research, but prima facie it seems like Parler actually had some quite attractive inherent characteristics, eg they were good on privacy and didn&#x27;t monetize your data. On the other hand, to say that something like 4chan is inherently neutral and that the demographic of their users is nothing to do with them feels like it&#x27;s taking the arguemnt too far.')
