Each has its place: typing is faster for long slabs of linear text; writing is way faster for diagrams and when the physical location of each phrase matters.<p>&gt; when I type I cannot draw anything and that&#x27;s great because usually I can&#x27;t decipher drawings I made while writing with pen and paper.<p>So try to do it more! I was a management consultant 20 years ago. I still solve problems by grabbing a piece of paper, turning it landscape, and sketching the problem&#x27;s components and their interrelationships.<p>Heck, one of the reasons I joined BCG in Australia back in 1996 was their interview used 0.9mm mechanical pencils and high quality sketching pads. The pencil I used back then is beside my computer right now.')
