A few large chunks of its functionality currently don’t have any good definition written down, but instead are defined by the rustc implementation: most significantly, the ownership and borrow checking system. Research towards formalising this model in a way that a specification could use is ongoing (e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;people.mpi-sws.org&#x2F;~jung&#x2F;thesis.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;people.mpi-sws.org&#x2F;~jung&#x2F;thesis.html</a>, published a couple of months back), but until then any specification document would be unreasonably complicated and verbose, containing large chunks of the current compiler rather than describing an independently-useful model.<p>But more generally, I think you’re approaching this from the wrong angle, perceiving a problem that doesn’t exist—Rust is already not tied to a single corporate interest. But have patience, there are rustlings of independent implementations in a few places, and their fullness will come in a few years’ time.')
