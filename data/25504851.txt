Not long ago, I wanted to see how they defined it and tried to look it up. Searching led me to “fake news” and I learned that they call “fake news” “false news” and that if you search across Facebook.com and fb.com for “false news is” you get about 6,000 results, none of which are a definition of false news. If anyone has found a definition of these terms somewhere on Facebook please link!')
