Look at the statistical breakdown of intelligence. Half of the world is 100 IQ and below. Half. Hell, 16% of all people are 85 IQ and below. That&#x27;s over a billion people worldwide.<p>Any technology that you want to see enormous widespread adoption of, has to be usable by some of those people.<p>And believe me, no business-minded person wants to throw a billion potential customers to the wayside. They want to simplify the technology to capture those dollars.<p>Sorry if this offends sensibilities of anyone, but I guarantee you if you could get inside the heads of a lot of these billionaires and multi-millionaires, you&#x27;d hear the same shit I&#x27;m telling you right here. The reason I know this is because my Uncle is one of those people. Smart. Ruthless. And has absolutely no qualms about exploiting people of lower intelligence.<p>Don&#x27;t think for a minute that the SV crowd is any different.')
