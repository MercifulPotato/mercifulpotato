I moved from the South to the West Coast and I&#x27;ve observed the behavior you described as well as people who exhibit a total breakdown of rationale as soon as they hear the word military. I&#x27;d say both perspectives are worthless.<p>&gt; Decreasing military spending in US politics basically gets you labeled as a traitor and despite people voting for anti-war candidates, they don&#x27;t vote for &#x27;reduce military spending candidates&#x27;.<p>and<p>&gt; Saying anything against the military is often interpreted as a direct attack on veterans and soldiers. Giving out metal before ever sports match is not exactly normal in most of the Western world.<p>Not quite. I served from 2009-2013 which means I got to witness &quot;The Tea Party&quot; and it&#x27;s affect on the military by cutting DOD funding. [1] These efforts garnered some good support of Democrats as well, it was an unholy alliance of sorts. [2] Did they cut a couple planes, tanks, trucks, and programs? Maybe, but they also closed the Single Marine Program and our commissary on base. I was going to the range less and sitting in the field more. You likely didn&#x27;t hear about this stuff in the news because the nature of a base is a bubble. I think taking a good <i>honest</i> looks at spending and decision making are worthwhile endeavors that should be reviewed constantly but the outcomes cannot be like when I served and all too often they are.<p>Spending decisions also play personally into the lives of troops, so I think it affects how they view someone who wants to take that money away. If you go down to Camp Lejeune to some random barracks room and ask to see their gear you might find some units with new gear but for the most part it&#x27;s heavily worn, heavily used, heavily abused equipment that we <i>try</i> to replace before deployment. My plate carrier had some nasty fraying on my deployment that made it difficult to attach MOLLE gear but others have had to deal with. [4]<p>Even policy decisions play important factors in how veterans end up viewing people, motives, and parties. The notable rules of engagement change during Obama&#x27;s presidency remains in a lot of peoples minds and was sparsely covered by news outlets who preferred putting lists of the dead on TV [3].<p>I think Republicans often are in a position where they&#x27;re trying to do something beneficial for military members or veterans but it&#x27;s often for show. If you want a good example of what &quot;for show&quot; looks like with veterans then simply examine how Veteran&#x27;s Choice has evolved over the times. The problem was clear and yet it took us three different presidents to get it where it needed to be. What&#x27;s too much is when they begin to use us as a political pawn and create some adoration culture out of it. I was personally shocked when I saw a veteran returning home used in a speech more than once and I think this sends a really terrible message to the American people. We can&#x27;t descend into the 70&#x27;s when liberals thought it okay to spit on military members but we can&#x27;t be walking around thinking they&#x27;re gods either. The latter I don&#x27;t think is really happening outside of small circles but it&#x27;s good to watch out for.<p>Democrats often don&#x27;t realize their policy and fiscal positions with the military have impacts on troops which are seen and remembered when those troops are veterans. Having some empathy and understanding for these scenarios could totally be aided by teaching military history but I also think it necessitates some change in the anti-war constituent rhetoric. Learning to talk about and criticizing a war without insulting the people who fought in it or had their lives changed by it is a tricky business, but it&#x27;s one you subscribe to when you get into the business of critiquing war. This rhetoric probably deserves it&#x27;s own thread but it&#x27;s one that I think can&#x27;t be had online.<p>All the same, as a veteran and someone who falls on both sides of this debate, I understand your frustration.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;commentisfree&#x2F;cifamerica&#x2F;2011&#x2F;feb&#x2F;12&#x2F;us-military-tea-party-movement" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;commentisfree&#x2F;cifamerica&#x2F;2011&#x2F;fe...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pri.org&#x2F;stories&#x2F;2011-08-05&#x2F;trimming-defense-budget-tea-party-style" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pri.org&#x2F;stories&#x2F;2011-08-05&#x2F;trimming-defense-budg...</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtontimes.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2013&#x2F;nov&#x2F;26&#x2F;rules-of-engagement-bind-us-troops-actions-in-afgh&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtontimes.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2013&#x2F;nov&#x2F;26&#x2F;rules-of-en...</a>\n[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;asia_pacific&#x2F;in-afghanistan-army-struggles-to-wage-war-with-damaged-equipment-poor-logistics&#x2F;2013&#x2F;10&#x2F;17&#x2F;96118b40-34e6-11e3-89db-8002ba99b894_story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;asia_pacific&#x2F;in-afghani...</a>')
