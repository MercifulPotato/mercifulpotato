Sometimes you can still get &#x27;one timestamp&#x27; by making something else the owner of the timestamp.  It also depends on your resolution of time and the process that does the ingesting.  For example if that ingest process has more than one thread to handle things you can still get out of order&#x2F;sametimestamp if not coded correctly.')
