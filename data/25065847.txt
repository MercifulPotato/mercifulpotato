The actual performance efficiency between those processes isn&#x27;t that drastic. The power efficiency of the M1 would come from better IPC such that it just doesn&#x27;t have to clock as high to be competitive.<p>That&#x27;s why A14 only runs at 1.8ghz base, 3ghz boost. That&#x27;s how it has low power consumption. And similarly Intel pushing 5ghz is why it has high power consumption.<p>TSMC&#x27;s 5nm will have a raw transistor performance&#x2F;watt advantage, but it&#x27;s not <i>huge</i>')
