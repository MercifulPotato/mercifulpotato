He want to continue to work on Bitcoin an Bitcoin Core.<p>Most recently, this became relevant as the bitcoincore.org website he (co-)maintains received a legal letter from a (fraudulent; as in unproven and repeatedly lying) entity claiming copyright of the 2008 Bitcoin whitepaper. He complied[0] by taking the PDF down from bitcoincore.org and received a lot of slack for it by parts of the community. He then made clear that he&#x27;ll happily continue to work on Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin in general, but will not be a &quot;martyr&quot;[1] for the project: &quot;it&#x27;s up to you as bitcoiners to protect it&quot;.
