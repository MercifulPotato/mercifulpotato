I usually don&#x27;t see this as possible, since I have a bunch of arrays which are allocated once, then a bunch of nested but static control flow.  The only way I&#x27;ve found to go beyond single thread performance is with &quot;whole program&quot; SIMD which only worked in the ISPC&#x2F;OpenCL&#x2F;CUDA programming models.')
