Which is, almost never.<p>HP, Dell&#x2F;Alienware, Lenovo, all of them have had overheating CPUs for over a decade. GPUs are fine half the time, surprisingly.<p>Their testing is garbage, what they call normal use seems to be completely different from what power users call normal use. And I&#x27;m talking about &quot;workstations&quot;, not cheap consumer laptops.<p>Oh, but the design constraints, you&#x27;ll say. OK, that&#x27;s forgivable for Ultrabooks&#x2F;thin-and-light laptops. Not workstations. And before the thinness fad, they were still overheating. And not because of design constraints.<p>As an example, I&#x27;ll bring the Elitebook 8760&#x2F;8770w&#x2F;ZBook 17 G1&#x2F;Zbook 17 G2 series, all of which have the same internal design and layout.<p>All were overheating after a while, due to thermal paste going bad (and being shit from the factory, but I digress).<p>With the ZBook G2 it got very, very bad. Those Haswell chips with FIVR were mini nuclear reactors. HP realized they weren&#x27;t &quot;just overheating&quot;, but &quot;extremely overheating&quot;.<p>Their solution? The same heatsink with an extra heatpipe. Just like that, poof, problem solved. One extra heatpipe!<p>That can&#x27;t cost more than $2 in the factory. I don&#x27;t know any buyer who wouldn&#x27;t have paid an extra $5-10 to have a proper working $4000 workstation.<p>Whoever is saving money on copper and screws in these companies needs to be fired and banned from ever working in companies making hardware.<p>I&#x27;m not even going to talk about Apple, everyone knows their stuff has a ton of problems. But they&#x27;re selling people on design and software, not quality engineering.<p>And they actually solved the heat problems by going in the opposite direction with the M1 (ultra low power usage while maintaining performance instead of a good cooling system).')
