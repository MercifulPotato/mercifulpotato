As long as there is no upper management commitment to the values of &quot;proper written tests and benefits&quot; or &quot;correct GIT usage&quot; or something else, there will be no change but &quot;Burn Outs&quot; (the one&#x27;s that try too hard to do 100%).<p>Your &quot;Head of IT&quot; is most probably &quot;forced&quot; into dropping those values in favour of a &quot;up &amp; running&quot; product.<p>In my personal case (as Head of IT), I got a commitment to security from the upper management. This allowed me to drastically reduce access to resources like DB and SSH access and &quot;force&quot; people to document their needs which helps understanding where &quot;South&quot; actually is. While enforcing rules, many double&#x2F;tripple&#x2F;quadruple works where detected and migrated and also some new &quot;Specialist&quot; where found that were very good at their specifically assigned work.<p>As a programmer, you and your team need to understand the companies goals and try to establish according rules&#x2F;workflow for your daily business. For example: Your product is basically &quot;done&quot; and now management wants &quot;Features&quot;. The &quot;Features&quot; Section of your products requires a clear interface for &quot;plugins&quot; and probably also a quick way to &quot;prototype&quot; new features. So you as a developer should find appropriate ways to optimise your workflow which might require to change your workflow for a specific section of your product.<p>Of course, this is totally oversimplified, but I hope you get the point.<p>Bye the way, this all requires Communication AND Understanding of all particpiants! Management need to communicate the way you are are heading and IT needs to articulate what is needed for the upcoming tasks. Be aware, most solutions are not found in a day. Complex Situations needs time to fully grasp and find solutions.<p>P.S. If communication and understanding is missing, you are most probably on a dead ship. Be prepared to drown (evaluate your market value) and don&#x27;t get emotionally involved (Danger of &quot;burn out&quot;).')
