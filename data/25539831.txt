Sometimes there is a solution, but it&#x27;s just not attainable for everyone.<p>&gt; are there any real life hacks that are not obvious that result in significant quality of life improvements?<p>I didn&#x27;t want to make this post about my own lifestyle, but it might qualify as an answer:<p>1. I reduced my expenses. You don&#x27;t need to earn the money you don&#x27;t spend. I&#x27;ve always been frugal, but I recently took more drastic steps with point #2 in mind. For instance, I cut my rent by 42% by moving to the edge of the city into an older apartment. Well, actually 30% because I have a garage - a lifelong dream of mine.<p>2. I went freelance to have more control on how much time I sell. I didn&#x27;t think this was possible, until a contractor at my old job said he took 3 month vacations between contracts. The more you earn and the less you spend, the longer you can go between contracts. At the average rate [1], I could cover my expenses in 3 months. The 4th month pays for a nice trip.<p>3. Decouple your income from your time. I built a website, and it grew enough to pay the bills. Now I live from it. I spend 20-30 hours a month on it (though it requires about 10). This was a stroke of luck. I couldn&#x27;t reproduce that if you asked me.<p>That&#x27;s about it. I&#x27;m well aware that this could only happen in specific conditions with a healthy amount of arbitrary luck. However, it did result in significant quality of life improvements. Anyone can appreciate the value of having so much free time. It&#x27;s only a matter of using it well.<p>I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any wisdom to extract from this, but I hope it helps.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;allaboutberlin.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;freelance-developer-rate" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;allaboutberlin.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;freelance-developer-rate</a>')
