You can use win+tab to add and switch to one and then bring all of your work windows over to it. I used to use that when I began WFH but got out of the practice. You can switch between them by doing ctrl+win+left arrow or ctrl+win+right but be careful because some graphics drivers use ctrl+alt+left&#x2F;right&#x2F;up&#x2F;down to rotate the screen and I&#x27;ve messed up my multi-desktop setup more than once by mistaking the key combo.<p>It&#x27;s not as good as having a separate system for office work but you can conceptually separate what you are doing at least.')
