Item(by='taxicabjesus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610692036, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25778706, text='The health of the adult teeth is mostly determined early in childhood, at around 3-5 years old iirc. Children need much more than fluoride to have healthy teeth. Having adequate calcium from conception 12 years old, and vitamin D (sunlight, etc), and those other vitamins and minerals, is sort of important for having good teeth as an adult. There was a submission somewhat recently about how we have to chew to develop good facial structure (or something like that... this submission iirc: [1]).<p>My now-12 year old dog still has good teeth [2] (possibly related to having adequate calcium when she was a puppy) and they&#x27;ve still never been cleaned. The community she grew up in had naturally-high fluoride levels in water. Was that a factor? I don&#x27;t know.<p>I think it&#x27;s silly to reduce dental health to a single variable of neurotoxic-fluoride vs no-fluoride.<p>[1] Why we have so many problems with our teeth - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23335368" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23335368</a><p>[2] 4 year old comment on my dog - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12027319" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12027319</a>')
