If I started today, I would love to being with python or even Java&#x2F;Kotlin as it&#x27;s better to show the good things about OOP.<p>C it&#x27;s great to learn the barebones experience with memory, and as a lang that runs in everything.<p>The modern use I could see for C++ it&#x27;s usually too specific for a random learner. I would only recommended for people who like to work in game engines, simulations, networking, embedded systems or migration of legacy systems, and other edge cases.<p>But for learning, I think it&#x27;s better to learn with a modern lang, as you will be less distracted learning the quirks of vitange language, and use that time to learn in parallel a lot of concepts outside the lang, like algorithms, devops, soft skills with teams, prioritizing requirements, etc.')
