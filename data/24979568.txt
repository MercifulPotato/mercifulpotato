But I also think that out of the hundreds of thousands of camera operators in the world you had to look for an exceptional one to make a point. Before you take it personal and form a general opinion based on that one anecdote sit on it for a minute and think, is this example relevant for the discussion? Is he the rule or the exception?<p>What about the situation from the article? The operator who&#x27;s sitting in a small football stadium of a small Scottish second league team pointing the camera at what could be charitably described as an average football match for 90 minutes? How many operators filmed Diana&#x27;s crash in Paris and the fall of Ghadaffi, and how many only film mundane, mediocre things their entire career?<p>&gt; (much of which was caused by the tech industry - specifically facebook)<p>I took the tech industry just as a good example of an all round good, well paying job <i>in general</i>, not to pass judgement on what it brings to the world. My comment history could tell you as much. Mass media deserves its share of jabs as I&#x27;m sure you agree. But neither of the jabs make any my arguments or conclusion any less valid.')
