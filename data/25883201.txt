SpaceX largely exists because of the government contracts to launch to the ISS and for various NRO launches there&#x27;s not enough public need for launches alone to sustain a rocket industry is what I mean. Especially for human launches, the only reason to have a human rated orbital capsule is to service the ISS.')
