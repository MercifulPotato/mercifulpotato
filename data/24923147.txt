First of all, it&#x27;s not a known fact that a Python JIT implementation with reasonable maintenance cost, functionality, and performance can exist. Pyston is trying to prove that it is possible, but it&#x27;s not exactly a weekend project.<p>Even if you solved all the political issues around getting CPython maintainers to accept performance contributions (discussed already in this thread), adding a JIT to the main CPython codebase would surely slow the pace of development of other Python features. If the effort were to fail, then CPython&#x27;s primary maintainers will have wasted a whole bunch of time coordinating with the JIT effort. I&#x27;m personally rooting for Pyston to succeed but it&#x27;s admittedly an ambitious project.<p>So forking off an experiment is the right move here. Pyston&#x27;s existence as a side-project is pulling no resources away from the main project -- but it would if it was trying to send changes upstream.<p>Hypothetically the Pyston developers could be making non-JIT contributions to CPython instead, but developers aren&#x27;t interchangeable commodities. Pyston&#x27;s engineers have expertise in optimizations -- they may not be as skilled or interested in language development.')
