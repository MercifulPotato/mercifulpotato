How would you replace a single file in a random tar-file, without changing any of the permissions&#x2F;userids&#x2F;groupids inside the tar-file? You can&#x27;t untar it because the users inside the tar file don&#x27;t correspond with the ones on your system. So, you&#x27;ll have to use special tools, which is (only) one demonstration of the inadequacy of the permissions mechanism of our filesystems.')
