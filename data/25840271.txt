It&#x27;s buying an item and then selling it later. The fact that they had the option not to sell and could choose to exercise it doesn&#x27;t disappear when they do choose to sell it.<p>In this specific case I think it&#x27;s completely wrong to say that people who sell back physical copies are effectively renters.')
