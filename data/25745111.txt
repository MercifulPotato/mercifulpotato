They will of course call themselves decent democratic socialists, and do it in the name of decent socialist values.<p>So to even try and make your point you’d need to back it up with: how would you ensure wolfs-in-sheep’s-clothing or the-well-intentioned-but-overreactive don’t use your “censor fascists” support to back door their way into the only world superpower with strong free speech laws and, well, end those?<p>And when a couple social networks have a vast majority of the users (social networks are literally network-effects) how is censorship on them not akin to a massive balance of power disparity that would reinforce itself? By the same logic of supporting banning voices from then you must admit they embody incredible power, even if they are private companies.')
