Embarrassing for humanity that is. I&#x27;ve struggled to get well paid professionals to cough up the â‚¬4. There is some mental block beyond &#x27;free&#x27;, yet these same people decry WA&#x27;s privacy changes.<p>I think signal was right to use GCM,for the general audience, but I personally would like to avoid it where possible. I use both apps, which in itself is a boon.<p>Feel free to reach out, my Threema ID is in my profile. Would love to create a HN group to test the group features at scale.')
