George Lucas doesn&#x27;t think it actually <i>is</i> ancient history.<p>Contrast this with George Martin&#x27;s assertion that the Dothraki are &quot;an amalgam of steppe and plains cultures [...] seasoned with a dash of pure fantasy&quot; (or that the sexual violence in his books mirrors that of the real medieval history). This is an &quot;out of fictional universe&quot; argument, different from Star War&#x27;s fictional conceit that it takes place &quot;a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away&quot;.')
