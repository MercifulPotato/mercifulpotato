They are one of the very few that can recognize their own mirror images.<p>I will never forget how one morning, on my regular run, i saw a group of magpies on the ground, right beside the road. There were 4 magpies forming a line, they were looking at two other magpies just in front of them. One of the two magpies appeared to be dead - was laying flat on the ground, while the other one was on top of it, sort of like in a triumphant fashion. Victor and defeated. The victorious magpie was the only one &quot;talking&quot;, appearing to be giving a speech, while the rest were listening. What it was proclaiming, it&#x27;s anyone&#x27;s guess. Never seen anything more glorious with my own eyes.')
