At least some reports at the time were of heavenly armies and other fantastic things. So no, the phenomenon was not described (at least universally) as aurora.<p>The article - written much later - assumes that it was in fact an aurora. The comment I replied to proposed &quot;tl;dr: IMO they were probably high on wacky loaf.&quot; Which is an alternate explanation that doesn&#x27;t really match the fact that this was seen all over the country on the same night. Maybe that author meant that people all over England were tripping balls on the rare night of an aurora.')
