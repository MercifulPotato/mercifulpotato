Item(by='st1x7', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606071802, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25177360, text='&gt; This is kind of random, but I was watching a cooking video where the presenter said things like &quot;we add two tablespoons of olive oil&quot;, and it looks like they pour much more than that.<p>I don&#x27;t know which chef you watched but Gordon Ramsey and olive oil is a meme for a reason. He uses way more than the amounts that he mentions. Most tv&#x2F;youtube chefs eyeball stuff like oil and seasoning anyway, I wouldn&#x27;t worry too much about it.')
