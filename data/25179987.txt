Its not specifically disallowed by Apple or Microsoft, but the manufacturers, tertiary driver providers, and community just haven&#x27;t put a lot of time into making it great. I expect the situation will improve, but its unlikely we&#x27;ll see any support from Apple or Microsoft, which absolutely should be a concern when picking these devices for Linux.')
