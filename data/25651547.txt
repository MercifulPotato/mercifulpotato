There is such a thing as urgency, and people do work beyond a 35 hour work week with evenly spaced meals, and especially during a global pandemic.<p>Specific to this instance, this FDA meeting was a formality -- they had already had the data for two weeks to review. The efficacy was well-known. They chose to take a 4-day holiday (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday).<p>People don&#x27;t all of a sudden sign house contracts. They&#x27;ve germinated the idea, spent weeks or months working through the pros and cons, talking to their life partners and family and agent and mortgage broker. The decision is made well in advance of the actual contract signing, and all the red lines are done before you get to the actual meeting to sign on the line. Similarly with the FDA regulators, they weren&#x27;t meeting to review the data for the first time and come up with a decision on the spot. This was one final step in a very long process.')
