Item(by='buttersbrian', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611604676, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25907292, text='&gt; Would they prefer it enough to opt into that tracking and targeting?<p>I believe a a sizable portion would. They like the targeted offers and ads. Maybe because they enjoy the feel of something being catered to them, maybe because they are addicted to shopping&#x2F;consumerists. IDK.<p>&gt; If users had to go to a setting to turn on targeted ads, what percentage of them do you think would do it? I suspect it would be pretty low. I wonder if most people would even notice that the setting had been turned off?<p>I think this is a really good question. The power of opt-in vs. opt-out, as you noted.<p>However, I don&#x27;t know if we can conclude whether they value it or not solely from their willingness to opt-in. We really have to account for how the ability to opt-in is exposed. If we showed it on every size (akin to the cookie accept craze of today), we&#x27;d see a lot of people opt-in. If it were hidden in a chrome settings, far less just because that&#x27;s mentally off limits for many, and easily forgettable.<p>I totally agree with you on somewhat sinister motivation of opt-out over opt-out patterns.')
