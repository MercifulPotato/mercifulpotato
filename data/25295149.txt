The more developers you have on ARM, the faster device and software support will come.<p>&gt; I am no fan of x86, but trading what we have now for an M1 is a net loss in terms of our ability to install anything we want as users, no question.<p>You&#x27;ve changed the question here. We were speaking about ARM in general, not the M1.')
