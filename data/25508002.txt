Cable for V2 seems to be about £20 nowadays (mine was official but most seem to not be, doubt it makes a difference), most stuff online seems to talk about it being multiples of that.\nThe step up in tracking ability and image quality from Kinect V1 is absolutely gigantic. However, you can very easily get a v1 plus adapter for under £20 in total and it probably covers most of what people would want to play with.<p>Dunno about built in functionality, I used a plugin. MaxMSP has Kinect functionality via a plugin too, which I haven&#x27;t dabbled in but looks pretty fun. There&#x27;s a node library for v2 as well I believe.')
