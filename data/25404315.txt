Think of it as localize, then filter. I&#x27;ve written it the other way, too, but this seems more natural to me. (Also, a direct h2e invocation would take the arguments from the command line; h2ei will ask every time.)<p>In practice, I will do something, realize that the thing I just did over the last several minutes could be useful--or the core of something more general--and then strike F12 to start h2ei. At the prompts, I&#x27;ll generally give it a nice round number like 10 or 20 or 50 lines, leave the default pattern, and set the filename to be something evocative in ~&#x2F;bin. An editor will immediately open on my new shell script, and I can trim it down and continue hacking on it from there.<p>The key idea is that I get an easier path from doing something ad hoc to creating something more useful in the long run.')
