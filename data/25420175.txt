TypeScript is intentionally designed to accommodate as wide a swath of styles as possible (even to a point where some functionality is duplicated: you can have enums or string unions, you can have interfaces or object types, etc). TypeScript code can be written squarely in a C# developer&#x27;s comfort zone (unsurprising, given it&#x27;s developed by Microsoft), or it can be a richly expressive and flexible immutable&#x2F;functional&#x2F;structural type system. It&#x27;s similar to what I&#x27;ve heard Scala described as (though I haven&#x27;t used that myself). In some cases though this is a strength: I usually to stick to a functional style where I can, but end up with a handful of classes where they make sense. Being able to mix the two smoothly is nice.')
