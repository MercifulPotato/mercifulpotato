Either we learn from the situation or we don’t.<p>However I don’t see what’s wrong with chronicling how political themes are systemic and not associated with a particular party.<p>In any case, the piece does a lot more just blame politicians, and talks about structural forces such as demographics and economics and how they lead to this situation.<p>Why dismiss that?')
