If that site redirects me to some big app&#x27;s delivery service, then fine.<p>Although of course sometimes that entire website might not be from the restaurant but from the app&#x27;s company. I have no easy way to fight that, I&#x27;m afraid. If that happens to a restaurant, they need to take better ownership of their brand.')
