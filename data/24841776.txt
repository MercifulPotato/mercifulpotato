You&#x27;re saying there&#x27;s little difficulty in using the OS, but that isn&#x27;t what I mean when I say it&#x27;s not a practical option. The core problem is that the average person doesn&#x27;t know how and wouldn&#x27;t be comfortable taking that step, even if it&#x27;s pretty easy once you know how. You have also made yourself their support person. They can&#x27;t bring their computer to Best Buy or call Apple if they have a problem. We don&#x27;t have the retail &amp; support infrastructure in place for desktop Linux to be a viable option. These are the things I&#x27;m talking about when I say it&#x27;s not a practical option for a typical user.')
