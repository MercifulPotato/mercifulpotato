Item(by='singhkays', descendants=None, kids=[25257564, 25257676], score=None, time=1606761884, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25257159, text='&gt; After hitting the guardrail at about 137mph (220km&#x2F;h), Grosjean&#x27;s car ripped in half and then burst into flamesâ€”something that hasn&#x27;t happened for over 30 years. To make matters worse, the front half penetrated between the guardrails that lined this section of track. As crashes go, this one was more reminiscent of the bad-old days of F1, the kind that claimed the lives of drivers like Roger Williamson or Francois Cevert.<p>This.....just sounds so horrific and a nightmare scenario for the driver. At that speed I wonder how much of a sense a driver has of going through this experience vs it&#x27;s over in an instant. Overall, it&#x27;s a testament to engineering, that a person can walk away alive from a crash like this.')
