That&#x27;s the game for me at least...<p>just today a retool open source alternative was in the homepage, so there&#x27;s room for everyone here I think!<p>What JAMStack means, is more layers of abstraction, but an easiness of getting started too, you can get it as simple or complex as you want anyway...')
