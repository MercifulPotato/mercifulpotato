Now that our Type Zero civilization is considering the dangers of a compacted human settlement sprawl (energized by the protein of the similarly compacted animal farm), perhaps it may become more convenient to view a remotely located Supercharger&#x2F;solar&#x2F;storage site as the first building block of the minimally invasive living space template of the future (McDonalds is one of the largest real estate holders, and also sells burgers).<p>The input then becomes a low cost large footprint solar array atop a common city center warehouse and&#x2F;or surrounding vacancy of low tax land. The modular Powerpack can scale capacity within the ample space of the Town Warehouse Space (also available to contain additional communal assets) as local residency increases.<p>This becomes conceptual practice space for the inevitable Starborough.')
