I&#x27;ve worked at krogers and target, and I would wager most employees did. Nothing huge and not cash but some food here and a drink there and you&#x27;re talking real money in a years time.<p>Edit: just remembered a funny anecdote, a employee was caught stealing food at krogers, but it was normal enough that they told him if he paid for it they would forget it happened. He pretended to check out and was caught stealing the same food twice so they had to fire him. It was like a 2$ sandwich.')
