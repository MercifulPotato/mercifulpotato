Over the past three years, I have had things break perhaps three times. All of them were either my own fault (outdatet package) or warned about through Arch News (which I didn&#x27;t bother to check because it is only necessary a couple of times a year)<p>That being said, running Arch on a computer that you <i>need</i> to be working at all time, might not be a good idea for professional reasons. However, I think you are essensially making a similiar argument for Arch, as they are making for the Debian bug.')
