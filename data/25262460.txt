It is really sad.<p>The quarter-pounder here is nowhere near 1&#x2F;4 of a pound. (seemly they use a 0.2 pound one instead. or 1&#x2F;5 of a pound)<p>I actually paid attention last time I went, in more than one store, I ordered quarter pounder and kept watching the drawer, not only they used the drawer, but the burger that went into quarter pounder is same that went into all other products.')
