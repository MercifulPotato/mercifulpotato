Item(by='nybble41', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603693748, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24885718, text='&gt; â€¦ these HN comments saying it&#x27;s not for YouTube and it&#x27;s not for downloading is silly. It&#x27;s literally in the name.<p>Regardless of the name, the tool supports over a thousand different sites, not just YouTube, and is routinely used for streaming rather than downloading, with no permanent copy saved. If you run &quot;mpv <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;WhWc3b3KhnY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;WhWc3b3KhnY</a>&quot; to simply play the Blender Open Movie &quot;Spring&quot; it relies on youtube-dl behind the scenes to stream the video. (Though of course the difference between streaming and downloading is a trivial one; getting the content to the end user&#x27;s device is the hard part.)<p>YouTube itself is the entity responsible for duplicating and distributing the content, and they have a license to do so, ergo there is no copyright violation here. The most any user of youtube-dl might be liable for, assuming they don&#x27;t save a permanent copy or further redistribute the data, would be a violation of YouTube&#x27;s TOS. Which is no concern of the RIAA. To call youtube-dl a &quot;circumvention tool&quot; is laughable; obfuscation of a video&#x27;s URL is not DRM.')
