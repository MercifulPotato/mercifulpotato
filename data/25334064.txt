Unless you&#x27;re in the habit of cranking your furnace up to tropical temperatures I guess.  For me, I keep the temperature above freezing inside but otherwise?  I put on a sweater and open the window.  It&#x27;s cheaper, refreshing, and better for the environment.  Right now it&#x27;s 8 C outside; with the window open and a sweater on, I&#x27;m as comfy as a clam.')
