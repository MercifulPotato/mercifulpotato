Hence software, and services that depend <i>only</i> on software are suitable for the rocket-fuel injection strategy VCs so heavily rely on.<p>Make no mistake - good software is damn expensive to create, but once it&#x27;s ready for delivery, creating and selling additional copies (or serving more clients) costs practically nothing.')
