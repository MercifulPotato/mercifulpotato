You even get a changes feed for live replication.<p>- I&#x27;d rather bet my money on CouchDB (Apache Project with significant support from IBM) being around in 20 years still than on Dropbox.<p>Privacy and user control is OFC up to the app developer. \nAlso, it&#x27;s no worse of a CRDT than the proposed structure, you just need to design the document structure well: In the given example, each todo should be a different document and voil√° - you&#x27;ll only get conflicts if the exact same entry is modified.')
