It&#x27;s not like the days where &quot;tabs and ad blocking&quot; were only available in one browser (well two, but Opera was still (a) charging money or (b) including ads depending on the timeframe) and provided a huge incentive to switch from IE. Sync is the closest any browser feature has come to that level in a decade, but all browsers had that pretty quickly.<p>Mozilla also don&#x27;t have the brand power to push their browser to people who don&#x27;t actually care but just want the notification on google.com or youtube to go away, or had it bundled with flash player or their windows install or their AV program like a lot of Chrome&#x27;s rise.<p>My hope is it bottoms out and finds a new stable equilibrium at brave&#x2F;vivaldi levels. The question is if that&#x27;s a large enough position to actually maintain a browser engine.')
