Although I honestly don&#x27;t give a crap about this particular issue, and would use whatever pronouns people prefer (as long as I don&#x27;t forget them, as one sometimes does even with names), the civil right is free speech.<p>Claiming the right of not being offended by speech, to me, is a litmus test for an anti-civil-rights person&#x2F;organization. Sure, if someone chooses to call everyone &quot;you pitiful worm&quot; it&#x27;s their right to not associate with the caller, but they have no right whatsoever, and certainly not any kind of civil right, to be called anything else.')
