They tried to do both things at the same time. Whether the spoiled kids realise this is irrelevant: they don&#x27;t become a tribe just because they are brought into the same kindergarten. Google will try to reshuffle the deck and if that doesn&#x27;t work, they&#x27;ll split the ethics and diversity components into separate orgs, where ethics will be given to more mature and competent people (perhaps unethical at the he same time - this is another dunder mifflin corp after all).')
