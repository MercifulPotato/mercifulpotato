Change to a subfolder and maybe a mouse-driven app is going to be faster. Change five levels down, then three levels up, then repeat five times with small variations doing some operations, and mouse user has no chance to keep up.<p>Also there is only so many things you can click on (ie the surface of the screen) so you have to click on things to uncover other options to click on, and so on. All this is slow because typing is much faster than pointing and clicking. I type 5 to 10 characters per second, easily, and that I think is not possible for a mouse-driven application and touch interfaces are even worse.<p>Commands basically open an infinite amount of possibilities with very few keystrokes as long as you have experience composing them. On my machine I press ctrl+n and start typing name of the file and I am instantly brought to that file. With a mouse I would first have to navigate to some kind of commander or explorer-like application, start going through folders (assuming I remember where the file is) or maybe click on some kind of search and then browse through results. That takes time and I am usually under a two seconds to reach most files on my system.<p>My theory is that people who started learning with newer technology that does not afford so much in terms of composability never learned to solve a problem this way. Also the new technology tends to change a lot faster than in the past, making it obsolete sooner which causes people to overlook advantages of learning their tools really well.')
