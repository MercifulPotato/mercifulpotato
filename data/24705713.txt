Graduates from an Australian university can get a Temporary Graduate (485) Visa which lasts 2-4 years, but the pathway from then on usually requires getting an employer to sponsor your permanent residency (186&#x2F;187) after 3 years of work experience, unless you get explicitly invited to some of the other programs (189&#x2F;190)[+]. If you live in a regional area there are more options (887 for instance) but most people don&#x27;t and might find it difficult to live in regional towns and cities.<p>As an immigrant to (and citizen of) Australia myself, I find it pretty appalling how hard it has become to become a permanent resident in Australia even if you are reasonably skilled (and the fact that permanent residency requires nomination by an employer -- which is unlike most other countries, where permanent residency is based on your own residence and skills). The work-based streams are becoming more and more narrow and it&#x27;s longer the case that studying in Australia gives you any guaranteed pathway to residency (and I would argue it hasn&#x27;t been the case for a fairly long time now).<p>[+]: A quick look at the EOI statistics &lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.dynamic.reports.employment.gov.au&#x2F;anonap&#x2F;extensions&#x2F;hSKLS02_SkillSelect_EOI_Data&#x2F;hSKLS02_SkillSelect_EOI_Data.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.dynamic.reports.employment.gov.au&#x2F;anonap&#x2F;extensi...</a>&gt; shows that 7.2% ((LODGED+INVITED)&#x2F;SUBMITTED ~= 7.2%) of people who register their interest end up being invited.')
