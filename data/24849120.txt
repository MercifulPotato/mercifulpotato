You can use auto in parameters if the calling context allows inference, for example when writing lambda.<p>Similarly, you can use auto as a return type if the function implementation is immediately given and the compiler with infer the return type. The new starship operator (&lt;=&gt;) typical usage is pretty much declaring it with an auto return type and &quot;= default&quot; implementation.')
