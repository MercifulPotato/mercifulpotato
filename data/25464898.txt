However there are surely differences between chilling free speech (removing speech), litigating against slanderous speech, the illusion of (but not actually) a public forum for reviews of all sorts (particularly if there are ratings but legitimate low rated reviews are removed), and retaliating against those who&#x27;ve publicly reviewed.<p>It is far more credible to believe that a loose association of similar tactics across a small number of large business entities might reasonably create a chilling effect upon speech.<p>An example; as a renter I have heard rumors of others who&#x27;ve left low reviews in public places and find it difficult to find willing renters in the future.  I have no basis for this but the process of qualifying a renter is also opaque so I have no evidence to refute it either.  It isn&#x27;t unreasonable to think market forces could coincidentally cause various entities to reach a similar logical conclusion, or that an outsourced background check agency checks for various public posts that might be relevant to the rental agencies.')
