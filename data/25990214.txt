It&#x27;s invaluable to know what makes people tick and how best to work with them.<p>If the groups don&#x27;t form naturally, maybe try to &#x27;seed&#x27; some. Stick some cash behind a local bar, ask if anybody wants to go karting after work, pop along for an informal 5-a-side on Sunday morning etc. Never force it, though.<p>I was made aware of a &#x27;fun event&#x27; that didn&#x27;t get enough uptake to hit it&#x27;s KPI. Therefore people were encouraged to press-gang their people - and you end up with a bunch of miserable people all resenting the intrusion into their personal time and everybody involved.')
