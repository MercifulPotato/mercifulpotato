At a friend&#x27;s house I overheard three late-twenties women talking about one of them going on a date with a guy.<p>Looking at the pone all three of them exclaimed in joy &quot;OHHHH - He&#x27;s CUTE!!!&quot;.<p>The guy proceeded to stand her up three times - no showing to planned dates -, said he can&#x27;t hold a job, his car broke down, and then stood her up again.<p>I&#x27;m quite confident a doormat could be a better person&#x2F;partner in terms of dependability and respecting someones time.<p>All three of them are still enthralled with him.
