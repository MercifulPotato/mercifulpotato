But I definitely think returning a specific subclass&#x2F;interface of ExecutorService would be a great help. I think at the expense of an extra class, something like this is a lot easier for people to wrap their head around:<p><pre><code>  try (Nursery n = Nursery.spawn()) {\n    n.submit(() -&gt; foo());\n    n.submit(() -&gt; bar());\n  }\n\n  try (Nursery n = Nursery.spawnWithDeadline(Instant)) {\n    ...\n    try (Nursery nx = n.spawn()) {\n      nx.submit(() -&gt; foo());\n      nx.submit(() -&gt; bar());\n    }\n    ...\n  }\n</code></pre>\n...')
