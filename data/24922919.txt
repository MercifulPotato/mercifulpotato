To a very real extent, Go probably only exists at all because Google poured an infinite amount of effort into Unladen Swallow--a project designed to remove the GIL from Python 2 to make it more usable for concurrent programs and add an LLVM-based JIT compiler to improve performance--and Python&#x27;s response was to not only not merge it, but to break the entire Python ecosystem for a decade by forking the language... while somehow leaving &quot;concurrency&quot; and &quot;performance&quot; off the list of goals while making their backwards incompatible change (which of course also destroyed all the work on Unladen Swallow); hell: early versions of Python 3 were benchmarking universally slower than Python 2 :&#x2F;. Google seems to have &quot;gotten the hint&quot;, and around the same time (2009) hired Rob Pike to do Go, and has since &quot;moved on&quot; from Python and taken a massive part of the ecosystem of users Python used to have with it (the rest having bailed for node.js; remember when Python was the future of web development, competing with Ruby thanks to Django? those were the days): people still use Python, but it is now an entirely different crop of data scientists and AI people... all of whom are starting to run into the performance issues in even their glue layer, and so if the Swift tensorflow efforts ever work out, Python is done.')
