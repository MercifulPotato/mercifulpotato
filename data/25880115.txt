While it’s true that both the left and the right both abuse  gerrymandering, I don’t believe that the latter part of the assertion that they do so purely in the pursuit of power&#x2F;control is accurate or a fair representation of everyone’s motives. There are people involved in politics that truly believe in what their party stands and moreover, that the opposing party will induce some sort of harm (regardless if they’re well intentioned or not) if their policies are implemented. There is no law against Gerrymandering and this objectionable tactic will invariably be used by the opposing party. By not Gerrymandering, you are giving the opposing party a distinct advantage and the opportunity to enact policies that you are fighting against. The cynic would say that everyone involved cares only about power and while that is almost certainly true for certain individuals, it’s not true for many. It concerns me how some bad apples, opportunists, and some folks with an agenda in politics, the media, etc. have turned so many into cynics. There are many good people in politics and the media — people who care deeply about their work and their impact on society. We should find ways to discuss specifics and not in generalities.')
