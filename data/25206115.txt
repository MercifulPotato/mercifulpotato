There are genetic limits to strength but fitness and being in shape are psychologically attractive to women. A lot of guys would be attractive if they would at least do the minimum requirements for maintaining their health. But I digress.<p>Guys who complain about women ignoring them are usually themselves ignoring lots of women around them who would be suitable for them but they aren’t good enough for whatever reason. I’ve seen it SOOOOO many times when average looking guys complain about how shallow girls are or how good looking guys have it easy (this second point isn’t exactly completely untrue mind you) yet they still focus on the most classically attractive women they know or at the bar wherever who are out of their league.<p>If average looking guys were to spend more time on themselves- grooming, having a hobby outside of work&#x2F;tv&#x2F;games, fitness, reading a book once in a while- they would be surprised to see how the world around them will change.<p>Also there are lots of good girls who may not be supermodels looking to date regular guys. At least give them the green light once in a while.')
