Derek Muller) titled &quot;Is success luck or hard work?&quot; [1].<p>While it&#x27;s probably impossible to prove one way or another, I&#x27;ve personally grown to accept that I will never be fully satisfied with everything in my life. Accepting that fact has given me some kind of peace, because I no longer dwell on the what-ifs as much as I used to. It doesn&#x27;t matter if I reach the goals I have in mind right now, as I&#x27;m bound to come up with new ones that are just out of my reach. I believe bettering oneself is good, but I also believe it&#x27;s important to accept that there&#x27;s never a goal to be reached there.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=3LopI4YeC4I" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=3LopI4YeC4I</a>')
