I won&#x27;t play that, but surely they&#x27;ll fix it before release - this is Blizzard we&#x27;re talking about,&quot; and I didn&#x27;t pay any attention after that. I actually had no idea that they even <i>released</i> it eight years ago. It might have gone a different way had they made something that didn&#x27;t betray all of the things I liked about the real Diablo games.')
