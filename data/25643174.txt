One of the complaints the OpenBSD developers had was broken memory allocation (well, de-allocation really), heaps of spaghetti ifdefs, support for non-existing platforms, hardcoded randomness, exposed private APIs and other weirdness. If the LibreSSL team managed to yank out half of the code, wouldn&#x27;t it be reasonable to assume that the OpenSSL developers have yanked out at least some code and rewritten thousands of lines?<p>Given the massive reworking of the OpenSSL code by the OpenBSD, I guess I just question whether or not the OpenSSL developers have been through a similar process.')
