It&#x27;d be hard to keep the testing matrix of apps X hardware X driver version from exploding out of control.<p>Your customers will be hella pissed at you if their favorite game suddenly doesn&#x27;t work on their system after a driver update. So you need to test a representative sample of previously-working software across all hardware that the updated driver applies to.<p>That sounds like a nightmare, and a capital-intensive one because you need to keep machines up with all of these cards, both in continuous integration and for interactive debugging.<p>I can understand the impulse to keep the list of hardware that new driver versions support small.')
