If it does, it could be covered by providing a short list of exercises to try for activating each muscle group A.  That way the user doesn&#x27;t have to figure out which muscle(s) B are compensating, which could be challenging for a lot of people who need this information.  In my case, I&#x27;m still not sure exactly how my body was compensating for the muscles in my back that weren&#x27;t being utilized.')
