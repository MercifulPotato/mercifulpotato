Offer for him to move to SF or Miami. Watch for the &quot;ha, ha, no thanks&quot;, but see the impact it has on Chinese citizens. They&#x27;re not stupid, and they know what&#x27;s going on.<p>Edit:<p>1. Brain drain. Adopt China&#x27;s best, brightest, and most creative.<p>2. Culture war. Tell Disney it&#x27;s time to stop being cozy and make a &quot;Chernobyl&quot; style film about Tiananmen, Uyghurs, Tibetans, et al.<p>3. Build up our global manufacture. Vietnam, India, Mexico, Africa, South America.<p>4. Build capacity domestically, especially for strategic needs. Build lots of factories on the border. Jobs programs. But also allow immigrant workers and provide a path to citizenship.<p>5. Commit to our strong allies in a trade pact. Europe, Japan, Korea...<p>We can route out this evil. But we have to work hard. This is an existential crisis.<p>The US and its allies should all be on board with this plan and commit to doing similarly.')
