There&#x27;s listings for everything and quite a few are misleading. It doesn&#x27;t help that you have no idea what is the normal price range when traveling abroad and may not speak the language very well.<p>If you&#x27;re interested by the way. My counter experience renting a flat on airbnb over the summer, is that guests are evaluating everything they could use including beds and couches and ground space. The guest renting a one bedroom could be anything from a person or a couple to a family (maybe with extended family&#x2F;cousins joining in) to a group of many friends. It&#x27;s always a surprise whether there will be 1 or 6 people showing up.')
