It was designed because video cameras were making too much data for CF to handle. The downside is its size: 43x36x5 mm vs 15x11x1 mm for microSD.<p>Also, CFast aren’t as ubiquitous as microSD. I can go to Target or Walmart and get a wide “selection” of microSD, but I’d be hard pressed to find a CFast card. So the chances of an SBC using CFast over eMMC or microSD is low.')
