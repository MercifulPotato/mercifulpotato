Unfortunately, so far, nobody except Racket enthusiasts appear to have much interest in building languages on top of Racket - but it&#x27;s absolutely possible and practical, and someone really did accomplish the astonishing feat of implementing Python (Python 2, alas) in Racket, in such a way that you could combine libraries from both languages.')
