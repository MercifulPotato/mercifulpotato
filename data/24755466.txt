Good luck crossing the Serbian border or in fact any EU&#x2F;non-EU border with a trunk of ammo. I just mentioned Serbia because their border police is rather <i>too vigilant</i>. They wanted to tear a friend&#x27;s RV apart to look for cigarettes or drugs. Imagine how delghted they&#x27;d be to find a trunk full of ammo. It would almost certainly be on the news. Also if you&#x27;re under 30 and looking cool, you&#x27;re very likely to be pulled off for a not-so-quick routine search. Also good luck crossing the Swiss border if you succeed.')
