In my experience, good review papers are more than summaries. They can connect separate lines of research for example, compare and contrast different ideas and they can re-contextaulise a body of research to give a broader picture and reveal new and interesting directions. These papers are hard to write well and take a long time. Even more so in cases where empirical work has been undertaken so as to make direct comparisons and provide reference implementations.<p>Even the summary papers can be useful. On particularly active problems there can be dozens of papers per year. Sorting out wheat from chaff by highlighting notable works, and pointing out trends in published research, is again a genuine contribution, and helpful for the scientific community.')
