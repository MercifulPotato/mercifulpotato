The idea is to accept some limitations on what shapes can be created, for the sake of better real-time editing performance.<p>The original Cube engine is almost as old as Quake III: Team Arena, which can do more free-form geometry and has pretty light-maps, but ‘compiling’ these maps was a lengthy, compute-intensive task at the time, which made online multiplayer in-game level editing impossible.')
