The $800 NordicTrack rower we bought automatically adjusts resistance with their iFit programs. So people were just paying for an exercise bike with a big LCD screen? I&#x27;m astounded that they stayed in business long enough to release a second version that fixes this. VC money can fix that problem, but I&#x27;m also astounded that anyone actually bought one.')
