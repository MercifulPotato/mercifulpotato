If it did occur and they had to pay-out for all the electronics of all their customers, then they&#x27;d simply refuse to pay. If they got taken to court and they were forced to pay, then they&#x27;d declare bankrupty  and it would be a government problem then.<p>Insurance is great for limited disasters&#x2F;issues. For wide-ranging systematic issues, insurance is a scam because they simply cannot make all their customers whole. Just like banks are great as long as everyone doesn&#x27;t cash out. If everyone decides to cash out, then banks start to look scammy.')
