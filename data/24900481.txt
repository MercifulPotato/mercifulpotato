Item(by='gruez', descendants=None, kids=[24910367], score=None, time=1603741660, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24899720, text='&gt;It doesn&#x27;t matter if there are dozens of CDNs. Look at what happened to dailystormer, they were unable to find a CDN. Yes, they are bad nazis and are pretty much underserving of anybody&#x27;s pity, but it still shows how easily those few market players (and an angry twitter mob) can banish stuff from the internet, driven by some public outrage.<p>My claim isn&#x27;t that they didn&#x27;t face any censorship, but that the scenario is not analogous to utilities, like you proposed earlier. Furthermore, if we&#x27;re talking about dozens of market players, how is this any different than ye olden days where there&#x27;s only a few dozen print shops within 1 day horse ride, and all of them refusing to print your pamphlets? It seems like your position is &quot;no businesses shouldn&#x27;t be able to discriminate on ideology&quot;, not just &quot;common infrastructure companies [...] shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to discriminate against people with the &#x27;wrong&#x27; opinions&quot;<p>&gt;There is a handful of CC companies and payment processors. Look at what happened to adult performers and sex workers (even the ones operating completely within the law): they cannot even get a bank account once they are found out to be in those businesses.<p>Many payment processors don&#x27;t want to deal with adult&#x2F;sex content not because they&#x27;re puritans, but because it&#x27;s associated with high rates of fraud. I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with dropping clients that turn out to be more trouble than they&#x27;re worth. Furthermore, the problem you describe doesn&#x27;t really exist. There are processors dedicated to processing adult content however, as evidenced by sites like onlyfans.')
