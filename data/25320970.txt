I hope I am not whining too much about Lightning in my article. It is annoying, but in the end, it just means I need to have a cable dedicated to the Apple phone in my bedroom, car, and in my battery backup charger. I can manage. But it would still be nice if I could just stock a single type of cable.<p>The iPhone 12 is compatible with USB PD, which is nice. My Lightning cable plugged into my USB C brick means fast charging. But why be USB PD compatible and not just go all the way?')
