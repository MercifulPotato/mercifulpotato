The opposition believes there&#x27;s no credible evidence not only for wide spread mail-in ballot fraud but not even for minor, scattered cases (besides the rare outliers here and there that are inevitable for every election).<p>This one particular issue carries the potential to catalyze a chain reaction that eventually leads to conflict or war, so I think it&#x27;s extremely important that people at the very least take the discussion seriously and try to help bridge the gap between the two movies. If this doesn&#x27;t happen, the screen might just get ripped asunder.')
