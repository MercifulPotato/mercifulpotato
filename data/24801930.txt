Capitalism is a machine that maximizes returns on investment; having people only work 15 hours a week doesn’t do that.<p>Also, there’s a hidden assumption in there that child care doesn’t count as “work”. A child needs 16 hours of care and attention every day and no economic system can reduce that.')
