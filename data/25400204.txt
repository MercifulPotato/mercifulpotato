Item(by='wombatmobile', descendants=None, kids=[25400537], score=None, time=1607796737, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25399907, text='&gt; Politics as most people understand it is the process of deciding who ought to run the government<p>That&#x27;s a narrow definition, sometimes known as &quot;party politics&quot;.  And that well might be what PG was referring to.  The limitation of party politics in America, and other places, is that to become an elected representative you need money for advertising, which you have to get from somewhere, e.g. donations.  These usually come with the expectation of a quid pro quo; oil companies want pipelines across the commons and lax pollution laws.  They get these by buying politicians.<p>And so there is a contradiction in a &quot;democracy&quot; like the USA whereby votes are in the hands of the people, but the ability to stand for office is in the hands of the financiers.  It leads to a duplicity, which is possibly why PG describes &quot;politics&quot; as anathema to earnestness.<p>But politics is more than that.  Politics is who gets what, when where and how.  It exists in classrooms and workplaces, and cars full of screaming kids on a hot day.<p>It most certainly exists in the competition to have ideas funded by VC.  So, in fact, PG is a skilful politician.  He just practises his craft outside of party politics.')
