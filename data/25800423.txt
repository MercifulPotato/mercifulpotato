It&#x27;s especially dangerous because it&#x27;s fun to <i>write</i> -- it scratches the &quot;I&#x27;m so clever&quot; itch -- but is a disaster to read, and a disaster to maintain.<p>Aside from just wanting to be creative, the desire to do it usually indicates either a missing core language feature, or a programmer&#x27;s missing knowledge of how to use core features effectively and idiomatically.  Otherwise you&#x27;d use the simple core language feature (the one every developer is guaranteed to know how to use already) to achieve your goal.<p>The other reason it&#x27;s sometimes used is prioritizing terseness over simplicity.  That is, you introduce some meta-programming abstraction that saves you some LOC, but at the cost of abstraction overhead.  Almost always, you&#x27;re better off with the reverse priorities.')
