Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.\n  --Antoine de Saint-Exupéry<p>I&#x27;ve noticed this in my software work.  When I&#x27;m on a project that I&#x27;m personally excited by, I feel like I&#x27;m firing on all cylinders and am vastly more productive.  Driven by COVID fear, I switched jobs over the summer to a company that would allow me to work from home.  I&#x27;m not at all interested in the project I&#x27;m working on.  And I feel like it shows...I don&#x27;t retain things that coworkers have already explained, I don&#x27;t feel a drive to learn more than necessary about the domain, etc.  Maybe some of it is just COVID-brain, but my goodness being interested in your work makes a world of difference.')
