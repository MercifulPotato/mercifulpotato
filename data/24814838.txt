That would certainly be a nice to have thing then, maybe use the current kernel key management stuff so that it could even be done in a way that the process never actually gets to load the key itself but it&#x27;s instead loaded by something else and given the id needed to tell the kernel that the socket should use it.  I do wonder how this would play with SNI and such which might make it a non-starter for a lot of cases.')
