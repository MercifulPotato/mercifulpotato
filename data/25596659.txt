(And some small firms like Infocom.) When Teradyne moved out of Boston in the 90s, it was basically the last real tech company there. (Arthur D. Little in Fresh Pond also survived until dot-bomb.) Kendall Square was Draper Labs&#x2F;Tech Square with a bunch of old brick manufacturing buildings&#x2F;warehouses to the east. The modern Kendall Square is a relatively recent phenomenon.<p>(And even my classmates who went into finance, working at Fidelity or Harvard, still lived in points at least somewhat west.)<p>Pretty much all the tech companies in the Boston area were ones like you mention: DEC, Wang, DG (where I worked), Prime, Apollo, MITRE, Raytheon, etc. And they were pretty much all well west or sometimes north of the city.')
