Item(by='jaaron', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602707009, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24779681, text='Best headset for sitting is a inside-out, tethered VR headset.<p>Until recently, the Oculus Rift S would be a great pick for that.<p>I don&#x27;t yet have an HP Reverb G2, but I expect good things out of that headset. The HTC Cosmos would also be a good choice.<p>The Valve Index (yes, I mistyped before) is an awesome headset, but the lighthouse emitter based tracking system isn&#x27;t great for seated. Not only is it a hassle to setup, but it&#x27;s easier for your chair or monitor or whatever to block the laser grid from the lighthouse units. And if you&#x27;re seated, you aren&#x27;t taking advantage of the highly accurate room-scale tracking the lighthouses provide. I&#x27;d stick with the convenience of an inside-out headset if you&#x27;re primarily doing seated VR.<p>For example, I tended to prefer my Rift S for sim games (sim racing, sim flight) for all the reasons listed above.')
