What would happen I think is failure to boot and your laptop playing a certain sound as a diagnostic message.<p>Either way, you should refrain from making comments like &quot;avoid Linux like a deadly disease&quot;, clearly you&#x27;ve messed up the installation process. You could&#x27;ve just chosen a one-click install linux distribution.<p>If you don&#x27;t know how to make a chair, don&#x27;t try to make yourself one. And if you do don&#x27;t blame the people that gave you the wood. It wasn&#x27;t even sold to you, you grabbed some free wood.')
