As others have mentioned, things like &quot;engagement&quot;, A&#x2F;B testing, percent of users using a feature, etc...<p>This often leads to absurd decision making or false incentives. Things like the GUI shifting around making people click the wrong button by accident will <i>increase</i> engagement metrics and look like a positive thing in the reports.<p>Take Netflix as an example. If you set your UI language to English and live in  Australia, Netflix allows you to choose <i>only</i> five languages:<p>- English for the hearing impaired<p>- Italian<p>- Simplified Chinese<p>- Traditional Chinese<p>- Vietnamese<p>Note that that list is for a show that has alternate audio languages like French and Italian, but you can&#x27;t select all of those languages for subtitles. But here&#x27;s the thing: Netflix has the subtitles in about 100 languages for every show. They just <i>refuse</i> to let you select them.<p>My parents are immigrants and like to listen to shows in English but have subtitles in their native language as a fallback. Netflix says &quot;no&quot;. My partner is an immigrant and she&#x27;s not Italian, Chinese, or Vietnamese. Netflix says her language just doesn&#x27;t matter enough to make the list. I sometimes like subtitles, but I hate the hearing-impared subtitles. I don&#x27;t matter either.<p>What&#x27;s happened is that some overpaid statistician at Netflix figured out the top 5 most common languages for each region, decided that 99% coverage is &quot;good enough&quot;, patted himself on the back, and the 1% can get fucked.<p>That statistician is probably paid 3-5x as much as me, and his job doesn&#x27;t even need to exist. Just show every subtitle language available! Easy! No need to pay some &quot;smarter than you&quot; person to <i>decide what you can and can&#x27;t have</i>.<p>Notes:<p>Apple TV shows every subtitle language, so there can&#x27;t be any arguments saying that this is impossible or difficult or whatever.<p>If you call Netflix support, they will gaslight you and say that this is a copyright issue. It isn&#x27;t, Netflix hides subtitles even for shows they produce themselves.<p>It&#x27;s possible to do some combinations in any region. E.g.: setting the UI language to something other than English will make other subtitle languages show up. Some combinations are impossible though. So if there&#x27;s some random couple like an Italian guy with a Filipino girlfriend, they can&#x27;t do Italian language audio and Tagalog subtitles <i>ever</i>. Netflix has decided that their relationship is statistically unlikely and excluded them as outliers.')
