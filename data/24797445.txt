That&#x27;s why the people crying about the NY Post article said nothing when Twitter was threatening to suspend accounts for hoping Trump would die of COVID. It&#x27;s why they&#x27;re fine when conservative content gets algorithmically boosted but nut when it gets penalized.<p>I&#x27;m happy to have a discussion about what the boundaries of acceptable speech should be. But it always gets cast as a discussion about <i>censorship</i> and <i>freedom of speech</i>, when really the goal is to shift those boundaries to a place they find acceptable.')
