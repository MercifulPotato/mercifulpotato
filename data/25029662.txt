Terrorism and trafficking of children will win the moral high ground.</i><p>Requisite:<p>&gt; <i>The term was coined by Timothy C. May in 1988. May referred to &quot;child pornographers, terrorists, drug dealers, etc.&quot;[2]. May used the phrase to express disdain for what he perceived as &quot;Think of the children&quot; argumentation by government officials and others seeking to justify limiting civilian use of cryptography tools. Connotations related to such argumentation continue to be attached to the phrase, and it is more commonly used by those who wish to deride various restrictions on Internet activity than by those who support such restrictions.</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Four_Horsemen_of_the_Infocalypse" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Four_Horsemen_of_the_Infocalyp...</a>')
