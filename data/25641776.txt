I think it&#x27;s above average for an affiliate marketing site, but I also wonder how reliable the recommendations are if they&#x27;re derived from automated analysis of other systems like reviews, pricing, etc. when we know those are garbage systems that are constantly gamed.  Even filtered, it&#x27;s still garbage in garbage out, right?<p>I think that (affiliate based monetization) is a really, really tough market to be in right now because Google and Bing are absolutely _dominated_ by low effort, garbage affiliate marketing blog spam sites.  There are days where I&#x27;d pay per search if I could filter out sites that have affiliate links on them.<p>The review &#x2F; product discovery market as a whole is a disaster right now.  The last good review site (IMO) was JonnyGURU and there hasn&#x27;t been a new PSU review there since early 2019 (since Corsair hired him?).  The thing that made that site great was that shitty products got shitty scores.  It&#x27;s not like the affiliate marketing reviewers nowadays where everything is 9.5 stars with the primary goal of getting you to buy _anything_ they can slap an affiliate link on.
