You are one of the very few exceptions - just as there are surely exceptional people who can do financial transactions that avoid Visa&#x2F;MC.<p>Society is not math or computer science where existence of one counterexample makes things invalid. Society is a thing of ratios and percentages. If something is almost impossible for most people, we have to treat it as impossible even though it is possible for some - otherwise bad actors get away with terrible stuff on technicalities.<p>(I for example pay everything with cash or wires which are free and instantaneous in my country - I use card only once in a while to withdraw cash - but it does not invalidate Visa&#x2F;MC duopoly any more than your special Android that only one in ten thousand people can use either)')
