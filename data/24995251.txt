Item(by='Wowfunhappy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604544718, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24995147, text='&gt; Last thing we want is for other companies like GitHub to think, &quot;wow Apple was right, maximum engineering secrecy by default is the way to go.&quot;<p>Well, &quot;maximum engineering secrecy&quot; would be <i>not</i> releasing the source code to XNU. Apple is very secretive overall, to be sure, but not in this one respect.<p>I&#x27;m glad that XNU&#x27;s source code is availableâ€”it lets you do a number of neat things. I wish <i>more</i> was available, but I&#x27;ll take what we can get.<p>By extension, I don&#x27;t support the idea that there&#x27;s no point in releasing source code if you can&#x27;t also release documentation and review outside pull requests. Making a tool available to the public is always better than hoarding information. All the other stuff is even better, but code is code.<p>---<p>All of that said, I recognize that for Github <i>specifically</i>, releasing code and not engaging with it might be a bad look, because their product is a code sharing platform. I don&#x27;t think that applies to most companies, though.')
