Item(by='Blikkentrekker', descendants=None, kids=[25455025, 25456491], score=None, time=1608207256, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25453909, text='Section 31 has been completely modified throughout the years in <i>Star Trek</i>.<p>When it was first introduced in <i>Deep Space Nine</i>, it was an extremist rogue branch of Starfleet. It did not officially exist; was technically illegal; and many members of Starfleet attempted to capture it&#x27;s members â€” but it was nevertheless protected by various powerful figures in the U.F.P. who felt it&#x27;s continued existence was necessary.<p><i>Enterprise</i> changed nothing about this and indeed Archer had never heard of it&#x27;s existence and Section 31 sabotaged his ship and Reed was court-martialed for being a member.<p>Then in <i>Into Darkness</i>, it became a secret branch of Starfleet that was nevertheless completely legal, but most officers were not aware of it&#x27;s existence.<p>And finally in <i>Discovery</i>, it was a known, fully legal branch. That <i>Discovery</i> also took place before <i>D.S.9.</i> made it all the more bizarre that most Starfleet officers in <i>D.S.9.</i> had never heard of the existence of an organization  which was publicly known a century prior.')
