Python trades that away so I have to write tests for the entire surface area - inside and out - of my code.<p>If there is something fundamentally wrong with my code, tell me now, not when it&#x27;s half way through a job or worse attached to spending money.<p>You can write bad code in any language, but bad languages influence the way you think about programming. For example, C++ encourages you to think about side-effects in the language like SFINAE, D encourages you to metaprogram everything, Rust encourages you to think like a compiler (lifetimes), Haskell teaches you how to manage stateful code in a controlled and measured manner, etc. etc.<p>In conclusion, Python is not a terrible place to start (JS takes that award to my eye), but the progression to writing genuinely reliable and fast code is too obfuscated. I&#x27;d rather we teach people C. C requires a helping hand, you can fumble around with Python.')
