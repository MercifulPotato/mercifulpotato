Item(by='Fnoord', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605000927, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25041601, text='New York Pizza in The Netherlands has a great vegan shoarma pizza containing shoarma by De Vegetarische Slager (&quot;The Vegetarian Butcher&quot;?), nowadays an Unilever subsidiary. It contains caramelized onions, vegan cheese, a garlic swirl, and tomato sauce. The shoarma contains the correct spices, and is salty. Crust is crunchy enough. Highly recommended.<p>There&#x27;s also research into meat grown from stem cells. Right now it is still too expensive to grow, but I believe that is the way forward.')
