Item(by='moron4hire', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609690275, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25622361, text='There was this NES game called &quot;The Magic of Scheherazade&quot; that had what at first looked like a very complex password system, but even as a kid, I was able to figure out how to exploit it to cheat at the game, giving me lots of money or start at higher levels, as it wasn&#x27;t actually hashed very well.<p>The game itself is kind of obscure and looks like it&#x27;s a cheap ripoff of Legend of Zelda (there are several scenes that are actually blatant rips), but it&#x27;s got a lot of depth and is a lot of fun, even today. There&#x27;s both over-world-action- and turn-based combat, and a whole time travel component.<p>IIRC, the password system was so bad that you could create game-puzzle-breaking states with it, to where you were in certain levels without items that you needed to progress.')
