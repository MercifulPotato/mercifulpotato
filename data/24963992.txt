You asked why things are as they are, I say it&#x27;s because we implemented rules governing how we drive and walk on roads to create predictability and therefore safety.  Don&#x27;t like that cars seem to have more free reign?  Change the road design, change the rules.  But there are good reasons we have the system we have now.')
