I&#x27;m not sure how you can claim that what is effectually a simple plaintext list of things can be copyrighted. What original content there is being put under copyright?<p>As you already stated, they do not alter the music itself in the way that a rearrangement would, most media players provide fade-in&#x2F;out functionality so they cannot claim that is unique, and they do not provide any supplimentary content to enhance the experience, at least not in the same way that a book published list, or internet top ten list would ordinarily provide some kind of commentary on the items.<p>What you&#x27;re claiming here is effectually that, not even the content, but the <i>mere titles</i> of every single &quot;top 50 foos&quot; list on the internet can be copyrighted.
