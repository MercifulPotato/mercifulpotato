Presently, it supports Taleb&#x27;s argument presented under the heading, &quot;Correlation only for low IQ.&quot;<p>The example shows that an employer gains a significant improvement (450%) in avoiding candidates two sigma below the mean, with only a minor improvement (16%) in obtaining candidates above the mean. A better example (if it exists) would show a very strong improvement in finding candidates at least one sigma above the mean.')
