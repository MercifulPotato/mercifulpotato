To write a book, all you have you do is &quot;write&quot; a book is find the correct one, already sitting on the shelf.<p>If you consider that basically any opinion on a subject is recorded somewhere on YouTube, then YouTube doesn&#x27;t have to &quot;write&quot; a thing. If they wanted to make a statement, all they have to do is sort the right thing to the top.<p>I personally agree with section 230, but there&#x27;s a fine line between curation and moderation, and it&#x27;s difficult to square with the scale of the internet. There are approximately 500 hours of video uploaded every minute on YouTube. That&#x27;s 30,000 every hour, or 720,000 hours every day. No matter how infinite YouTube&#x27;s resources might be, there is simply no way to human moderate all of it.<p>Do I think YouTube is toe-ing the line between moderation and curation effectively? Honestly, no. For myself, maybe, but not for the internet as a whole. But I don&#x27;t think removing section 230 is the way to fix it.')
