Whether or not you think these actions were politically motivated or made in good faith, it just poured <i>liquid oxygen</i> on the &quot;reform section 230&quot; fire you&#x27;re seeing from both sides of the aisle - one using the censorship reason, the other using the disinformation reason.<p>There&#x27;s no way you don&#x27;t block a newspaper, <i>and</i> the press secretary, <i>and</i> prevent anyone from even private messaging the link to each other, <i>and</i> blocking people who share screenshots, and not invite serious scrutiny or action.<p>The legislative blowback is going to suck. Section 230 is an ordinary law, not a constitutional right or based on one, and that means it&#x27;s exposed to all the usual political fighting.')
