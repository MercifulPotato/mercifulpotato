The reason this works as a &#x27;side hustle&#x27; is because it&#x27;s only lucrative if you ascribe a very low value to your time (and your car mileage, and the stress of doing admin for your &#x27;business&#x27;).<p>The fact the big players don&#x27;t bother, the number of &#x27;entrepreneurs&#x27; doing this in their spare time, the fact that they repair, move and restock the machines themselves, the calculations which ignore the presumably high risk of vandalism or theft, the presence of a landlord who can charge you as much as they like.
