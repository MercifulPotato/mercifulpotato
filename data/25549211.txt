They&#x27;re obviously making a lot of money, but most companies in their position do a lot of work to court developers and accessory makers etc. Apple&#x27;s position is essentially that they control the market so you need them more than they need you.<p>But that makes others resent them. Which is a vulnerability because it means you have all the rest of the industry ready to sell Apple down the river the first chance they get, whether it&#x27;s in making antitrust claims or lobbying against them or just fervently supporting any half viable competitor in the hopes that it becomes fully viable.')
