There are also not enough hours in the day to say everything worth saying about every topic on every forum on the Internet.<p>But you took time out of your busy day to comment on this thread, out of all the threads on the Internet, about this problem, out of all the problems in the world. You even came back and replied to me.<p>I am not suggesting you spend every waking moment of your life trying to solve every problem in the world. I <i>am</i> suggesting you divert a portion of the time that you&#x27;re currently spending on advising people on how to live in this world, and instead spend just a little of it on thinking about how to build a better one.<p><i>while the strategy B is about just doing what you like do and hoping that it will somehow bring the desired outcome</i><p>Really? The only other option besides accepting the world as it is, is to do what you like and hope that the world changes to your liking, entirely on its own? You can&#x27;t think of any other options?')
