You might be surprised at how many people follow you.<p>Everyone at a former startup I was also an employee at rejected working with me lol.<p>But yes, new people did follow my journeys after a lot of my &quot;thought leadership&quot; shitposting on Quora, Twitter, ghostwriting on Forbes... the usual &quot;organic&quot; stuff. It is still funny how that was written in the article, compared to the expressions on my former co-workers faces as they quickly tried to nicely reject me as if I had just grown two heads.
