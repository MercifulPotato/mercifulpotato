A great place for this is Lichess[0], where you are presented with situations from real games played on the platform, and you are trying to find the best series of moves for one side, playing against the computer. Those puzzles have difficulty ratings based on the ratings of players who have been able to solve them or not, and your rating goes up or down depending on if you solve it successfully. It&#x27;s also great because there&#x27;s no time commitment or pressure with the puzzles. You can jump in or out at any time.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lichess.org&#x2F;training&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lichess.org&#x2F;training&#x2F;</a>')
