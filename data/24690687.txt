Because it&#x27;s right there, infinitely adaptable to any change in workflow you may need to make. No need to send official requests through half a dozen layers of management to get the IT people to maybe, in half a year, add a column to the database. No need to involve 20 people for a year to create new software for a new workflow. You just agree with your co-workers on a change, swap a column, add some color, File-&gt;Save, done. It wins because it puts power in the hands of the people doing the work.')
