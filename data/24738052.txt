Item(by='squarefoot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602327048, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24734381, text='Thanks, I&#x27;m currently testing Minitube (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flavio.tordini.org&#x2F;minitube&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flavio.tordini.org&#x2F;minitube&#x2F;</a>) which uses the MPV library and seems not to have some problems experienced with MPV (permissions, unrecognized format, etc).  Still have to test it on the RPi though, so I have no idea how fast will do compared to the browser, but at least the crash problems would be solved. I&#x27;m afraid it won&#x27;t last long, however: Google is locking access to more and more resources behind signup walls, which is a turn off for many people, including myself. Hopefully content creators will move elsewhere.')
