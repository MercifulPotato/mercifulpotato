His point is basically:<p>&quot;If some is already verbally abusing you, its fine to resort to light violence if nothing else works&quot;.<p>Its actually a point that i disagree personally, because i would just go away. But if you cant understand that verbal abuse can be far far worse than physical, you are probably the one that needs a sensitivity training more than me.. Or you just need to live life a little more until you meet some really narcisisstic and abusive partner (whichever his gender) which will harass you and make you seriously consider violence.')
