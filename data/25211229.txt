I could really use some help from contributors to make this new approach to building web apps even better. It&#x27;s not meant to replace other stacks, but to complement them as an easy-to-learn, quick-to-build-with alternative.<p>Large parts of its infrastructure were inspired by some excellent critiques of SPAs from this very message board:<p>- It&#x27;s a server-rendered framework (doesn&#x27;t need front-end JS at all if a user is viewing a page they can&#x27;t edit)<p>- It uses plain HTML, CSS, and JS to build out functionality (no transpilers and only the simple Handlebars.js templating language). You don&#x27;t need a million tools to get started.<p>- It uses a file-based JSON datastore so it&#x27;s easier for devs to use and manipulate data<p>- It uses file-based routing, so there&#x27;s no complex hierarchy of pages and a standard structure to URL params<p>- It feels like, to me, the gold standard of web development: using a single templating and behavior-rich language on the front-end, and a simple JSON file for each user that&#x27;s synced to and loaded automatically on the backend<p>I&#x27;ve been building it and documenting it [1] mostly on my own, although I&#x27;ve gotten a few other devs to help me along the way. I really think it could be a great framework for beginners as well as experienced developers who want to release small side projects quickly.<p>I&#x27;ve built several example apps with it so far and they&#x27;re pretty powerful. I&#x27;d love to know what the HN audience thinks though.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;remaketheweb.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;remaketheweb.com&#x2F;</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.remaketheweb.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.remaketheweb.com&#x2F;</a>')
