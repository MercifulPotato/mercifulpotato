It&#x27;s just a matter of time. It can happen now, it can happen next week, next month, next year, in the next 10 years, next 100 years, next 1000 years, next million years. They say that they know it will be in 5 years or 10 years or some made up number. But no, it&#x27;s not possible to say for sure. It could very well be tomorrow.<p>There is absolutely no way to control climate in any meaningful way by doing or not doing something as humans. Even if we did manage to identify the right variables and control it a few times does not mean we&#x27;ll be able to do it every time.<p>Environmental change will most likely wipe off our species too, just like it has done to countless other species in the past couple of billion years.<p>Having said that, we as humans have managed to survive some big environmental changes, like the last ice age when several other species perished. Not all of us will survive but enough of us will.<p>So, what are some of the climate catastrophes we need to protect ourselves against and are we doing enough to prepare for that?<p>One big problem today is that most humans don&#x27;t have access to energy to heat or cool their habitats artificially if the planet warms up or cools down significantly. In developed nations, this is taken for granted but poorer countries lack the infrastructure for it.<p>Solar, wind and hydro are unreliable if say some climate catastrophe causes sun to be blocked (say because of volcanic clouds or asteroid impact or something similar) and there is no heat or light from the sun. The only good sources are fossil fuels and nuclear. Do we have infrastructure for it spread out around the world so that no matter what part of the earth the asteroid impacts, as long as it doesn&#x27;t wipe off everything all at once, we can rise again?<p>What other problems might we face climate-wise? And assuming it happens, are we prepared such that enough of us will survive?<p>No, we&#x27;re not thinking about any of that shit because the entire fucking world is hung up on &quot;Global Warming&quot; and &quot;Climate Change&quot;, the PR material that CleanTech Industry in the U.S. fabricated to get tax breaks on their investments when they thought that the world was running out of oil... and moved the production to China... except China stole the technology and built upon it... while the U.S. found and perfected fracking... and now China is using the same PR infrastructure to promote selling solar fucking panels and wind turbines... while using their pawns in politics to try to stop fracking and natural gas projects in the U.S. because it hurts Chinese energy business.<p>Get a grip.<p>Get a job in the industry. They need technologists in energy industry too.<p>Read a book or two and widen your view of the subject.<p>How about &quot;The Absent Superpower: The Shale Revolution and a World Without America&quot; by Peter Zeihan?<p>Or just to see another side of it, how about &quot;The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels&quot; by Alex Epstein?<p>Anything but repeating this PR nonsense over and over again.')
