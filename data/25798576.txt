The web-server libraries are still evolving, and I too would love to see a few crates designed for handling auth.<p>A lot of the issues with difficulty writing&#x2F;safe practice will just improve once there&#x27;s more examples&#x2F;books&#x2F;tutorials. It takes a little for this stuff to catch up.<p>Finally I really struggle to see the point about dataloaders - they may be a little confronting initially but its the same thing you often have to do in Nodejs. There&#x27;s public examples on Github of how to use them with both Juniper and Async-Graphql.<p>I can understand a lot of this as &quot;its just not there yet&quot;. Rust has a much smaller community than Golang&#x2F;Python&#x2F;Js, I think its understandable if its taking a little longer to have equivalents in tooling etc. I still enjoy writing it')
