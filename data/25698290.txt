I would have been on the fence between Bush and Biden and I feel nothing in common with domestic terrorists who would invade the Capitol and attempt to destroy our democracy.<p>The mainstream media refuses to take seriously issues raised by libertarians&#x2F;paleoconservatives like getting rid of qualified immunity. I don’t see Cato Institute people trying to stage a coup.<p>The mainstream media compared Bernie’s victories to Hitler’s conquest of Germany and said on live TV that they worried if he won there’d be executions in Central Park. Bernie Sanders didn’t incite a riot and then call the rioters “good, special people.”<p>This is such a bizarre false equivalence, like claiming I should weigh equally the opinion of my doctor and a patient at an insane asylum.')
