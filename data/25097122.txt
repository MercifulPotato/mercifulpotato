Even a straightforward Arduino-based environment [0] is usually enough to get started and begin poking around to see what else is possible!<p>For myself, after getting something simple like the above working, it was a gateway to much more experimentation of further possibilities, and ultimately I ended up making an interactive shell [1][2] with some built-in utilities and text games I also wrote that runs on a variety of AVR microcontrollers (those very same Arduino boards I had when starting out).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arduino.cc&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arduino.cc&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.atmel.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;avrsysh-systemshell-some-built-utilities-and-some-games" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.atmel.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;avrsysh-systemshell-som...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ls4096&#x2F;avrsysh" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ls4096&#x2F;avrsysh</a>')
