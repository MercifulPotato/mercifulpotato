You won&#x27;t get hunted down for saying &quot;rich people are bad and should die&quot;, but if you start spewing facts with names and pointing fingers (&quot;CIA is a terrorist organization, and this is why&quot;), or e.g. in Greece you say &quot;Marinakis is a drug dealer&quot; publicly, you should start worrying for yourself.')
