Day traders are people who trade on extremely short term basis (ie within the Day) often by doing chart analysis or breaking news. Her parents are buying good companies on hype during a bull market. It&#x27;s definitely risky but its not the same as day trading or option trading for that matter. They are likely up quite a lot if they had the foresight to buy in when the market fell. They just need the foresight to get out before a correction happens. And its only 15-20% of their assets. Doesn&#x27;t sound like the worst strategy to me.')
