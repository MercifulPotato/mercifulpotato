It just so happened that steel production seemed to be the industry that prioritizing would allow for the most future growth.<p>In a way, this was true for the USSR - the Red Army in WW2 was incredibly well equipped in numbers, which would have been impossible if they had not focused on so hard in steel production.<p>But in theory, if one could get such a system going, and if it could be implemented in a verifiable way, then there would be no way for the government to justify prioritizing one industry over the other. Indeed, how could you argue that you make a better job than the algorithm? If the government decided to incentivize further productive growth, that should be done via a hyperparameter.<p>I think the major politicking issue would be getting the politicians to willingly give up their power to this system, which indeed would be a huge problem.')
