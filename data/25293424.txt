It didn&#x27;t take long for Android to discover touch screens once Apple made it clear that they were dramatically better. Similarly, it&#x27;s not like other ARM chip manufacturers are going to have to go through all of the same R&amp;D expense to figure out how to make chips that are comparably fast--they just need to copy what Apple did without infringing on any particular patents. Even if they did have to spend the same R&amp;D expense to get there, <i>Apple has already derisked it</i>. So they have a small fraction of Apple&#x27;s expense and none of the risk, so I would fully expect to see M1 competitive chips come out in a few years&#x27; time. This isn&#x27;t to say that they&#x27;ll catch up with Apple completely; only that they&#x27;ll be able to recoup a significant amount of the gap in a relatively short period of time such that there will be a similar breakthrough in the PC market (this is effectively what TFA is predicting as well, if that lends me any credibility).')
