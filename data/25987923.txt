It’s an iOS app where every day, users receive a new writing prompt to spark their imagination and to get them writing. You can share your writing with the community, and give each other feedback.<p>Fast forward 2 years from this being a side project - it now has over 20k overs and I quit my job a few months ago to work on it full time. Apple featured it as App Of The Day in the UK last year which was a nice point of validation.<p>Not going to lie, when SwiftUI was brought out I got really excited and jumped into using it right away. Big mistake and headaches, although now it has grown up a lot and there’s a lot fewer bugs and seemingly random behaviour!<p>Backend wise, I’m using the Firebase platform. Specifically, Auth, Firestore, Functions (written in Javascript), Storage,  Crashlytics, Remote Config, Analytics, and A&#x2F;B testing. For a ‘newbie’ like me it has been a godsend and the pricing so far has worked out really well. Revenue last month was over $2k and Firebase costs were around $3.00<p>The apps free to use, so feel free to check it out. I’d love to hear your thoughts.')
