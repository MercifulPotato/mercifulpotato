But with alerts and shelter (a strong room or cellar ideally), eminantly survivable.  Unlike erathquakes or hurricanes, damage isn&#x27;t even especially widespread.  A few hundred metres, at worst a kilometer outside the track, life goes  own, modulo power outages and hail damage.<p>Floods, hurricanes, rising seawater, and wildfire are far more addressable risks.  Arguably drought, heat, and disease as well.')
