Neither a proprietary company like Adobe, nor an open-source initiative.<p>Because - the flash monopoly is basically &quot;there for the taking&quot;.  The market&#x27;s demonstrated a huge amount of interest.  There&#x27;s a runtime that can do it (the modern web).   All that&#x27;s left is we just need someone to build an authoring tool, and they&#x27;ll instantly win over that huge group of users who&#x27;ve <i>been demonstrated to exist</i> (not just legacy users, but tons of new folks with a similar mindset).  Building an authoring tool of course is incredibly difficult, but - given the potential payoff, you&#x27;d really think someone like adobe would be all over that, if only out of fear of being disrupted.<p>I&#x27;m just really surprised nobody&#x27;s done it.  I expected it 5 years ago.  Hell, I&#x27;m even surprised how sluggish flash emulators have been to show up - we&#x27;re finally getting what I think is the &quot;right one&quot; in the form of Ruffle ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ruffle.rs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ruffle.rs&#x2F;</a> ), but I&#x27;m surprised the older Shumway project didn&#x27;t take off.   Then again, maybe we simply had to wait, because I don&#x27;t think anything prior to WebASM would have really been appropriate for the job.<p>I think the best case scenario would be some sort of &quot;commercial open-source project&quot;, like how Krita structures themselves, taking up the mantle of being a flash-like authoring tool.')
