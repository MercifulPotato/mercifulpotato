However, this is not a vulnerability in the browser, but in that website. Am I missing something? Was Chromodo breaking the `messageEvent.origin` property, breaking same-origin checks in JavaScript? Seems far-fetched.</i><p>I believe it&#x27;s neither of these - I think the claim being made is that Chromodo installs a custom event <i>listener</i> for MessageEvents in all websites, which exposes a handful of APIs, including &quot;execCode&quot; and &quot;callOuterFunction&quot;. If you look at the sample exploit (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.chromium.org&#x2F;p&#x2F;project-zero&#x2F;issues&#x2F;attachmentText?aid=225988" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.chromium.org&#x2F;p&#x2F;project-zero&#x2F;issues&#x2F;attachmentTe...</a>), while it defaults to ssl.comodo.com, you can specify an arbitrary website.<p>(Also, if this were indeed a website bug, this would have been reproducible in normal browsers.)<p>We would need to find a vulnerable version of the Chromodo browser to confirm this.')
