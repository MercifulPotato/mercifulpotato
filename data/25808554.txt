It&#x27;s been frustrating in the years since to program on less powerful foundations.<p>If I were building a system that combined interactive and autonomous processes, I would absolutely reach for Akka again. The one thing I&#x27;d love to see is if they could build something like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;temporal.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;temporal.io</a> on top of Akka. I think it would be complementary to the state machine style model of typed actors and the pipeline model of Akka Streams.')
