There has been a ton of outright mis-information about my country and how it handled the coronavirus so I don&#x27;t blame anyone for not knowing. The poor journalism that has been conducted is to blame and the resulting mis-information.<p>Misinformation 1: Swedens healthcare system did not collapse on itself. Fact: In the region where most people got sick (Stockholm) the military was called in to set up an emergency hospital. This was never used because the hospitals in Stockholm managed without it.<p>Misinformation 2: Sweden imposed no lock-down. While technically-kinda correct that we did not lock people in their homes, quite quickly it became illegal with public events of 50 or more people. (mid-late March I think).<p>Misinformation 3: Sweden &quot;remained largely the same after the virus&quot;. Goodness sake, no. Anyone that claims this hasn&#x27;t talked to a single swede.<p>Misinformation 4: Swedens strategy was to achieve herd immunity. No. In spring this question was asked at almost every press conference with FHM (ministry of public health). The strategy from the beginning was to preserve the overall health of Swedes as good as possible. During the open questions with FHM they have repeatedly brought up and said that the goal was not to achieve herd immunity. This stuff is complex and poor journalists don&#x27;t like complex answers. As far as I remember, the reason for this &quot;milder&quot; strategy focused on spreading accurate and correct information about the virus was because FHM (correctly) predicted that we would have to live with the virus for a very long time. They decided that the best way to protect people over a period of possibly several years was by arming them with \n information on how to protect themselves and others (social distance, wash your hands, work from home if you can).<p>The real issues that caused Sweden to have such high rates of death compared to similar countries like Denmark and Norway are more complex and has to do with lack of information for those caring for the elderly, poor equipment (and especially reserves with unusable equipment), and other systemic failures when it comes to elderly care.<p>Those in care homes were especially vulnerable because they are both older and come into contect with a lot of people. I believe the Swedish healthcare system failed to protect these people, and that is a major contributor to the high death toll.')
