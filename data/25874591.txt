Item(by='drewzero1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611340635, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25874217, text='Often in US cities with otherwise unrestricted street parking, there is a time limit&#x2F;number of days before a vehicle is considered &quot;abandoned&quot; and ticketed or towed. So even if you don&#x27;t need to drive your car, you need to move it periodically (partially to demonstrate that the vehicle is operational).<p>In my city street parking is free but time restricted. Downtown streets have 2 or 4 hour parking limits, and street parking is not allowed between 2AM and 5AM. I like not having to worry about meters but it&#x27;s always a pain to wake up in the middle of the night and remember I forgot to put my car in the driveway.')
