They also want things that just work in connecting them (preferably for “free”) to whatever content or people they’re interested in. On the latter, I think the economies of scale are always tilted to favor those who have scaled and can scale (unless the ones with scale become very greedy and&#x2F;or ignore the competition).<p>It takes ideals <i>and</i> money to support products that are better in protecting some rights we consider important. That excludes a whole lot of people from choosing.')
