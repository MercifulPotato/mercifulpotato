They don&#x27;t want to admit that strange possibly powered objects (but also possibly not) are being detected and witnessed in the sky that they can&#x27;t identify, track, or engage. It means that either the government does not control our skies or that they&#x27;re detecting a bunch of illusions and false positives and their equipment is wonky.<p>They&#x27;d much rather people believe conspiracy theories about the government having secret alien crash wreckage, etc., because that makes the government look like they&#x27;re in full control of everything.')
