Lots of tickets for things that involve almost no work and things that actually make a difference to the customer&#x2F;product are not equal.<p>Everything I work on is new products&#x2F;projects and tickets come in all sizes and shapes, and often change daily as some exec crams in more new ideas or some designer or product person &quot;clarifies&quot; the ticket, even after the work is done. Tickets are often written and estimated long before decisions are actually made. Defects are written that require a lot of investigation only to discover it&#x27;s some other teams problem and you can&#x27;t do anything or turns out to be a temporary service outage no one communicated or misconfiguration in some CMS or even plain simply not understanding what the product does.<p>Measuring productivity by tickets closed is a whole pile of dead snakes.')
