Glad to see a few of you have tried it and enjoyed it. Any questions, just let me know below and I&#x27;ll do my best to answer.<p>Just to answer some of the stuff below:<p>Yes, you could write something faster and smaller in C. However chances are you&#x27;d spend a lot more time doing it, eg. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;classycodeoss&#x2F;nrf52-ibeacon&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;main.c" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;classycodeoss&#x2F;nrf52-ibeacon&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;m...</a> vs <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.espruino.com&#x2F;iBeacon" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.espruino.com&#x2F;iBeacon</a><p>Most battery powered devices spend most of their time asleep. If your device spends 1ms awake every minute instead of 0.01ms then honestly in most cases that&#x27;s not a big deal, because the power consumption of everything else in the system is 100x that.<p>Low.js&#x2F;Moddable&#x2F;Jerryscript&#x2F;etc are bigger, faster more complete JS engines that provide a more Node.js-style experience, but generally for more powerful devices. With Espruino we&#x27;re saying if you&#x27;re willing to make a few small tweaks to the way you write code then you can use amazingly low power devices: 0.003mA sleep for nRF52 vs. 80-500mA for Raspberry Pi or 0.8mA for ESP32 (with RAM retention)')
