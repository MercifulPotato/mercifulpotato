I get into serious browsing&#x2F;searching&#x2F;etc. and I usually just end up grabbing a laptop. I <i>can</i> do it on my tablet but it just seems like too much work. Of course, that may reflect habits and if I were to only have a tablet I&#x27;m sure I could make it work. My dad certainly has no trouble ordering from Amazon all the time just using his phone.')
