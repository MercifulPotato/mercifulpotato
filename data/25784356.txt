This ends up creating a bass heavy sound.<p>I would argue that over the past decade, most humans have been exposed to this kind of processing&#x2F;compression and our &quot;tastes&quot; reflect our overwhelming exposure to this sound. Just look at how headphones are marketed these days, or any sound system for that matter. &quot;How much bass can I get? Will it knock my socks off?&quot;<p>The second portion of the video clearly has much for detail and clarity in the higher frequencies, and as a result, can sound a bit &quot;tinnier&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t come across to me as quality at which I&#x27;d love to listen to music, but it certainly helps convey the nuances of the harmonies in the piano much, much better.')
