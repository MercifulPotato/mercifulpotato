My claim was only that it&#x27;s impossible to have your employees NOT hate you if you are the richest man in the world and they&#x27;re doing blue collar labor for you. If you create only jobs where people are earning six figures in front of a desk and living comfortable lives, they might envy but don&#x27;t begrudge you $100 billion. But if you&#x27;re asking someone to do tough physical labor for $15 or $20 an hour while you make a billion dollars a day or whatever, no way they won&#x27;t try to knock you off that pedestal.')
