Eg when I used it last, the PHP version it shipped with was 8 years old.<p>Now, I understand the appeal of that to certain super risk averse enterprises who value stability over any kind of developer or user happiness (including the ability to run latests versions of userland software that happens to require somewhat recent php&#x2F;python&#x2F;etc versions). But aren&#x27;t those exactly the kinds of enterprises that would want normal RHEL licenses anyway? If you scratch those out, what audience is left? Why would I run such ancient software for any technical reason?<p>I know this sounds dismissive, but I don&#x27;t know how else to formulate this and I&#x27;d like to understand this. I think I understand RHEL and I think I understand Fedora, but I never got the appeal of CentOS.')
