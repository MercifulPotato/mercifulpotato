This is difficult for me to believe. The original article’s stressed multiple times its use of random assignment and described the design as a &quot;true experiment.”<p>&gt; They also had perfectly equal samples per condition (&quot;n = 1,524 students watched a &#x27;violent&#x27; cartoon and n = 1,524 students watched a &#x27;nonviolent&#x27; cartoon.&quot;) which is exceedingly unlikely to happen without random assignment.<p>This actually cannot happen <i>with</i> random assignment either. The only way you&#x27;re going to get equal numbers in each bin is if your process is intentionally constrained to do that. If assignment were random, the odds of assigning 1,524 to one bin and 1,524 to the other bin would be C(3048, 1524) &#x2F; 2^3048, or 1.4%.')
