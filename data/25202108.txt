Have you used concepts at all yet? Rust&#x27;s generics are similar to, but different than, C++ templates generally; concepts is the closest thing C++ has to them. That being said, even when you understand them, you <i>can</i> create some monstrosities, just like C++.<p>To connect it back to your original questions, Rust relies heavily on generics because if you want runtime performance, but you also want safety, you pretty much need ways to evaluate safety at compile time, rather than runtime, so you don&#x27;t have the overhead of runtime checks. This basically implies generics need to exist and be used heavily.')
