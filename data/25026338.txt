It would be nice if there was a way to make this &quot;just work&quot;. steam-run feels very hacky and I am loathe to use it in production, though I admit I&#x27;ve used it a lot.<p>Rewriting the library paths for a given binary also works but is cumbersome.<p>Ideally there would be a few extra tools in Nix to say &quot;adopt this binary&quot; in a similar way we can install things into our environment permanently, and to transform a binary to look for dependencies in the right places.')
