Desktop UIs are dense, they&#x27;re your tools to get your job done as efficiently as possible. You can position the mouse pointer quickly and with great precision, so there is no need for ample spacing between the controls.<p>It&#x27;s okay when a professional tool has some learning curve to it, but after you&#x27;re past that, it&#x27;s a joy to use.<p>And no, desktop UI design shouldn&#x27;t be informed by phones and tablets. When designing a desktop UI, you should pretend touchscreens were never invented.<p>That being said, I do know one person who has a Windows laptop with a touchscreen and does occasionally tap or scroll something on it. Myself, as someone who has never owned one of these, I maintain this clear separation between mobile and desktop in my head and have never had the thought of touching my laptop screen except to clean it.')
