I went to a pick and pull junkyard with a friend a decade ago to help him find some parts for his car. Well, it was slow that day and a huge back field and we happen to have a crowbar. We wanted to shatter a window for early 20s guy mentality reasons. I swung at it one handed and the crowbar bounced right off. Both of us were confused as hell. It takes a good effort, two handed batter swing to break those windows or put in a lot of effort one handed and make sure the hook end makes contact, not the backside. That scene from 2 fast 2 furious where he uses his elbow to break a window... I have to call bullshit unless certain cars truly have really weak windows. We broke 4 different windows in cheap USA consumer vehicles, all of which put up a good fight against crowbar.')
