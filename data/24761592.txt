And further &quot;it is so so cheap that you can still make these dumb mistakes and it&#x27;s still worth hosting the files yourself!&quot;<p>It&#x27;s like saying should I use a dry cleaner? Well it&#x27;s only $50 to get them to iron my shirts, so it&#x27;s worth it for my time saved. Then someone says &quot;$50! You are being ripped off, if your &quot;doing it right&quot;, you&#x27;d get it done for $10&quot;, to which I say, well if it&#x27;s worth me paying $50, then it is worth me paying $10, so my original argument &quot;use a dry cleaner&quot; is made stronger.')
