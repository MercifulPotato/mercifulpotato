We&#x27;ve part of an accelerator with the Energy Systems Catapult and we&#x27;re backed by the UK government.<p>20% of CO2 emissions come from domestic property and &gt;Â£65b will need to be spent upgrading properties to meet the UK&#x27;s Net Zero targets. The government have multiple financial incentives available, but we&#x27;ve got a data problem: people don&#x27;t know which upgrades to make, they don&#x27;t know how to access finance, and they don&#x27;t know how to find trusted tradespeople.<p>We help homeowners collect property data and combine it with our own data to create an accurate energy loss model. We identify the best retrofit solutions for their home and help them through the upgrade process.<p>We&#x27;re looking to work with creative software engineers who care about the environment, want to make a difference, and are happy working independently.<p>We have two rolls to fill:<p>- Elixir + Phoenix Liveview (full-stack)<p>- Unreal Engine or Unity<p>For more info and to apply: hn-hiring@ambue.com')
