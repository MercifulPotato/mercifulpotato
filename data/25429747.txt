Our psychomotor states instantiate the abstraction which are drawn from them (or else, why abstract?).<p>eg., there is a level of abstraction at which an ape &quot;alerting&quot; another ape is the same as an chemical &quot;alerting&quot; a cell<p>My point is that these things are only equivalent to these abstractions in a very narrow kind of activity (cognition).<p>A concept in the brain-body of an ape is a means for coordinating itself with respect to its environment: coordinating its eye, its hand, and latterly, its mind (, emotions, thought patterns, etc.). (NB. political correctness is here just a regulation on how we socially coordinate).<p>That&#x27;s just what we use concepts <i>for</i>.<p>They also play a purely cognitive role in the sense that &quot;circle&quot; is both a guide to the motion of my hand in drawing a circle, and also a &quot;Form&quot; to which cognition can be purely and abstractly directed (ie., a shape with various properties...).<p>But this cognitive role is derivative of their non-cognitive origins in, quite literally, structuring the meat of our bodies. It is this structuring process which is how we &quot;conceptualise&quot; the world.<p>A dog is replete with many concepts; it is the dumb cognitive illusion of apes lacking self-awareness to think their linguistic cognition is where &quot;concepts&quot; lie. This is a cognitive shadow of how every animal navigates its environment.<p>Your &quot;AGI&quot; remark indicates to me that you may take this cognitive view. I think this is the consequence of a mathematical discipline (computer science) being &quot;let into the room&quot; -- it should be thrown back out.<p>Mathematics hasn&#x27;t much to say about intelligence. The dumb walnut we call a frontal lobe possesses no models of how it actually works, and only the shadow of concepts it calls &quot;abstractions&quot;. It is a delusional Cartesian place with little to offer self-understanding.<p>Everything important for the development of intelligence, etc. will come from the non-cognitive (, bodily) aspects of mental function which will require building animals. Cognitive ai systems cannot conceptualise, they only automate the walnut.')
