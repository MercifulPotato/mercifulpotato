(Prusa Mk3s for example) While not beautiful, PLA prints are pretty darn smooth and surprisingly strong if you orient the print in the right direction. (you don&#x27;t want to stress the part on the axis of the layer stacking)<p>I bought one a year or so ago and while definitely still in the &quot;toy&quot; category, you can do some neat things with them. That said, woodworking is going to let you build way nicer things, but you don&#x27;t get to just click a button and have it reproduced, nor share plans with others. But ya, FDM doesn&#x27;t print things that are &quot;nice&quot; really, just functional.')
