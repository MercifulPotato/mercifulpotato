Votes are counted the same night (most of them) by the committees in all voting locations and sent upstream then. Even the opposition doesn&#x27;t dispute the fairness of the election much.\nBTW, you need an ID to vote and you&#x27;re responsible to update your official address or you won&#x27;t be able to vote. The idea that you can do election without ID and with shady registration process sounds like someone trying to steal it to everyone here and I guess most of Europe.<p>That we elect authoritarian national socialists and that division of power is a myth here due to our half-assed constitution is another matter. We are just pretty backwards as a society. PiS and their ideas are very popular here sadly.')
