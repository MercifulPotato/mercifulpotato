I feel comfortable saying this because I shared the same view as you have just expressed, up until about 18 months ago. It&#x27;s okay to let go - the water is warm! Please know that when I say this, I&#x27;m not putting you down to build myself up. I don&#x27;t have the answers either - I&#x27;m just in favor of looking in new places.<p>For example take a look at Eric Weinstein and his presentation of his unified field theory: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Z7rd04KzLcg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Z7rd04KzLcg</a>. Weinstein himself states that he doesn&#x27;t know that his theory is correct, only that it deserves a real examination. I agree!')
