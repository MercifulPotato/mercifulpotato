Item(by='MereInterest', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611153600, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25846654, text='To answer you first question, because historically &quot;monopoly&quot; is the term used.  To have exclusive rights to produce a particular object is a monopoly over that production.  One of the earliest instances of patent law is the &quot;Statute of Monopolies&quot;.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Statute_of_Monopolies" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Statute_of_Monopolies</a><p>To answer your second question, all ownership is a restriction on the actions of others, in some way.  If you own a house, what that means is that everybody else is restricted from entering that house without permission.  If you own a copyright monopoly, it means that everybody else is restricted from making copies of particular books without your permission.<p>Where I would draw the line between &quot;artificial&quot; and &quot;natural&quot; monopolies is in how straightforward those restrictions are to apply.  It is very easy to maintain restrictions on wearing a particular hat or entering a particular house.  On the other hand, it is very hard to monitor all copies of a book to ensure that nobody is making additional copies of it.  For one, exclusivity is a function of it being a physical object.  For the other, exclusivity is not an inherent trait of the book, and is instead bolted on through legal measures.')
