Horrid luminous green card though.<p>I&#x27;m an investor in Revolut due to their aggressive growth strategy, but I wouldn&#x27;t use them personally.<p>As for Monzo, I like their app but missing features like being able to view your full  CVV number in app, or link the app to all your other bank accounts on the free tier, basically prevent me from using them as my primary bank')
