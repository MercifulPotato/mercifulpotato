We should not be mass destroying usable devices.<p>No. That&#x27;s just wrong. First, just the contract itself should be enough. The customer wants these devices destroyed, and the recycler agreed and took the money to destroy them - they can&#x27;t just renege on that deal. They took the money to destroy them. Full stop - we&#x27;re done here.<p>Why would Apple want these devices destroyed? Well .. many reasons. Maybe they can&#x27;t guarantee safety of those devices. Electronics, especially with high-capacity batteries need to pass rigorous standards to be sold on the market. If Apple expects these devices to be destroyed, they will not be performing any safety checks. If one of these devices blows-up and kills a customer - who is liable?<p>There are other reasons why Apple may want them destroyed. Maybe these devices will put pressure on their support and warranty services. Or maybe many of these devices have structural issues that cannot be fixed fully leading to bad end-user experience with the product. Or maybe those devices on the market will eat into their market share. Or a bunch of reasons (good or bad) that neither you nor I can come up with because we don&#x27;t know actually know that business (so why are you arm-chair quarterbacking this?)<p>&gt;Force the company to ship them to a developing country or somewhere else where it won&#x27;t hurt your sale of new phones as much, but stop destroying the planet for $$$<p>You can seriously impact a local or a national economy of a developing nation when a rich nations dumps crap it doesn&#x27;t want on your market. Most developing nations will have anti-dumping laws as well.')
