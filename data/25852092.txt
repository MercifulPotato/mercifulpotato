In California, for example, employees are protected from discrimination based on their political affiliations and activities. New York and the District of Columbia have similar laws. And, in Oregon and Wisconsin, employees may not be penalized for refusing to attend meetings intended to allow their employer to communicate its political or religious opinions.<p>Lawful Conduct Laws\nA number of states have laws that prohibit employers from making job decisions based on an employee’s off-duty conduct and activities, as long as they are legal. In Colorado, for example, an employer may generally not fire an employee for engaging in any lawful activity while off duty and away from the workplace. If your state has this type of law, it will likely protect you from political discrimination.</i><p>However, given that candidates aren&#x27;t employees yet, it&#x27;s not clear if such laws apply to them.')
