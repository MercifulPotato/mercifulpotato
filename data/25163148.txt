Perhaps I should cite what Galileo was trialed and sentenced for (following Wikipedia and sources therein): In 1633 Galileo was ordered to stand trial on suspicion of heresy &quot;for holding as true the false doctrine taught by some that the sun is the center of the world&quot; against the 1616 condemnation, since &quot;it was decided at the Holy Congregation [...] on 25 Feb 1616 that [...] the Holy Office would give you an injunction to abandon this doctrine, not to teach it to others, not to defend it, and not to treat of it; and that if you did not acquiesce in this injunction, you should be imprisoned&quot;. Galileo was found &quot;vehemently suspect of heresy&quot;, namely of having held the opinions that the Sun lies motionless at the center of the universe, that the Earth is not at its centre and moves, and that one may hold and defend an opinion as probable after it has been declared contrary to Holy Scripture. He was required to &quot;abjure, curse, and detest&quot; those opinions.<p>He wasn’t sentenced for threatening political structure but for heresy (even if it had some political motivation). I believe my point still stands as he WAS sentenced, by inquisition, for presenting facts against their dogmas.')
