The majority of men are normal and cordial in their approach. I don&#x27;t doubt that most women will experience sexual harassment at some point, but that doesn&#x27;t mean most men sexually harass women. It&#x27;s a minority of men doing the d*ck pics and sexual harassment, so it&#x27;s a non-sequitur as to explaining why women tend to be more selective in swiping and have more matches&#x2F;messages online.')
