So each unit of light &#x2F; gravity &#x2F; electromagnetism could be seen as taking up a specific &quot;patch&quot; of expanding area.<p>However, the strong nuclear force decays much faster than 1&#x2F;r^2. In fact, at some distance it goes negative and then decays back to zero. This could be (wild speculation) a force that propagates in many more dimensions. And it&#x27;s not the only force that does this, the weak nuclear force also decays much more rapidly than 1&#x2F;r^2 with distance.<p>I&#x27;m not a physicist and I would love nothing more than to hear what holes could be punched into this hypothesis.')
