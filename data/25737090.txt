When the official position of the white house is demonstrably false and incites violence something has to be done.<p>We should not forget however that you could argue that the current situation was caused by Twitter&#x2F;Facebook in the first place.  The algorithms that optimize engagement played a large part in amplifying Trump&#x27;s, and others, voices.<p>There is lots of discussion of whether Twitter should be thought of as a public square where every idea is free, a newspaper where opinions are curated, or something else entirely.  I personally think that it is something new, and we need long policy discussions on how platforms should be regulated.  No matter what happens the decision to or not to regulate platforms&#x2F;big tech and how it should be done is going to be one of the most important policy decisions of the decade.')
