To use the language of other posts, if the &quot;reservoirs&quot; of influenza were uniformly distributed, we&#x27;d expect NZ to have more flu than the United States or Europe where (time-integrated) lockdowns have been stricter.<p>Look at the pre-election videos covering campaigning in New Zealand -- crowds of maskless people, politicians hugging supporters etc. Stadiums full of rugby supporters. Not a COVID transmission risk, but wrt the flu it&#x27;s obviously no different from a regular season -- except for the borders.<p>In San Francisco people are distancing a lot more. It&#x27;s understandable why we have more COVID cases, but when winter rolls around it&#x27;ll be very interesting to see if the same difference in flu cases is seen. A non-uniform distribution of reservoirs might be something we can conclude with borders closed.')
