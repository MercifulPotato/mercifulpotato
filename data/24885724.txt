Everything else lags behind (because in Wayland you need to reinvent everything for each WM and toolkit). Everything is also incompatible because of all those reimplementations, so if you don&#x27;t just stick to the one true Gnome way, it will be broken. If you just do what Fedora is designed for, I agree that it can be fine.')
