We took a steam train ride that promised a &quot;trip to paradise&quot;.<p>I remember two things clearly about that train:<p>1. If you are sitting close enough to the front and lean out far enough, you get hot steam mist droplets painfully scalding your skin.<p>2. The train indeed went to Paradise, PA, with a big welcome sign, and I remember thinking &quot;Is this a joke? I guess some people aren&#x27;t very good at humor.&quot; I really don&#x27;t know what I did expect or what would have impressed me more.')
