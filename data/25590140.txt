Profits are revenues after expenses and the numbers in that graph are not taking certain expenses into account. When the expenses are taken into account the profit drops to zero.<p>Specifically, one of the big expenses deducted before calculating tax was liquidation of employee stock options. And guess what? Instead of being taxed at the corporate income tax rate those options were taxed as individual income for the employees who exercised them -- an even higher rate!<p>In your example the gains were in fact taxed. The tax was just applied in a different place than where you&#x27;re happening to look.')
