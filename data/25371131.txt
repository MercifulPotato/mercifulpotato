Given that we now know that a bat-related SARS-CoV2 virus that&#x27;s highly transmissible in humans <i>exists</i>, somehow, and there are human-staffed error-prone labs that specifically search for those kinds of viruses in bulk, what makes you think some <i>other</i> bat-human (pangolin-human?, something-else-human?) contact should be presumed <i>more</i> likely? Until there&#x27;s more evidence, why aren&#x27;t they <i>all</i> live hypotheses?')
