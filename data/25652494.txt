If I&#x27;m depositing into a CHF denominated bank account that is owned by the bank I&#x27;m borrowing from and they charge me currency exchange fee, ok, but if I&#x27;m savvy enough to go with a foreign currency denominated mortgage, I&#x27;m also savvy enough to find a cheaper way to convert CHF to EUR. Otherwise I have to take on the onus of arranging the currency exchange myself, in which case the bank I&#x27;m borrowing from doesn&#x27;t have a chance to benefit from the exchange fee.<p>If I&#x27;m a European bank and I want to engage in currency speculation, like the other people said below, there&#x27;s no reason for me to have to go through the administrative hassle of making the loan in the first place.')
