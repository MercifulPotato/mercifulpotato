Item(by='jeroenhd', descendants=None, kids=[24837231], score=None, time=1603193053, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24831379, text='&gt; It&#x27;s pretty clear Epic set out to intentionally get their Apple developer account terminated so they would have standing to sue, so I would not draw too much inference from that.<p>Actually, it&#x27;s clear that they intentionally got their _app removed_. The termination of their entire Apple account was a step I wouldn&#x27;t have expected Apple to take because it underlines the fragility of their authentication system. Now, player who signed up to Fortnite on their phones can&#x27;t continue to play anywhere else, probably making them regret using the Apple sign-in in the first place.<p>I generally consider any federated login that doesn&#x27;t have an external email address attached to be fleeting, possibly disappearing out of the blue. I&#x27;ve lost some minor accounts when I deleted my Facebook account with services that didn&#x27;t offer an email alternative. Developers, at least make adding an email&#x2F;username and password optional once I&#x27;ve signed in with another service account, because that account might just disappear altogether one day!')
