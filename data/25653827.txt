At a higher level of passengers per hour labor costs of needing one driver per bus start to dominate. 70% of mass transit operating cost in developed countries is staff. A train can have many cars but only one operator. Buses use existing roads and the increased wear of a 35,000 lb vehicle on roads is part of another organization&#x27;s budget (notice bus stops use concrete instead of asphalt). Methods of improving bus service like more drivers and buses to reduce wait time, and dedicated lanes bring up the cost.')
