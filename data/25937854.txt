Item(by='rubatuga', descendants=None, kids=[25938177, 25938471], score=None, time=1611805294, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25937080, text='&gt; The only reason Gamestop is going up is because of Tulip-mania. It&#x27;s a classic bubble.<p>If only. This has no signs of being &quot;classic&quot;. People on WSB realize that if many people purchase and hold on to GME stock for long periods of time, there will be an increase in stock price. If&#x2F;when this occurs, this increases the annual cost for GME short sellers through increases in both Margin Interest and Stock Borrowing Costs, which is a direct percentage of the GME stock price. This depends on the short type, but either by a certain timeframe or if the lender desires, short sellers will be forced to buy back their GME stocks. Buying back GME can also be forced through a Margin Call. When this happens, you will see a short squeeze.')
