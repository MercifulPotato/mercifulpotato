Who wants to become an expert on these systems just to turn the lights on? Not a chance.<p>I considered these systems when my house was built, and am very glad I didn&#x27;t get them. I turn the switch on, the lights go on, I turn it off, the lights go off. I replace a bulb now and then.<p>That&#x27;s it! I&#x27;m very happy with it.<p>But what I did do was run cat5 and RG6 to every room in a star configuration, which has paid off very very nicely. I did all that work myself because the electrician didn&#x27;t understand words like &quot;crosstalk&quot; and I didn&#x27;t want to find out after I moved in that the wires in finished walls didn&#x27;t work.')
