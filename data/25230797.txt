We need only look up to see that constraint didn’t hold up to the rest of time nearly as well as contemporary humans assumed it would.<p>How do we know that some immutable property of space&#x2F;time causes light to travel at the speed it does rather than the other way around where some immutable property of light causes it to be incapable of traveling any faster (the old strap wings to a human and look now it can fly; so strap X to light and look now it can go faster to!)<p>Again, the extent of my knowledge in this space is from Star Trek not science so please be gentle with my clear level of ignorance.')
