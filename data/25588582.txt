The question is about if the driver is actually working (waiting for a rider) or just sitting with their phone on. I don&#x27;t think this is a trivially solvable thing. But I&#x27;d also imagine Uber&#x2F;Lyft would be more aggressive in kicking idle people off the platform. But that will get complicated because &quot;rides needed&quot; is not a uniform or homogeneous distribution throughout the day, week, month, or year. I&#x27;d imagine someone driving as a 9 to 5er would be idle much more often than someone driving on the weekends and holidays. I&#x27;m fairly certain good actors will get kicked in an attempt to rid the platform of bad actors.')
