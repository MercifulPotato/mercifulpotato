On one hand, it is the instant ability to have others react on whatever you may say or post, regardless of the context of what is being expressed. In an ordinary social gathering with people talking, there is a collective subject discourse and you cannot just express your preference for cats in the middle of the conversation.

Personalised likes, notifications, a time-trackable identity linked to your emotional preferences like movies, sports, lifestyle etc.')
