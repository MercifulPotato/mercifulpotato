I fear many of these people could have become one of the real &#x27;greats&#x27; - had they retained the little glimmer of &#x27;unfounded confidence&#x27; that is washed away with the constant stimulus of other greats.<p>Finally, I&#x27;m not saying all is lost... some thrive in this and view stimuli of the greats as inspirational...  but it&#x27;s definitely not the same skillset that previous generations used to thrive.')
