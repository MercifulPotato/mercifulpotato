I actually believe that left leaning voters are more familiar with the term. I suspect it hardly gets mentioned on fox news for example. The more interesting thing would have been to ask about some of the theories from Qanon and to scale them likely to unlikely similar to the other questions.<p>The second difference between Qanon and some of the previous conspiracy theories (on both sides) is that we have several republicans quite openly supporting some of those theories, and even the president retweeting qanon theories. That&#x27;s why people are saying it seems to becoming mainstream.')
