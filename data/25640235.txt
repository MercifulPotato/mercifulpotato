Item(by='erklik', descendants=None, kids=[25640403], score=None, time=1609805913, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25640004, text='&gt; it&#x27;s great that you&#x27;re in a position to walk to if you don&#x27;t like your employment situation<p>From a person who doesn&#x27;t work in Google, or Big Tech, or even in SV. This is one of the reasons why these attempts at unionization from Google employees tend to annoy me slightly.<p>These are the few people in the world that would get hundreds of job offers in seconds. Yet instead of moving out if they don&#x27;t agree with Google&#x27;s projects, they would influence the projects and maybe affect the future of the company rather than give up their place for the hundreds like me who would gladly work on any defence-related project.<p>These are examples of true privilege.')
