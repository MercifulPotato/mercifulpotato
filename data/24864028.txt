Item(by='frankus', descendants=None, kids=[24864506], score=None, time=1603406275, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24863821, text='Pedestrian deaths have been rising in the US for a few years after falling steadily, and the number of private vehicles that are light trucks and SUVs has been rising steadily. So there&#x27;s a clear correlation, as well as a mechanism in that the higher, blunter front ends of these vehicles are more likely to kill pedestrians in a collision (hitting vital organs instead of legs).<p>It&#x27;s hard to know if there was a commensurate rise in buses, vans and (commercial) trucks, but they have a couple of mitigating factors: Drivers usually have more training, and they&#x27;re often designed with reasonable forward visibility (especially cab-over designs).<p>You&#x27;re 100% right that street design is a super important variable here. If this kind of thing interests you I&#x27;d recommend the book Right of Way by Angie Schmitt (no relation).')
