Interestingly, making a custom Microsoft chip for Xbox is a proposition that I haven’t heard before. It could provide some of the volume needed to justify custom designs.<p>But still, the Xbox is not iPhone volume, and you can kind of see that both consoles have architectures that are barely different than a standard x86 PC these days. Their AMD hardware is best described as semi-custom, perhaps not unlike the surface SOC.<p>And here’s the other thing, designing your own chip isn’t a guarantor of better performance. A great demonstrator of that concept is Qualcomm. There really isn’t much reason that Qualcomm’s chips can’t be just as impressive running Android as Apple’s chips are at running iOS. I mean, they KNOW that Qualcomm smartphone chips basically just run Android and nothing else. So why aren’t Qualcomm chips blasting Intel in benchmarks?<p>(I will say, Qualcomm’s improvement line is still moving faster than Intel - but there’s still not much explanation as to why Apple is so far ahead in the first place. From the outside it seems to basically boil down to enlightened management and engineering.)<p>So Microsoft could sink tens of billions of dollars and years into chip design and basically end up with “something that’s just about as good as Intel” rather than Apple’s basically perfectly executed decade of hardware R&amp;D.')
