I want to connect to it from another computer. Copy pasting doesn&#x27;t work between computers. Am I supposed to type it letter after letter? Am I supposed to send somehow? What if I don&#x27;t have internet access on the first computer? Do I need to go find a USB stick so I can transfer a file with the IPv6 address? Am I supposed to set up a DNS server of some kind?<p>I&#x27;ll keep my IPv4 thank you very much.')
