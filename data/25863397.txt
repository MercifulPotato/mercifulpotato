It&#x27;s not ideal(I much preferred sysV, and then preferred upstart...and so on), but it&#x27;s what we have. It&#x27;s also improved greatly from the initial state we received it in.<p>What specifically irks you about it? When I&#x27;m honest with myself, I realize my biggest objection to systemd was &quot;change&quot;. I was comfortable with something, it changed, and I resisted it. Once debian finally gave out and switched to systemd, I saw the writing on the wall and drank the kool-aid. I haven&#x27;t had any regrets.')
