The least privileged have no political power at all. The less privileged are affected by political decisions but they don’t care about the politics per se, instead they care about how the effects of politics touch their lives (through laws, policy or practice.)<p>Edit: In a democracy it is our responsibility to care about politics. However, it is a tragedy of the commons in that as an individual, time spent on politics is probably mostly wasted, given the amount of political power we control as an individual (assuming that political knowledge doesn’t give you much other benefit). A large percentage of the world’s population has even less power than the right to vote or otherwise be politically involved.')
