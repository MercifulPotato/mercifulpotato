Item(by='wging', descendants=None, kids=[25855923], score=None, time=1611205292, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25855416, text='The question is &quot;Do you all want a drink?&quot; They&#x27;re all answering with the logical meaning of &quot;all&quot;, where it&#x27;s yes if and only if every single one of them wants a drink, not the common meaning. Their responses are the value of the predicate `(A wants a drink) AND (B wants a drink) AND (C wants a drink)`.<p>If either of the first two didn&#x27;t want a drink, they would be able to answer &quot;no&quot;. They each started off knowing one of the terms in that logical AND above. (They know their own preferences are either &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; but they aren&#x27;t yet aware of the others&#x27; preferences, and they each know the others know that.)<p>For example, if (A wants a drink) is false, then the whole predicate is false. So if A didn&#x27;t want a drink, A would&#x27;ve said &quot;no&quot;. But instead they say &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;. They could only have not known if they actually <i>do</i> want a drink but are unsure whether both of the others also do. But after the first two people each say something that reveals they do want a drink, the third person &quot;C&quot; knows that:<p>1. A wants a drink (or they would have said &quot;no&quot;)<p>2. B wants a drink (or they would have said &quot;no&quot;)<p>3. C wants a drink (knowledge of their own preferences)<p>and finally has enough information to conclude that the overall predicate is true.')
