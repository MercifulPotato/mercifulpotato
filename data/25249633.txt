Item(by='alkonaut', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606697358, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25249378, text='I just mean the extremely common condition when you have one or more thoracic vertebra that ”feels” out of place (As I understand it, it’s not -it’s just a muscular thing). Typically due to stiff muscles surrounding it. Muscles aren’t out of location. Muscles are tense near the spine, causing pain and stiffness.<p>The area is easily seen&#x2F;felt with a finger on the spine near where the issue is.<p>Apart from pain it can give a sensation of tension or a feeling you can’t take deep breaths.<p>The diy fix is having someone lift you from behind as you exhale (a snap-crackle-pop sound will be heard), or rolling with your back on a foam cylinder.<p>I thought almost everyone, at least those with desk jobs and not enough excercise had this issue occasionally. I go to either a chiro or a naprapathy person to sort it. And as I said they do the same thing or very similar.<p>The same authority that certifies doctors certifies these people, so it’s literally under the surgeon general’s oversight. Which is why I think they basically have to practice something very similar to naprapathy, and can’t make claims to treat <i>anything</i> but the areas actually treated. Basically back muscles.')
