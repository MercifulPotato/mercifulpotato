However one thing I severely dislike about East Asian meal &amp; drink culture is the implication that drinking alone - simply sipping your drink while enjoying the meal &amp; conversation - means you are not enjoying yourself, and possibly also insulting the host.<p>This means that every time you want to sip your drink you have to entertain this needless protocol: identify someone around the table - preferably someone you have yet to drink with - say cheers (translation required), and sometimes drink all of the 60 mL cup at once. You should also keep a checklist of who you have and haven&#x27;t drunk with. The more political, the greater the need to move around the table at random intervals, shake hands, and drink. This is a demonstration often devoid of meaning.<p>If it&#x27;s a real party it can be fun to bottoms-up all the drinks. For a more relaxed meal &amp; conversation setting (my preference), as an outsider this is  uncomfortable. It ruins the slow enjoyment of expensive alcohol. Why can&#x27;t I sip my own damn drink with my meal?!<p>Also as someone who drinks a lot less as I get older, I lately find myself not drinking at all at these events, because there is no middle ground.')
