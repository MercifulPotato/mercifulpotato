I went through a similar period several years ago as an executive. I was leading engineering for three separate products and dealing with some very difficult stakeholders. I was also in a new relationship that I was trying very hard to maintain. The stress of all these things happening to me at once was colossal. I experienced a constellation of bad health symptoms. What I can&#x27;t believe, in hindsight, was when I asked my doctor if this could be stress related. He asked, &quot;do you feel stressed?&quot; I thought for a second and said, &quot;no.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve never written anything about that time, despite wanting to, but this is the thread I wish I could write. Details aside the emotions are all the same. It felt cathartic to read this.')
