AOC recently tweeted about &quot;making lists&quot; of opposition supporters, which was amplified by many others.\n</code></pre>\nThe former Twitter CEO is not the POTUS, and while the tweet is distasteful, is it really surprising that Twitter doesn&#x27;t have the resources to flag tweets by every user on the platform? Auto-flagging works for links, not for inciteful remarks. AOC, on the other hand, wasn&#x27;t talking about death lists, like you imply in your comment, she was talking about people taking responsibility for their actions under the Trump regime.<p><pre><code>    &gt; Whatever pretzel-like justifications one may come up with for the obvious double-standard, the average person no longer believes in neutrality of media or of any of the major tech platforms.\n</code></pre>\nYes, because the average American is a fascist at this point. This says more about average people than it says about tech platforms, though.')
