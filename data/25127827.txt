The last one is big - because all the parts of the SoC trust each other and work together they can share memory withing having to copy data over the bus. That coupled with superfast SSDs means that comparisons aren&#x27;t Apples to oranges, excuse the pun.<p>16GB of memory on-die shared by all the components of an SoC is not the same as 16GB made available to separate system components, each of which will attempt to jealously manage their own copy of all data.')
