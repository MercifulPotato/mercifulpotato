Heck, Intel, Microsoft and Cisco were breached through that, and that covers a very significant portion of the supply chain of the devices and software people use today (though admittedly not for the one example of an iPad).<p>Even if they want to use them for ML, this shouldn&#x27;t be reason to reduce the perceived sensitivity of the data to let them sit on an online device, as the harm hasn&#x27;t reduced. Hopefully we&#x27;ll see more threat models based on the impact of harm, not on the convenience to business.')
