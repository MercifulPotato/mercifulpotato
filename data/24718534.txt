It&#x27;s as hard as coding C&#x2F;C++! ;)<p>So now I carefully plan my stay in the house, meticulously making sure the garbage I create is minimal and smell free so I can bring it back to the city!<p>Everything I invest in long term is either glass, cork, natural rubber, stain free steel or cast iron.<p>Plastic is going away as we speak since the polymers in the low quality oil that we extract today can&#x27;t hold anything.<p>Fuels are also getting worse, the alkylate gasoline (basically distilled gasoline) I put in my lawnmower only lasts 3 months in a plastic container now (down from more than a winter only a couple of years back) so now I store it in metal jeep dunks.<p>In Sweden we are now since 2018 mixing ethanol into all fuels (gasoline and diesel) by law! I have a hunch covid lung problems are not getting better because of this!<p>50% of all the dead here lived at home (without jobs) between our largest highways with the most heavy traffic, the life vein of Sweden (intersection of E18 and E4 in the north of Stockholm, the 55&#x2F;267&#x2F;275 shortcuts aren&#x27;t used by the largest trucks because the short radius of the ramps&#x2F;roundabouts).<p>The other 50% where elderly (probably living near highways too, if I&#x27;m right).<p>Reuse, preservation and production is now the only thing you can do, consumption is dying.')
