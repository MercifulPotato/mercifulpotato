Even if GCP &quot;lingers lagging behind more and more,&quot; that gives users plenty of opportunity to move, they won&#x27;t suddenly find themselves without a provider.<p>Given Google&#x27;s stated commitment to their cloud business (see e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;29&#x2F;google-wants-to-show-how-serious-it-is-about-the-cloud.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;29&#x2F;google-wants-to-show-how-ser...</a> ), even if their efforts fail it&#x27;s likely to take many years before anything like that is remotely an issue for customers. &quot;But we might need to migrate in 5-10 years&quot; is not a very persuasive argument for most businesses, for good reasons. Note that GCP is already 13 years old.<p>I do advise people to keep an eye on their dependencies on a particular provider, since moving providers can be needed for all sorts of reasons, not just the death of a provider. Luckily there are all sorts of tools and approaches to doing this. I&#x27;ve been involved in migrations between all the major providers, and concern about the provider&#x27;s future wasn&#x27;t an issue in any of those cases.')
