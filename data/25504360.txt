The two questions are:<p>- how do you deal with knowing that you&#x27;re on either of the far ends of tech salaries? (calling this financial inequity is a stretch)<p>- how do you feel about financial inequity in the general sense? (this is a much bigger societal&#x2F;economical&#x2F;political question and the division really isn&#x27;t between the lower and higher paid tech workers)')
