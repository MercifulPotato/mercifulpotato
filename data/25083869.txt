Its fundamentally analogous as a legal argument; whether it&#x27;s corporeal items being moved (physical goods) or not doesn&#x27;t really matter. The principle is the same.<p>I cannot ever advise a company like Epic to burn its business model overnight on a such a huge risk as you suggest, I&#x27;m sure many would agree. You of course are free to continue to disagree and advocate for a new Epic phone platform to sell.<p>Epic today have 116 million users by their count playing Fortnite on an iOS device. That&#x27;s a lot of users to convince to pay likely at least several hundred dollars to move to a platform that doesn&#x27;t exist yet. I didn&#x27;t even bother to look up the Android count, the iOS user base is enough to illustrate why this is likely a pretty bad business decision.')
