ISO 8859-1 (and -2, and others) form would be F3 72 6E 79. UTF-8 treats F3 as a start of a 4 byte sequence where each subsequent character is in 80 - BF range (as specified in RFC 3629):<p><pre><code>   UTF8-4      = %xF0 %x90-BF 2( UTF8-tail ) &#x2F; %xF1-F3 3( UTF8-tail ) &#x2F;\n                 %xF4 %x80-8F 2( UTF8-tail )\n   UTF8-tail   = %x80-BF\n</code></pre>\nThis nicely causes an exception in both Java and Python, for instance, if they were to do what Go does here - and there is nothing anyone from adding an X- header to the request or response to try just that.')
