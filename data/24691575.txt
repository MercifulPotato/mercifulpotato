I think it&#x27;s about 1 week at present?<p>Before the recent leap in cases my test took 6 days to come back (negative). My wife&#x27;s test at the same time came back the next day. At the time they were saying that 72 hours was the expected return time for results. For me it has been a couple of days of steadily worsening coughing, and I gather people take about 3days-1week to show symptoms ordinarily.<p>So UK results are most likely reflecting infections from 1-2 weeks ago.')
