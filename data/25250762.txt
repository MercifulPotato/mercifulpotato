I think that there is a big difference in the affordances of a chalkboard&#x2F;paper and a monospaced text editor, and to me APL is too close to paper based notation where it is easy to read and write a larger set of symbols. Matlab has some dedicated notation around matrices but uses more text heavy descriptions beyond that which feels better suited to a command line. Julia takes an even more text based approach and supports notations like list comprehensions which feel easier to learn, read and use than a set glyphs.')
