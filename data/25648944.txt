Currently, most exploration companies are allowed to deduct 100% of the costs in the year they are incurred with the majors able to deduct 70% of the costs immediately with the remaining 30% amortized over 5 years. In what world would money spent that may or may not be recovered be capitalized as an asset?&quot;<p>Plenty of companies spend plenty of money on R&amp;D every year that goes nowhere. For some reason, the oil &amp; gas industry gets a refund on their exploration but other companies don&#x27;t. I work in R&amp;D in tech -- should the government fund my complete salary for projects that turn out to not be viable? Sounds great if you&#x27;re an entrepreneur -- start all the companies you want and get refunded by the government for all of your misses.')
