Item(by='thwarted', descendants=None, kids=[25680974], score=None, time=1610072226, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25679944, text='You are &quot;that guy&quot;. I didn&#x27;t say we didn&#x27;t know about this distinction, I said we have a better understanding.  It used to be the case submitting originating email on port 25 was accepted. Now, if you have that configured, it&#x27;s wildly considered that You&#x27;re Doing It Wrongâ„¢.<p>Many email clients, like Eudora and Thunderbird, were submitting email on port 25 for a long time, in the clear, where the only protection was very loose source IP address restrictions for outbound, otherwise you&#x27;d be an open relay.  Using different servers for inbound vs outbound mail submission was a relatively rare thing too, because the routing can be a bear to set up.  SMTPS (SMTP over SSL) on port 465 wasn&#x27;t official and was locally used where it could be supported (by the client) and where an admin had bothered to configured it.  Many email clients didn&#x27;t have support for even using a non-standard port for any thing mail related, so even once the mail submission port 587 was standardized it was often a problem getting a client to use it or providing authentication on it.<p>But even the OP is saying that fetchmail is a problem because it&#x27;s trying to be an a full, transparent MTA when it&#x27;s really a glorified MUA.  The fact that fetchmail (and its ilk) talk MUA protocols to receive email (pop3, imap) and can then turn around and <i>reinject</i> that message into the mail stream using SMTP to implement local delivery is where a lot of the problems with fetchmail come from (such as munging the headers or creating email loops with mailing lists).')
