If I recall correctly, refactoring on a titanic scale on the Windows Phone OS was underway along with the same on Windows itself to both make Windows a componentized OS that would work on anything from a tiny mobile device to a huge server and to synchronize the architecture of WP to Windows.  By the time of WP10, as the old joke goes, &quot;the operation was a success but the patient died&quot;.  It&#x27;s kind of a pity.')
