It seems much more a reflection of exactly the difficulty you&#x27;re describing: lots and lots of people like you <i>want</i> to find big suburban family homes but are priced out, and the suburbs are (awkwardly and somewhat unfairly) infilling to accomodate more modest and denser neighborhoods to house them.<p>The unfortunate truth is that &quot;The Suburbs&quot;, as you and many people imagine, simply don&#x27;t scale.  So the actual neighborhoods we&#x27;re building in the urban periphery are having to change.  Recognizing that fact isn&#x27;t &quot;propaganda&quot;.')
