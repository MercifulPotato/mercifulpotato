The concept originated in an essay written in 1833 by the British economist William Forster Lloyd, who used a hypothetical example of the effects of unregulated grazing on common land (also known as a &quot;common&quot;) in Great Britain and Ireland. The concept became widely known as the &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; over a century later after an article written by Garrett Hardin in 1968. In a modern economic context, &quot;commons&quot; is taken to mean any shared and unregulated resource such as the atmosphere, oceans, rivers, ocean fish stocks, or even an office refrigerator.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tragedy_of_the_commons" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tragedy_of_the_commons</a><p>To me the wild thing is the first sentence:<p>&gt;IN 2018, THE most recent year for which relevant data are available, people consumed more fish than they did either pork or beef or poultry.<p>The lede isn&#x27;t buried, it&#x27;s right there, but it goes unremarked.

Dark grey squares represent humans, light gray represent our pets and livestock, and green squares represent wild animals. The squares are arranged in a roughly round shape, with clusters for each type of animal. Animals represented: Humans, cattle, pigs, goats (39 squares), sheep, horses (29 squares), elephants (1 square). There are other small, unlabeled clusters also. It is clear that humans and our pets &amp; livestock outweigh wild animals by at least a factor of 10.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1338&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1338&#x2F;</a><p>If we&#x27;re pulling out more fish from the sea than all those pigs, cows, chickens, ducks, etc., that&#x27;s gonna leave a mark, eh?')
