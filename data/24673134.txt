We all know that the majority of people working in government now are from prior administrations. If Trump directly tried to stop it, then he&#x27;d have to weather more inconvenient headlines about Trump-Russia conspiracy. If he indirectly tried to stop it, then we&#x27;d have more anonymously sourced leaks and whistleblowers. Either approach would lead to the house Democrats demanding another investigation. The American people would be embroiled in another impeachment debate. Biden and Harris would be making hardline statements about severe punishment for Assange, and it would hurt the Trump campaign goal of being the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; side. The least risky thing Trump can do is allow the government to proceed with the prosecution &amp; then try to get a deal in for him.')
