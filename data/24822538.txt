You might as well blame Linus Torvalds.<p>&gt; The problem does indeed come down to Google and their choice to prioritize rapid market share growth and what the device makers and carriers wanted over what would provide a good end user experience.<p>Google didn&#x27;t have market power in phone operating systems when Android was just getting started. They had no power to dictate terms at the time because the device makers would have just used something else.<p>&gt; The original $399 iPhone SE just started its sixth year of OS and security updates. Android devices get half that support period if you are lucky.<p>This is whataboutism. They&#x27;re both doing it wrong, so your defense is that HTC is doing it wronger. But they&#x27;re both still doing it wrong.<p>And what are you going to say if Google <i>does</i> get a hardware abstraction layer, so that Android devices <i>are</i> supported indefinitely?')
