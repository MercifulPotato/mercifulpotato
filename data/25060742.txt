I am aware of how common abuse can be. My original comment said &quot;safety and sanity of course require separation in cases.&quot;<p>What I am advocating for is for spouses in a strained relationship not to consider divorce a solution that removes a problem from their life.<p>What can happen very often is that it removes the problem <i>from the spouses</i> and places the burden of the problem <i>onto the children</i>.<p>And then, of course, the children cannot discuss it because it is the <i>child&#x27;s fault</i> that they have issues with their parents divorce (which is always very friendly and amicable).')
