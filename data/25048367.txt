If there were a way to perform a task without needing a secret, you would not be using homomorphic encryption. You could just do regular computation since there is no secret. However, if the only way to perform the computation is with the secret, then Indistinguishability Obsfuscation won&#x27;t help you. To me it seems that iO is useful only for computations that didn&#x27;t need homomorphic encryption in the first place, because they already had a way to do the computation without the secret.')
