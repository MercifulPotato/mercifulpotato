I guess it&#x27;s not different to the equator on the surface of a sphere... so yes, a straight line &quot;encloses&quot; half of the plane &quot;inside&quot; it, so it has a hole.<p>My topology is rusty, but I do not think that a line in the plane is equivalent to an equator of a sphere because a plane is not equivalent to a sphere in a topological sense, and neither is a line equivalent to a circle. There is no homeomorphism (structure preserving bijective function) between either pairs of spaces.<p>There is a standard way to augment the plane&#x2F;line to make it equivalent to a sphere&#x2F;circle called the &quot;1-point compactification&quot;[1], but since it requires adding an extra point &quot;at infinity&quot;, the augmented space is not the same as the original.<p>So no, a straight line doesn&#x27;t have a &quot;hole&quot; in the topological sense. The 1-point compactification of it does though.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Alexandroff_extension" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Alexandroff_extension</a>')
