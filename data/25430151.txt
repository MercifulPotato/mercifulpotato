The “compiler changing behavior” isn’t actually happening in those cases. The program’s behavior never changed. We just have a wrong understanding of the program’s behavior as humans reading the source. If we were to codify and write down all of the expectations we might have about what behavior a source file might represent so that the compiler can match it exactly.... that’d be the standard and we are back where we started.')
