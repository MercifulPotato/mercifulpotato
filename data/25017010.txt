In specific cases they actually do compare them to other treatments like exercise.  It’s mostly a question of what’s the current treatment, if they wanted to sell a post operation drug you can bet they would need to test exercise.<p>Edit: Now I agree drug companies would not make a big deal about advertising that result, but that’s a different story.<p>There are any number of studies in the effect of exercise and physical therapy currently uses motion not drugs to help people recover from surgery.
