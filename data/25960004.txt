What I&#x27;m talking about is exactly WebForms. Please don&#x27;t distort my words.<p>WebForms <i>was</i> good, as long as you didn&#x27;t try to use it in way it wasn&#x27;t intended, like doing direct DOM manipulation on top of the UpdatePanel, trying to access private state, refusing to use components or not using separation of concerns.
