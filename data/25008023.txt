The audit system for many industries are not mature as well.<p>So yea ironically if you are a Chinese innovator at early stage you might find there’s much less restrictions in China to innovate (not necessarily from moral high ground as long as it’s lucrative ) than the US. Later you become big and draw more attentions but hopefully you know how to play by the rules. I personally don’t think it will make early stage innovation harder')
