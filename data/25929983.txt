Same at $250.  It&#x27;ll be the same at $420.69, $1,000 - whatever. But whenever it crests, it&#x27;ll sink FAST. A sell order at $1000 will get filled at $200.  Everyone knows it.<p>Which makes for an interesting collective action problem: you have to hold hold hold - and then be the FIRST to dump. Not the third, the FIRST.<p>WallStreetBets will be anarchy...')
