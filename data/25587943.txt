I used to think it was too fuddy-duddy to even glance at, but the recent adoption of DDS by ROS2 made me take another look. DDS seems to have a lot of interesting properties, particularly the QoS and discovery mechanisms. What made me think of it is that DDS is really a free and open standard, but there are a number of commercial entities making money off of it. They provide DDS implementations for free, and then they make money by offering professional consulting and support. Maybe a Cloudflare-backed capnp could end up looking the same way. Anyway, I&#x27;m sure you have your head around the possibilities and tradeoffs, not sure why I&#x27;m rambling.')
