I need to ship RTSP&#x2F;RTP with hella-different stream profiles over WebSocket. Imagine slamming the entire RTP and RTSP datastream into binary packets shipped around via WebSocket only to have the packets reassembled in-order on the other end.<p>RTSP isn&#x27;t <i>quite</i> the problem, especially if I had your use case. I work in PSaaS (physical security as a service) which has <i>really</i> unique streaming circumstance where security + latency are prime. Also, there&#x27;s tons of additional features I need from RTSP as well, ex: &quot;hey give me a new I-frame right now&quot;.<p>Unfortunately the RTSP spec is all over the place with my vendors... and throw the whole ONVIF WebSocket thing at it + trying to actually keep stuff cryptographically secure and welcome to my nightmare. I&#x27;m talking about craziness like not having an &quot;ack&quot; to the final &quot;PLAY&quot; command in the prelude but the server still shipping the data, packet parsers&#x2F;fixers implemented in ECMA, browsers acting as the RTSP session client... unfortunately the list goes on.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of overlap with your world. I even have your project bookmarked + labeled &quot;sane light-weight RTSP gstreamer implementation&quot; from when I was in my research phase! Small world =)<p>If you&#x27;re interested you can check out the ONVIF streaming spec:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.onvif.org&#x2F;specs&#x2F;stream&#x2F;ONVIF-Streaming-Spec.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.onvif.org&#x2F;specs&#x2F;stream&#x2F;ONVIF-Streaming-Spec.pdf</a><p>And the pipeline tech that most of my jazz is based on:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AxisCommunications&#x2F;media-stream-library-js" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AxisCommunications&#x2F;media-stream-library-j...</a><p>Thanks for being an open-source resource with well-documented work!!!')
