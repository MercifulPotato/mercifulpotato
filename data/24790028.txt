If you look at this design it&#x27;s packed with tons of overhangs regardless of printing orientation, and a particularly nasty undercut ending in a sharp point (see right side view).  This is actually a great example of where FDM is a bad solution and the part should be redesigned (ex. split it into multiple pieces or find a way to re-engineer it so it can be printed in some good orientation) or you should pick a different method.  Yes, you <i>could</i> FDM print this, but the end quality would be garbage, the tolerances would be poor, and you&#x27;d end up with a lot of support material cleanup and probably failed&#x2F;unacceptable prints.')
