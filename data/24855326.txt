Everyone was hating the re-design when it was launched but my twitter use increased from once or twice a week to couple of times a day after the new design.<p>It is amazingly fast(on desktop at least), behaves in all the right ways you would expect, you never lose you position anywhere, using back button always works properly, gracefully handles connection loss, and again, it&#x27;s so fast and pleasurable to use. Too bad can&#x27;t say the same for the content on the site.')
