Keep in mind, she&#x27;s a civil engineer and one of the smartest people I know.<p>I said &quot;In what context?&quot; because really, I didn&#x27;t know either. &quot;I have to scan this QR code if I go to my office. It&#x27;s apparently posted at the door, and will let them know I&#x27;ve been there, for contact tracing.&quot;<p>After a lot of playing around, we finally found out her phone&#x27;s camera could automatically read QR codes. When we did, the QR code in question was a URL to a website with a form, requiring her to enter all her information.<p>Not a fan of QR codes.')
