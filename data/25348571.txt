The holdings must be in cash, so they can&#x27;t even invest this giant pot of money.<p>This is not true.  The law only requires saving money for accrued benefits, which makes sense to me. See section 802 and 803 of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.congress.gov&#x2F;109&#x2F;plaws&#x2F;publ435&#x2F;PLAW-109publ435.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.congress.gov&#x2F;109&#x2F;plaws&#x2F;publ435&#x2F;PLAW-109publ435.p...</a><p>This is how deferred compensation should work.  If an employer offers deferred compensation, they should be saving sufficient funds such that even if income were to stop today, the accrued benefits would have no problem being paid from the savings.<p>&gt;This was a law pushed through by conservatives with the seeming intent to ensure that the USPS is never profitable.<p>This is also true, and the proof is &quot;conservatives&quot; exempted governments from the rules it wants the USPS to follow.  Politicians do not want to force proper funding of government employee benefits, as then they could not advertise low taxes to voters at the same time they advertise higher compensation (via benefits in retirement) to government employee unions.<p>&gt;It is a mandate that literally no other organization is saddled with.<p>Non taxpayer funded organizations do have similar mandates.  See Pension Protection Act of 2006.')
