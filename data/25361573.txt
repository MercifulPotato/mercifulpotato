Its really hard to convey the mental model of the code and bring everyone on the same page. Slides are the starting option, but creating animations taking a lot of time and aren&#x27;t necessarily good either.<p>An example would be to show the working of a retry mechanism in distributed system. An animated diagram showing the client server relationship, then packet loss happens, client disconnects and reattempts with another server.<p>Has anyone found a way to do this quickly and easily?')
