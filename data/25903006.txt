If it is something we discover, universal truths, then Math is a science, uncovering truths in the same way physicists and chemists and others do.  If it is something we invent, then perhaps it is engineering or art?<p>This is one of the great debates of the philosophy of mathematics.  Surely the arbitrary symbols we use to represent mathematical concepts are &quot;invented&quot;.  But Math is much more than the symbols.<p>If we encounter aliens would they have the same mathematical concepts, or would theirs be completely different?  Studies looking for basic numerical concepts in animals have shown that some animals really can grasp the basics the same way humans do.  Is that due to human bias?  Common DNA, or universal truths?')
