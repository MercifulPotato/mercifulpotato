All cases had to be moved to another site in a neighboring state. I don&#x27;t think they should be charged with sedition, but it clearly fits the statute, which states:<p>&quot;If two or more persons in any State or Territory, or in any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, conspire [...] to oppose by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States&quot;<p>Using violent attacks and arson to force a federal courthouse to close down would seem to fit that definition.<p>While it&#x27;s true that the <i>reason</i> the mob attacked the Capitol was arguably worse, both antifa and the Trump mob attacked federal buildings and tried to harm those guarding them.<p>Also, regarding your source: our media has sadly divided into two, so no resource you list will convince anyone.<p>Either they already read the resource, and so already agree with you, or they don&#x27;t read it and know better than to trust it, since it&#x27;s a partisan source.<p>We would all do better to stop encouraging open partisanship among the media, and reward non-partisan perspectives. NB: this doesn&#x27;t have to mean non-opinionated perspectives, although those should be clearly labeled as editorials (now, editorials have blended with news).')
