Especially make sure that attaching and detaching new monitors like video projectors works during operation and does the right thing. Also provide support for rotated monitors.</i><p>My wishlist would be to have this go further and be aware of inter-monitor, relative positioning as well. For example, I use the ‚ä¢ layout (one rotated monitor on the left, one straight monitor right in front) and it&#x27;s usually an unsatisfactory experience tiling windows for productivity.<p>Things I do on the vertically oriented monitor on the left are mostly reading documents or watching logs.')
