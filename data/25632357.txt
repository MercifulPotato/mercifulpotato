I worked in education for years and saw first hand how lazy and shitty grown adults can be (professors). However, I would never condone eliminating unions. The faculty need a bastion against those who control the money (&quot;the administration&quot;)--think about the separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches. Otherwise you would never have the few professors that make the whole system worth it. We need to strengthen unions and make sure the unions&#x27; and management are aligned on the same objective. This takes a rational and inclusive approach by both sides. In my experience if either side is mainly concerned with their own silo the whole thing gets very toxic. Unionized employees are not the enemy and neither are management.')
