Item(by='buran77', descendants=None, kids=[25348974], score=None, time=1607445107, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25341361, text='It should be the right of the finder to stay anonymous but the cat&#x27;s out of the bag now.<p>But this I don&#x27;t understand though:<p>&gt; and they both seemed to agree that the location of the find should be kept secret<p>In the interest of transparency after the fact I see no problem with telling people where the treasure actually was. This gives people closure especially to the ones who suffered or the families of the ones who died hunting for it, lets them verify that the instructions they went on were indeed valid, and puts to rest other suspicions people may have.<p>Under these conditions a judge has nothing to go on if they want to dismiss a lawsuit claiming the finder cheated in any way. There are no details on how this happened, the initiator of the treasure hunt passed away so there&#x27;s nothing stopping anyone from taking this to court. Transparency is there specifically to preempt claims like this.')
