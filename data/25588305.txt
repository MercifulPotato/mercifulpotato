If you need deeply nested objects just look away, it becomes unintelligible when trying to understand the schema with any real nesting.  The company I was at used it fairly well as long as you keep things 1 or 2 levels nested at most, but we had a legacy schema that was 5 or 6 levels deep at some points and it was just a disaster.  My anecdote anyways.')
