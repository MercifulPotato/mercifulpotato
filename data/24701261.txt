I&#x27;ve been interviewing heavily the past 3 years and I&#x27;ve noticed that at least for the major US tech hubs (say, SFBA, Seattle, NYC, as well as LA, and from my understanding, London in the UK too) pretty much all the companies I would rate as &quot;decent&quot; or better to have a career as a SWE are gatekeeped by leetcode interviews. Difficulty and selectivity varies of course.<p>There are exceptions, but they are getting fewer and fewer. i.e. some companies that did not leetcode when I got my current job (5 years ago) are now leetcoding. Even companies in that famous &quot;they don&#x27;t whiteboard&quot; list will leetcode you from my experience (I reckon its really a team by team basis thing).<p>You might be able to find a good company that will not leetcode you, but if you are trying to maximize your potential to get a good job at a good company, the best strategy is to grind leetcode, as opposed to hunting for a White Whale.')
