Microsoft are arguing that the malware operation damages Microsoft&#x27;s brand, instead of putting the fault onto themselves for making vulnerable software.<p>I agree with you.<p>Why on earth would opening a .doc document infect a freaking computer? Imagine opening a freaking json file and getting infected by a crypto virus... The real problem is with Words or whatever software Microsoft has built that allows some code execution VIA a .doc document. They must of have so much technical debt nobody&#x27;s willing to touch some old code anymore or something... IMHO, this and the fact they ditched their own browser engine in favour of Google&#x27;s because it couldn&#x27;t compete says a lot about the state of engineering in some Microsoft teams...')
