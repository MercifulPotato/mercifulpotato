I don&#x27;t understand why people think of microservices as an architecture pattern. To me they seem more like an implementation detail.</i><p>Implementation details and architectural patterns are orthogonal.<p>Implementation detail means something that is-not&#x2F;should-not  be exposed at higher levels (e.g. API consumers and&#x2F;or the end user). This includes architecture, but also all kinds of other things (e.g. choice of storage backend).<p>Microservices is very much an architecture pattern (affecting the whole architecture&#x2F;design&#x2F;code-base of the app in the most fundamental way), and is&#x2F;can-be an implementation detail, as far as API&#x2F;UI users are concerned.')
