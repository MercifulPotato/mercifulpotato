Just pointing out what it does to the character of a neighborhood to have long-term renters stick around for the long haul.<p>In rent-controlled markets, in my experience it&#x27;s not unusual for long-term renters to enjoy significantly lower housing costs than if they were to buy an equivalent condo. I know that when I looked it was definitely the case for me unless I had bought with &gt; 50% down.
