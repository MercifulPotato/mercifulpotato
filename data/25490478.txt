BBC just knocks it out of the park here, and, it&#x27;s <i>way</i> better than the Gary Oldman film (no disrespect). IMHO one of the best television shows ever made. Would totally put it up against The Wire, although it&#x27;s an apples-to-oranges comparison for a variety of reasons.<p>FYI said miniseries can often be found floating around on Youtbe.')
