Of course there are disputed and spoiled ballots, and these are resolved quickly by the volunteers and local observers from the parties taking part in the election.  Unless the number of disputed ballots exceeds the difference it&#x27;s not really a problem.  Recounts happen, especially where there&#x27;s only a few hundred votes in it.<p>Spoiled ballots (where the voters are actively protesting by scrawling &quot;I hate them all!&quot;, or some other message across the paper) are tallied separately, but are otherwise ignored when calculating the election outcome.')
