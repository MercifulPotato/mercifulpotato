Democracy seems like our best bet for a fair and just government and I&#x27;m strongly in favor of having better representation of the actual beliefs of the citizenry - even if they&#x27;re folks I disagree with.<p>1. Assuming you ignore American oddities like the electoral college, ignore tacitly socially accepted voter suppression and accept that minimum voting ages should be a thing (which I&#x27;m still pretty &quot;meh&quot; on personally but whatever).')
