But allow me to channel my inner HN and humbly suggest that the downvotes you&#x27;re receiving, such as they are, arise from your assumption that if terminology is not &quot;technical economic language,&quot; it is incorrect. You replied to a person who used a commonly understood term correctly and you claimed it was incorrect. Now you&#x27;re saying that the terminology didn&#x27;t come to have the current meaning until 2008. But I&#x27;m not seeing the connection between that and whether the terminology is appropriate to the current context. Why would anyone bother to cite you a source of this terminology before 2008? Nobody has even referenced a claim that the terminology is older than that. It&#x27;s a non sequitur to observe that the terminology is young.<p>The long and the short of it is that the person you originally responded to was correct to call the behavior &quot;socializing costs.&quot; You were incorrect in your response where you claimed that a subsidy is not &quot;socializing costs,&quot; since that&#x27;s exactly what the term means in common parlance. The downvotes probably come from your not recognizing and admitting your mistake.')
