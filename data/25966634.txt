The original claim is that God is tantamount to a dictator, as far as I understand it. This is false for the reasons I&#x27;ve stated. Augustus Caesar and Jeff Bezos may have some things in common, but that doesn&#x27;t make one exchangeable for the other. For that matter, a king, a lord, and a dictator are all very different things, again with historical roots. They are not interchangeable concepts, even if a random uneducated person on the street may think so.<p>&gt; &quot;the majority of Christians.&quot;<p>There is no such thing, especially for a complex theological issue like free will. The Catholic Church, major Protestant sects, and the Eastern Orthodox church all have different views.<p>&gt; Basically if you can prove that Christianity reinterprets the word &quot;lord&quot; and &quot;king&quot; to mean something other than the colloquial definition of the term &quot;dictatorship&quot; and that the &quot;majority of Christians&quot; believe that definition then you&#x27;re right.<p>Yes, that is not the case, again, for basic theological reasons. For one, the relationship of Christians to secular power has been a complex one.<p>On the one hand, you have Jesus saying &quot;Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar&#x27;s, and unto God the things that are God&#x27;s.&quot; On the other you have the divine right of kings, which argues for the opposite.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Render_unto_Caesar" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Render_unto_Caesar</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Divine_right_of_kings" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Divine_right_of_kings</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Names_of_God_in_Christianity" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Names_of_God_in_Christianity</a><p>I&#x27;m sorry, but again, this is a complex theological question that many Christian thinkers have weighed in on over the years. It&#x27;s really not the kind of issue one can solve in a HN comment and your constant &quot;if you don&#x27;t prove it now, you&#x27;re wrong&quot; is exactly the kind of ignorance I&#x27;m referring to. <i>It isn&#x27;t that simple.</i><p>I don&#x27;t have much else to say. Religion is complicated and not easily summarized in &quot;But do X people think Y?&quot;')
