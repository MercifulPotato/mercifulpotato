Historically, this was in fact the motivation for special relativity: we noticed that the speed of light does not obey Newton&#x27;s relativity principle: if you fire two beams of light, one from the ground and one from a moving train, they will both arrive at a detector at the exact same time.<p>Having observed this concerning fact about the world, we now had to come up with a theory that explained it. The one we landed on was that speed is a number that goes not from 0 to infinity, but from 0 to c. This then must mean that accelerating an object from 0 to 1&#x2F;3<i>c is easier (requires less force) than accelerating that same object from 1&#x2F;3</i>c to 2&#x2F;3*c, and that this difficulty increases the closer you get to c. The final theory in fact predicts that an object with mass can&#x27;t even reach c, it&#x27;s speed can only grow infinitely close to c. However, massless particles (such as the photon) do move with speed exactly c.<p>Note that we have since repeated this experiment with other particles of non-0 mass and confirmed that photons themselves are not special, c is indeed a limit. For example, electrons have some mass and don&#x27;t move with speed c, and an electron fired from a moving train will arrive faster than an electron fired from the platform, but the speed of the speedier electron will NOT be V_e + V_train as Newton would predict, it will be (V_e + V_train)&#x2F;sqrt(1-(V_e+V_train)^2&#x2F;c^2) if I remember the Lorrentz transform correctly.')
