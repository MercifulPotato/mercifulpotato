Item(by='lb1lf', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606716719, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25250821, text='-I speak English (my third language) with a marked Aberdinian accent - despite never having lived there; this is courtesy of the kids next door when I was a child - their family had moved from Aberdeen to rural Norway, and if I wanted to play with them, I had better learn how to speak English. (And for a couple of years, said kids were the only teachers around...)<p>I have tried to lose the accent, but I still get asked by Aberdeen locals how long I&#x27;ve lived there whenever I visit for work.<p>Good thing the kids next door were from Aberdeen and not the Outer Hebrides, methinks. :)')
