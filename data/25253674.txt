Item(by='ht_th', descendants=None, kids=[25254055], score=None, time=1606744551, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25253134, text='&gt; Who throws away a perfectly fine washer? Why? A new model has nothing new inside technology-wise, I can promise you that.<p>When I first moved in my house I didn&#x27;t have a job, so I bought a lot of cheap appliances. Most of them still work, and I expect them to keep on working with almost no maintenance for years to come. However, they have some serious downsides: they are energy inefficient, they make a lot of noise, and they do not necessarily fit my future needs.<p>For example, now that I have a partner, my fridge is a bit small. And instead of running the washer once every two weeks, we&#x27;re running it two or more times a week. Every time I run the washer, the floor the washer is on becomes basically unlivable for about half an hour or so due to loud noise of the centrifuge.<p>I do not want to buy new stuff, particularly because the old stuff &quot;still works&quot;. And getting rid of my old stuff in a nice way is not easy either: Because they have wear and tear, goodwill and second-hand shops are not overly enthusiastic about taking them from me. Unless I can find someone to take something over (for free!), I am left with moving it to the recycling place because I do not have any storage space in my house.')
