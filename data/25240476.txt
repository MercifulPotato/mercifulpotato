The simplicity of the universe is not just an artifact of our best theories, it appears to be baked into the very structure of those theories.  If our current theories are even in the ballpark, then there are very few places that hidden complexity could possibly hide.<p>Take quantum randomness, for example.  It used to be thought that the apparent randomness could just be papering over our ignorance of some hidden underlying mechanism, but it turns out that we can <i>prove</i> that this is not the case.  We can eliminate entire <i>classes</i> of theories based on finite observations, and one of the classes that we can eliminate (with very high probability) is theories with high Kolmogorov complexity.')
