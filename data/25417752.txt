We&#x27;re there already, too. Adtech data has been bought by the Pentagon for use in targeting individuals overseas for military operations. This is quite literally not a drill.<p>Whether or not you believe you have nothing to hide is immaterial, too; there are some people in the world who might disagree with you (for religious, political, or moral causes) and they could potentially be <i>very</i> interested in your data.  Do you think the people who worked at the world trade center felt they had anything to hide? how about the folks at the Olympics in Munich? Hell, I bet the people we (US) drone strike don&#x27;t feel like they have anything to hide; after all, they&#x27;re the good guys, and those invading Americans are the aggressors.<p>This is far more complex than &quot;I&#x27;m not valuable&quot;. Perhaps, philosophically, if you lived a perfectly saintly life and never made any enemies or had an opinion that upset anybody ever, you could say you had nothing to hide.')
