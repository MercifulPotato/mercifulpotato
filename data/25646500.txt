They want to make the big risky investments, then stop the whole economic engine once they&#x27;re safe.<p>Actual Chicago economics arguments are much better than the ones you hear on the Internet. I think they&#x27;re still pretty bad, but not as bad as the parodies based on first-half-of-the-first-semester Econ 101.
