I drastically dropped my carbs and increased my fat in take and Saturdays were my cheat days.  This was bad for my cardio but I really trimmed up and it required a tremendous amount of discipline.<p>I have found that long distance running also resulted in some weight loss.  After 3 months of running on a treadmill I gradually increased my distance until I was running an 8 minute mile pace for 50 minutes, which is about a 10K.  This was much healthier than dieting.  Even though it required extensive time and effort it felt like less discipline than dieting and I wasn&#x27;t so limited on what I could eat.  The exercise allowed me to trim up, but I only lost a little bit of weight.  The running resulted in a low resting pulse rate of about 42bpm.')
