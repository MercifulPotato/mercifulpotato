But pretty much no one wants preapproval of every utterance either, so everyone is also “anti-censorship”.<p>If you see someone talking about “damping positive disinformation feedback loops” or something like that, rather than “censorship”, that’s one signal there’s a substantive discussion taking place.<p>(Zero censorship is kind of like absolute anarchy: an interesting thought experiment that may be useful to inform a practical debate.)')
