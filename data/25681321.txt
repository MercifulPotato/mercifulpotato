I published this paper while I was at Google:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41591-019-0447-x" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41591-019-0447-x</a><p>The only data we were able to get at the time was mostly white patients. We talked to many hospitals but many were&#x2F;are reluctant to share anonymized data for research. I&#x27;m not at Google so I&#x27;m not sure the status of the project now, but there was a real attempt to try and gather more diverse data. Unfortunately there were a lot of obstacles put up by those who have the data (hospital systems).<p>Fundamentally, it seems to me like there just aren&#x27;t as many lung cancer screening scans out there for non-white patients as there are for white patients. How do we get around this? How do we improve on the situation? I fundamentally believe that machine learning in the long term can make medicine more accessible to more diverse groups, but not if we shoot it down out of fearmongering right away.<p>I agree that bias is a problem, but part of what needs to happen to get more diverse data is simply having more data available. There is real promise in this technology and if we have a one dimensional view of it (&quot;is it or is it not dangerous because of bias&#x2F;privacy&quot;) then we will fail to get past the initial humps related to fear and distrust.')
