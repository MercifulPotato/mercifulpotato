It didn&#x27;t help that where I&#x27;m from it was much more common in a bar to pay as you go, or in a restaurant for everyone to pay a share (either listing off what they had, or just dividing, whatever makes the most sense) at the counter on the way out.<p>In the Netherlands, your table will run a tab and someone pays, and then later sends a tikkie (it&#x27;s an app that makes paying the person back very easy) to the group. They get kinda weirded out if you violate this model, e.g. recently I was going to the shop, and a friend asked for something - €6 or so, small enough that I don&#x27;t mind not being paid back for a one-off thing, and then a few weeks later sent me a message &quot;I remembered you never sent me a tikkie for that, please do!&quot;<p>There&#x27;s a standard joke screenshot that goes around here of a whatsapp message after a date, translated, &quot;Please pay €0.25 for mayo on your fries.&quot; It&#x27;s probably not a joke.')
