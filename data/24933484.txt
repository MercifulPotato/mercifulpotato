I have 40 years professional experience in the software dev business, as I wrote, and during that time I&#x27;ve met and worked with a lot of people. Networks grow organically but you have to cultivate them (another person commented in this thread with the garden analogy).<p>If you feel lonely or struggle to connect with people, or maintain relationships, don&#x27;t expect to get help for that in HN comment threads. Don&#x27;t feel sorry for yourself, get help.')
