Despite their description supporting this notion that their scheduling works this way, I&#x27;m skeptical, because they&#x27;re just not that dumb (I hope! :)<p>However, sandboxing is absolutely <i>not</i> the simplest way to fix this. Ardour does not and will never sandbox plugins in processes. It just uses a topological sort and a dataflow algorithm to decide what can be run and when, and would execute [ A, B, C ] and [ D, E, F ] in parallel (or could, if on appropriate hardware), before finally running [ G ].<p>Moving plugins into a separate process has both overhead and complications, and is basically a crazy way to fix this issue, if indeed it is an issue as described.')
