A lot has changed since then, but even that brief exposure to Google&#x27;s internal developer tools left a lasting impression on me.<p>Perhaps the operative phrase being &quot;Many years ago&quot;. I currently work at Google, previously I worked at Square. Of the two, I generally prefer the OSS and off-the-shelf tooling at Square. Some things really are better at Google (code search and Blaze are definitely a big improvement over what we had), but many of our monitoring and CI tools feel antiquated and cluttered with inscrutable debris. Or take Gerrit, where each change has 3 different IDs and the developers decided that every workflow status should be expressed as an integer in the range [-2, 2] for some reason [1].<p>They were probably amazing (and much simpler) tools back in the day, but the world has moved and we&#x27;re somewhat constrained by what&#x27;s familiar.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gerrit-review.googlesource.com&#x2F;Documentation&#x2F;images&#x2F;user-review-ui-change-complex-reply-dialogue.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gerrit-review.googlesource.com&#x2F;Documentation&#x2F;images&#x2F;...</a>')
