If so the current magic keyboards have the same keys and you should buy one now because they will probably be updated soon. If you prefer the longer travel ones (like a 2015 MacBook or 2020 M1 MacBook) you have to find an older used one or wait a bit.<p>I have a 10 year old Bluetooth magic keyboard and a 10 year old USB magic keyboard and both work perfectly with windows.<p>Be warned, they are difficult to Bluetooth pair with windows for the first time, usually takes 10 tries for me.')
