Because none of the issues you identify seem to apply to the BSDs.  We don&#x27;t really have the notion of &quot;maintainers&quot;, either, so, I&#x27;m guessing your comments aren&#x27;t as a BSD user per se?<p>The BSDs have excellent archives of the mailing lists; FreeBSD, NetBSD and DragonFly have their own websites with complete or near-complete archives, including full threading and sub-threading support; all BSDs are also archived on marc.info, and plentiful of other sources, some of which do come and go; but archives themselves are downloadable in bulk from the underlying projects, so, archiving is generally a non-issue.<p>What formatting tools?  Why would I need any formatting tools to hack the kernel?  That&#x27;s only a benefit that none are available.<p>Security mechanisms?  How&#x27;s GitHub any better?  Anyone can make any account and pretend to be anyone.  Or do you suggest GitHub introduce Account Verification, so that someone at Microsoft-owned GitHub could then decide whether or not you&#x27;re an OSS contributor worthy of a Blue Checkmark to accompany your name?  I think we did have people pretend to be de Raadt or Dillon over the years, but it&#x27;s generally not really an issue; often just the April 1 jokes; very easy to verify based on headers.<p>&gt; Forum config problem.<p>OK, now we&#x27;re talking!  So, how about all those forums fix their &quot;forum config&quot; problems, and then maybe we&#x27;ll talk?  Mailing lists are by far superior to what GitHub or any other popular forums actually do offer as of today.  GitHub Issues, for example, doesn&#x27;t even support threading within an Issue; unlike the mailing lists since decades ago.  There&#x27;s absolutely no archiving of GitHub Issues being done anywhere that I&#x27;m aware of, apart from user-initiated archive.today.  So, even in such basic aspects, mailing lists are already superior.  Not to mention that we have contributors from across the globe, whereas Microsoft disables (without notice) GitHub accounts of anyone who&#x27;s a citizen or a visitor of the geographic places and peninsulas you aren&#x27;t supposed to visit or originate from -- covering dozens of millions of global citizens, denying them access to code for no good reason.')
