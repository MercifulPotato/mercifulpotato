About 1&#x2F;2 of the heat flow from the core to the surface comes from primordial heat.<p>I&#x27;d say solar will also add some heat to the atmosphere because they reflect less sunlight than the surface.<p>Of course, in the big scheme of things this is all pretty irrelevant unless we keep on exponentially increase our energy usage. The greenhouse effect of CO2 is a few orders of magnitude higher.')
