Telegram and FB Messenger and Hangouts at least can, but here in Europe WhatsApp is the default for everything and there are things for which it is becoming almost completely necessary.<p>But I simply find the whole chat ecosystem so depressing.  A few years ago at least I could chat with Google Talk people via Jabber.  It is really absurd that instant messaging is not federated like email.  Of course there is one explanation: while Email was invented in the 70s at research institutions with goals beyond profit, IM already started in the 90s with companies trying to capitalize their user-base with vendor lock-in... (ICQ, MSN, etc.). Sad, sad, sad.')
