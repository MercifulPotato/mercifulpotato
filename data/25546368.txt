But K12 was not that Seattle core as K12 was an in house custom micro-architecture that was similar to Zen but engineered to execute the ARMv8A ISA. And that project K12 along with Project Sky Bridge(Pin Compatible x86&#x2F;ARM socketed motherboard design) was mothballed in favor of just Zen&#x2F;x86.<p>So AMD very likely still has the Verilog for its K12 custom ARM core and really AMD&#x27;s already had the A1100 to market albeit with A57 cores and not any K12 custom ARM cores. So AMD&#x27;s very well capable of packaging and integrating an ARM core into a usable product.<p>What AMD and Intel are lacking in most is the other non CPU core processing block IP that the M1 has included like the NPU and DSPs and other specialized on SOC IP that are included on the M1. And Apple&#x27;s in house CPU&#x2F;SOC teams are really ahead there as is the OS&#x2F;API and software ecosystems that Apple has developed to make all that happen seamlessly for application developers that are targeting Apple&#x27;s M1 silicon.')
