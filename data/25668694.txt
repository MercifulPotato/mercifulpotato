It&#x27;s been driven&#x2F;lead by senior members of government. Using lies and propaganda, conditioning a group of citizen sympathizers over a long period of time to distrust media, distrust opposing &quot;facts&quot; or anyone that disagrees with Trumps agenda. Weaponize this group of people to seize power and considerably fracture our democracy. It&#x27;s the least patriotic and perhaps treasonous thing I could ever imagine. But they think they are the patriots. It&#x27;s just so backwards to me.<p>This is correct to a degree but it is debunked by the President&#x27;s plain language in his speech prior to the violence at the Capitol where he asked the crowd to &quot;peacefully and patriotically&quot; protest at the Capitol.<p>It becomes difficult to make the accusation that the violence is incited when it is very explicitly said that the protest should be peaceful.<p>During the nomination of Justice Kavanaugh, members of Congress were confronted in elevators and hallways of the Capitol building by protesters. These protests were also based on unproven accusations and the people were weaponized to seize power as a ploy because they did not have the requisite votes as per the constitutional process. Intimidation and invasion of the building was seen very differently when it came to a lifelong appointment of a Supreme Court justice.<p>I would argue that the politicians from both parties share blame in allowing the discourse to escalate like this. To condemn only one party for it is not helpful at all.')
