Item(by='acoard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602261468, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24720227, text='&gt;When you are forging the document and claiming the document is from the FBI, you are fully t acting as an FBI agent<p>That&#x27;s sophistry and confuses the issue.  One is absolutely not acting as an FBI agent when forging FBI documents. There is a clear and common-sense difference between impersonation and forgery, and  you seem to be misusing language to willfully misunderstand the difference.<p>When you&#x27;re forging the document, you are not pretending to be an FBI agent.  You are being a forger.  The forger then claims that the FBI made the document.<p>Saying, &quot;The FBI made these documents and here  they are&quot; is fundamentally different than saying, &quot;I made these documents and am with the FBI.&quot;  They do not collapse into the same thing.<p>To be honest, I still would hope forging FBI documents is a crime in the same way that impersonating an FBI agent is a crime; however that&#x27;s a matter of law.  It is a matter of fact that forgery and impersonation are different.  One is falsifying documents, the other is falsifying identity.  If you want to say that both can be reduced to falsification or deception, sure, but that&#x27;s not a crime.  Forgery (falsifying  documents) and impersonation (falsifying identity) <i>are</i> crimes, and separate ones.')
