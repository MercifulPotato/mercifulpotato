I just started researching the pieces I need to build something similar. \nWhat kind of PoE hat did you use? I was also thinking of having one of the PIs have also an SSD with bootp&#x2F;dhcp and let the others boot with PXE.<p>I had been thinking of building a PIs cluster for a while now and I was looking with interest at the turingpi board project [1] they are taking preorders for the second batch if anyone is interested. But I would like nodes with more than 1GB of RAM so I guess I&#x27;ll have to wait for that.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;turingpi.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;turingpi.com</a>')
