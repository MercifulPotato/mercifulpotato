With our current ways of solving problems, the new problems become harder and harder. The existing human knowledge is also becoming harder and harder to understand, requiring somebody working in a field to spend much longer studying and catching up to the state of the art before being able to make a significant contribution to the field.<p>This is one of the reasons that I&#x27;m personally so excited about (and working on) the potential of spatially immersive media like VR to understand complex concepts. Taking a step back, tools like a graph plot enabled humans to understand complex concepts like differentials and projectile motion at a much younger age. Could a breakthrough with new ways of understanding human knowledge effectively do the same with knowledge that is today considered complex (eg, quantum mechanics)? If such a breakthrough happens, could we bring the average age of significant contribution in subjects like physics back down?<p>I don&#x27;t know, but I hope so. :)<p>Edit. I also remember reading thoughts by either Michael Nielsen on the increasing age of Nobel-worthy contributions in physics, but I can&#x27;t find it in my current sleep deprived state. I shall tomorrow if somebody else hasn&#x27;t pointed to that article by then.')
