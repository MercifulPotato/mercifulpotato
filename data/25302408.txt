If you want to create a real-time video light-field, MPIs are very fast to render. Although MPIs require a large amount of memory&#x2F;RAM, rendering them is very fast. In comparison, NeRFs take very little space but rendering in real-time would be challenging at the moment as the NN is an implicit representation of the scene and you need to call the NN multiple times to render each pixel.')
