Item(by='lambdatronics', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607544989, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25356725, text='&gt;We call that &quot;science&quot; mostly because it is a state funded project.<p>Interesting perspective.  I agree that arguably most of the difficulties are more in the applied side of things, although calling it engineering might be going too far.<p>The big looming physics uncertainty is crossing the &#x27;burning plasma&#x27; threshold, where the plasma becomes dominantly self-heating.  There are two aspects to this: (1) will the plasma settle into a nice self-consistent steady state?  (2) will the large quantity of fast fusion-born helium nuclei destabilize the plasma in an unexpected way?  Theory says it should work, but the proof is in the experiment (which is why SPARC &amp; ITER are being built).')
