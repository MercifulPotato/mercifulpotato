This is because our lizard brains have evolved over millions of years in environment where linear processes were the most important to understand for survival. When we see a lion that is 1 mile away we know that we have 2x the time to run away than when the lion is .5 miles away.<p>So when we see a crappy project that took a few months to create, we naturally assume that it will be slightly less crappy in a few more months. We can&#x27;t even imagine what it would look like if it was 100x more useful in 9 months. Even PG and other great early investors only have a slight notion of what that would look like.')
