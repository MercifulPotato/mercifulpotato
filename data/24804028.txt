Social media platforms can easily argue that their moderation already follows similar principles. It just happens that they deal with content, not raw bits, so they have to moderate content.<p>You also didn&#x27;t address my other point, which is that ISPs aren&#x27;t common carriers at all and <i>this same FCC</i> voted to make it so. So this seems pretty hypocritical behavior on their part.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;47&#x2F;153" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;47&#x2F;153</a>')
