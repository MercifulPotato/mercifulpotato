Others are passionate about solving whatever particular problem their project solves.<p>A simple thought experiment - think about the most widely used libraries and tools across the whole developer ecosystem. How many are built in Haskell? I count maybe one, Pandoc. How many are built in terrible code bases and languages but chug along anyways? I count thousands. How many wildly successful companies have pristine code bases and how many have trash fire code bases that chug along anyways?')
