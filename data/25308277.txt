On the one hand, it cannot be infringed unless there is someone else there to infringe it.  On the other hand, if you exist within any society (the default position of all human beings throughout history), then this right requires active protection to maintain.<p>Overall, I don&#x27;t think it is a useful distinction to make.  For either type of human right, there are cooperative agreements needed in order to maintain those rights.')
