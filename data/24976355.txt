Item(by='Zancarius', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604378453, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24975008, text='&gt; It wasnâ€™t so recent, but as you said things take some time to heal.<p>It does. Even last month (this ended in May--just 4 days after my birthday) I had a regression catching myself thinking about things. Usually little things. Stupid little things. Maybe I&#x27;d across something funny and thought briefly about sharing it with her only to realize that cutting off <i>all</i> communication is a one-way street. You can&#x27;t go back. If you do, you risk opening those old wounds.<p>I know this isn&#x27;t a popular place to say this, so I won&#x27;t dwell on it, but what helped me immensely was getting back into church. Networking with other people whose compassion gave me an outlet was a tremendous relief.<p>I think that&#x27;s the real key though: Having a support network is the most <i>important</i> keystone in paving a road to success after personal hurt. It&#x27;s not easy, and you&#x27;re right--it takes a lot of time. A dear friend whom I made through this told me, using his own experiences (he lost his son just 2 years ago) as a guide: You can get bitter or you can get <i>better</i>. It&#x27;s a choice.<p>&gt; you think you have to fix the broken relationship at any cost<p>This really hit home. Mine wasn&#x27;t <i>bad</i> (or abusive), but even in spite of it, I felt <i>exactly</i> that way. If things went south for whatever reason, I wanted nothing more than to recover it back to the prior state. Love is hard, but the fear of <i>losing</i> that love is even harder.<p>Honestly, if I were smart, there were a number of red flags that should&#x27;ve been an indication I needed escape the situation. But, I wasn&#x27;t. I fully accept that my choices were entirely stupid and motivated by the fact that <i>I</i> didn&#x27;t want to hurt <i>her</i>. (It sounds ridiculous typing this out since I feel I&#x27;m just trying to rationalize it <i>ex post facto</i>, but it&#x27;s how I felt at the time.)<p>&gt; And that leads to toxicity and being taken advantage of.<p>...even if sometimes that &quot;being taken advantage of&quot; is strictly emotional!<p>I think what made it worse for me was that we were very close friends before the relationship started, and during it. Losing a romantic interest is one thing; losing someone who was your best friend for so long? That&#x27;s much harder. The only way I could mentally rationalize it in the beginning was to pretend she passed away. In a strange series of mental gymnastics, I guess she did. She transformed into someone I didn&#x27;t recognize (fancy title in front of her name; justified treating me differently), and that friend I had for so long honestly did die--at her own hands.<p>I know that as this post ages, there&#x27;ll be others who stumble on it and wonder why the heck I typed all this out. Then there&#x27;ll be those few who read our conversation here and realize that, yes!, things really do get better. It hurts. It sucks. You&#x27;ll dwell on it for a while. But you can&#x27;t dwell on it forever! For my part, a new gal has taken my interest from church, and I&#x27;m hoping to grow a new friendship just to see where the path leads. I was worried I wouldn&#x27;t keep my heart open to such things; but, I realized that if I closed it off, I was letting that other person inflict harm on my future relationships. That&#x27;s not fair to anyone, and it&#x27;s giving a person who&#x27;s no longer in my life <i>far too much control</i> that they don&#x27;t deserve.<p>I&#x27;m going to cherish that poem. Ironically, I hadn&#x27;t intended to browse HN tonight, then came across this headline.<p>Sorry about the lengthy post. Your comment really impacted me and made me take a moment to reflect on <i>everything</i>.<p>Thank you so much!')
