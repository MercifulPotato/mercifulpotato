Item(by='gaius_baltar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610734195, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25793621, text='I wonder if it would be possible to have an user migration between servers without cooperation from the <i>origin</i> server. This would allow users to move to a new one without losing track of existing conversations.<p>Seems crazy, but the reason we can&#x27;t do this with email is the lack of a generally agreed identity for an user account that does not depend on the server itself. Signal accounts have a &quot;master&quot; key that can provide this and it&#x27;s only stored in the device and backups (it&#x27;s the most trusted of all keys, after all).<p>A sketch:<p>- User creates an initial account on server X (account: user@serverX.org), the procedure includes signing a message saying &quot;I use server X since $TIMESTAMP and this is the 1st server that I use&quot;;<p>- Everything works as now.<p>- User wants to change server, so they signs a new message &quot;I use server Y since $TIMESTAMP and this is the 2nd server that I use&quot; (account: user@serverY.org); this message is sent to all chats&#x2F;groups&#x2F;contacts and to the old server (as an information only, it may be already down or be non-cooperative). Contacts update the server part of the account and start sending messages through the new one.  Maybe the user can still try to contact the old server for a while, for the event it delivers a message from a account that didn&#x27;t get the first, but at some moment all users will get the new address.<p>- Notice: I have no idea of how this can work with sealed senders of other metadata-prevention measures that Signal uses and we all love.')
