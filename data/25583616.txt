If some guy somewhere else was gonna die and you make an intervention where I&#x27;m more likely to die then that doesn&#x27;t work for me. I will oppose it to the end of my being (after all, the alternative is the end of my being).<p>That is, if you take all the deaths from sleepy drivers, drunk drivers, angry drivers and replace them with random chance then I can no longer increase my chances of survival by not driving at night, not driving on holidays, not driving during commute hours, and avoiding shoals.<p>Instead now you&#x27;ve taken my ability to increase survival and moved it into the base rate. Nope, I think I&#x27;d accept maybe a thousand other arbitrary people dying before I&#x27;d accept myself dying.')
