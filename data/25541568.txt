However they might personally feel about it, landlords _have_ a lot of power. Some of them use that power to break the law without consequence, presumably when it&#x27;s financially beneficial.<p>To the rest of your comment, it seems you&#x27;re conflating service animals (well trained, won&#x27;t bark all day and night, legally protected, still sometimes banned by unscrupulous landlords) with emotional support animals (undefined training, might bark all day and night, minimal legal protections, often banned even by scrupulous landlords). Is that accurate, or is there something more to your comment that I&#x27;m missing?')
