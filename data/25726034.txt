It must have authentication, respond with an answer inside x milliseconds, It must work with a developer admin interface (see ticket z)<p>Ticket z would be assigned to the web team, and we would work closely on an interface between the API backend and the dev interface.<p>After that, my team would layout and make a high level design. We&#x27;d break that design down into individual &quot;sub epics&quot; and let each dev create and work on tickets as they see fit.')
