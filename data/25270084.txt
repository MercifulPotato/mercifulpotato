I can opt out of their marketing material and everything can be saved locally to an SD Card.<p>In my opinion the hardware prices are cheaper because it&#x27;s sourced out of China and the product is at the lower end but worth every penny. I use to source <i>widgets</i> out of China that were amazing quality. I would have them delivered to my factory in  Canada. The price of the finished product delivered to my factory door step was cheaper than the cost of raw materials in Canada. There were no duties involved since the HS Code of the item was duty free and China had Most Favored Nation Status.<p>So that&#x27;s probably how they do it. The Camera costs them a few of $$ delivered and they sell it for $20 +. The only draw back is that the Chinese copied the design and would be selling in their internal market or markets where Wyze wasn&#x27;t in yet.')
