It is awesome.<p>It was made before we met, so I don&#x27;t have a sense for the cost. As a functional swaddle of memories, it is worth far more than a blanket from the store.<p>One thought for those considering it -- the shirts can&#x27;t be completely worn out. A threadbare shirt will make a threadbare quilt.')
