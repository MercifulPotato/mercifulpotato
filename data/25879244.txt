I&#x27;m not sure I know what exactly the concept behind sprouted fodder is, and who would stand to profit from such a scam. Maybe You could explain the details?<p>I do throw whole wheat grains into my chicken run&#x27;s deep litter every time I put a new layer of chips or hay down. I personally do this more to encourage the hens to scratch for sprouts and fermented seeds. IMHO this scratching has value as it keeps the birds active in cold months and keeps the bedding compaction down which makes spring cleanout easier but I also believe it provides some benificial nutrients.<p>Silage tarps over hay, especially hay that didn&#x27;t get cut before heading out due to wet weather, results in sprouted fodder of sorts and that definitely increases the  nutritional value of seedy hay.')
