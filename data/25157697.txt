Oauth regularly opens Safari on mobile and Firefox on OS X for me; it&#x27;s not clear that this move itself is forcing users to chrome per se.<p>If they&#x27;re blocking non-popular browsers, that&#x27;s obviously a problem. But if they&#x27;ll let users open Firefox or Safari, then it seems fairly obvious to me that this is a mistake more than a sinister plan to drive Chrome adoption forward. After all, if they were trying to drive Chrome forward why would they push me more towards Safari?')
