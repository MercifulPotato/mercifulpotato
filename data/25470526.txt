I was courted by a company a couple of years ago to join their engineering team and I was pretty set on joining the company until I spoke with a former employee who told me that this company had reneged on giving him the option to purchase his ISOs because they didn&#x27;t like that he was leaving after two years.<p>That&#x27;s completely unacceptable behavior for a company, and it completely changed the way I look at equity. A company can&#x27;t come at for my already-cashed paychecks, but they can absolutely prevent me from purchasing my options for pretty much any reason.')
