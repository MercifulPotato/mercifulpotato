Like a lower power version of this <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;WAI7Lu4UFi4?t=825" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;WAI7Lu4UFi4?t=825</a> basically long distance frying of ants with a magnifying glass.<p>Sand grains suffer from a large surface area relative to their mass, so their speed would drop off very quickly.  I have one of those bug-a-salt guns and they kinda suck at anything more than 10 feet (also bugs seem to be pretty resilient to that kind of damage).  Obviously you could make one that is more precise but I feel like there would be a lot of new variables to deal with.<p>Some kind of beam steering ultrasonic setup might work as well (although probably expensive)  If you can get 10-15 transducers to pop off a precisely timed 5W burst of say 60kHz sound such that they constructively interfere at the critter, you might be able to get them to disassemble in air without any moving parts on your rig.')
