One is used for querying the HTML DOM with Javascript, the other one in libxml2 is only used for XSLT transformations. (XSLT support is the main reason why Chrome still uses libxml2. If they weren&#x27;t relying libxslt which in turn requires libxml2, they would probably switch to a better suited XML parser like Expat or write their own.)')
