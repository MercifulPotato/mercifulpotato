They’re absolutely 100% not. The average driver is a complete moron. Go spend 10 minutes scrolling the &#x2F;r&#x2F;IdiotsInCars subreddit to get a feel for what I’m talking about.<p>So no, I don’t think TSLA is being irresponsible in their FSD rollout. At worst it’s equivalent to the average human driver.')
