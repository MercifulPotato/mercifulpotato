Letters kept have always been accessible.<p>The fact that they may be accessed by law enforcement agencies in specific circumstances does not mean that they are not private.<p>If you are seeking <i>absolute</i> privacy <i>for all time</i>, i.e. absolute secrecy, the only option now and since writing was invented is to leave no trace: either communicate face to face discreetly or hand deliver letters and destroy them after reading.<p>What has changed recently is that we are effectively communicating in writing for virtually everything (even a voice call is affectively &quot;in writing&quot; as it&#x27;s data stored on a medium) and that the cost of storing those writings has dropped to zero. In addition, and that&#x27;s the issue, encryption has reached a stage where what I suggested (to hand deliver letters and to destroy them after reading) has become &#x27;easy&#x27; and cheap for all communications if you want to, which creates big problems for law enforcement and security agencies.<p>I think this is a legitimate issue. The level of the debate, for example in this thread, is low and not helpful because, at least in some tech circles, people refuse to acknowledge real world issues and there is an extreme and utopian view than anything less than absolute secrecy is absolutely unacceptable.')
