There appears to be a whole movement of youtubers doing movie critics who pretty much agree that modern productions have very bad story telling.  Some of these are indeed a bit older, and that might be a reason why &quot;we&quot; agree.<p>But when I add my personal experience to the analysis, I can only say that I basically stopped watching TV a few years ago because I couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore.  Action filled stuff is so needlessly loud and over the top, and the story telling indeed feels very shallow to me.  In a sense, I miss the times when technology wasn&#x27;t so advanced and movie makers actually had to make up for that by a good story and nice pacing.\nI think Interstellar was the last movie I enjoyed watching.  The industry basically lost me as a consumer.')
