Maybe Proverbs chapter 6 [1]? I think that would enhance the discussion (even if this subthread would become a bit of a tangent). It&#x27;s generally good to go to the primary source even if you don&#x27;t follow the religion in question.<p>If we are talking about Proverbs 6, then -- what it has to say &#x2F;could&#x2F; be spun as misogynistic, but it isn&#x27;t very, really: The message (in regards to women) is to avoid adultery; the metaphor is that practicing adultery will cost you much more than visiting a prostitute (of which it presumably also does not approve). It is the kind of thing you could imagine a mother, nanna, auntie, or babushka giving to a young man as advice. Seems commonsensical enough.<p>If you had something else in mind though, it would be great if you could share.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biblegateway.com&#x2F;passage&#x2F;?search=Proverbs+6&amp;version=ESV" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biblegateway.com&#x2F;passage&#x2F;?search=Proverbs+6&amp;vers...</a>')
