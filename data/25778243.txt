But that is not the case, supplementation of various vitamins and minerals, specifically over supplementation have been shown to have risks. For example, Vitamin C is linked to increase iron absorption, and higher iron levels have been correlated with high risk of Alzheimer&#x27;s. I&#x27;d much rather have Parkinson&#x27;s than Alzheimer&#x27;s.')
