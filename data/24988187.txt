The screen is basically &quot;torn&quot; between two or more states and you need to draw another complete frame to bring it back in sync. Not a problem in a game where you redraw everything at 60fps anyway, but not so good for a classical GUI toolkit.<p>Edit: I guess you could partially solve this problem by double-buffering the application state, so during the first draw you update a state copy, and during the second draw you use the updated state. You won&#x27;t get any &quot;tearing&quot; but you still need to draw twice.')
