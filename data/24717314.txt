Good luck getting 7bn people to properly dispose of their trash...<p>* I don&#x27;t think you can call it sequestering carbon if the carbon was never in the air to start with. And that&#x27;s assuming no one starts burning their trash<p>* you still need to extract a lot of oil to make that plastic. That means emissions and pollution and sending money to shitty regimes. Then you have to process the oil into plastic with more emissions and pollution etc.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone serious thinks all plastic should be banned. It just needs to be used more responsibly. I bought some ham today. Each slice had a plastic sheet separating it from the others (why?). Then 6 slices were in a plastic packet. I got a twin pack so that was 2 packs wrapped in more plastic. Then the cashier looked at me like I was crazy when I declined a plastic bag to carry it in. Do we really need 4 layers of non-reusable protection from cooked ham? Could paper or reusable plastic not have done at least some of those jobs? I think we&#x27;re still stuck with conspicuous consumption models from the 80s where people wanted that. I don&#x27;t want that.<p>&#x2F;rant<p>More generally, I agree about landfill.<p>Thanks for reading')
