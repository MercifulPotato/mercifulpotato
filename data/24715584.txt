Yes, the problem we&#x27;re facing is that the virus is going to be terrible for humanity and for the economy. There&#x27;s no way around that. There are no good answers. No matter what we do, many people will die and many more will lose their livelihoods and their lives&#x27; work.<p>The question before us is to find the <i>least bad</i> answer - how do we save as many lives and livelihoods as possible? Of course every possible answer (including &quot;do nothing and attempt to disclaim moral responsibility,&quot; which several governments seem to prefer) has a terrible cost. Some of those options are relatively less terrible.<p>(Personally, I think the city should lock down aggressively and also aggressively provide monetary relief to people negatively impacted, through taking on debt if needed, and figure it out later. If we don&#x27;t survive this, the city loses its tax base anyway.)')
