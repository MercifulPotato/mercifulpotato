I should reflexively question covid studies saying how dangerous it is because in my own experience it&#x27;s not even worth making a fuss over?<p>Should you question them?  Yes.<p>Should you let your own experience and that of a few people around you override what you see to be a rigorous statistical study because you questioned it and looked into it?  No.  If you look into it and have serious questions about the rigor of the study?  Maybe.  Is that the case in the Covid studies?  Probably not.<p>Whether this is about Covid or anything else, the important thing is to be able to asses information as it comes in and reassess your position based on the data available to you.  Anecdotal data is invaluable and used by everyone every day to make decisions prior to receiving good outside rigorous data, because for many things we don&#x27;t have good outside rigorous data.')
