Similarly, being prosocial – acting kindly, cooperatively and with compassion toward others – is also significantly linked with higher wellbeing.<p>&gt; Maybe the comparison between &quot;dark traits&quot; and &quot;light personalities&quot; yields this, but its been shown pretty consistently that higher agreeableness (more empathy) has a negative effect on salary, primarily for women.<p>You seem to be comparing apples and oranges: I do not think &quot;higher wellbeing&quot; is the same thing as &quot;higher salary,&quot; and whatever correlation there is due to the stress of being poor (and thus is less and less signficant as salary progresses past a minimum threshold).')
