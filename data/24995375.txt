And most of those who were born into it have either bought and built their farm over their entire life or inherited it. It&#x27;s hard to make a living selling farm products when you have a mortgage payment and you are competing with people who don&#x27;t and also with people who are more than happy to make near nothing as they are mostly living on pensions and social security anyway.<p>We have lots of farmland in my family that is passed down. It&#x27;s a beef cattle ranch. And it&#x27;s really not even that profitable even though the land is fully paid for. My grandparents farmed it their whole lives, but they also worked as teachers and now get that pension as well as social security. The farm is more of a way of life than a way to make a good living.')
