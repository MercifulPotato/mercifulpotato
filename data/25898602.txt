Else you can&#x27;t get Euclidian distance, for example.<p>By this token, classic Doom is already non-Euclidean because of teleports.<p>What people often want when they ask for non-Euclidean is a curved space, like, well, the surface of a globe. Or maybe a torus. Or space being infinitely repeated while looking flat (also much like a torus). Some kind of hyperbolic geometry could be fun but likely too mind-boggling.<p>(The ultimate in non-Euclidean worlds I&#x27;ve seen so far in games is the paradoxical space of Monument Valley.)')
