Most of its white collar jobs are concentrated in one small area (in contrast to other regions which are more distributed) and it has the infrastructure of a much smaller city. The local government believes in only expanding transit infrastructure while leaving roads and bridges to rot, and so far their actions haven&#x27;t improved travel times at all but they do certainly cost an enormous amount: the most recent ballot proposition allocated almost a billion dollars per mile of rail.<p>I&#x27;ve found this urban design has created isolated neighborhoods where people without cars refuse to travel more than a mile away from home. An example that comes to mind is friends living in Capitol Hill refusing to visit any restaurant in Fremont, a distance of around 3.5 miles with both locations being located directly on highly trafficked bus lines, but if offered a ride (in a car) they would come. For comparison, when in the car-centric cities I lived in, people were willing to travel anywhere in the metro area. Now this is just a few pieces of anecdotal evidence, and you may reply with examples of people who behave completely differently, but it&#x27;s no better to assume that everyone hates driving and living less dense areas just because you personally dislike them. I prefer living in an area that doesn&#x27;t hate cars with a passion, and I&#x27;m far from the only one who thinks so.')
