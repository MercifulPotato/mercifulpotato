I’m not an audio expert, but I do know what I like, and I love the way these headphones sound. They make music sound rich and make movies sound very real.<p>It is almost impossible to wear a $550 device on your ears and not become immediately biased about how &quot;real&quot; the sounds are.<p>The better way would be with a double blind test. Would require some sort of device to conceal both the brand <i>and</i> the weight of the damn thing hah.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the headphones end up being in line with the rest of the existing offer from other brands.')
