The primary mission of any capitalist company is to make their biggest investors and founders a lot of money, and you shouldn&#x27;t forget that.<p>While some exceptions do exist (I actually think your SpaceX example is a very good one - Musk has pointed out, rightfully IMO, that if he just wanted to get richer there are easier ways to do it), they are few and far between. VCs and investors largely depend on the &quot;mission&quot; myth solely as a motivational tool to get employees to work harder.')
