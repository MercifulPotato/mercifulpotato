I notice I lose from people that I otherwise wouldn&#x27;t lose from when I:<p>- am tired,<p>- have very cold hands,<p>- or just used gross motor skills (cycling for example).<p>The effect of each of these is similar to not playing for a few months. You don&#x27;t unlearn it so you&#x27;re not like a newb, but your playing is hampered in some way. If my hands were unaffected by cold then this shouldn&#x27;t have an effect.')
