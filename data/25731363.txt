Item(by='DCKing', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610383078, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25728930, text='&gt; Apples old hardware isn&#x27;t all that closed - most models have enough exploits it&#x27;s very possible to get your own low level code running.<p>This might be semantics, but the fact that unlocking the bootloader or running code with the highest level of privilege on an iPhone requires exploits in the first place is a pretty big sign that these platforms are <i>pretty closed</i>. Checkra1n is very nice but this is an oversight that Apple is unlikely to make again (the only way Checkra1n was found in the first place was Apple fixing the underlying issue on Apple A12 devices anyway).<p>Unfortunately I think the existence of Apple&#x27;s Security Researcher Device program squashes any hopes that Apple would consider opening up store bought devices any further. The only real way I see Apple opening iDevices if some regulation to that effect would be enforced, but I don&#x27;t see that happening any time soon either.')
