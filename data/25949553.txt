Robinhood sells order flow to a number of market makers, one of which is Citadel Securities [1]. Citadel Securities is part of the Citadel group, which consists of a hedge fund (Citadel LLC) and a market making firm (Citadel Securities LLC) [2]. While both companies are owned by Ken Griffin and share many resources, they are split by a &quot;Chinese Wall&quot; [3] to prevent any conflict of interest between both sides of the firm. They also have different CEOs, management, employees, infrastructure, etc. as a result of this. Now, Citadel (the hedge fund) has invested $2 billion into Melvin Capital, which is one of the firms central to the whole issue [4]. Yet Melvin Capital has already closed its position in GME [5], which means that they no longer have a vested interest in the performance of GME.<p>There are several glaring problems with the theory that Citadel is pushing for Robinhood to ban buying GME for financial motives:<p>1. Robinhood has NO relationship with Citadel LLC<p>2. Everybody knows about the theoretical conflict of interest between Citadel&#x2F;Citadel Securities so it is incredibly unlikely that Citadel Securities would risk doing anything to help Citadel in such a high profile scenario (i.e. the SEC&#x2F;FINRA would be able to find out this kind of thing very quickly and very easily)<p>3. Citadel has no financial motive to stop trading of GME, because Melvin Capital has no financial motive to stop trading of GME<p>4. If it was as simple as trying to profit off of GME going down, why would they bother halting trades on other securities (AMC, BB, NOK, BBBY, etc.)?<p>This article does a really good job at explaining the situation (much better than I can do) [6]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.robinhood.com&#x2F;assets&#x2F;robinhood&#x2F;legal&#x2F;RHF%20SEC%20Rule%20606%20and%20607%20Disclosure.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.robinhood.com&#x2F;assets&#x2F;robinhood&#x2F;legal&#x2F;RHF%20SEC%2...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chicagobusiness.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;20170203&#x2F;NEWS01&#x2F;170209978&#x2F;chicago-billionaire-ken-griffin-splits-citadel-into-two-companies" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chicagobusiness.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;20170203&#x2F;NEWS01&#x2F;1702...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;c&#x2F;chinesewall.asp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;c&#x2F;chinesewall.asp</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-...</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-gamestop-melvin-idUSKBN29X0EN" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-gamestop-melvin-idUSKBN29...</a><p>[6] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;finance.yahoo.com&#x2F;video&#x2F;heres-why-robinhood-restricting-users-173049721.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;finance.yahoo.com&#x2F;video&#x2F;heres-why-robinhood-restrict...</a>')
