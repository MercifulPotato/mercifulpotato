Your comment could be interpreted to mean just taxing income from US investments while living abroad, for example (which would be more reasonable, but still over-reaching). Taxing worldwide income is also done by a few other countries but only the IRS has the bizarre extra reach into overseas banking data (that I know of, at least).')
