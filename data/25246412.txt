Maintaining such a vital yet support-needy project seems like it was taking quite a toll.<p>I love this &quot;A better Kubernetes&quot; theorcrafting but the post I really really want to see from Dave is &quot;A better MetalLB&quot;. The indie operators everywhere would love to have some sights on what a better MetalLB might look like.')
