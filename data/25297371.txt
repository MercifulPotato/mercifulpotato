Poor mixing and it made it harder to multitask. Sometimes I have to look at my phone watching TV or something and I might not totally comprehend a line, but then I can quickly glance up and read it. At this point it&#x27;s subconscious. This also enables me to enjoy foreign films and shows a lot more, since I&#x27;m so used to reading subtitles already. I watched &quot;To the Lake&quot; on Netflix a few weeks ago and enjoyed it more than I thought I would after seeing it was all in Russian. That experience opened me up to watching more foreign live-action TV and I&#x27;m getting back into anime again. Come to think of it, I&#x27;ve watched subs anime for most of my life. There are only a few series that I think the English VAs are better than the original Japanese ones.<p>The only genre I do not turn subtitles on for, is stand-up comedy, for obvious reasons.')
