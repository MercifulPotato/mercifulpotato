At the same time, deep down, I think many of us have also learned the truth:<p>If there is some startup providing some ridiculously awesome service and strangly isnt charging:<p>1. It will charge in the future, and even that charge may not be sufficient to cover costs (see: Quantopian recently, apparently could not find a price point which kept users and also kept the service)<p>2. It may get acquired, to finance long-term profitability (see: YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram)<p>3. You may be giving up more than you thought you were (e.g., privacy) (see: like half the social media startups)<p>4. It may get acquihired, and often the product is sunset (see: Slide, Parse)<p>5. It may shut down (see: like 95% of your friends startups)<p>As a former founder, I can say most startups are just one funding round away from case 5 (bankruptcy) -- see MapR. In which case, sometimes you accept case 4 (acquihire) as a consolation prize. Many of us want to be the next FAANG, but reality strikes that obviously not all 100,000 startups out there will become a fang. Often, you teeter in case 1 (barely making it), and if that happens too long, you might go with option 2 (strategic acquisition.)<p>There are a lot of problems as a founder. Not all of them are actually about tech. I&#x27;ll list some problems:<p>1. You are constantly questioning yourself -- is life just about eating ramen noodles and working? Did I really study and get top grades for 20yrs only to barely life? Mabye I can sell out. This should not be a problem post Series A, but is def an early stage issue.<p>2. You have liabilities - student loans, healthcare, rent, etc. Sure, you can couch surf, but should that be expected of people?<p>3. After marketing and ads especially, you often dont make as much as you think.<p>Sometimes you make a limited time bet, and if things dont catch, you move on.')
