Isn&#x27;t the usual derivation of MCMC methods based on <i>equilibrium</i> distribution of the chain? So you either need to run the chain for a (unknowably) long time to achieve equilibrium (hence burn-in) or start from an equilibrium distribution - but if you knew that, you wouldn&#x27;t be running MCMC. And sure, we can never tell the chain has achieved equilibrium, but that&#x27;s better than calling any odd point &#x27;equilibrium&#x27;.<p>He does mention this stream of thought but dismisses it out of hand, without an explanation.')
