Your options are<p>(1) block a domain from camera&#x2F;mic access<p>(2) give a domain camera&#x2F;mic access forever<p>2 is what people pick. From that point on, that domain, in an iframe, can turn on your camera&#x2F;mic. That means if messanger.com or meet.google.com or zoom.com wanted to make zoom.com&#x2F;embed&#x2F;this&#x2F;url&#x2F;as&#x2F;iframe&#x2F;to&#x2F;spy&#x2F;on&#x2F;people.html they could, and then sell that service for ads to embed in their ads. They have the permissions needed to turn on the mic&#x2F;camera whenever they want at that point, no more questions asked.<p>That bugs me.<p>Firefox at least has &quot;allow camera access once&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t know what a better solution is. One might be mic&#x2F;camera permission per URL instead of domain. I supposed that&#x27;s not really any different if you can just append ?dothespything=true<p>Another might just be that it always asks. It&#x27;s not like the phone feature of a smartphone has the option to just always answer immediately. Instead you choose whether or not the take the call. Does it need to be any different on a webpage?<p>PS: I like that webpages have this feature. I like that I can video chat&#x2F;conference in a sandboxed environment instead of having to install a native app that can spy on me in other ways too. I just wish this permission issue worked differently.')
