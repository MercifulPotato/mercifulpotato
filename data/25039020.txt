The maintainer now accepts donations and makes a considerable sum. I got none of that. Personally, it left a bad taste in my mouth. I maintain a private fork now, because I don&#x27;t like the idea of someone profiting off my rare nights and weekend work. It would be one thing if he recognized the work and&#x2F;or gave back to the contributors in some way, but they don&#x27;t... so I stopped contributing publically.')
