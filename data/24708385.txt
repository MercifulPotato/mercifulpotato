Because it&#x27;s just vanilla HTTP, users don&#x27;t need do things like connecting to P2P networks and the app looks just like a regular web app, except that every API is signed by the user Bitcoin wallet.<p>Note that the HTTP requests are serialized and stored as OFFCHAIN Bitcoin transactions by default and never bloats up the blockchain. Optionally, the offchain transactions can be compressed into a transaction id bundle and timestamped on the blockchain as well as taking advantage of the programmability and payment ability of the Bitcoin script itself, but by default it&#x27;s all offchain, yet still achieves decentralization and trustless replication of HTTP requests.<p>The reference client is almost ready and just wanted to get it out there to see who&#x27;s interested. Thank you for taking a look.')
