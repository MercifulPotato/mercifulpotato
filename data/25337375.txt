It&#x27;s getting so much debate! I think everybody understands that she gave an ultimatum that included a &quot;or else I will resign.&quot; I think everybody understands that Google responded with a &quot;you are out as of now&quot; that took her by surprise.<p>And yet there are a bazillion articles debating what verb best describes that pair of events. I get that there is legal relevance, and let the lawyers argue that one. But the rest of this seems to be a court of public opinion thing, in which case it should have no relevance given that everyone is agreed on the facts. Why do we care so much about the one-word linguistics of it? How about you just don&#x27;t use a single verb alone, and instead spend the literally two sentences it takes to explain that part?')
