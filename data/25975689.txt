I may be a terrible person, but I don&#x27;t really keep track of the other intervals; if something needs doing, it&#x27;ll likely come up when in for the oil change or make a terrible noise.<p>Also, the just off lease C-max was very inexpensive, and gets huge gas mileage, so even if it explodes, whatever. It got me a carpool sticker for a year too.')
