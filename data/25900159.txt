Japan had several dominant consumer brands and was considered an AI pioneer.<p>But Japan lost its way when transitioning from pre-Internet hardware products to &quot;software with hardware.&quot;<p>So today the interest is probably about reading anime subtitles, or having a Japanese gf.<p>I studied Japanese in SV at the Jetro-related classes, and worked in Japan briefly.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jetro.go.jp&#x2F;usa&#x2F;topics&#x2F;jetro-connects-japanese-startups-with-silicon-valley-investors-at-techmatch-019.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jetro.go.jp&#x2F;usa&#x2F;topics&#x2F;jetro-connects-japanese-s...</a><p>What&#x27;s interesting is that although Japanese non-work culture is roughly opposite that of the West in many ways, it seems we share a &quot;Protestant-like&quot; or at least secular work ethic that is results-driven.<p>You can see that in WW2 - the Japanese Navy was able to build itself into a world power that was briefly equal to the US Navy, and the Battle of the Coral Sea was roughly a draw.<p>Where the cultural values differed was at the very top of leadership, and ultimately the US had aggressive, independent naval commanders, and Japan had Yamamoto (a rebel who couldn&#x27;t communicate his plans effectively to traditionalists) and Admiral Nagumo (a traditional, hesitant commander who was both inflexible and unlucky - he refused to do a third wave at Pearl Harbor, and he thought the Battle of Midway was primarily intended to capture Midway!)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ch%C5%ABichi_Nagumo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ch%C5%ABichi_Nagumo</a>')
