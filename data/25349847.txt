For any given decision, there&#x27;s a universe of choices - some choices are moral and others are immoral.  &quot;Dark&quot; people can choose from the entire universe of choices, while &quot;light&quot; people can only choose from the moral universe of choices.<p>It should be obvious, then, that people with &quot;dark traits&quot; are more likely to be successful iff they learn to cover up their dark traits.  After all, having greater optionality in your actions is likely to lead to a more optimal path towards your goal.<p>From my experience working with people that run high in these &quot;dark traits&quot;, it&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing as long as you put them in positions where their incentives are aligned with those around them.')
