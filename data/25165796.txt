I don&#x27;t remember when this was removed, but I haven&#x27;t used it 10+ years. Somehow I doubt the new Chat will work the way it used to, but I hope so.<p>EDIT 2 (off topic): I tried to look at Google Chat, but first Google wanted me to answer some survey questions, so I agreed to. There&#x27;s no (apparent) way to navigate the survey questions or revise your replies. I clicked through one question accidentally without answering it. For another question, I mistakenly answered the opposite of what I meant to. Garbage-in, garbage-out.<p>EDIT 3: After clicking &quot;Get Started&quot; in Google Chat, it appears this is only for groups a la Slack. Why can&#x27;t I just IM other people with gmail addresses in my address book?')
