Item(by='RestlessMind', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612202593, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25987551, text='&gt; but as far as I can tell, they dislike it because it&#x27;s big and they don&#x27;t understand what it does.<p>Please step out of your bubble and talk to more people. I have a decent understanding of what the big finance does and I still dislike it for the way it was treated after 2008. &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; made the bank in the run up to 2008 and when the bill came due, hardly anyone was punished.<p>Some specific examples of the &quot;rigged game&quot; - USA jails someone for possessing marijuana a few times or gaslights someone all the way to his suicide for downloading and distributing copyrighted articles. But credit rating agencies are let go easily even if they give AAA rating to MBS tranches deserving a junk rating.<p>Same with investment banks who knew the mortgage bubble was about to collapse but nonetheless sold those securities to their clients. Individuals at such firms made millions from 2003-2007, but when they were caught, not a single one of them went to jail and instead, the companies had to cough up a few billions.<p>Same with Wall Street getting billions in bailout and trillions in implicit guarantees from Fed (&quot;bazooka&quot;, ZIRP, QEs), but Main Street getting measly aid in a weak-sauce 2009 stimulus.<p>So yes, the game is indeed rigged and Big Finance deserves all the pitchforks coming its way.')
