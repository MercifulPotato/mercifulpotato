Silicon chips are very detailed and any small change could make them stop working. So the heat applied needs to be below some threshold (i.e. don’t let it get too hot).<p>If the chip needs more wattage it creates more heat and that heat needs a “heat sink” and fan to protect the chip from degrading.<p>Heat sinks and fans require a lot of space, high surface area to volume ratios. Take a look at the PS5 tear down, 90% of the insides are a heat sink. Laptops and phones don’t have a lot of room for heat sinks or fans.<p>Therefore, if the chip can use less wattage then it will get less hot. Meaning it can work better in “fan-less” devices like the MacBook Air and the iPhone and iPad.')
