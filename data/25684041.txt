It&#x27;s fine as long as you don&#x27;t need high efficiency or specialized functionality.<p>Mathematica has no serious competition as a general-purpose symbolic system. I guess Maple is the closest runner-up, but it&#x27;s more narrowly focused on computer algebra. Most people only need a fraction of Mathematica to get their work done, though.')
