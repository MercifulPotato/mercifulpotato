Item(by='amluto', descendants=None, kids=[25609527], score=None, time=1609552564, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25609266, text='&gt; When I suggested free market vaccine allocation on top of government distribution, critics lambasted me.<p>I think this misses the point a bit.  I think the CDC’s allocation is just fine — the main problem is that it’s being implemented slowly. Just about any carefully planned allocation will be slow. Sell to the highest bidder?  Slow. Sell for $20?  Faster, but still slow.  Compare the way most vaccines are given in an office to the way that mass flu vaccines are done.<p>If I were running the show, I would choose categories.  The categories don’t matter that much — suppose, for the sake of argument, that it’s (1) patient-facing medical personnel, (2) people over 75, (3) people at high risk, self-certified, etc.<p>Now, in each region, you open up vaccinations by group. Medical centers can run walk-through or drive-through vaccinations, and people in the relevant group line up and get the vaccine. Someone scans ID and types in name and (if available) DOB for people without ID and hands out the info flyer. A handful of technicians give the vaccines.<p>As soon as vaccine lines aren’t getting filled by one group, you open it to the next group.<p>Money is basically irrelevant here. The available production is spoken for and paid for. Trying to allocate carefully is nice, but it’s far more important to give <i>someone</i> the vaccine than to give the right person the vaccine.<p>(Stanford Hospital would have avoided a lot of flak if they did something like this. Randomize the last initials of residents into groups, and give residents the shots by last initial. Then do other groups. Or forget about distinguishing residents from other people — it’s not worth the logistical complications.)')
