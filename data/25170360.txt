I could see code written (poorly) in a dynamic language to be 100x slower than necessary. Maybe it was fast enough when written, so nobody looked too hard. Inefficient DB queries, excessive IO.<p>But I agree with the sentiment. In a code base where performance matters, that level of optimization would often be impractical.')
