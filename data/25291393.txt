That alone seen the driver for Unions moot in many eye&#x27;s, combined with a lack of tech focused Unions and the shift from lifer work mentality to few years being classed a long time at a company.  Times changed and moved faster than many Unions.<p>However, many tech companies grown to the stage that they ain&#x27;t all software engineers and the size&#x2F;scale of them has seen them grow to the stage that some level of check like a Union wouldn&#x27;t go amiss and opinions about unions as a whole been slowly improving in the past few years after decades of disdain.  Thing is, what type of Union and is the need for a larger more tech orientated Union or lots of smaller ones?  That&#x27;s the crux.<p>Though when I started in tech, the worry about competition bugging the water cooler was the edge-case worry, today it&#x27;s the company itself that has become that worry and less of an edge-case as well.  So clearly the use of Unions does have some safety in voice for employee&#x27;s.')
