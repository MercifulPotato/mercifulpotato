I wholeheartedly disagree with Apple&#x27;s wages but for context, Rs 50 - 80 is the price of a full, though street food, meal in many Indian cities.<p>India simply has cheap food and low costs. I know this personally as I live a fairly low-expense life. But I can not imagine a big co paying these ridiculously low wages. This is exactly why rich get and stay richer. Apple has the means to push partners to keep paying low.<p>Apple knows what it is doing.')
