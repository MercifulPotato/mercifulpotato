Item(by='eganist', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606404348, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25220671, text='&gt; A car driver is absolutely responsible for their choice of vehicle, their choice to drive any particular journey, their choice to <i>exceed the speed limit, text, phone, chat, and everything else.</i><p>Just their choices not to drive defensively (the portion I italicized in your statement). The car you choose may be based on specific requirements for life. And the journey you take may be all the same. Would you fault someone for not being able to afford a newer car? I picked a car that exceeds the latest pedestrian safety regulations; would you still grief me just because it&#x27;s an SUV?<p>100% of the fault comes from how a person chooses to drive and keep their car safe (lighting, brakes, capabilities that allow them to drive defensively). I wouldn&#x27;t rob someone of their choice of car because I don&#x27;t know what circumstance necessitated it; it would be selfish of me to tell someone they can&#x27;t drive a pickup when all of their work revolves around it.')
