Fortunately a lot of games on that list (Civilization VI, Prison Architect, FTL, etc) have been ported to tablets, but I’m really waiting on Factorio and Rimworld.<p>I know these small developers don’t have an infinite budget so I don’t expect anything of them unless it makes sense for their team, but unfortunately it does mean I’m less likely to play them. Which is a big shame because I’m pretty sure I would <i>love</i> Factorio.')
