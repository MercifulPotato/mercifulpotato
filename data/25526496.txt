Item(by='DanBC', descendants=None, kids=[25527316], score=None, time=1608807090, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25525569, text='I don&#x27;t use reddit much, so maybe I&#x27;ve got this completely wrong. (But the post doesn&#x27;t say &quot;use reddit&quot;, it says &quot;search reddit&quot;.)<p>Look at frying pans.<p>Reddit will tell you that cast iron is the only option. Carbon steel is wrong (&quot;home burners don&#x27;t get hot enough&quot;, stainless steel is wrong (&quot;too hard for you to use&quot;), aluminium non stick is wrong (&quot;only good for beginners who don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing&quot;), aluminium with ceramic non-stick is wrong (ok, they&#x27;re right about this one).<p>Ask about boots, or hammers, or any of dozens of products.<p>Reddit fetishizes some products and disdains others and there&#x27;s not much reason to it, it&#x27;s mostly memetic.<p>Most redditors don&#x27;t have the money to buy 8 different pans or 7 different pairs of boots. They tend not to work in these industries, so they can&#x27;t give that experienced view point. And most redditors are young so they just haven&#x27;t lived long enough to give a credible review of how long something lasts.<p>A 40 year old person who works with a tool 8 hours a day, and who&#x27;s used a wide range of those over the years, will tend to give a better review than a 20 year old who works with a tool for a few hours a week.')
