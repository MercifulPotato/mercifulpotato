The natural conclusion is that this whole test-first-use-later approach is stupid, and we should have given people the option to use the experimental vaccines without them having been proven effective. Then the pandemic would have been over by now.<p>Of course, it’s even more obvious that delaying the tests for their whiteness has also been stupid. I am not white, and testing other populations matters, but delaying the tests needed for the authorization is just stupid. Humans aren’t that different.')
