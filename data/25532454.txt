You’re right that scaling up 1Mx won’t cut it. That’s because fidelity is still too high. We already know the brain is a very efficient machine for storing heuristics and compressed models. Also related to why it’s prone to err. Information theory is the right framework here imo. Other related concerns: hierarchal organization of information and model comparison.')
