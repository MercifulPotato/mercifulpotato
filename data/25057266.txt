I was a long-term Gentoo user but recently dumped it for NixOS. Colleagues were pushing it and so far I&#x27;m happy. Much less compiling and manual configuration which is what was driving me crazy about Gentoo. It took rather little effort to get the system in a state that feels very comfortable. But my needs have changed over time too, so this isn&#x27;t strictly my opinion on what is best.<p>More than a decade ago a programmer friend got Ubuntu running on a second hand desktop for a rather computer illiterate arts &amp; letters student. He was able to navigate the GUI like any other system, and it had Firefox, OpenOffice, and mplayer. I knew then that Linux is a perfectly fine desktop OS. And now we&#x27;re back to using Debian of a sort. ;-)')
