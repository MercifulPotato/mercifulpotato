On a properly working system, the system clock will track the audio clock quite well. If the audio hardware tells you that it will need more data in x ms, it will be very close to x ms as seen by the CPU. If you use a deadline scheduler, you don’t want to wait for an interrupt — you tell the scheduler that you need to run before a specific deadline, and that that.  A hardware interrupt is pure overhead, especially on platforms like x86 with silly interrupt latency.<p>(A good kernel can account for the time it takes to wake from idle and compensate when programming a timer (as could a good CPU, but I’ve never heard of hardware that does this) and can wake a user program a bit early if the CPU is otherwise idle and would take a short nap.  A sound hardware interrupt can’t do these tricks.)')
