I’d open a bookmark to a page with a simple table listing of all issues assigned to me.<p>I don’t know what the heck is going on, now the ui is this awful &quot;modern clean&quot; style with popups everywhere, sidebars, everytime i look at an issue it’s cramped in a tiny column, or i have to open in a new page. The whole ui is so slow and clunky, you have to expand&#x2F;collapse content all 5he time. All in the name of what? Is scrolling down a page so difficult for a user? How does Amazon make money?')
