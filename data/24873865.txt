(And, while there is an new update to the app, I haven&#x27;t installed it yet, so its not an app update.)<p>&gt; I&#x27;m also wondering about the casting, since I regularly cast (again from the Android app) to my minis at home.<p>Casting works fine from the app (well, playlist bugs excluded), the problem is having to cast from the app for lots of simple tasks where voice commands worked for GPM. As music is part of the bedtime routine for my toddler and preschooler, having everything suddenly be much less straightforward has been...unpleasant.')
