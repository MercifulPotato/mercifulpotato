I was just thinking the other day about what an absolute dumpster fire &quot;the internet&quot; is due to anonymity (obviously that&#x27;s not the _only_ reason, but it&#x27;s a non-trivial reason). This idea that &quot;Let&#x27;s give people the ability to be anonymous, and somehow, that&#x27;s gonna make us all bond together and be better&quot; is pretty hilarious in hindsight. Anonymity seems to just bring the worst out of people (that&#x27;s not a tech problem, that&#x27;s a human&#x2F;culture problem). I would personally love to see a &quot;web&quot; where you have to comment...as your public self. Post messages...as your public self (not just on an individual platform level). So on and so forth.<p>I 1000% agree that eventually people will need some type of unique identifier to operate on the internet. And I&#x27;ll take it a little further and say that in the future, anonymity will be reserved for the wealthy primarily.')
