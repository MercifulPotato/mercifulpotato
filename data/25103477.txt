Item(by='dwild', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605465287, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25096124, text='&gt; Such a &quot;lazy&quot; design is hard to imagine coming out of Apple otherwise.<p>That&#x27;s my biggest issue personally. There&#x27;s a bit of information leak, but most wouldn&#x27;t care and would just do the standard and be done with it. Firefox still uses OCSP in some case...<p>My issue is that a company like Apple, which currently market itself as a company that care about privacy of their user, would have let this comes out of that same process that&#x27;s supposed to care... and still hasn&#x27;t said that was a mistake out of their process and that they are correcting it.<p>They could easily use k-anonymity like HaveIBeenPwned, or even as push, which would means no cache, which is even better for their argument of security.<p>There&#x27;s nothing alarmist here, it&#x27;s all alright, it would just means that this is the same false advertising that so many companies do, but still, is important to be aware of.')
