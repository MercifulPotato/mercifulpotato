I haven&#x27;t felt a real need but I also just don&#x27;t <i>trust</i> &quot;smart&quot; thermostats not to fail off in the winter which can be a really serious event if you&#x27;re not around (and I normally travel a lot). There are other failure modes for heating of course but I absolutely don&#x27;t want to introduce another one for no good reason.<p>(I don&#x27;t have AC.)')
