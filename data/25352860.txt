You also can&#x27;t print out a video and highlight things or write notes in the margins (or do the equivalent with a PDF). Scrubbing back multiple times to catch a quickly spoken word or quickly dismissed graphic is the bane of my experience with such video documentation. To me, that <i>may be</i> a fine superficial introductory experience in some cases, but is a universally terrible one for understanding and reference.')
