There are things like self promotion threads but its only visited by people looking to promote their products and not by other people. Users who don&#x27;t cease the promotion on being warned will have a very real possibility of having their account and domain banned from the sub.<p>I&#x27;ve been on the moderator side of subreddits, and the general sentiment is that people are there because of a shared interest and not to be the promotion ground for some wannabe-rich guy. If a subreddit is for fountain pen enthusiasts, they&#x27;d rather see 10 posts going &quot;Help me choose my first fountain pen&quot; rather than some guy promoting his fountain pen store on etsy.')
