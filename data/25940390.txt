A compact camera with x30 optical zoom at a $200 &#x2F; $300 price point is far better than any smartphone. You can take pictures from far away, the lens is better, the sensor is larger. You don&#x27;t capture the pupils of a bird on a tree with a smartphone.<p>Of course I get out with my phone in a pocket and I bring my camera with me only on special occasions and long journeys so I shoot many more pictures with my smartphone than with my camera so I agree that smartphones changed how we think about pictures.')
