I think he lied about that, but I think they&#x27;re solvent. The reserve system required by the securities people mean they have to have a cash position proportional to the total flux of trades. There were some laws passed a few years back that reduce how quickly you can turn unsettled trades into new trades. Without that they&#x27;d probably need a much larger cash position.<p>I suspect he was thinking of bank runs. If people think they aren&#x27;t solvent, then it becomes true. If he says they have a liquidity problem (which I agree the loan they took out is a confession of that fact), then they could have a solvency problem if everyone without a margin account cashes out.')
