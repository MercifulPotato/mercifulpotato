On the other hand it&#x27;s okay in comparison to what the US did to obtain and secure oil from the middle-east. That said, I don&#x27;t think this has anything to do with being respected or liked. Having a good redundant energy supply is a core need, both governments and businesses before that failed to secure it by going for renewables earlier on. At the same time the US has always been respected in the past despite geo-polical acting that was more than questionable. If people have to freeze in the winter because of political fallout, this doesn&#x27;t have to do much with being likeable.')
