After a year I just noticed that my &quot;mobile&quot; account has been ghost banned and for the last year I was essentially just talking to myself.<p>If you comment or post to HN are you ghost banned? My guess would be that A LOT of people here are in the same boat.<p>It would be a lot nicer of HN to just ban your IP or at least let the user know.')
