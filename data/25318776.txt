My original comment is here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24735050" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24735050</a><p>This same account (dnetesn) got this article to the front page this weekend. As of this comment, this article only has 3 comments, which is very low engagement relevant to other frontpage articles, which is the same pattern for other Nautil.us weekend frontpage articles.<p>This turtle article is marginally more interesting than the article from my previous comment, but nothing you wouldn&#x27;t find in a wikipedia page.<p>Again, if this comment is against the rules, I will remove it. But I want to call out that this exactly fits the pattern of a low engagement article with mediocre content front paging on a weekend.')
