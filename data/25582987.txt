Unless I&#x27;m familiar with the seller on Amazon (a known brand like Anker) I <i>try</i> to stick to Walmart, Target, Staples. Bonus, often times the identical item can be found at a lower price.  Downside is the shipping may take a few days more.<p>For something like an SD card or a battery your chance of getting a counterfeit or unreliable product is pretty high.
