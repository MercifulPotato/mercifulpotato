Such applications defeated the purpose of having a first-come-first-serve system and benefit only a few who use the software<p>so why not have this functionality in the first party website in the first place?<p>&gt;However, railway officials clarified Yuvrajaa bypassed the railway system and made money illegally which is a crime. He wasnâ€™t event an authorized agent registered with IRCTC to book tickets.<p>did this guy take a users money, buy a ticket on his behalaf and get a commission from the railways? no. from the customer? no.  all he did was make a fucking autohotkey for their website. he charged 20 rupees, thats USD $ 0.30 for hosting the service, paying for the upkeep. any of his non customers who were disadvantaged because of his service, well no shit. go and ask the government to fix their website and bring it in parity with this guy<p>look. this guy automated typing, refreshing, probably even bypassing captchas. on that note, why should this be &quot;illegal&quot; to do automation? just because they say in Tnc&#x27;s?  grow a pair. why should the government rate limit customers by shoving captchas?<p>i had the misfortune of buying a couple of tickets back in june 20 or july was it for some relatives. that was the most agonizing time of my life. random refreshes, logouts, not being able to do multiple logins, having an actual monthly limit on the number of tickets you can buy in a month, the payment failed 4 times. i had to borrow money twice because the payment was deducted but credit not given. refund was sanctioned after 15 days AFTER a deduction of Rs. 2500 i think USD $ 40.<p>if i had used this guys service, i would have been glad to pay him 10 times over because the service which should have been promised by the first party itself IRCTC was in 1990&#x27;s.<p>&gt;regulations.<p>such a bs word in india. why doesnt the railway make their website like a 2020 website which does automation, remembers your shit, allows instant payment and refund, this and that')
