It seems like you have a fairly rich data set.  I could see this being really useful for soon to be parents trying to think up baby names.  For anyone where this is your use case or you just find these types of name lists interesting, then you may also want to checkout <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mashword.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mashword.com</a>.<p>Mashword is a word mashup name generator service that we recently built that recognizes many common human names. One of our primary use cases is finding alternatives or unique spellings to traditional or common names (e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mashword.com&#x2F;search?words=rebecca" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mashword.com&#x2F;search?words=rebecca</a>)  It does not support all of the names in these lists, but we are adding and growing our support for names all the time.')
