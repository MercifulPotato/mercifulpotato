Item(by='modzu', descendants=None, kids=[25578109, 25578075, 25578128], score=None, time=1609297929, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25577754, text='i live in canada, but this matches my experience in normal times... my brother had a bike accident and cracked his head off a car and we walked into a nearby hospital with blood running down his face, he was concussed such that he kept asking me where he parked.. and the triage nurse said, &quot;just go home, unless you want to spend 3-4 hours waiting to see someone&quot;. we left. so the issue of hospital capacity seems to go way beyond covid, imo')
