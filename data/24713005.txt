Also, some of this speed isn&#x27;t that the SSD components are necessarily that much faster, but rather that they&#x27;re soldered directly onto the main board and located closely to the components that will use them.  Modular, detachable storage located farther from the CPU is just gonna be slower, period.<p>So I&#x27;m not so optimistic that this alone will prove to be a significant differentiator.  And it could easily be the case that by the time it does, PC components have pulled ahead again.  It takes several years before developers have gotten really good at using a given console to its full potential.')
