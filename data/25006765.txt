My cat hates me  when she&#x27;s not hungry, and loves me when she is hungry, but I love her in either case for her honesty. She&#x27;s one of the most honest beings I have in my life. It&#x27;s irrational, I know, but I love my cat. She&#x27;s honest about her intentions, and I appreciate that. I can count on her love when it 7pm and it &#x27;s time to fill her bowl with cat food. That&#x27;s more love than I can expect from any human on any given day, and it&#x27;s completely predictable.')
