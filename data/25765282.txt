I personally become depressed if I cannot work on something important and potentially valuable, feeling that the days pass without meaning.<p>I spend lots of time with my kid because I see that as important. I set aside time to get enough sleep so that I can remain productive. But I hate weekends (unless at the park with my kid), I hate shopping, and I hate vacations. I think I avoid burnout because I don&#x27;t waste time on meaningless tasks. Life is too short, and I want to accomplish a lot')
