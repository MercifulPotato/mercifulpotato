L1&#x2F;L2&#x2F;L3 caches are transparent from the perspective of the processor - it only sees a change in access times to main memory.<p>Any advancement in the storage hierarchy means reducing latency at one level or increasing the amount of memory at that level.<p>Most caches would use SRAM instead of DRAM, but the technology used doesn&#x27;t define its role. Microcontrollers often have only embedded SRAM, serving as main memory.')
