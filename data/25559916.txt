Honestly, it&#x27;s hype culture. The scene seems to attract a very similar crowd to a lot of other hobbies that have limited batches or &#x27;runs&#x27; of a product. Actually I found a lot of crossover with watch and shoe collectors and modified car enthusiasts.<p>Some of the prices on caps and cases were insane. Then what happens is you get this status on particular makers or products that only had very limited runs and were sold at very high prices and the prices just keep going up.<p>In the end I settled on a nice mass produced 60% board that suited me, got a relatively cheap case and some caps to taste, sold the other boards and left it at that.<p>It was fun for a while, but it&#x27;s a deep rabbit hole and quite expensive. I also noticed that for many (including myself to some degree) it turns into a &#x27;collect and show off&#x27; endeavour, where your status in the community is basically tied to how much money you&#x27;ve spent. And that just wasn&#x27;t the game I wanted to play any more.')
