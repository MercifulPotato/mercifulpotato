The &#x27;advert&#x27; is in the start up page we see upon every update. It&#x27;s as much of an imposition upon my browser experience as a welcome page in any application, and because my hand is already hovering over Ctrl+W, it&#x27;s gone before I even got a chance to care.<p>I just don&#x27;t get the irritation here.<p>My web browser is my single-most used application and I&#x27;ve never paid Firefox a bean for it. If they want to promote an extension to their service that they presumably feel is relevant to a percentage of their userbase, then they should go for it - even if the likes of you or I don&#x27;t really care for it.<p>The Mr. Robot promotion was a screw up, no denying it.')
