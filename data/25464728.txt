I regret including do-notation in my critique, maybe list comprehensions instead.<p>I think we disagree on what &quot;different code&quot; ought to mean. I have a C function which multiplies a list of numbers; I make it immediately `return 0` if it hits zero. In C that&#x27;s the same function, just optimized; in Haskell it&#x27;s a breaking API change due to laziness. I suppose the languages reflect that difference.')
