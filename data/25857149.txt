Item(by='asgrdz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611222193, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25846504, text='I disable automatic updates for all extensions, as well as personally reviewing the source of every extension before installation.<p>The review doesn&#x27;t take much time. What I look for:<p><pre><code>  1. The manifest for what network endpoints the extension is allowed to call.\n  2. Any URL in the code that is external to the extension.\n  3. Any remote network function (fetch&#x2F;XHR&#x2F;links) and traceback to the call sites.\n  4. Whether there is any obfuscated code or not.\n</code></pre>\nIf anything found in those spots seems fishy &#x2F; unclear, I don&#x27;t install the extension.<p>Takes a few minutes, but catches most of the threat vectors. Skimming the code also gives me a sense of what sort of developer is behind the extension. Some code clearly shows a developer cares about privacy and &#x2F; or security, which unconsciously adds karma for that dev in my book.<p>Like others above, I don&#x27;t use many extensions, but those I use I have to trust.')
