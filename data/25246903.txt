In 5 minutes i couldn&#x27;t find any way to &quot;browse repositories&quot; inn any sense, to discover what is out there.\nDiscussions are not fleshed out as a issue tracker (no tags for a start), though that could be dealt with by using a 3rd party issue tracker.<p>Pijul&#x27;s whole setup seems like it would solve a bunch of problems I have with git.\n1. that a commit maintains its own identity when cherrypicked onto another branch, and its intrinstically linked. Vs in Git where it is a unrelated (but identical) set of changed.\n2. the whole merge&#x2F;rebase dichotomy.\nIn git most people try annd avoid merging the main branch into the feature branch, because it leads to messy history and hard to understand where changes come from, and prefer to instead do rebase.\nBut for a merge you only need to resolve conflicts once.\nFor a rebase you need to resolve them potentially again and again even if those conflicts never would matter to the final version (e.g. if the file that is conflicting has been deleted before HEAD)\nBut Pijul doesn&#x27;t have seperate merge and rebase because changed in Pijul commute. Which is a mind twise of an idea. But they say they solved it, so nice.')
