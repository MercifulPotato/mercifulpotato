Paraphrasing, it went something like this:<p>&gt; <i>Burger was good, but it was 100 degrees out and windy! I can&#x27;t enjoy a meal in that kind of weather.</i><p>I&#x27;m sure the manager stepped up their weather control after getting that scathing critique.<p>If I&#x27;m being charitable, I suppose that would be useful for an out-of-towner who was unaware that the area is hot and often windy. But to mark it 1 star as a result is useless.')
