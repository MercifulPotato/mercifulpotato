Item(by='dokem', descendants=None, kids=[25794053], score=None, time=1610725538, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25791358, text='1) For me, I don&#x27;t really do anything fancy with my window manager(s) and consider my work mostly terminal oriented. So I want a workflow that isn&#x27;t dependent on what terminal emulator or operating system i&#x27;m on locally.<p>2) If i&#x27;m shelled into a system I just want to open another pane quickly to look at something, not open a new window, ssh, then move to that directory.<p>3) I get tired of configuring things to work the way I like. If I can copy my vim and tmux config, I know I can get to work and be comfortable. I don&#x27;t have to worry about making different different OSs and terminal emulators act the same. I want my coding workflow&#x2F;muscle memory to be based around things running in the terminal, not a mix of terminal and non-terminal&#x2F;local things. It seems more unix philosophy oriented to me.<p>4) I can move from office to lab or go home and pick up right where I left off without any remote desktop nonsense.')
