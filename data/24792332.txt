Item(by='tzs', descendants=None, kids=[24792535], score=None, time=1602787990, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24791416, text='The Puerto Rico bill had good support from both parties.<p>The vote in the House to send the bill to the Senate was 227-0 among Republicans and 186-10 among Democrats.<p>When the Senate&#x27;s modified version came back to the House, the R vote was 160-70 and the D voter was 192-2.<p>When it got back to the Senate in final form, the Senate vote was 76-22. The stupid senate.gov site does not tabulate vote by party and I&#x27;m too lazy to do it by hand, but the Senate at the time was 55 R to 45 D. I do see that all 22 Nay votes were from R, and two D did not vote, so that would give the R vote as 33-22 and the D vote as 43-0.<p>Among the Yea votes in the Senate I see several current R Senators: Grassley, McConnell, Shelby, and Murkowski. I think Inhofe is the only current R Senator who was in the Nays.<p>I bet someone running against whichever of those first four Senators are up for re-election this year could put together a pretty good ad featuring Trump&#x27;s talk of the bill &quot;obliterating&quot; Puerto Rico&#x27;s pharmaceuticals and then calling out that Senator for doing so. How is the Senator going to respond? Say it was a bipartisan bill that was widely supported by both parties, which risks highlighting Trump&#x27;s misleading use of it?')
