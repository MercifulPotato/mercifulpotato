Asking them to clean and scrub the source data set is like telling an amateur pie-baker the store was out of pie crusts, you&#x27;ll have to make your own from scratch -- it&#x27;s not going to happen, they just don&#x27;t have that skill, the instructions on the box don&#x27;t account for that possibility. As soon as the task diverges from the simple step 1, step 2, step 3 that they were originally taught, you realize they have very little ability to adapt. YMMV of course.')
