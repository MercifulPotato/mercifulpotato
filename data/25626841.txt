I thought the process of restoring these sites with new materials and even going so far as to reimagine what parts might have looked like thousands of years ago made the cultural experience somewhat less genuine because I knew a lot what I was seeing was added recently and probably didn&#x27;t fully reflect what it would have looked like back when it originally built.<p>But I&#x27;ve become a lot more accepting of the practise the more I&#x27;ve learnt. I don&#x27;t know much about the Colosseum&#x27;s history, but I&#x27;m sure over the many years it was in operation parts of it would have been being rebuilt and extended. Arguably in most cases the original monument was destroyed long before anybody in modern society touched it.<p>I also started to realise that without a huge amount of restoration most of my favourite historical places would be almost unrecognisable. For example, if you look at Stone Henge before and after the restoration work you&#x27;ll see what I mean.<p>It&#x27;s also true that without occasional upkeep and maintenance many of these monument wouldn&#x27;t survive long given the number of visitors they attract each year. So if we need to do some amount of restoration anyway, why not also restore what was lost before modern times?<p>I think so long as we are respectful and honour the character of what was built before we arrived it&#x27;s probably fine to do our best to restore what we believe was once there. After all in most cases we&#x27;re simply continuing what would be a long history of modifications and restorations. If it wasn&#x27;t for those modifications and restorations we wouldn&#x27;t be able to enjoy these sites in the first place so we probably have some duty to continue that work for future generations.')
