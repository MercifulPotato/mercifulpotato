Item(by='nicoffeine', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602593030, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24764341, text='&gt; Companies can use automation to grow their output while keeping their workforce intact by taking on new projects that were not previously possible.<p>This idea does not scale. It assumes that there is no upper limit for demand&#x2F;production, and assumes that a business can suddenly gain the expertise to enter new markets to sell new products. It also assumes that investors would prefer risky reinvestment strategies to cutting costs by reducing labor and increasing short term profits.<p>&gt; If automation were that dangerous, then being a software developer should be the worst job because it automates itself away<p>Automation goes after the easiest targets first. IT is still growing because it is an immature profession, and a platform for automation itself. I remember IT in the late 90s - basically anyone who could operate a computer could get a job doing installs. In fact my first job was adding Trumpet Winsock to machines that didn&#x27;t have any built-in way to access the internet. A few years later you could still make decent money installing and configuring operating systems. Those jobs are long gone and replaced by SCCM and other similar tools. They have been replaced by jobs that require much more technical skill. Entire teams are replaced every day by outsourcing to automation platforms like AWS, because those platforms can provide the same services with fewer employees.<p>A better example is farming or manufacturing. Take a look at productivity versus employment since 1900.[1]<p>&gt; This anti-automation rhetoric is like children hating school while their parents force them to attend - preferring short term ease that comes with a much bigger long term penalty (temporal discounting at work).<p>No, it&#x27;s a pretty straightforward recognition that retraining even a few percent of any given workforce every year is going to lead to massive inequality and social problems, especially when there is no infrastructure to provide for living costs while a worker gets retrained. A manufacturing worker can be retrained to a better job, but how long do you think it would take to educate that person so they could design and maintain the machines that replace them? How much would that cost? Who is going to pay for it? And if demand for the product is flat, does it make any sense?<p>It&#x27;s also a recognition that we are nearing peak production of practically everything. Developed nations are leveling off and declining in population. Around a third of our food is discarded. Ride-sharing is reducing demand for cars. E-commerce is able to offer discounts because it uses less labor. We are now at the point where major technology vendors have resorted to designing addictive experiences to compete for attention. What&#x27;s left after that is saturated? I&#x27;m almost afraid to ask.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncci.com&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;Pages&#x2F;II_Insights_QEB_Impact-Automation-Employment-Q2-2017-Part1.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncci.com&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;Pages&#x2F;II_Insights_QEB_Impact-A...</a>')
