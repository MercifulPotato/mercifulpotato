But when it comes to representing complex content, there is no other format that even comes close to being as useful and usable.<p>* All digital publishing of ebooks uses XML inside ZIP files.<p>* All contemporary mainstream word processors (Word, LibreOffice) use XML inside of ZIP as the basic file format.<p>* Automatic customized conversion processes from Word to InDesign or from InDesign to EPUB use XML at the heart.<p>* Let’s not forget the web itself, which is still mostly SGML in the form of HTML. Not XML per se, but only different in the details.<p>Not only is XML the only practical serialization format for working with publication content, but the presence of mature schema tooling is intrinsic to making publication automation robust in a given context.<p>I’m very glad for JSON and JSON schema in the domain of APIs. But in the domain of content data, it’s all XML.<p>Every serialization format has a domain for which it is most appropriate (whether or not it is the best choice in that domain.)<p>I’m really liking the shape of nested text for the domains in which I would have used YAML.')
