I really don&#x27;t understand some of the bashing that happens every single time the Macbook Pros come up in HN comments.<p>I was a longtime happy owner of a 2015 15&quot; MBP until earlier this year when I decided it was time to upgrade to a refurbished 2019 16&quot; MBP. I was a bit nervous at first but I have to say that I have no major complaints, other than the fact that I wish I had F keys instead of the touchbar. Contrary to everyone else, I really like the keyboard.<p>As for solving the touchpad issue, I use Pock [1] which I read about on HN. It removes the need for using a slider every time I want to adjust the volume or brightness and lets me control Spotify and see what song is currently playing.<p>I also have a 2018 15&quot; MBP for work. If you believed the comments here you&#x27;d think that I am unable to type or use the damn thing. Honestly, after 1 week of use I&#x27;m already used to the keyboard. Not having an escape key kind of sucked, but I have rebound caps lock to escape on all of my Macbooks and enjoy that even more than having an escape key.<p>My other complaint is that the trackpad is a bit too large - I find myself accidentally hitting it sometimes and it just seems excessive. Finally, it&#x27;s a shame that you can&#x27;t mess with the battery&#x2F;RAM&#x2F;SSD yourself but unfortunately that&#x27;s more of a trend for the industry than just Apple.<p>Overall I&#x27;m a totally happy user on both the 2018 and 2019 Macbook Pros. I was quite nervous about the possibility of having to use a Windows PC for work when I started my new job. And don&#x27;t even get me started on having to use a Pixelbook at Google.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pock.dev&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pock.dev&#x2F;</a>')
