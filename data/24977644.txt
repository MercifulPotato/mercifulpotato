That&#x27;s it.<p>I live in a country where, when the demand for N95 masks started, had a few unrelated corporations quickly enter the market with their own product. I&#x27;m talking about companies ranging from office supplies to coffee makers. Hell, even beer producers quickly entered the hand sanitizer market. Consequently prices dropped drastically and not only is there no shortage of protective equipment but it&#x27;s also affordable.<p>That&#x27;s what happens in a free market.<p>How come you&#x27;re talking about this sort of stuff not happening in your country, and still you talk about a free market?')
