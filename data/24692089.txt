App and OS UIs can often put too many small hoops in the way that you use some other part of your brain to jump through them. Muscle memory has a way of like bypassing and cutting to the chase and doesn&#x27;t have this mental cost associated with a context switch if you will. Somehow doing something physical has some tie in with like a &quot;mental background task&quot; that doesn&#x27;t disturb the &quot;main thread&quot; high level cognitive processes that I want reserved for matters that deserve deep attention.<p>I wonder if it has to do with the fact that there&#x27;s a precision of attention in digital UIs just to click the right button and just all the aiming involved though simple actually has a pretty tight tolerance with fine motor skills and large room for error compared to a quick and dirty gross motion you can get away with for things in the real world. Hopefully that makes sense.')
