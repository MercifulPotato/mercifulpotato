The median age of death at 79, and 50% of people have 3+ diseases doesn&#x27;t imply that &quot;Nearly all of the people who die from COVID had a life expectancy of &lt; 1 year&quot; as you say. Those 3+ diseases you mention include diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity etc... Diseases that people commonly live with for decades. The median remaining lifespan of a person who dies of COVID has been estimated to be around 12 years [1,2].<p>2. Lets say you are correct and 90% of people who die of COVID would have died within 1 year. And let&#x27;s assume that you have some magic PR method that will convince 100% of the population that this is true.<p>That means that COVID is still more deadly than the Flu, and some large percentage of people will still choose to remain home, stop traveling, stop eating out etc...<p>These people will continue to damage the economy until an effective vaccine is available. And even in your scenario a vaccine that is 95% effective will still save millions of lives.<p>An effective vaccine will save lives, and it will improve the economy. There is no logical reason to deny that fact.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wellcomeopenresearch.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;5-75" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wellcomeopenresearch.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;5-75</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medrxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2020.06.08.20050559v2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medrxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2020.06.08.20050559v...</a>')
