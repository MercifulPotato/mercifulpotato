From the outside, it appears as though the incumbent administration is starting to mobilize the state apparatus - Senate Majority, DOJ, WH - that exists to uphold the democracy, against the democracy. It surreal that reality distortion is being deployed to undermine a mature democracy.<p>I understand that there is a possibility of voting fraud and the incumbent administration has the right to ask for investigation. However, given the history of reality distortion, it&#x27;s hard to grant that benefit of doubt innocently. Doing so innocently feels like walking into the exploitative trap.<p>In this post-truth world, are democracies doomed and susceptible to larger than life reality distortion? Is it the goodness and innocence of the people being taken for a ride? How should democracies be engineered to deal with large scale reality distortion?')
