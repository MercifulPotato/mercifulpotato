Just as little as the guy sending you a patch. If you want you issue tracker to be pay-only, would you be fine with allowing people to submit patches that you can only open after paying?<p>The &quot;not getting paid a cent for it&quot; is just flipping the entitlement problem around. The person reporting a bug is not entitled to a fix, nor even to be heard (even though, as I claim above, ignoring them is usually not the smartest thing for a maintainer to do). Neither is the maintainer entitled to get fixes attached to bug reports, or even a certain quality in bug reports themselves. All of this is voluntary, nobody is entitled to anything.<p>But what you can do is foster a good culture. If you incentivize high quality bug reports, for example if somebody shows they made an effort when reporting the problem and you respond with a positive answer, then people see this and adjust their behavior accordingly. If you accept pull requests, especially high quality ones, especially those where everything is well-explained, well-structured and the maintainer&#x27;s comments are addressed, people will tend to adjust and do it like that more.<p>Just as much as if you are and asshole about bug reports, you&#x27;ll likely not get high quality ones or even fixes any longer. Likewise, if a bug reporter is just rude, they won&#x27;t get attention from the maintainer any longer.<p>It&#x27;s all reciprocal. Nobody is entitled to anything. If you play the game right, it&#x27;s a very productive collaborative framework. And a lot of fun.')
