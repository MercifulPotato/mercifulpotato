I personally doubt anyone was using it to bulk download copywritten photos and somehow use those photos. I could be wrong but I believe most people that steal photos still them a few at time. Basically they&#x27;re making some article, they need a related photo, they search, grab a 2 to 5 and stick them in their article. They&#x27;d do this with the browser, not my app.<p>My app didn&#x27;t let you search by keyword, only by user. Further it didn&#x27;t remove watermarks or do anything else. If photographers put their photos on flickr and they care about stealing they usually both watermark and only put relatively low-res versions there and you have to pay them for high res versions.<p>If flickr provided logs that showed bulk download and further some proof that even with bulk download that it was actually affecting professional photographers and not just a few geeks collecting some pictures they liked then I&#x27;d be more inclined to buy into their ban but without that I&#x27;m pretty confident the ban had no basis in reality.')
