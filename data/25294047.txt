Is it even possible to install Linux on this new Mac though? Probably not. Will Apple offer these chips to other manufacturers? Would be cool if we could build small form factor PCs with these M1 chips!<p>I also wonder about the driver situation. Intel hardware has excellent support on Linux, everything works out of the box. Apple probably has zero interest in contributing drivers to the Linux kernel.')
