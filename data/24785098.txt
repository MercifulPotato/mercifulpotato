A better answer would have been &quot;I don&#x27;t know.  Let&#x27;s figure it out.&quot;  But that was impossible for political reasons.  Bohr was being attacked by <i>Einstein</i> for <i></i>&#x27;s sake. He can be forgiven for adopting Ali&#x27;s &quot;rope-a-dope&quot; tactics if he felt that Einstein was trying to destroy his entire field in its infancy. But I find &quot;there is no quantum world&quot; simply unacceptable.)<p>Now to answer your question as best I can, an interaction must collapse the wave function when it is required to fulfill a conservation rule.  For example, if an electron is captured by a nucleus it becomes bound and emits a photon.  This is an interaction that must conserve momentum, angular momentum, energy, and charge.  Because of that, the electron can no longer be represented by a non-localized wave function.  The universe must concentrate those properties down to a point in order to &quot;do the accounting&quot; necessary for the conservation rules.<p>No, I don&#x27;t know how it does that.  But then, NONE of the available interpretations answer that question.  This indicates to me we are thinking about it wrong.<p>What I like about Stuckey&#x27;s paper is that it adds another factor: besides conservation rules the universe seems to require that &quot;measurements&quot; obey the Relativity Principle (No Preferred Frame of Reference).  I have yet to figure out how to incorporate that.')
