The T2 in the 2020 imac has hardware encoding ability for 8-bit H265.<p>Now, the thing is: intel&#x27;s AVX512 instructions are supposed to accelerate this sort of work, but in practice they are getting lapped by the T2 chip. That signals that apple&#x27;s ability to tune hardware designs to the needs of content creators is greater than intel&#x27;s.')
