Back in the day they tried charging businesses a fee to list a number and iirc it was per call. So they listed a proxy number so they could track and bill.<p>The crazy thing is to prevent search engines from indexing it (and getting sued for false billing) they rendered the number in an image-that-looks-like-text instead of text. I wonder if they are doing anything to prevent indexing of these false numbers or if they just donâ€™t care now.')
