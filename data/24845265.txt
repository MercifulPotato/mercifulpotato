If the inputs are bounded in some sense then a digital computer can calculate Fourier in O(1) too. That doesn&#x27;t make the problem any easier asymptotically -- you still need more machine or more time to calculate arbitrary Fourier.<p>That said, recent work on photonic Fourier transforms does look interesting from the perspective of a co-processor. They offer meaningful gains over alternatives.')
