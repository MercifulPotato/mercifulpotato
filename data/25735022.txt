They frequently call for overthrow of the government and organize violent direct actions.<p>Rose City Antifa is still active. They do the same.<p>Salon&#x27;s Tweet calling for more violence this summer and calling the violence that had already occurred against Federal properties by Leftist activists &quot;justified&quot; is still up, as is Salon&#x27;s website.<p>Khamenei&#x27;s Twitter is still active, calling for the elimination of all Jews and Israel.<p>I&#x27;m sure this will get downvoted. Probably flagged.<p>But since the government can&#x27;t shut down companies due to the content their users post, because of Section 230, I guess a small, colluding cartel of corporations can step in to silence people when the government will bend knee to the Leftist mob instead.<p>It&#x27;s only a matter of time before the people wielding this power find it turned against them, if they do not recognize what they are doing to discourse on the Internet.<p>Pandora&#x27;s box is fucking open now.')
