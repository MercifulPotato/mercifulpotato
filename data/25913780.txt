There was some articles about it reversing in the last decade though.<p>On a personal note: I did QA, test automation, and current am technically Sales Engineering (though I&#x27;m finding I dislike it quite a lot). My last raise brought my salary to $52,000 Canadian a year at year 9 of my career. That&#x27;s about $34,000 USD or so. I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s not exactly stellar pay in the US.<p>Personally I&#x27;d seriously consider heading State side too if I could. As is I haven&#x27;t the foggiest idea if I am qualified, how to find out, or what companies would even consider someone like me.')
