The A72 claims 4.7 DMIPS&#x2F;MHz.<p>This board has a Dual-core U74 (RV64GC) 64-bit SoC @ 1.5 GHz with 2MB L2 cache.  The U74 claims 2.5 DMIPS&#x2F;MHz.<p>So, roughly 1&#x2F;4 as fast as a RPIi 4B given the roughly half DMIPS&#x2F;MHz and half the cores?<p>That, of course, is a really rough guess, ignoring lots of potential variables.')
