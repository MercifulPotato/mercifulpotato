There&#x27;s nothing so satisfying as plunking down a sack of pennies when purchasing stuff and saying &quot;just let me know if it&#x27;s not enough.&quot;<p>The above is sarcasm.  I hate pennies.  They are pretty much useless these days.  The only joy I get from them is when someone annoys me, I can throw them at the person.<p>They are so useless, in fact, that it actually costs nearly twice the value of a penny ($0.0183)[0] to mint one.<p>That said, I&#x27;d really like it if larger denomination coins ($1&#x2F;5&#x2F;10) were common in the US as they are in the EU.  Generally coins with value more than $0.25 aren&#x27;t used (yes, $0.50 and $1 coins exist, but are rarely used&#x2F;distributed).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Penny_(United_States_coin)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Penny_(United_States_coin)</a><p>Edit: Added forgotten link.')
