For example, send one to me ;) But joke aside, the ROCm documentation seems so wacky that I would not dare to purchase an expensive AMD card without recommendation by someone that I trust.<p>For example, rocmdocs.amd.com appears to be the official documentation, but the front page doesn&#x27;t mention any popular AI framework. Opening the &quot;Deep Learning&quot; box in the sidebar, I see that there should be a TensorFlow 2.2.0-beta1 release. But on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ROCmSoftwarePlatform&#x2F;tensorflow-upstream" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ROCmSoftwarePlatform&#x2F;tensorflow-upstream</a> the featured release is &quot;2.0.0-rocm&quot;, the docker link says it&#x27;s TensorFlow 2.3 and the &quot;Official Builds&quot; at the bottom of the readme point to CUDA versions ... The whole GitHub repo kind of feels like a bad copy&amp;paste job. I manage to eventually download the TensorFlow 2.3.1 + ROCm source from GitHub, only to find that it doesn&#x27;t compile. I need the hip_hcc library <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ROCm-Developer-Tools&#x2F;HIP&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ROCm-Developer-Tools&#x2F;HIP&#x2F;</a> but apparently that one has been renamed some months ago, but the ROCm TensorFlow port has not been updated yet.<p>After spending half a day trying to install a ROCm-compatible TensorFlow, I gave up. Obviously, I wouldn&#x27;t want to hope on those issues getting resolved when I buy an as-is unusable $6400 accelerator card. That said, the MI100 could be a great deal if I could get it to work. AMD hardware is a lot more affordable than comparable NVIDIA products, plus the MI100 has lots of fast RAM. I work on optical flow (think autonomous selfie drone) and that needs lots and lots of GPU RAM. Plus I&#x27;m very happy with my AMD CPU. But like I said in the beginning, I wouldn&#x27;t dare buying an AMD GPU unless there was believable evidence that I can get my TF2.3 model running with ROCm in a reasonable timeframe.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to blame AMD for having bugs here. I have run into a fair share of issues with NVIDIA GPUs, too, like for example a RAM corruption bug inside CUDA 10.0 and a reproducible kernel freeze in CUDA 10.1. But for NVIDIA, the initial setup is quick and easy. And the CUDA documentation looks like they have a dedicated team that cares about developer productivity. For AMD&#x27;s ROCm, on the other hand, even the marketing material reads more like someone hopes that the open source community will fix things for free. &quot;first open-source software development platform for HPC&#x2F;Hyperscale-class GPU computing&quot; sounds great until you notice that in this context, &quot;open-source&quot; apparently means &quot;no binaries + no support&quot;.')
