For some reason, Aurora always generates values with the first bit set and so they learned the hard way that that field needed to be declared as unsigned.<p>Yes, the defaults can be changed but many, many people do not know this and will only learn why they need to after they have something blow up painfully. Often, even people who know this in theory will forget about it at some point when setting up a new one. It&#x27;s the same reason why the industry is trying to get away from services like MongoDB &#x2F; ELK listening on 0.0.0.0 with no password or having a default password which can easily be scanned. For something as widely installed as MySQL, even a 10% chance of oversights will mean a LOT of collateral damage.')
