Item(by='Melting_Harps', descendants=None, kids=[25517063, 25519748], score=None, time=1608700210, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25514442, text='&gt;  That $40k home isnâ€™t so cheap when you make $13k and interest rates were 11-15%.<p>With a decent down payment (lets say ~15%) that&#x27;s still less than 5 years salary even with interest, which would be completely acceptable terms especially since cost of living was way more affordable back then and the population had ~10 million people less than today in the 90s. Just to give you context that&#x27;s more in population increase than many US states have in totality!<p>The problem comes from the fact that even with most FHA loans, decent down payments and average(non-FAANG) middle class income wages you&#x27;re still looking at 15+ years of salary with a home with no repair clauses from banks that bought distressed proprieties on the cheap in the 2008 housing crises, and are selling far above their ATH. And that&#x27;s assuming you can even get a home into escrow before external demand or Chinese investors fleeing the mainland pay cash for it sight unseen for something they will just at best rent out on Airbnb or let decay as its better than the alternative of keeping it in fiat before the CCP takes it.<p>Personally speaking NY is exactly what I didn&#x27;t want CA to become, and slowly it started to resemble it more and more in all the negative ways; the recent lockdowns from incompetent politicians with deluded presidential aspirations only highlighted how much they have in common now.<p>I&#x27;m not a protectionist and I welcome(d) people to come work and live in CA, by my issue is that in the process it stripped a lot of what was good about it away and enhanced a lot of the worst parts instead.<p>Personally speaking with all of that culture and atmosphere lost I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it. And I think that one guy below was right, California will probably never go back to what it was back in the 90s and I should probably just be satisfied I got to experience it all.')
