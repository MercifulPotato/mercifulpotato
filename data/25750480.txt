If a right is not recognized by others&#x2F;the government, then it effectively doesn&#x27;t exist. That&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s not right or that you couldn&#x27;t rationally defend it though.<p>&gt;If in a pandemic I can only legally communicate via digital tools<p>I see the conflict you&#x27;re bringing up, it&#x27;s in effect illegal to communicate in person a lot of the time due to the pandemic, so digital tools are very useful for you to be able to communicate, but if you are somehow banned from those you have few options, if any. I think the thing that is incorrect here is actually the government making it illegal to communicate via non-digital tools, even if a lot of times it is in an individual&#x27;s best interest to stay inside. And once again, no one owes you a platform. You are, in your words, silenced, but I don&#x27;t think that that is an issue that requires government action.')
