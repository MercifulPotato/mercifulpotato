I really want to stress the point that thinking about accessebility as a niche is exclusionary and unethical.<p>I think about my time working at Net a Porter - UK upmarket online fashion retailer - where I brought up some accessability concerns especially around their terrible in-house captcha and it was dismissed as &quot;they arent our target market&quot; which is so blanetly untrue, but all stems from this myth that accessability is only for a small group of users.<p>&gt; don&#x27;t lose sight of the much, much smaller group of users who require the feature in order to use the product at all.<p>The people who need to use captions&#x2F;subtitles are not a &quot;much smaller group&quot;. I think about foreign language media, where i need the subtitles (like when I watched Dark on Netflix), or even primarily English media but has some forign language (I watched Lost recently - there&#x27;s a fair bit of Korean and Arabic in that). Or even when you&#x27;re watching TV around someone who&#x27;s sleeping.<p>Everyone needs &quot;accessability&quot;, and if you don&#x27;t now, you will eventually.')
