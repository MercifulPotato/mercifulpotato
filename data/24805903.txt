I am suggesting this is a blindspot we&#x27;ve all fallen into that may have created the monsters we are now fighting to protect.<p>&gt; Your extremely short sighted position<p>I am getting this a lot in this comment section so far. I mean, hey we should all be thick-skinned, right? My disagreement with your conclusions or predictions of what would happen doesn&#x27;t mean I suffer from myopia and it isn&#x27;t very polite to suggest otherwise.<p>Central aggregation of user generated content isn&#x27;t the only possible mechanism to do anything on the Internet. Removing the legal protections for aggregators may slow growth and make it significantly more difficult to centrally aggregate content, but that might actually be a good thing.')
