That&#x27;s the issue. It&#x27;s of course improbable that none of these interventions work, but it&#x27;s probable that some do not work.<p>At the same time, there are a lot of factors that are purely circumstantial, such as weather&#x2F;climate, age&#x2F;health of the population, elderly care system. These may have a lot of influence at the tail ends (deaths).<p>We must not fall into the trap of making post-hoc rationalizations that confirm what we <i>want</i> to believe. We&#x27;re paying a heavy price with severe measures, if some data turned up that showed that it didn&#x27;t make much of a difference, that would be a tough pill to swallow.')
