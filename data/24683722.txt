Basically, you grant the public the rights of the gpl, and the company the right to do as they see fit. This seems better to me than MITing it, because you don&#x27;t lose the benefits of the gpl.<p>The complication is that, if you received the source under the gpl, then you must release your patch under the gpl, too. But I think this can be worked around by the company licensing the source to you under a different license, that allows only submitting patches.<p>So basically, you effectively submit the same patch twice: once under the gpl, based on the public gpl&#x27;d code, and a second time under a proprietary license, based on the same code, offered to you under a proprietary license that exclusively allows sending patches.')
