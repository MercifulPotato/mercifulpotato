But it&#x27;s rarely accurate enough to use on bulk archives in an automated way, especially when archives come from different domains (eg, technical vs social writing).<p>It&#x27;s useful for identifying possible alternate authors plays attributed to Shakespeare[1], but a lot less useful for trying to tie a reddit identity to a github profile.<p><i>Anyways, what can be done probabably will be done, for whichever reason because it&#x27;s getting cheaper and cheaper.</i><p>Crawling and storing is cheap, but analysis is harder. Automated spell checking (&quot;probabably&quot; above not withstanding!) and auto-complete means stylometry is even less useful now.<p>Source: myself - I work in natural language processing, and have talked to people applying these techniques.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.frontiersin.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;10.3389&#x2F;fpsyg.2018.00289&#x2F;full" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.frontiersin.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;10.3389&#x2F;fpsyg.2018.0028...</a>')
