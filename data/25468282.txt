Carmack&#x27;s idea of &#x27;deep&#x27; work [0] is environmentally dependent. It works for him and for the places he has been at. But it is not a universal rule for learning in <i>all</i> environments.<p>Epstein uses Tiger Woods and Roger Federer as his headline case, but goes into many other forms of learning. Woods&#x27; golf is a <i>kind learning environment</i>; the rules are clear, the feedback is quick, the skills are straightforward. Federer&#x27;s tennis is an <i>unkind</i> learning environment; the rules aren&#x27;t as clear, the feedback isn&#x27;t as quick, and the skills are more murky. A lot of tennis is the mind-game aspect and in elite tennis, you don&#x27;t get the same person very often.<p>With programming and development, the environment Carmack talks about is a <i>kind</i> learning environment (rules are stated, feedback is a compile away, skills are practicable). Contrast this to the business&#x2F;marketing people whose environment is unkind (unclear rules, long feedback cycles, skill overload).<p>Epstein relates the method to be great at a thingy is to know what environment you are in. This gives the keys to success. In kind learning environments like programming, golf, or chess, the key is practice and drilling, to do it until you can&#x27;t be bad anymore. In unkind learning environments like tennis, jazz, or marketing, the key is to learn as many things as you can as broadly as you can, to gain a reservoir of ideas to use.<p>[0] not Cal Newport&#x27;s idea of &#x27;deep work&#x27;, to be clear.')
