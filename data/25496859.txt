At least it was a serious contender.<p>Paper planners where the most important tool for all sorts of business types, but they had there shortcomings. The Palm was the first digital alternative that could make the case: &quot;Hey, try me out, I am better.&quot;<p>What also helped was availability, but Symbian was good at this as well.<p>Thirdly, the Palm desktop software was very good, syncing flawlessly, cooperating with Lotus and MS.
