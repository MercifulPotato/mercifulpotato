Despite his chances of actually winning now are something like less than 1% on betting markets.\nNo court case has gotten to the stage that allowed significant evidence to be presented (They&#x27;ve rejected for standing or other reasons). The media has all but inaugurated Biden. And it looks like the Republican party will turn against Trump too now. Trump is really a populist politician that somehow won the Republican party nomination. But he doesn&#x27;t have backing in the institutions of government, especially the courts. Allowed most of his closest political allies to be prosecuted, and removed or taken out or he fired them. And his support in republican party is also shaky. They would love to get rid of him.<p>Joseph Stalin said some version of &quot;It&#x27;s not the people who vote that count, it&#x27;s the people who count the votes.&quot;<p>Its interesting listen Rudy to make his points and argue his case, how the votes should be counted.<p>He&#x27;s a skilled orator.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=NAzCECx8XeE&amp;t=547s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=NAzCECx8XeE&amp;t=547s</a>')
