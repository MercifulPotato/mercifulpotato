Commander’s intent is meaningless unless there’s an established tradecraft behind it that governs how to execute on that intention in a way that brings alignment to behavior, initiative and decentralized execution of said intent.<p>Mission statements probably give you a “North Star”, but they don’t-on their own-necessarily help teams execute')
