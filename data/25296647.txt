You might think you do, but that would be just some hot-hand fallacy.<p>&gt; This is essentially encapsulated by a Sharpe ratio (among other things).<p>You&#x27;re conflating two things. Sharpe ratio is about a profit opportunity with regards to its well established degree of risk. Unexploited opportunity is when you asymmetrically discover a new return opportunity upon what was already priced.<p>In both cases it comes down to the belief that &quot;I am smarter than other investors, and can profit from an angle they haven&#x27;t thought&quot;. I will not assert a strong efficient market hypothesis, but in overwhelming majority of the cases, no, you&#x27;re not.')
