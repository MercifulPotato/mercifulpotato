This happens because each deploy contains fewer changes.<p>Is this generally true? Deploy as in going to production?<p>I worked on a web app that didn&#x27;t have any tests and the code was brittle, where changing one part of the app could break a completely different part without you realising. It was much more efficient (and less stressful) to batch up lots of small changes and do one thorough manual testing session of the whole thing while we gradually got the codebase under control.<p>It likely depends on how much automated testing you have, how bad it is if bugs go live and how quickly you need features live.')
