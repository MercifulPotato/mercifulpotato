Might as well control the deal.<p>But I&#x27;d question the need to get TV on all of your six devices just like I&#x27;d question the need to get Twitter and Candy Crush on all of them. Maybe get it on 1-2 (laptop, TV usb stick) and learn to be okay with not having 24&#x2F;7 access to TV. You&#x27;d be happier.<p>As some ideas for ways to swap out TV with something more fulfilling, I recently decided to randomly consume some Youtube courses on the works of T. S. Eliot and Plato, of course reading them on my own alongside. It&#x27;s not necessarily as stimulating as captivating TV or methamphetamine, but I feel like I&#x27;m growing, being challenged, and it&#x27;s damn sure fulfilling. Also gives me something interesting to talk about. (I chose those authors because an older friend of mine knows about them and likes talking about them.)')
