I have extensive experience in building recommendations systems, search engines, and NLP solutions. I have some experience in building distributed systems, microservices, REST APIs, etc... but I mostly want focus on data science related stuff. I have a very extensive (8+ years) experience in training and mentoring, especially in math, programming, and data science (machine learning included of course).<p>I&#x27;m also open to volunteer my time and experience to non-profits and any company that is doing a real good to someone on this planet (sorry other planets!).<p>Drop me an email if you want to discuss anything :)')
