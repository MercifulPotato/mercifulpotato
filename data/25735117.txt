One says, “We drew down and gave him service.” Another, “I ran out of bullets!” and then laughter. The reporter asks twice, “So the defense people shot this person?” and multiple protestors answer yes. They brag about “ex-military” security, and avoid saying whether the victims were armed (they were not). They repeat false rumors about an earlier drive-by, which turned out to be gunfire from other “defense people.”<p>If you can stomach it, watch the whole video. It is graphic:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=0cUYLQkhGmU&amp;t=2m" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=0cUYLQkhGmU&amp;t=2m</a><p>Another clip with the killer(s) and other protestors repeating, “I didn’t see sh*t!”, the mantra of those who don’t talk to police:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kDmNJ6tO2Lg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kDmNJ6tO2Lg</a><p>Unsurprisingly,\nSeattle police have made no arrests in the case. Per official statement, the crime scene was destroyed and witnesses aren’t cooperating.<p>This happened in a residential neighborhood. An unarmed black kid died at the hands of political vigilantes. Rifle bullets entered people’s homes. It barely made national news. Joe Biden felt no need to tweet. Compare that to later coverage of Kyle Rittenhouse. To some, this disparity represents a double standard.<p>That double standard is the essence of my comparison between this summer’s violence and the storming of the capitol. Both are reckless, deadly, and reprehensible.\nBoth must be condemned. Perpetuating the double standard just perpetuates one group’s grievance, fueling more violence.')
