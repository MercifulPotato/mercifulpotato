Instead you&#x27;re here on a thread about a PC product that you&#x27;ll probably never use, acting like anyone that doesn&#x27;t have a 4k display must be missing out. (You&#x27;re right, I must be projecting :) Personally, I like desktop rigs with 1080p, a 5 button vertical mouse and 32-64gb of RAM in a quiet private office. I don&#x27;t optimize for working on planes, trains and in meetings even though I do own a PC and Mac laptop as well...<p>Look at all the top listings here though- they&#x27;re all FHD. Nobody cares about 4K on a laptop display - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;s?k=laptop&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;s?k=laptop&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss</a>')
