That has not happened.<p>For example, per the NYT, Arizona has 3% votes outstanding (estimated), but the margin of victory that has been called for Biden is less than half that.<p>The polls have just not been accurate at all this cycle (or the last), so using them to project victory is fraught with peril.<p>&gt; <i>New information can affect outcomes.</i><p>Indeed. ;)')
