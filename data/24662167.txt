It depends on the key size, ciphers, etc, but up to 300ms is typical.<p>However, this should only be done at the beginning of the connection. After this the client will have a symmetric encryption key that is much faster to use. Their load balancer should be caching these sessions so that subsequent connections don&#x27;t need to re-negotiate a session key.<p>If this 110ms is only on the first request, and a cache miss on the sessions, then I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s probably something you should be expecting. If it&#x27;s after the TLS session has been set up, or on a cache hit, that sounds bad. It also could be that their session cache isn&#x27;t large enough and is forgetting sessions too soon, causing more TLS negotiation than may be necessary.')
