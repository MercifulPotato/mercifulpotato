Show package contents is exactly what I was looking for.  I was looking in the wrong spot before with App Info (cntr + i).<p>Thought I share where I am at:<p>I think I&#x27;m in the right direction now.  There are log files associated with previous crashes due to out of mem errors.  The app here also includes a java vm_param file so I can maybe experiment with a few settings here and hoping here by decreasing the GC recycling time maybe things improve.  Also, I will be looking whether the app may have somehow embedded a jvm (possible?) rather than using the one I have provided.')
