I have a very close friend who works as a emergency room doctor and she said that she is really tired of all the cases where people can&#x27;t handle marijuana, its all the same symptoms, extreme sickness, vomiting, belligerent behavior etc. I asked her what caused it (overdose?) and she said its a few things, a part of the population has a hard time dealing with large amounts of the compounds in marijuana, also she said that THC content in alot of strains being sold today is really high. So some overdose, some genetic&#x2F;biology involved. Strange thing is the media&#x2F;news does not report on this at all. And she said its an almost multi-daily occurrence(lives near a medium sized metro area).')
