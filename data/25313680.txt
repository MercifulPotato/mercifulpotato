Item(by='todd8', descendants=None, kids=[25313912], score=None, time=1607167364, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25311848, text='There are a number of different ways to do this in Emacs, but <i>org capture</i> is probably the place to start. This feature is very powerful. See [1].<p>&gt; That sounds kind of cool, though Iâ€™m not very familiar with emacs so it looks a bit strange to me.<p>Yes, Emacs is an editor from another time and is a bit strange.<p>Like Vim&#x2F;vi, Emacs has survived for something like 44 years. There have been hundreds of text editors created and used, some very widely, over the intervening decades.<p>Through a kind of evolutionary pressure, better editors survive and less capable editors decline in popularity. The best features are often adopted by the newer generations of text editors. By now, there are a pretty widely accepted set of features in modern editors, for example cut-copy-paste and undo. But, like the octopus, Emacs and Vim are just different than other creatures. Not necessarily better in every way, but different. So cut-copy-paste is supported by these editors if you insist, but they have their own highly refined way of improving even these elementary and widely used operations.<p>I like VS Code, Sublime Text, and Jet Brains IDEs; however, the editor I use the most is Emacs. It is, at the core, a set of low level primitives for editing text combined with a flexible programming language interpreter that higher level commands use to implement its unbelievable feature set. By now, millions of lines of code have been contributed to Emacs and it is likely to have whatever you want out of an editor.<p>There is a bit of a bump to get over when learning either one of these two paleolithic editors (Emacs or Vim). If you are a coder, I think it worth learning at least one of these two proven editors.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qCdScs4YO8k" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qCdScs4YO8k</a>')
