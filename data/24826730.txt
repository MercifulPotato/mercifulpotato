It would be hard to get a clear answer to &quot;which family had the most members in Harry Potter?&quot; etc, whereas that&#x27;s a query you can write pretty naturally with a graph database, RDF or otherwise.<p>I&#x27;d never say that I wish we just had massive triple stores and Google had never been invented, but I still maintain that linked data is exciting and expressive.')
