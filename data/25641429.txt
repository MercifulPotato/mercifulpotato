Item(by='marcinzm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609814801, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25640762, text='&gt;And yet their search product is littered with crap and exploits users like only a monopolist would.<p>As others have pointed out this site is nearly indistinguishable from crap to a human much less a crawler. Thus Google trying to clean up the crap get&#x27;s yelled at by you for hitting other sites (which is unavoidable). And if they didn&#x27;t try to clean up the crap you&#x27;d yell at them for that.')
