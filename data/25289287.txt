I think Hurd can provide similar  functionality at the filesystem level thanks to its translators. Plan 9 likely can, too, and it would be possible to cook something together with FUSE.<p>I leveraged this some time ago to sent WOL packets. I think it went something like:<p><pre><code>   echo -e [16 times the target MAC written as \\xFF] &gt; &#x2F;dev&#x2F;udp&#x2F;255.255.255.255&#x2F;9\n</code></pre>\nBTW, I&#x27;m not entirely sure how broadcast IPv4 addresses work. I think they are set by the DHCP server, and the computer sends packets to these addresses as MAC broadcasts? (leaving the dest IP as the configured broadcast one).')
