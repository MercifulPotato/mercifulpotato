You can have it better.<p>Someone is privileged &#x2F; in a bubble enough to think this is even remotely plausible for a massive chunk of people.<p>When <i>native</i> Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro X, hell; even <i>Unity</i> makes it to Linux, I’ll be able to <i>consider</i> it.<p>Until then, I make my money off those apps. How is not having access to the vast wealth of commercial software ‘having it better’? Even for just the average person?<p>It’s not. Plain and simple.<p>Can we finally just drop this ‘just go to Linux’ shit? It really only works for Grandma or Mom who only needs to check their emails, Facebook and type documents, and programmers who happen to be lucky enough to have that extremely limited set of tools work for them.<p>Until solutions like WINE are no longer required and commercial software is available it is and will remain a non option for the vast, vast majority of professionals using a computer.<p>No offence intended - but <i>seriously</i> every time someone posts ‘everyone should just move to Linux it’s so much better’, I have to ask myself how isolated in that community they made themselves to make that ‘realistic’.')
