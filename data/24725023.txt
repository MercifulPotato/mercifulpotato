Item(by='nemothekid', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602199301, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24724685, text='&gt;<i>IBM for one; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Z&#x2F;Architecture" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Z&#x2F;Architecture</a></i><p>IBM has been building chips since day one. I&#x27;d expect IBM to divest their mainframe business eventually. The distinction you are missing is that usually &quot;finance-driven&quot; companies don&#x27;t usually decide to pour billions of dollars into bringing in an already outsourced component in house that they hardly have experience in.<p>Furthermore, I don&#x27;t see IBM using the Z to &quot;innovate&quot; - They aren&#x27;t pushing the mainframes to anyone other than people who are already buying mainframes.<p>&gt;<i>Z is a more interesting architecture by far than the turd Apple is shipping.</i><p>The Z, an architecture for people who are pretty much already buying mainframes, is more interesting than a desktop class chip with what will probably be a completely unmatched in performance&#x2F;watt? I don&#x27;t see how the Z is more interesting than a chip that is finally attempting to challenge the 30 year x86 dominance in desktop computing.')
