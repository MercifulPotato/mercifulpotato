You need to look long term. But I agree the pain of losing a job is real and thatâ€™s where UBI comes in. UBI (Universal basic income) is a must because job losses are inevitable wether due to automation &#x2F; offshoring &#x2F; health issues or skill shortage. Where will the money from UBI come from? From the companies that profit because of these mechanisms. Tax them , tax the ultra rich folks. If humanity has to continue its progress in the current path this has to be the future. If you have an alternative in mind please share.')
