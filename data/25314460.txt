Knock it off. I&#x27;m the opposite of racist: the thought of arguing with a black woman doesn&#x27;t bother me in the slightest. I&#x27;ll happily argue with anyone.<p>The racism here is in the behaviour of treating some people specially because they are of &quot;wanted&quot; races or genders. I&#x27;m criticising racism, not engaging in it. But clearly a lot of people especially in the US are so far gone they&#x27;ll never recognise it.')
