Item(by='yazaddaruvala', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610275102, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25711952, text='&gt; The problem here is that private companies are doing something that only democratically legitimized state authorities should be doing<p>Companies are obligated to make the most possible money for their shareholders. Otherwise their shareholders withdraw investments and invest elsewhere. Deplatforming is a legal money making strategy (it might succeed or it might fail but the goal is to make money).\nTo add more data, in Nov 2020 7 MM more “potential customers” voted for Biden compared to Trump. Additionally, the “potential customers” that voted for Biden were predominantly younger i.e. more time to purchase good and services from company X. It seems clear to me deplatforming is a medium-term and long-term financial numbers game.<p>&gt; Otherwise we are always dependent on the good will of the companies without democratic control.<p>The way I see this is:<p>Historically we thought free market economics only applied to the monetary aspect of socio-economics. “deplatforming”&#x2F;“cancel culture” seems to be the free market “solution” to social issues. It is basically the “popular vote” weighted by capital, forcing social change by ostracism&#x2F;“excommunication” (specifically limiting their ability to scale their speech, without excommunicating them from society - “soft excommunication”?).<p>Historically social issues were dictated by the church through “hard excommunication” fast and effective, but not fair to minorities. Since then we’ve tried to use a version of “one person one vote” and required government regulation, and moved very slow (for many reasons, one of them being a disproportionate voting power to low population states). Perhaps we are now witnessing the efficiency of the free market to solve social issues?<p>Which is an interesting&#x2F;ironic result, given historic Republican policy about free markets.<p>P.S. FWIW, I’d be happy with more regulation in this area, even though the free market “solution” is in my favor. I hope we can soon live in a world that uses “one person one vote” for all societal decisions, that strategy seems most fair to me. However, whatever your politics might be, please understand: A true “one person one vote” does also mean that both the Senate and the Electoral College need to be rectified.')
