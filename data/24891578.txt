Even after finding those, I never quite felt like I’m looking at the same political reality as him, and ended up unsubscribing. I’m sympathetic to the substance of his writing, so maybe that’s just what non-partisan writing looks like and it’s too strange to read in this media environment? I don’t know,  but if anyone has more thoughts on this, then I’d like to hear them.')
