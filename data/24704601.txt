Even $5 does not go much in those countries anymore. Experienced coders charge $30 or above from  pukistan but I get your point it is still a lowball offer compared to $100 for a US based developer.  But tell me if you are a startup and just bootstraping your company with your own savings ,  where would you look to get your job done? Would you rather pay $100 per hour to a developer based in US or $30 to an experienced developer from somewhere else if your goal is to get your MVP up and running as fast as you can so that you can then attact some venture capital that you can use to hire &quot;real&quot; developers here in USA?')
