The Microsoft stand were proudly demoing a new security feature of the latest Windows (Vista?). Their demo basically boiled down to: no one reads the security warning dialog boxes when opening an application, so we added another dialog box.<p>I pointed out the obvious flaw in this (won’t they just not read the second dialog either?). They looked a little peeved and said they’d take my comment back to Redmond.<p>I still feel a bit bad about that, they we ok people and it wasn’t their fault.')
