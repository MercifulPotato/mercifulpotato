I doubt that is the case - I suspect that most humans would prefer to have both an elite job and their family relatively nearby, thus keeping talent locally is pretty easy if you have elite jobs to offer.<p>But since the GP didn’t elaborate on why they think people are leaving it’s difficult to argue about the posters intentions.')
