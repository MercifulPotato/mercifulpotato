Keep in mind I&#x27;m at &#x27;stayed at the Holiday Inn&#x27; levels of competence here, but in my mind the spike proteins that are generated by an actual infection don&#x27;t typically leave the cytoplasm detached from the rest of the virus.  This could be incorrect.<p>If that&#x27;s generally true, the difference here would be that the part of the spike protein topology that is typically bound to other proteins in an actual infection would be accessible to the immune system in the case of a vaccination.  I think that is where the differential risk could occur with a vaccination that wouldn&#x27;t occur with an actual infection (however small that might be).<p>In my daughter&#x27;s case, something happened when she was about 14 years old that caused her body to determine that the beta cells in her pancreas were invaders and have to die, so I&#x27;m just tuned into this kind of possible side effect.')
