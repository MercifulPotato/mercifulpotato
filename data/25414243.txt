In reality we have dozens of different search backends searching different stuff in different places with different relevance and UIs and results. And if you&#x27;re going to use labels then this is the same thing, except picking 1 major label to organize with.<p>It&#x27;s why we have street numbers to find buildings. It&#x27;s why libraries use catalogs to locate books. It&#x27;s why financial systems use a chart of accounts with numbers and prefixes to organize transactions.<p>Location is important, and abstracting that away into a giant file share with search only makes things worse.')
