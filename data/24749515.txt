There was a programming interview question I used to use where you&#x27;d typically build a tree and print it out. I would warn people against trying to build the tree recursively because it never went well. (Printing it out was fine.)<p>I think part of it was that to use recursion properly in this case, you&#x27;d have to return multiple values, and that complicated things, particularly if they were using a language like Java where it&#x27;s not built-in.')
