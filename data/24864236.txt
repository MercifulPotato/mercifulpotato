This is not a small car designed for the American market. This is not even a small car in the European sense. This clearly is targeting the segment filled by scooters and small motorcycles.<p>European urban driving has little in common with American urban driving. Cities are compact and very dense with little to no parking space and speed limit at 30km&#x2F;h to 50km&#x2F;h. You are never going to get close to highway speeds driving inside a city in Europe.')
