When you buy a house, or start a company, you commonly borrow resources to have the thing you want today instead of years from now. I think technical debt is exactly the same: you&#x27;re borrowing future work so that you can launch your product now instead of far in the future after you have it absolutely perfect.<p>It&#x27;s a little wild to imaging buying a house without incurring some debt. This is normal and OK. You don&#x27;t go crazy with it, though, like getting a loan for 20% over the mortgage with a 12% interest rate. Same with technical debt: cut a few corners if it lets you go to market more quickly and start earning income before your competitors can launch, but not at the cost of utter spaghetti code written in MUMPS or something. Your class hierarchy isn&#x27;t perfect? Fine - your customers aren&#x27;t paying you for that anyway.<p>So go ahead and borrow. Just don&#x27;t go so far in debt that paying it off becomes burdensome.')
