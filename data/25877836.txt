Item(by='desine', descendants=None, kids=[25877978], score=None, time=1611359147, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25877654, text='&gt;This idea that &quot;Let&#x27;s give people the ability to be anonymous, and somehow, that&#x27;s gonna make us all bond together and be better&quot; is pretty hilarious in hindsight.<p>I get irritated by this logic.  I don&#x27;t think many people are arguing that anonymous access makes us more likely to get along.  There are lots of areas where we have the freedom to do something, that access objectively makes things worse in terms of social cost, but we keep it because it&#x27;s what is right.  Installing a breathalyzer lockout device on every new car sold would decrease drunk driving.  There&#x27;s a few religious sects that could be eliminated that would overnight reduce the amount of vile rhetoric in the world.  We all make choices as to how much regulation we deem acceptable in daily life.  Many of us see no valid reason to permanently tie online access to personal identification.')
