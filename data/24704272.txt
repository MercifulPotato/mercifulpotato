Are there more jobs for Biologists than Computer Scientists&#x2F;Developers&#x2F;Programmers?<p>It looks like this is a response based on <i>demand</i>. Why in the world would you <i>want</i> more biologists when there isn&#x27;t market demand for them?<p>This is mostly wishful romanticization of particular &quot;underdog&quot; areas of studies.

Even more preposterous is the parent&#x27;s profound claim:<p>&gt; I feel like this thread has a lot of bias coming from bad experiences in the computer science field<p>I don&#x27;t understand why we are talking about bias? It&#x27;s not like the market goes &quot;Gee ... we are a software company, but only if we would abandon our biases and hire an archeologist from Columbia and sponsor an H1b visa for them.
