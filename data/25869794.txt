Only cars that used gearboxes in EV space (two speed) are usually intended to be able to hit 200mph so they need extremely wide rpm range from their electric motors. I know Rimac used one and Taycan (not surprising since Rimac is partly owned by Porsche).<p>In Rimac case, they used the gearbox to improve 0-60 times but IIRC they are losing the gearbox for their new car.')
