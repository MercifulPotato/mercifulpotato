I am talking about french and swiss rather premium products, so not some supercheap crap for 3rd world countries done by likes of Nestle&#x2F;Kraft.<p>When you cook it yourself even with very little salt and reasonable spices for a baby, the result is <i>so</i> much better. We can see how much our little one enjoys cooked stuff vs bought ones, so we stopped quickly with those. It takes some time, but covid is actually helping with this particular thing right now. Thank god our kindergarden has proper chef who actually cooks and not just reheats frozen stuff from cheap retailers.<p>Its a bit sad that even in 2021 we can&#x27;t really manufacture en masse reasonably processed food that contains just the food ingredients and tastes at least reasonably.')
