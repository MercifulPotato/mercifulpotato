AFAIK most homeless people in Finland do have a substance abuse problem, though.<p>Edit: What actually might make this more interesting is that this could be how things are regarding homelessness in Western Europe in general, more or less, not just in a single country. I mentioned this in another comment, but AFAIK living in the streets in Finland, and quite possibly in Northern and Western Europe in general, is rather strongly connected to mental health issues and substance abuse problems. That doesn&#x27;t mean that the homeless should be vilified, as both of those are illnesses and largely not a voluntary choice, but it could be something that&#x27;s different about homelessness in the U.S. and in Western&#x2F;Northern Europe.')
