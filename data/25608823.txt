I think it&#x27;s worth comparing with the Edison Phonographic Cylinder EULA: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maisonbisson.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;edison-phonograph-eula&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maisonbisson.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;edison-phonograph-eula&#x2F;</a><p>In spirit, it&#x27;s similar: &quot;We sold you a thing, but it&#x27;s not really yours.&quot; Eventually, that changed, presumably because people resented not actually owning the things that they reasonably believe they owned.<p>It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how this evolves. This is clearly different, in that &quot;purchased&quot; items only really exist on the Zynga servers; the burdens fall differently. But in the coming decades I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see some consumer protection laws around virtual purchases.')
