It&#x27;s only product management types that cast around technical criticisms without proposing any solutions so I guess you are of that strain. I don&#x27;t believe you&#x27;re stupid, far from it but I think your perspective needs some correction.<p>We&#x27;ve been using VCS fairly universally for the last 25-30 or so. There&#x27;s been RCS, CVS, SVN, Perforce, Clearcase ... the list goes on. They all have their warts. Git as it stands at this point in time is the best VCS system that the global software development community has come up with. It&#x27;s exactly as easy to use as the community that developed it needs to be.<p>You are free to explore alternatives. You can get commercial products for this kind of thing, and they may well be easier to use, but in my experience these are more buggy, though they do try to provide a more user friendly experience.<p>You are also free to use the many freely available front-ends to git that are available, or you can use Git in the old centralised model if you like, and go crying to the admin when things get too tricky, as with any other VCS.<p>By far the biggest gripe with Git is the inconsistency of the tooling, and I guess you could fork it and make whatever improvements you feel are appropriate and then set about getting people to use it. But again, there are numerous front ends (IntelliJ is my favourite) that shield you from these minutiae if needs be.<p>So please, spare me your injured animal grandstanding. Git is for the choir, not the masses, and to make it suitable for the masses would be a <i>waste of everybody&#x27;s time</i> because the masses have no interest. You have an interest that would be better served by just sitting down and learning how to use the damn tools that the rest of your colleagues do.<p>15 years. LOL.<p>EDIT - if you want something that is &quot;like git&quot; but &quot;easy to use&quot; then, in all seriousness you should check out Mercurial. I always thought it looked nice, but it&#x27;s of little use if none of my collaborators are on it.')
