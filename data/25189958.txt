Jokes aside, I think you&#x27;re underselling how complex Kubernetes is and overselling how complex logging, monitoring, process management, et al are. You don&#x27;t get any of those things with kubernetes &quot;out of the box&quot; unless you&#x27;ve got an ops team or someone&#x27;s got a year plus experience running one cloud provider&#x27;s version. It seems really easy cause we&#x27;ve got one click clusters and a bunch of great UIs but all the time people spend chasing down problems and wrangling the extra complexity of k8s in production gets papered over because it&#x27;s the hot new thing.<p>The bash history for the setup above fits on a single page and since the advent of Nix and now Terraform, repeatability hasn&#x27;t been a problem. The harder part is discipline among coworkers but Linux user&#x2F;group permissions go a long way towards making it readonly for debugging purposes while still giving fine grained control over servers.')
