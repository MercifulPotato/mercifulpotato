I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised how well it&#x27;s gone and would consider a remote position in the future but I think it&#x27;d have to be a fully remote team. When offices do return, being one of a few remote workers means you will likely be left out of a lot of teambuilding, conversations, etc.')
