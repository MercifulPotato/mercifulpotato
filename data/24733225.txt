One of good examples is compiler slowness reasons, sometimes its LLVM, or it is lot of optimizations, or it is not really slow compare to C++ and so on.<p>They could have said it straight &quot;Guys highly optimized, safe compilation of medium size project will be in range of 20-30 min&quot;. And that would great and honest way to deal. Instead we get oh, we have reduced compile times from 26 minutes to 21 minutes so it is 19% improvement in just one year and there is more to come. Now this is hard work and great but I am sure Rust committers understand when people say fast compile times they most likely comparing to Go etc which would be under a minute for most mid size projects. And this is very well not going to happen.<p>Same is now to Cargo dependency situation. Cargo and NPM are ideologically in agreement that people in general should just pull it from package manager instead of rewriting even little bit of code. And again instead of owning it there will be list of shallow reasoning: others do it too, reusing is better that rewriting, cargo is so awesome that pulling crate is much easier and so on.')
