Excluding poor local search results (which is understandable bc of the privacy aspect), Bing&#x2F;DDG has trouble with long tale search query relevance (5+ word queries), and also finding results from small or obscure sites.  The later is simply because Bing&#x27;s organic index is not as large as Googles.<p>Bing&#x2F;DDG&#x27;s organic results are still very good, but they are not as good as Google&#x27;s in the above specific circumstances.')
