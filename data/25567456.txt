Let&#x27;s look at a 1930s salary, and tell me how you afford all that stuff:<p>&gt; From 1935 to 1936 the median family income was $1,160. An annual wage of $1,000 or more placed a family in the middle-income range. The middle-income family did not have a surplus of income but did have a fairly comfortable standard of living. [0]<p>Show me how I can pay a mortgage, eat, go to the doctor (still ignoring this one, I see), have a little entertainment every once in a while, <i>etc.</i><p>Actually, I&#x27;ll make it easier on you.  From the very same source:<p>&gt; Average Family Budget, 1935<p>&gt; Income Amount, $\n&gt; Average annual income $1,348<p>&gt; Expenses<p>&gt; Food and alcoholic beverages 472<p>&gt; Housing, utilities, furnishings, etc. 456<p>&gt; Clothing 136<p>&gt; Automobile purchase and maintenance 73<p>&gt; Medical care 53<p>&gt; Recreation, reading, tobacco 72<p>&gt; Taxes 5<p>&gt; Miscellaneous expenses 5<p>&gt; Total Expenses $1,272<p>Let&#x27;s go ahead and inflate this typical 1935 family budget to today and see how we do.  Note, these numbers are <i>per year</i>.  It&#x27;s easy, right?<p>Let&#x27;s simplify it a bit and just say it&#x27;s a household of one, but you only get to live on ~1&#x2F;3 of a median US individual income, currently around $43K.  I&#x27;ll give you $15K to work with.<p>Hint: do medical care and housing first.<p>Sorry, not my fault you regret biting off more than you can chew.  You knew you couldn&#x27;t do what you were claiming from the beginning.<p>---<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.encyclopedia.com&#x2F;education&#x2F;news-and-education-magazines&#x2F;everyday-life-1929-1941" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.encyclopedia.com&#x2F;education&#x2F;news-and-education-ma...</a>')
