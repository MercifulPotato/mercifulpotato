Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605248082, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25068056, text='&gt; I remember distros (Debian and others) patching cdrecord, which resulted in the upstream author getting furious and re-licensing cdrecord under a non-free license to stop them.<p>Right, <i>because</i> he was getting blamed for bugs introduced by those patches.<p>&gt; Hadoop is not buildable with non-bundled dependencies, as far as I understand. This violates Policy. We were discussing reliability â€“ am I missing something here?<p>Well, if you can&#x27;t install programs you want to use, that&#x27;s not reliable. My point is that in practice you end up with an awkward mix of system-managed and non-managed programs installed, because there&#x27;s a lot that Debian is unwilling to package, and such a system becomes unreliable, particularly when those system-managed packages diverge from their upstreams.<p>&gt; Python libraries are hardly applications.<p>No, but in the Python ecosystem it&#x27;s normal for new versions of an application to require relatively up-to-date versions of a large number of small libraries. So the applications end up out very out of date. I think there was a post here not so long ago from the Debian side about how it&#x27;s increasingly unsustainable to try to include programs from ecosystems with a small-library mentality in Debian.<p>&gt; Add-on repos are frowned upon in Debian.<p>And yet I&#x27;ve seen far more of them being made for Debian than for other distributions.')
