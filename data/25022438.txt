None of it is remotely close to being usable as a photon-controlled photon gate.<p>All-optical switching (i.e. photonic computing) is like fusion power generation.

Heat diffuses very slowly; you won&#x27;t be able to put a lot of these devices near each other and run them at usable speeds without them causing each other thermal interference.')
