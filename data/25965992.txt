They call them modern but none are simple enough such that they get it out of the way. Eventually on linux only i3 makes sense for dev work but otherwise for the common desktop user windows 10 UI makes sense (once you remove the search and cortana and turn it into XP style UI) even over macOS. Sadly the telemetry the bloat makes it quite unusable. It just keeps reinstalling things though there are antispy tools disabling (or limiting i&#x27;m guessing) telemetry.<p>Also i&#x27;ve tried WSL2 and Debian is much better than ubuntu. the ubuntu and snap fiasco is quite annoying. i know you can just uninstall snaps but i think a simple debian install is enough for most dev testing if you plan to go WSL2 because it&#x27;s extremely lightweight and fast inside wsl2. Also vscodium is an option as open source without telemetry but wsl2 can&#x27;t be accessed through it because it&#x27;s apis i believe are closed source.')
