It&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re going to get richer working 80 hours. Come review time, nobody looks and says, &quot;oh hey, you worked lots and lots of hours. You get a promotion!&quot; It makes no sense.<p>Now if you owned 10% of your startup and those 40 extra hours meant the difference between a big exit and running out of runway, that makes more sense.')
