The issue is that for two of these three communities, they are hosted by a company that has a large amount of power over the communities. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to replace HN with some federated&#x2F;p2p alternative, because HN is already independent.<p>And not <i>everything</i> needs to be a decentralised system, that&#x27;s just a false dichotomy. If GitLab.com deletes my repos or stops offering the features I like, I&#x27;ll just move elsewhere, I could even move to another GitLab instance. It&#x27;s much harder to move a group of people.<p>Besides, not everyone needs to run a server in a federated environment. As long as it&#x27;s a possibility, one rogue actor can&#x27;t take over the whole network. Most people don&#x27;t host their own email&#x2F;Matrix server, and that&#x27;s okay.')
