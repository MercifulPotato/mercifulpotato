Item(by='motohagiography', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611931098, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25955314, text='Habitat 67 is a monument to what happened when progressive idealism met the Quebec construction industry, imo.<p>The few examples of modern &quot;sustainable,&quot; neighbourhoods that emerged organically were the result of a community (often illegally) adapting industrial buildings for mixed use, and then a cycle of gentrification that makes them desirable. Letting owners convert residential to mixed use also does it. The central planning route just creates subsidized luxury housing for the politically connected.<p>Architecture expresses economics, and Habitat 67 was an artifact of using federal largess to bribe Quebec to stay in confederation in an age of naive social engineering. When I last saw it in the 90&#x27;s, the way it continued to absorb subsidies to maintain it on behalf of people who worked in publicly funded culture industries, was basically the most Canadian thing ever.<p>I often say that Canada is british democracy with french efficiency that only persists for lack of many natural predators this far north. Habitat 67 is kind of a monument to that absurdity.')
