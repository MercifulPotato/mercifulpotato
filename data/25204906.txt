Long form media tend to be just very long narratives. Newspapers are narrative wrapped around a single factual event, to fit that event into a preferred narrative.<p>Tweets can be narrative driven, but sometimes they’re centered around some primary source document or chart or something like that, and in that case they can be far more useful than a newspaper article.<p>My view these days is give me the primary sources or GTFO. For example, I don’t trust you to tell me what’s in a court filing—the first thing in your article better be a link to the filing itself and you had better actually quote the source material.')
