Why can&#x27;t you trust your dad about his stock purchases? Yes, someone like your dad can buy a stock easily. They can also lose all their money at a casino or buy a lottery ticket easily. They can spend all their money on gadgets or fancy clothes. They can drink too much alcohol, or gain too much weight. Life comes with risks.<p>To the extent that a behavior will harm innocent bystanders, then I am fine with making various things illegal, I&#x27;m not an anarchist or hard core libertarian or anything. But I don&#x27;t see how letting someone buy shares of a stock falls into that category of things that could harm innocent bystanders.')
