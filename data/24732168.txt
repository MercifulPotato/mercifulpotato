Up until 1995 55MPH was the maximum except for roads very far from population centers.<p>Even after 1995, many states were very slow to raise the speed limit (I lived near the Maryland&#x2F;Virginia boarder and remember Maryland did well before Virginia), and when they did raise the speed limit it was by small amounts.<p>Today, you can drive from Los Angeles to New York and not hit any significant stretches of freeway with speedlimits under 65, and west of the Mississipi river, you will spend most of it at 70mph or higher.<p>On top of that, the actual speed that will get you pulled over can be much higher (In CA you are very unlikely to get pulled over for single-digit MPH speeding on a freeway, making a 65 speed limit a de-facto 74; in the northeast US it&#x27;s not uncommon to get pulled over for going just 5MPH over the posted limit).')
