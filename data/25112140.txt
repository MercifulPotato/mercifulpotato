You can give &#x27;good&#x27; advice or &#x27;bad&#x27; advice\n2. Your advice can be followed, or ignored<p>There are thus four outcomes:<p>i. You give good advice and they follow it. They will most likely internalise the merit of the advice and not really give you any credit, but no praise is the best possible outcome.<p>ii. You give good advice and they ignore it. They resent you for giving them good advice that they ignored.<p>iii. You give bad advice and they follow it. They resent you (and blame you) for the outcome.<p>iv. You give bad advice and they ignore it. They dismiss you as an idiot.')
