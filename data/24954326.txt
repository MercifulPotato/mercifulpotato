But the signal here is very noisy and unreliable except for a few cases like having a well known surname.<p>To my knowledge there is no correlation to place of birth. While there may be statistical differences in the distribution of characteristics such as say skin colour among communities which I am unaware of, you will find a reasonable representation of all physiognomies? in each community.')
