Can you just state the fact? You can even add some qualifying statements like I did. But for christ&#x27;s sake just say it first! No need to go out of your way to find a subset that is (no doubt) excepted from the average. It&#x27;s politically inconvenient, yes.<p>It&#x27;s not just politically inconvenient, it&#x27;s also lacking a lot of nuance. Native Americans commit crimes at an even higher rate than African Americans do. The two groups share a long history of violent disenfranchisement. Taking the statistics in isolation, yes Native Americans and African Americans do commit crime at higher than average rates. But ignoring structural issues is just as disingenuous as ignoring the data.<p>&gt; But it&#x27;s also the truth, and one that might help explain why african americans are more likely to have interactions with police (a group I have no love for, tbh).<p>Can you prove this cause and effect chain? The rate at which African Americans encounter the police is much greater than the rate at which violent crimes are committed. I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;re wrong, but I haven&#x27;t seen any causality research here, but the way you&#x27;ve juxtaposed these claims implies that you believe there&#x27;s causality here.')
