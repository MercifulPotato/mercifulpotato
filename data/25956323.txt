But i suppose our beloved skeptics are apt to ignore that inconvenient interpretation. I just think that the propensity to think outside the box, and courageously push against the boundaries of (sometimes merely culturally normative, as in the case of TCM) orthodoxy, while also keeping connected to truth, is possibly one of the foundations of scientific genius, and seems to be something to be encouraged. At the very least, it&#x27;s benign. I&#x27;m not quite sure why people seem to be so terrified of scientists who dare stand outside the herd, and propose new ideas.<p>Don&#x27;t we have enough groupthink everywhere else (politics, think tanks, political science, education, religion), can&#x27;t we have one place to celebrate dangerous ideas? Why wouldn&#x27;t science be the perfect place for that?<p>I think it&#x27;s possible your Hancockyness is a little overblown. Perhaps he&#x27;s not quite the crank you think, tho he may be the crank you need.')
