Item(by='elihu', descendants=None, kids=[25382775], score=None, time=1607665189, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25382236, text='&gt; The raw feeling of man and machine coming into one wasn&#x27;t there at all, although it was a lot of fun to drive, which is why I&#x27;m giving up my collection of ICE stuff besides my first car and bike and getting a Cybertruck.<p>I wonder if this is more of a Telsa thing than an electric car thing?  I test-drove a dual-motor model-3, and while the acceleration was very impressive, it felt kind of boring to drive in general.  Not that I&#x27;m some automotive connoisseur, I&#x27;ve been mostly driving boring stick-shift Hondas for the last couple decades.<p>(My current project is to convert a Mazda RX-8 I picked up cheap with a bad engine to electric.  I thought about getting a Tesla model 3, but in the end it wasn&#x27;t quite the car I wanted, and was more expensive than I wanted to pay, and too locked down.  If I can get the RX-8 going, it&#x27;ll have a lot less range and not any better in terms of storage space, but it should at least be fun to drive and I can configure it however I like.)')
