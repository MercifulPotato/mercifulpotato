If that&#x27;s your only ML experience then I suppose this is how sceptical you&#x27;d be of ML in general.<p>It looks like DeepMind invented a completely new method for this round that&#x27;s not just an extension of their previous work, showing how much you can gain if you don&#x27;t shoebox yourself into just trying to improve existing methods.<p>That all the scientists were highly skeptical about the scope of ML (and these are computer scientists to begin with mind you) just shows how little they knew of what they did know of what a computer or a program can possibly do, which is a bit appalling to be honest.')
