Item(by='gamblor956', descendants=None, kids=[24882087], score=None, time=1603571102, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24878296, text='<i>Copyright included fair use and the courts ruled that a balance for fair use must be maintained for the monopoly rights of copyright to be enforced, but congress wrote the DMCA and said &quot;nah&quot;?</i><p>The Constitution gave Congress the power to right the laws on copyrights, not the courts. The courts don&#x27;t write copyright law, they just interpret it.<p>Fair use, for example, is explicitly written into the copyright <i>statutes</i> by Congress (17 USC ยง 107), but with sufficient breadth and ambiguity in the language that the courts have added in uses that were not explicitly written into the law but could be reasonably read as being within the scope of the text of the law. That is indeed <i>why</i> the court in the Betamax case was able to characterize &quot;time shifting&quot; as fair use in the first place.<p><i>Yeah I&#x27;m gonna need to hear that from the courts, my assertion here is that the DMCA unfairly skirts around this provision of copyright, not that it superceded it outright.</i><p>Again, Congress gets to write copyright law... They get to change it how they want, so long as it does not violate the Constitution. (Note that the DMCA is an &quot;act&quot; of Congress, which is the method by which Congress actually writes and changes the laws of the US. When we refer to the DMCA, we are referring to the <i>changes</i> to US copyright law embodied by the DMCA.) Courts have upheld the constitutionality of the DMCA.<p><i>Those fair use rights are not an optional provision of copyright,</i><p>Yes, they are. The Constitution makes no provision for &quot;fair use.&quot; In fact, by its bare text, it would appear that the Constitution would <i>not</i> support fair use because it provides for &quot;exclusive rights&quot; to go to creators and inventors (for the periods covered by copyright and patent). &quot;Fair use&quot; is entirely a legislative creation of Congress, and theoretically Congress could take it away.<p><i>unless you have relevant case law that superseded Sony Betamax</i><p>I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;re hung up on Betamax. That case was based on the copyright law at the time of the case, i.e., the 1980s. Congress changed the copyright laws after that case (in the DMCA and other legislative acts), so Betamax is no longer relevant except as persuasive authority, and the underlying facts supporting the time-shifting as fair use ruling generally do not apply to digital content available on-demand.')
