I don&#x27;t want Apple to do anything other than allow me to install apps outside of the App Store and without the bullshit 7-day restriction on sideloading.<p>I know what I bought and iPhones are still the best option for my use case <i>despite</i> the limitations. Just because I decided to purchase an iPhone from the limited options (Android or nothing), doesn&#x27;t mean I have to be head-over-heels in love with it and I can still be unhappy with certain aspects of it. I can still desire improvements to what I consider the best available option.<p>You can continue to try to do mental gymnastics and twist the contexts here, but you&#x27;re bending over backwards to let Apple bend you over.<p>What&#x27;s even more frustratingly absurd is that you think that you can &quot;hack&quot; your iPhone without going through Apple. The only way to do that is purchasing a Mac for around $1k and to get over the previously mentioned bullshit 7-day restriction is a $99&#x2F;yr developer account.')
