Just because a given URL might break into the top 10 <i>URLs</i> for a day doesn&#x27;t affect that these <i>pages</i> dominate news feed volume.<p>If you go to Dan Bongino&#x27;s Facebook page, you&#x27;ll see why his page doesn&#x27;t show up in the by-URL analysis: most of his content is not links to external content, but in-Facebook content. So I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s &quot;misinformation&quot; to point that his page has enormous amounts of traffic, and I think it&#x27;s misleading to say that it doesn&#x27;t because grouping by a metric that excludes that traffic.')
