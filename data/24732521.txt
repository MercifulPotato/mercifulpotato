For me targeted ads just show me things I&#x27;ve already bought. &quot;Great google, yep, last month I was reading midi controller reviews, and I bought one last month. &quot; Amazon does the same thing after I&#x27;ve bought something from them. Just bought a printer? Amazon&#x27;s gonna email me shit about other printers I might like for a week, not accessories that go with the machine I purchased, just other printers. So not only am I not really comfortable with tracking, I don&#x27;t think the experience justifies it.')
