Also, it doesn&#x27;t address other vehicles for suppressing toxic speech; for instance, no 230 change you come up with is going to obligate cloud providers to do business with Parler and StormFront.<p>I should add a point I should have made earlier, which is that 230 is in no way based on a notion of being &quot;publishers&quot; or &quot;platforms&quot;. That&#x27;s a super common misconception about the law.')
