Eich originally joined intending to put Scheme &quot;in the browser&quot;, but his Netscape superiors insisted that the language&#x27;s syntax resemble that of Java. As a result, Eich devised a language that had much of the functionality of Scheme, the object-orientation of Self, and the syntax of Java.<p>From day one, Eich was told to make it &quot;Java-like&quot;. Netscape first tried to get Java itself running in the browser, even before developing JavaScript. JavaScript looks like Java not by accident but on purpose.')
