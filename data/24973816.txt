Even in posts where I just state logical reasons for disagreement I get voted down in this thread.<p>People vote down what they disagree with, if they agreed with me, most peoples&#x27; biases would usually find my attitude appropriate.<p>If I said something like logically I feel a certain race is inferior genetically. People will vote that statement down purely out of disagreement and misinterpret it as an emotionally charged statement and illogical.<p>It&#x27;s just a statement with no logic behind it. It&#x27;s dead pan with nothing. You can&#x27;t even find erroneous logic with it because the logic wasn&#x27;t even spelled out. You can only technically disagree with the statement. But people will subconsciously add all sorts of embellishment.<p>That&#x27;s how people work. Maybe Nimish didn&#x27;t vote me down, but they certainly aren&#x27;t voting me down because I&#x27;m crossing some sort of line. They&#x27;re voting me down because they disagree. That&#x27;s the majority of it.<p>You&#x27;ll find that more than anything the majority of what I write are just dead pan responses with like 5% of the sentences being &quot;expressive.&quot; In fact a great number of stuff that I write that gets voted down is just dead pan responses with zero &quot;expressiveness.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s because people can&#x27;t tell the difference between someone disagreeing with them and an actual attack. That&#x27;s human nature. We all think we&#x27;re above it, but basically none of us are. You&#x27;ll find that even you are like this.<p>The reason why I get voted down is because my opinions tend to be different than most people. So people interpret this disagreement as an attack.')
