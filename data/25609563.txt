Using some of the brine, for one, and combining the brine with treated wastewater for another.<p>The latter depends a lot on how closed cycle your process is. Most of the water I use to shower or wash my clothes ends up in the sewer. Filling a swimming pool, not so much. Watering my lawn, only what overflows into the storm water system.<p>It&#x27;s also distinctly possible we may have to build offshore desal plants to keep the thermohaline cycle running, using the brine as geoengineering.')
