[1]<p>When you&#x27;re selling company value, but taking the money yourself in the form of some kind of arbitrary comp, that&#x27;s defrauding investors, it&#x27;s a form of embezzlement.<p>That the investors &#x27;didn&#x27;t care&#x27; is fine, but I don&#x27;t see how it could have been arranged in the first place - the acquirer does not get to decide how much the &#x27;founder&#x27; is going to get.<p>Also - the $800K write off seems odd. A million dollars is not nothing, and there would definitely not have been $800K in lawyers fees, far from it.<p>Something here doesn&#x27;t seem quite right.<p>Also - folks - if he is negotiating comp outside of share value, that&#x27;s not only hosing the investors - but any employee equity as well.<p>A small team where some other guy has 5% of the company, that&#x27;s $150, not a lot, but not nothing. If the package was  dealt outside of equity, those equity holders were screwed, if in fact there were other shareholders&#x2F;equity holders.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;2&#x2F;hi&#x2F;business&#x2F;6897991.stm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;2&#x2F;hi&#x2F;business&#x2F;6897991.stm</a>')
