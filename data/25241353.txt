I accept science method because I know nothing better. But I doubt the idea, that there are no possibility to invent something better.<p><i>&gt; we have no all-encompassing explanation of the universe that concludes R = U&#x2F;I for electric circuits</i><p>I&#x27;m not a physicist to argue with it. But somewhere deep inside me I see R = U&#x2F;I as a tautology too. R, U and I was defined by a way, that made R=U&#x2F;I true. There is some information about the universe encoded in this rule, but there also information about us there. How to separate information about the universe from information about us?')
