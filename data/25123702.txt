A GUI is fine (and a good thing) as long as it is just for convenience and discoverability, and it doesn&#x27;t abstract git away, hide its power or try to impose its own workflow.<p>IMHO, a good git GUI would show exactly what commands are being run (so it is useful as a learning tool) and their result and allow it being used along side the cli.<p>I use magit extensively and it has all these properties.')
