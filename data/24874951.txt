Are their authors untouchable just because they put in some boilerplate disclaimer like that?<p>As for what was written in some code somewhere in the repo, it could have been written by anyone, even an RIAA plant who contributed that trojan horse to the project.<p>What makes anyone think what was said there is endorsed by or even representative of the views of the rest of the authors of youtube-dl or is what youtube-dl is for?<p>God, it pisses me off to no end to think that I&#x27;m going to be forced to use youtube&#x27;s piece of shit, slow, ad-infested, tacker-infested, feature-poor, non-automatable browser interface.<p>But, after taking a few deep breaths, I think within a year there&#x27;ll be multiple alternatives to youtube-dl which will all bear disclaimers that they are <i>&quot;for educational purposes only&quot;</i> and that they in no way endorse copyright infringement.')
