As a hoster, I am incapable of moderating content since I don&#x27;t keep the data (it&#x27;s all in people&#x27;s own hard drives, e.g.). The hard part though is that getting people to write webrtc-based apps is unreasonable, instead I&#x27;d let you get apps that expose html&#x2F;js data and serve html&#x2F;js over RTC.')
