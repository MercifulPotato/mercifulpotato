While no one will claim that was a bad thing.<p>In the case of capitol siege they followed the orders their leader. This is not always that bad: unlocking people to do violent things are half of the issue too. You can dream about killing someone, thinking about suicide or whatever - difference is if it will lead to action. Unlocking people to attack capitol or commit suicide are also a crime and in both cases target is not capable to think clearly. Why we treat two cases differently?')
