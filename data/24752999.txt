The term for the concept comes from the study of amusements, but in the context of game theory, a game is merely a situation where at least two participants make strategic decisions that effect each others&#x27; outcomes, potentially in the face of incomplete knowledge.<p>In this sense, &quot;People who play games&quot; are people who make mutual decisions which affect themselves and others.')
