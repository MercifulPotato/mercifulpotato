Item(by='leetcrew', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608402144, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25479399, text='&gt; I had the same VIP area issue, on reload I watched the guard conversation and then another guard goes to the bathroom where you can jump him for his keycard. There were a few different ways to do it I think.<p>yeah I ended up playing through it a few times. part of why it was so confusing was that I actually went straight to the manager the first time I went in the back hallway area. he seemed a little surprised to see me, but wasn&#x27;t too upset. I had to reload because I threatened to fight him if he didn&#x27;t spill the beans and I lost the fight. the next time through, I ran into someone else who just shot me on sight.<p>&gt; Once inside nobody saw me as a threat though which was odd. I was wearing an arosaka vest so maybe thatâ€™s why?<p>if that&#x27;s the actual reason, that would be pretty cool! I&#x27;d actually love a more implicit&#x2F;nuanced system for &quot;where am I allowed to be&quot;. the thing that really breaks the immersion is wondering whether I am solving a puzzle or troubleshooting a bug. in general, I only do the latter for pay :)')
