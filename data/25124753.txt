Item(by='bscphil', descendants=None, kids=[25128009], score=None, time=1605626541, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25122628, text='&gt; Given your knowledge you can disable or even build firefox with DoH disabled , it is a sensible default for vast majority of users who do not know what DHCP is, or control their network. It cannotis trivial configuration for people who can control and do not want the DoH service provider given by Firefox.<p>I have mixed feelings about the issue, but it&#x27;s not that simple.<p>I run a variety of services on my LAN for my users and guests. That includes Unbound, so even though their browser doesn&#x27;t know it, their queries are secure from my ISP. But more importantly I have other stuff behind hostnames (which are resolved by Unbound). For example, my guests can navigate to music&#x2F; and use a web interface to play any of the music in my library over the stereo.<p>Hopefully it&#x27;s obvious why this is something useful to have.<p>Now that Firefox is intercepting DNS requests, a conversation with someone might go like this: &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s not working? Are you using Firefox? Yeah, Firefox broke this recently, let me get the IP address for you.&quot; And then I have to log in to a computer, ssh into the relevant system, and get its IP address on the LAN.<p>And that&#x27;s just the beginning. Last I checked Cloudflare still can&#x27;t resolve the archive.is &#x2F; archive.today domains. Even though I use Cloudflare over TLS in Unbound, I fix this for myself and my users by sending these domains to Google instead. Anything as convenient and simplistic as Firefox just sending everything directly to Cloudflare can&#x27;t do that.')
