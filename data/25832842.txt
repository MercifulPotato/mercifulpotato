So no need to use &#x27;socialist&#x27; instead of &#x27;social democratic&#x27; unless you want to dogwhistle to communist supporters.<p>Also note that this meaning of term &#x27;socialist&#x27; is rather archaic (and not in opposition to term &#x27;capitalist&#x27;). The modern meaning of &#x27;socialism&#x27; is to describe economic system in countries of soviet communist bloc.')
