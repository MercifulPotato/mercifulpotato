AVIF is good but it&#x27;s clearly a video codec adapted to fixed images, whereas JPEG XL covers a lot more use cases important when dealing with images (ie palette images, progressive decoding, more bit depths options, JPEG lossless recompression, etc). Adding to that producing large AVIF images takes an ungodly amount of memory and time right now.')
