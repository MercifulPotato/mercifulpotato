I think they will exploit these powers to a far greater extent going forward. There is nothing to celebrate here.<p>Trump&#x27;s base of support is insane, but somewhat independent of control by Washington (versus the Democratic party electorate which loyally votes for the chosen leader). The establishment is finally asserting its power to lay down the law. Unfortunately, the country is spinning out of control for reasons they can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t manage so this will only be a band-aid though it&#x27;s gonna hurt for us.')
