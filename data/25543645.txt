Usually it is not done for weapons designs since you got all those neutrons and can just double the yield by adding some 238U outer layer.<p>But e.g. the US Castle Bravo test or the soviet Tsar Bomba tests were almost pure fusion. For the Tsar Bomba they left out the 3rd fission stage. It was the cleanest bomb ever detonated in terms of radiation per yield.')
