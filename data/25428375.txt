I agree that it probably made some sense to have some kind of plantation economy in the South, and that, <i>as a matter of fact</i> the plantations the South did have were based on enslaved labor.  And for sure, there are interesting debates to have about the unacknowledged contribution that&#x27;s inherent in that. But slavery was never <i>a necessary part</i> of that successful economy; indeed, it&#x27;s quite physically possible to have plantations that employ free laborers as opposed to relying on slaves!')
