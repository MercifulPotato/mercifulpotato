Good on you for knowing which color is which, but most of my friends who are fairly good with computers and internet, don&#x27;t really understand what is going on.<p>I think Google tried the same and the Android audience were less forgiving and I think Android is better off because of that.<p>I would have loved to have SMS and iMessage separate. I use SMS less because of iMessage. When I switched to my Android phone, some people would text me in iMessage and the messages would end up on my iPad, where I had asked for all iMessage notification to be turned off, because I want to receive SMS on my phone.')
