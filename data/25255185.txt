I think academic rigor and being a decent scholar, as well as being able to parse and produce research are good things (and in my mind, those are the corner stones of being an academic). Did misunderstand you?<p>FWIW, in germany (and likely other european countries) we have a two tier system for higher education, consisting of universities and &quot;applied universities&quot;, with the latter focusing on applied skills and the former focusing on research, which in think is sensible.')
