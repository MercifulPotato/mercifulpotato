It was in the early 2000s shortly after Phil’s death.  He had taken it very hard and had gotten really into fitness as part of his coping mechanism.  Ended up starting a chain of really top of the line gyms in Dayton Ohio.  I actually worked out of the back office of one of the gyms for a while working for one of Steve’s buddies.<p>I wouldn’t characterize Phil as having no friends, at least from the little I knew of Steve.')
