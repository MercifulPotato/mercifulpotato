Hardware guys + the occasional assembly code. However, my command of Linux &#x2F; OS-level stuff is far superior over my peers, and I&#x27;m able to occasionally write up a shell-script or two in a few hours that replicates something a peer does over a week at a low-level. (Hardware guys don&#x27;t necessarily know that &quot;Tee&quot; exists, or how to use Unix Domain Sockets or pipes to their fullest extend)<p>Becoming the best in one field is almost impossible: there is always someone more studied than you. However, becoming &quot;competent&quot; in two or three different fields can lead to a strong advantage.<p>Yes, you should reach for depth in your field. But you should also reach for breadth when its easy. There are sometimes easy ways to differentiate yourself over your peers.<p>----------<p>I feel like there needs to be a good collection of books that teach the &quot;simplest tricks&quot; of a field.<p>Ex: Cryptography Engineering is the &quot;simplest&quot; explanation of cryptography. There&#x27;s not enough math to understand any crypto-algorithm, but by just laying out the names of common algorithms + their common uses, the book teaches the &quot;easiest&quot; bits of crypto to those outside of the field.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s the niche for this book? I haven&#x27;t read it, but if its written clearly enough, it can be used for someone like me to explore a field I don&#x27;t work in on a day-to-day basis.<p>--------<p>Breadth of study vs depth of study are two different styles of study. They&#x27;re not necessarily more or less important... they&#x27;re just two different ways of creating your own niche in your organization.')
