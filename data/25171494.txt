He&#x27;d lost some project work, and let his life insurance lapse.  Had a heart attack just a few weeks later, and left a wife and 3 kids with very little.  He worked from home and spent time with them, but had hit a point where money was a problem.  The story sticks with me because he&#x27;d contacted me just a couple months before he died asking if I had any work&#x2F;referrals, and I had nothing at that time.<p>The older I get, the more I see less the great outcomes when adversity hit people I know (whether death or illness or some other big hit).  Money isn&#x27;t everything, but in many of those cases, having an extra $k saved up would indeed help smooth people through those rough patches.  I&#x27;m actually amazed at how many folks work for decades, then something happens, and there&#x27;s a gofundme set up for the family to help with day to day bills.<p>If you have all your financial ducks in a row, everyone is comfortable, and you have the life you want, that&#x27;s great.  To each their own, indeed!  :)')
