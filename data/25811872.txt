My car...<p>- is paid for (the single best thing about it)<p>- is a 13-years-old Mitsubishi Spyder Eclipse that’s done ~50k miles and runs like a dream<p>- has been a bastion of reliability over the years<p>- has never failed to start, even when left standing for 6 months due to CV19<p>- still has great pick up and is fun to drive<p>My wife has a much newer car, with far more technology in it,  backup cameras, satellite radio, tire pressure sensors, Bluetooth, built-in gps, etc. etc. etc. Her car<p>- has the saving grace of also being paid for<p>- always seems to have something wrong with it, some minor sensor is broken, or false-alerting, or <i>something</i>. Most-recent is the passenger seatbelt-not-being-worn chiming away, when there’s no passenger.. which apparently needs the $$$ entire seat being replaced.<p>- does <i>not</i> have the innate reliability of my car,<p>- has had its battery replaced a couple of times<p>- has needed to be charged <i>three times</i> now, after being left for a few weeks at a time due to CV19. We just plug it in every weekend now.<p>- was significantly more expensive (admittedly, bought 7 years later) than my car<p>I’m not sure, based admittedly on anecdote, that the trend towards ever-more-complex and consequently ever-more-expensive cars is a great one. The cynic in me thinks that minor sensors going wrong and needing major parts replaced to fix them, is a good way for manufacturers to make a fair amount of money on the sly.<p>Anyway, I can’t see myself replacing my car any time soon, for me they’re a way of getting from A to B, and reliability is the prime concern. The spyder is “nice enough” that I don’t want to risk the reliability.')
