That means x86 chips have to deal with lots of wrong guesses and mistakes which has to be discarded. This creates such a convoluted and complicated decoder stage that it is really hard to add more decoders. But for Apple, it is trivial in comparison to keep adding more.<p>In fact, adding more causes so many other problems that four decoders according to AMD itself is basically an upper limit for them.&quot;')
