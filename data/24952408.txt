Lots of large companies use php for their internal applications. I built a php based backend for one of the largest sellers on amazon, in php. That company is approaching $1B in annual revenue.<p>Php allowed my team to move amazingly fast and deliver what the business needed very quickly. In e-commerce and dealing with Amazon specificity, rules and methods change monthly and you always have to be able to quickly pivot to remain competitive and I think php was a big factor in allowing this to happen.')
