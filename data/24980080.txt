Consenting to a usability study means I want to provide feedback and actively state what I&#x27;m doing, why I&#x27;m doing it, and what I didn&#x27;t expect.<p>It does not mean I want you to see what I do, where I leave my mouse, what I click on, what input I type -- and what input I then delete. If I wanted that then I would take screenshots or a video and share that.')
