I know the quoted reason is that its something to do with the structure of the delivery method, the lipid nanoparticles. And I&#x27;ve seen news articles saying that this information is proprietary and won&#x27;t be released. Is that really an acceptable excuse for the first mRNA vaccine to be used on a massive scale and with about 6 months of trials?<p>I think this information should be made open so that other countries&#x2F;companies can produce vaccines with the higher temperature requirement, not to mention that the public should know these differences and why they exist. There&#x27;s gotta be more factories that have the necessary equipment, but the plans just aren&#x27;t available.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;sections&#x2F;health-shots&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;17&#x2F;935563377&#x2F;why-does-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-need-to-be-kept-colder-than-antarctica" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;sections&#x2F;health-shots&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;17&#x2F;9355633...</a>')
