We had several mobile apps that required some calculus, statistical models and some differential equations.<p>In college, I only had to take through Trigonometry for my major so when I was suddenly tasked with this stuff, I eventually had to lean pretty hard on two of my co-workers who had CS degrees and were much better with it than me.<p>I got through it unscathed and ended up with a much greater love and appreciation for math.')
