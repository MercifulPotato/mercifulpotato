Morse is still very much alive and - most of all - <i>fun</i>. I like to compare it to playing and listening to music.<p>There are many active mountaineers (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sota.org.uk&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sota.org.uk&#x2F;</a>) and nature lovers (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wwff.co&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wwff.co&#x2F;</a>) who take their radios with them and have fun &quot;activating&quot; summits or nature reserves, and on the other side there are many guys hunting&#x2F;collecting these activations.<p>There is a great feeling of community between those pursuing similar goals and many life long friendships have been formed through ham radio.<p>As I said, this is only a <i>tiny</i> fraction of what ham radio is all about, but the one that I personally love.')
