A watch that keeps track of some vital signs. I don&#x27;t want an Android-compatible smartwatch. I don&#x27;t want a smartwatch at all. I want a simple &quot;health&quot; device.<p>I got a new fitbit for Christmas because I couldn&#x27;t even initialize it without installing their app on my smartphone. I don&#x27;t want their app on my phone. I don&#x27;t want it to report all my info to their servers. I don&#x27;t want it to have access to my gps location, which is might be reporting in. My old fitbit doesn&#x27;t need any of that at all, and I don&#x27;t see the need for a new one (that would meet my needs) to, either.')
