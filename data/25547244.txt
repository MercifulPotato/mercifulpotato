The article admits as much and Harvard Med will confirm it. Will an &quot;incrediburger&quot; give you boobs and make you penis fall off? Absolutely not, but the hormones in soy <i>are</i> actively used in hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women.<p>I think men who choose low reality&#x2F;information news sources, sources that are often ripe for manipulation might be excused for fearing they will grow bigger boobs given the reality of the situation. Particularly men who are already experiencing bigger boobs as a result of age, testosterone loss, and fat.<p>As with so much of The Atlantic&#x27;s content, this article seems to go out of the way to present an otherwise interesting topic with a culture war lens. No one who could actually benefit from unbiased information about the health benefits of soy is reading The Atlantic because they are <i>&quot;vegan-curious&quot;</i>.<p><i>&quot;vegan-curious&quot;</i> really? the author thought that that might help someone who listens to Joe Rogan have some sort of soy epiphany?  Burger King had it right in my opinion and by the way, soy is not the exclusive product of vegans.<p>This kind of framing is why the right is able to paint the left as condescending elitists.')
