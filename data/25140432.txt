However the recommendation for IDEA tools kept growing stronger among my network. So I just took the plunge with their JetBrains (for Java). And what worked for me was I was full on using their IDE. Including running the app&#x2F;web-server from within IDE. The great thing is they have 30 day trial period and so I learned most of the <i>right</i> way of using it. i.e., keyboard short cuts, navigation etc., Towards the end of the trial period I could sense a clear increase in my productivity. From then on buying full version was easy decision.<p>With their DataGrip product it was something similar. Good thing is their trial version allows 30 minute sessions. I kept on using it for a month or so until I was annoyed with repeated restarts so bought their full suite of products (the difference between two tools and full suite is something like ~10$&#x2F;month).<p>&gt; Laptop.\nMacBook&#x27;s keyboard + Trackpad has been a game changer for me. Especially the trackpad. It&#x27;s incredibly easy for me to navigate using trackpad. From exclusively Linux for ~12 years I&#x27;ve gone full on Apple ecosystem over last 3 years. Now not just Laptop I can also vouch for their bluetooth keyboard, trackpad and iPhone-11, and AirPods Pro.')
