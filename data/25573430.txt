Five years ago it went for $140k. It is located in a quiet small town 30 minutes from a real city. Built in the 1960s and still in good condition.<p>Another childhood home, 3 bed&#x2F;2 bath and 1900 sf, is worth $55k currently. Also a brick home in relatively good condition, built in the 1920s, though considerably further from a real city.<p>These are places I actually lived.
