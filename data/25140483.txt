My daily routine (like a &quot;self-program&quot;) with tasks, priorities, calendars, notes for review, habits in process of being formed, everything all smoothly integrated, inside this text&#x2F;desktop (keyboard-oriented) app I wrote (free, AGPL, uses postgresql but I might move it to Rust and SQLite someday to simplify installation):  <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;onemodel.org" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;onemodel.org</a> (aka OM).<p>Edit: In some ways, I tie everything to:<p>* pvsgeer: purpose, vision, strategy, goals, empowerment, execution, measure&#x2F;review&#x2F;report&#x2F;repeat &amp;c.<p>* roles&#x2F;goals (like Covey said in 7 habits, like, person&#x2F;child, spouse, parent, extended family member, citizen, professional&#x2F;employee)<p>And things sort of flow from there, but baked into daily and periodic routines to help me stay on track <i>and</i> enjoy balanced life.  Or at least that is the intent, and it helps greatly, as I continue learning.<p>* edit2: I have a prioritization system inside OM that I use to not get consumed with busy-ness.  It also helps tremendously, to be able to sort things etc.')
