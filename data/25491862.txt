As Todd Rundgren said (can’t find the citation), there are a lot of folks who have passed through the music industry, but few settlers.  For classical music, my impression is that has been true for a while for that genre.<p>But people made music and listened to music long before money was around.  Making music would return to be a labor of love and an increasingly affordable hobby, especially for those of an electronic bent.  Some teenager will be inspired and inspire others. There has been a lot of music already made to be listened to.  Maybe fewer settlers.<p>But people will continue to pay for the live performance, but perhaps not the live spectacle.')
