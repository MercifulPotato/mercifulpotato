In the first page he describes the preconditions required to uproot the revolution and treats it like forming a startup. He summarizes 30 people is the ideal for the initial group to create revolution and describes about different personality types required among them. There is no big words like sacrifice, noble cause and stuff which you usually see used by the authoritarians, just pure information. He also goes on to say even without Castro the revolution would have happened.<p>By the way I like Che not communism.')
