It&#x27;s not a real market. Would we call a situation, wherein rice is $100&#x2F;bag because local oligarchs have taken the bulk of imports&#x2F;production and sequestered it in some private warehouse, a &quot;real market&quot;? Because that&#x27;s essentially what&#x27;s happening here.<p>&gt;How do homeless people maintain wealthy people?<p>If your labor produces wealth that someone else claims, forcing you to become unhoused, your homelessness is intrinsically connected to their affluence.')
