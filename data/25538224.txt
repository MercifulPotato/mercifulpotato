This was about two years ago -- I remember trying to install Jack, completely screwing up my audio configuration, and then spending days mucking around trying to get Pulse Audio working again at all. I never could get my sound card working, and had to nuke my Fedora installation and reinstall. It was a nightmare. (This was around three years ago, on Fedora 25).<p>While I don&#x27;t doubt that Linux can be great for audio, if the configuration befuddled someone with a CS degree so badly, I think most ordinary musicians don&#x27;t stand a chance.<p>N.B. Compare to something like Soundflower on Mac at that time, and it&#x27;s no contest -- almost foolproof to set up.')
