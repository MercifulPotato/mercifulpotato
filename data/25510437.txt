The  criteria is &quot;metabolism&quot;, not growth and reproduction.  Similarly, viruses are not alive although they can reproduce.  Interestingly, there are some highly parasitic organisms with limited ability to metabolize, that is, they have lost their genes and instead depend on their host organism (but I think all those examples still have some level of metabolic capability).')
