For all you know, they could be reading The Turner Diaries. While I would love to think that the teachers are socially progressive individuals who have found a better alternative, presumably those teachers would have switched to that better alternative regardless of whether TKAM was an option or not. Unfortunately I have my concerns about what the teachers who actively avoided the more appropriate option decided on.')
