So, for instance, if you have tests that assert whether the method tested calls another method with certain parameters in a certain order, then you&#x27;re enforcing coupling between the two methods.  If you refactor the code to have the first method return a result and then use that result to call the second method, then you also have to update the tests.  But they shouldn&#x27;t have to be updated since the overall logic hasn&#x27;t changed.  If, instead, you test the logic of each method individually, then you can refactor and not have to update the tests.')
