Each vertex could, for example, have 4 indices and 4 floats to indicate these values, and these only need to be uploaded to the gpu once.<p>The transformation matrices are interpolated for each rendered frame using the hierarchial animation data and the computed matrices are uploaded to the gpu in a buffer. The matrices are accessed in the vertex shader by indexing into the matrix buffer to calculate the vertex position.')
