How would the OP&#x27;s situation have improved if instead of sprocs he had a similarly complex webapp and had to deal with the schema changes there? I&#x27;m not challenging the OP; I don&#x27;t have enough experience with sprocs to have an informed opinion, but this information is necessary to make sense of the OP&#x27;s criticism.<p>The best argument against sprocs that I&#x27;ve heard is that you really don&#x27;t want any code running on your database hosts that you don&#x27;t absolutely need because it steals CPU cycles from those hosts and they don&#x27;t scale horizontally as well as stateless web servers. This is a completely different argument than the OP&#x27;s, however.')
