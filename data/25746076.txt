It&#x27;s starting to look like a &quot;damned if you do, damned if you don&#x27;t&quot; situation.<p>A friend of mine runs a social media brand that calls out men who post nasty comments on female strength athletes profiles, she simply screenshots them and posts them to the brand as well as making memes of the horrific things.<p>She&#x27;s shared screenshots of people wishing violent sexual assault against underage girls just beacuse they are a strength athlete, and instead of that person getting banned for advocating the rape of a minor, she gets a 3 day, week, 30 day ban from Facebook and&#x2F;or Instagram for simply screenshotting and reposting a public comment. You can see some of these awful things screenshotted, as well as her various bans, on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;you.look.like.a.man&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;you.look.like.a.man&#x2F;</a><p>Or they you remove a politician, or something like Info Wars for saying absolutely insane&#x2F;dangerous things and then all the fans &quot;overstepping! You&#x27;re overstepping!&quot; meanwhile everyone else is &quot;it&#x27;s about bloody time!&quot;<p>I would absolutely hate to be the leadership at any social media platform. Even things like nudity, I&#x27;ve seen several burlesque friends have posts removed and temporary bans issued for topless women with pasties covering their nipples on digital flyers advertising their next show, meanwhile I once saw a woman breastfeeding to a club song while sexually fondling her bare breast that wasn&#x27;t being used to breast feed with millions of views on Facebook and tens of thousands of comments that was months old...<p>Not only is there no consistency in how such things are applied, but when they do get applied people freak out for various reasons.<p>Like Sam Altman (&#x2F;u&#x2F;sama) said a few days ago:<p>&gt;There are exemptions to free speech defined by the Supreme Court, and we urgently need new ones for the age of social media.<p>&gt;What those exceptions are should be decided by the government, and fairly applied by companies.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;sama&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347980613559611392" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;sama&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347980613559611392</a>')
