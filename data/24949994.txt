I&#x27;d estimate we&#x27;d maybe be at the level now to handle complexity of software 30-40 years ago (i.e. 80s software), but that is not based on anything solid because in the world of software there is precious little solid to base anything of. The free lunch we have been enjoying might come to an end now that software is imbuing itself more and more to things that really matter, like human rights and safety. Electronic voting and self-driving cars come to mind as examples.<p>Of course another problem is that not only is software engineering still pretty immature, its use also is very unevenly distributed. While we might be able to build software somewhat reliably with state of the art tools and methods, vast majority does not use them. Not that we have much agreement on our field what constitutes unequivocally good practices. This has lead to the situation that even the basic foundational building blocks we use are usually of dubious quality.')
