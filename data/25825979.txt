A lot of data infrastructure is memory-bound, so saving the memory overhead of GC is a huge win.<p>The use of Arrow to support multiple programming languages is also a great concept. Other distributed computing engines have ended up tied to the JVM (Spark, Presto, Kafka) as a way of avoiding serialization&#x2F;deserialization costs when you go across a language boundary. Arrow is a really elegant solution, as long as you&#x27;re willing to batch up operations.')
