The theme for this room was camera obscura. One wall had these large windows that had metal doors to totally seal out the light but the door in the middle had a small hole to make the camera obscura. The next morning we had a pretty cool shot of the buildings nearby. I hadn&#x27;t ever actually seen a camera obscura before so I had no idea it looked as good as it does.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;Lt60R7v" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;Lt60R7v</a>')
