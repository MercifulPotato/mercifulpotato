Item(by='fipar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610479408, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25751688, text='&gt; Seems challenging to implement without losing significant performance to the abstraction layer.<p>Agreed, it seems the tradeoff would only make this worthwhile when you need to optimize for throughput, and a lot of the workload is ad hoc. A lot of distributed DBMS just serve point queries or range scans where I don&#x27;t think something like this would be useful.<p>Troubleshooting production issues here seems challenging too (though that&#x27;s always the case in distributed systems to this would be less of a problem).<p>Still interesting, but it would be more interesting to see the idea get some trial by fire.')
