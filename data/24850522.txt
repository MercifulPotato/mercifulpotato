Item(by='jfengel', descendants=None, kids=[24850664], score=None, time=1603304141, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24848555, text='He&#x27;s too late.<p>If the Church (and others) had taken that position 30 years ago, we might have ended up with a second class &quot;civil union&quot; situation. It would have been a compromise.<p>But same-sex marriage opponents didn&#x27;t compromise. They gambled and lost. They opposed civil unions, and so there was no reason for same-sex marriage advocates to aim for anything less than full equality.<p>That turned out to have broad appeal, as more gay people came out of the closet and appeared as non-threatening characters on TV, and their relationships became normalized. There was just no reason to reject them, aside from religious dogma, and that&#x27;s just not acceptable in a civil court.<p>So it&#x27;s great that the Pope again acknowledges that gay people are people and that their relationships have merit. (He has said so before in other ways.) But if he wants to reserve the word &quot;marriage&quot; to be a thing that he controls, that is a ship that sailed. He&#x27;s welcome to say that gay people aren&#x27;t &quot;married in the eyes of the Church&quot;, but countries have and will pay that zero mind.')
