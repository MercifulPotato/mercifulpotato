Typically, when speaking of upward mobility, some degree of stability is assumed to follow an upward income movement, but this study doesn’t preclude the possibility of someone going from, say, the 20th income percentile to the 80th for a year, then subsequently falling back to the 20th income percentile for the remainder of their life. That’s not a fault of the study, to be sure, but it does limit the scope of its application with regard to the topic of upward mobility.')
