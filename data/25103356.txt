It&#x27;s quite a lot smaller than a cat, though it may lack other evolutionary adaptations for falling. And a rat <i>is</i> a mouse, taxonomically: we just informally call the bigger species of mice rats.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.todayifoundout.com&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;2010&#x2F;11&#x2F;domestic-cats-can-fall-from-any-height-with-a-remarkable-survival-rate&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.todayifoundout.com&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;2010&#x2F;11&#x2F;domestic-cat...</a>')
