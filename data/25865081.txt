Should AWS drop facebook as a customer?<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone is suggesting that Facebook is free of guilt, but there is evidence that Facebook does at least try to keep their site clean, and for the most part they do. Its certainly possible that Facebook had (in absolute terms) more violence and planning than Parler, but as a percentage of the overall content, it&#x27;s much smaller.<p>This doesn&#x27;t excuse Facebook, they can do better, but it isn&#x27;t hypocritical to say &quot;the group with 10% violent content that tacitly encourages it isn&#x27;t okay, while the group with .1% violent content that actively innovates in trying to keep things clean is okay&quot;.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s only true if FB is actively innovating, and, well, that&#x27;s questionable (Yann Lecun has made some concerning statements about Facebook&#x27;s role, or lack thereof, in radicalization).')
