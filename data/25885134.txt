I’m sure if you look back at the Spanish Civil War and other divisive historical time periods you’ll find plenty of turncoats that flip from one extreme to another.<p>This seems like a bit of a myopic, low-dimensional view of the political landscape. Bernie and trump (esp candidate trump) weren&#x27;t &quot;opposite extremes&quot; when it came to plenty of issues: anti-free trade, anti-corporatist, promises to protect entitlements, complaining about the corruption of the existing political order, even just the populist vs technocrat aesthetic.<p>For people who prioritize this issue, the notion that Bernie and Trump are &quot;opposite extremes&quot; in every way relative to Hillary is laughable.<p>(President trump obviously reneged on much of his promises as a candidate and went with many mainstream gop policies, but that&#x27;s neither here not there when discussing support during the election)')
