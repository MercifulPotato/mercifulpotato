Alright...<p>If I said &quot;I am skeptical that infants smoking weed is harmful to them&quot;, does it mean that I smoke weed, or that I smoke weed around infants? Or that I actively support it? Or do I (perhaps wrongfully) state that I am skeptical about claims around the topic?<p>Personally I think pedophilia is just about the most awful thing in the universe. I wouldn&#x27;t engage in in depth speculation about how it affects children, because I think it&#x27;s a horrible thing to think about, but the fact that RMS engages in those conversations doesn&#x27;t make him a pedophile. And it definitely doesn&#x27;t make him an &quot;active supporter&quot; of it.')
