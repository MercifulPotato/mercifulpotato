It&#x27;s not an annualized rate. &quot;No impact&quot; in the study means that there is no detectable correlation, not that rent doesn&#x27;t increase nor decrease.<p>Beyond that, if it actually was a 1% total decrease (which it isn&#x27;t), you can bet your ass the author would have written that as 7.6% relative decrease cause by construction, instead of 0-2%.')
