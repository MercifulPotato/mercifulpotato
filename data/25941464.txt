The input of the public and other campaigning groups is swept away by this tsunami of money, and people are read their Zuck rights on arrest.<p>- $350m <i>isn&#x27;t enough</i> to move the needle. In some ways this is a more frightening outcome, that that amount of effort - five SpaceX launches or one medium-sized company market cap - can&#x27;t change a system that&#x27;s entrenched against it.<p>- countervailing lobbying is spending another $350m in the other direction, so the needle remains unmoved.<p>None of these are particularly great. It&#x27;s not really surprising that the average non-billionaire thinks that merely stating their case isn&#x27;t enough to achieve positive change and it requires burning things down.')
