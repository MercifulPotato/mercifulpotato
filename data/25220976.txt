You wanna limit the sex lives as well?<p>Basically, your morality is all wrong. The point of life (for humans, at least) isn&#x27;t to do what we <i>need</i> - that&#x27;s only the lowest, most basic level of Maslow&#x27;s pyramid. It&#x27;s self-actualization, which essentially means fulfilling autonomously chosen goals. <i>You</i> might see no reason to drive 200km&#x2F;h, but <i>others</i> might - why limit them? The only potential reason is safety, but hey, people enjoy plenty of extreme(-ly dangerous) sports, so clearly there are reasons to trade off safety as well.<p>In addition, an <i>appeal to safety</i> doesn&#x27;t actually make sense in this instance - why would 120km&#x2F;h be better than 200km&#x2F;h? I mean, it&#x27;s <i>slightly safer</i> but still incredibly unsafe! If we prioritized safety over all else, we&#x27;d all be driving at most 30km&#x2F;h! So clearly &quot;safety&quot; isn&#x27;t a good, objective reason - at best, it&#x27;s a subjective, arbitrary threshold, but then we ought to recognize that diifferent people will make different tradeoffs regarding safety.')
