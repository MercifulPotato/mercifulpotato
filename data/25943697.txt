Things that inspire people to work on passion projects - a sense of ownership, velocity (no need for meetings and jira et al when it&#x27;s just you. 100% efficient communication!), &quot;shipping&quot;&#x2F;accomplishment, pride and respect - are all going to be really vulnerable to having to share headspace and ownership with someone else.<p>I&#x27;m personally feeling this. I have a project I&#x27;m working on for my homelab that I think other homelabbers, and maybe even some SMBs, will be interested. And I want to give back to the community &#x2F; have no qualms about someone &quot;stealing&quot; my code. I have an AGPLv3 sticker on my laptop. But the main thing giving me pause is - &quot;but what if people are like &#x27;neat, now please do this feature next!&#x27;&quot;. Then I&#x27;m thinking about it and worrying about disappointing users. And plus, we know that &quot;please do this feature next&quot; is absolutely the *nicest* way that that request will ever be phrased on the internet.<p>I honestly would feel better if github had a way to let me say:<p>1. Here&#x27;s the code, but please don&#x27;t fork it (but leave the fork button functional. I don&#x27;t want to actually stop anyone. I just want them to know what I won&#x27;t be super thrilled.)<p>2. Please only open issues or PRs for small fixes. An extra if-statement, etc. Please don&#x27;t add features or redesign anything or &quot;fix my code&quot; at a cosmetic or architecture level.<p>I know this sounds kinda whiny and entitled and anti-free-software, but I do think it&#x27;s real and respectful from a human perspective. Locke said that anything you put effort into, you feel ownership of. And by that logic, if someone puts effort into something you currently own &quot;100%&quot; of, they&#x27;re going to feel some sort of ownership too and you&#x27;ll feel some part of loss of ownership.')
