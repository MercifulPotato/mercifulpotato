The alternative is an experience-based approach (the more fluid approach you&#x27;re describing). The problem with experience-based approaches are that they&#x27;re hard to evaluate since it&#x27;s impossible to standardize, and they may open the provider up to risk of litigation. As a result, an evidence-based mindset may result in the algorithmic behavior you describe. We don&#x27;t have a good codified way to standardize the practitioner&#x27;s balance between evidence-based and experience-based, so it&#x27;s a bit up in the air right now. Medicine is really, really hard to do well.<p>Love to hear from anyone with a different take.')
