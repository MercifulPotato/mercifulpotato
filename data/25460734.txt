This has it&#x27;s benefits because it encourages explaining the rationale behind a given design, but it also means that you can end up with rotten old information looking just as recent as the new stuff. Man pages often don&#x27;t actually cover a complete listing of everything an API has, too.<p>eBPF is a good microcosm of this, where using it isn&#x27;t all that complicated but actually working out what to do can take ages because most resources use a middle-man to talk to the kernel.')
