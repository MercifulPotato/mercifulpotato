(I can imagine they might hazily think &quot;even&quot; requires being twice a positive integer). This isn&#x27;t the case with the Earth&#x2F;Sun question.<p>Analogous questions at slightly more sophisticated levels:<p>&quot;Is zero a natural number?&quot;\n&quot;Is 1 a prime?&quot;\n&quot;Does an algebraic ring contain the multiplicative identity?&quot;<p>(At least two of those rely on definitions that have been ambiguous at some point.)')
