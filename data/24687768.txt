I work partly in partnership with the NHS within my university, and get to see it being applied, completely inappropriately, with no ability to comment.<p>For me, I always feel like I&#x27;m living in some sort of parallel universe. Imagine living in a world where _you_, and a select group of others, know that there are better methods to drive a screw into a wall than punching it with your fist. However, 99% of people in the world punch screws into walls by hand, because they know how to use the only tool they have to hand (i.e. their hand). Their friends and neighbours do too. Their colleagues show them neat little tricks about how to fold your hand better to get the screw in with less pain, or more efficiently. The &quot;proper&quot; option -- drilling a pilot hole, using a self-tapping screw, understanding the difference between nails, bolts and screws, etc, or the concept of wall-plugs, is &quot;too technical&quot;, &quot;too complex&quot;, or requires &quot;a large amount of infrastructure to fix a simple problem&quot; [buying a drill &amp; screwdriver, etc]. Sometimes people buy new walls with screws pre-installed because the thought of driving in those screws seems like an overwhelming technical burden.<p>You, and a group of similarly-minded nerds, understand just how stupid this is at times. You personally then spend the rest of your life watching people occasionally have horrific hand injuries from punching screws into walls and refusing the offer of screwdrivers. Others profit from selling vertical hard surfaces with a whole array of convenient screws pre-installed; or get employed teaching others the _very_ basics of screw-driving, or sell products containing all sorts of klunky hacks to cope with the fact that screws manually installed are at odd angles and tend to fall over randomly. The supplier of a popular brand of screwdrivers happens to be the world&#x27;s largest screw manufacturer, but never seems to promote screwdrivers to people who currently punch them in with their fists. Instead, they sell them a subscription to screws, with the option for a very expensive pre-screwed wall-delivery service, built to your specification (that they call Dynamics for some reasonâ€¦).<p>You, and a subset of your nerdy and educated friends recognise just how batshit insane the widespread use of punching-as-a-method-to-install-screws is, and occasionally laugh about it, mostly to distract yourself from the grim reality of buildings badly held together by punched-in-screws. Every so often a skyscraper-sized building collapses, [1] and it&#x27;s realised in retrospect that the manually-driven-in-screws were not the right tool for the job. Still, people carry on banging in screws with their fists, and you increasingly realise that you have to -- somehow -- accept that in order to sleep at night without going insane.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;excel-partly-to-blame-for-trading-loss-2013-2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;excel-partly-to-blame-for-tr...</a>')
