At first, I wondered if it was a good choice because RedHat and SuSE were the &quot;professional&quot; distos. Debian was different and when Ubuntu came out, it was like Debian, but with some useful closed-source stuff. There&#x27;s been drama, but it&#x27;s not nearly so bad as some of the evolution that MacOS and Windows users have had to deal with. The security improvements on MacOS have really made doing simple things like a Zoom conference painful while Windows userspace is devolving to something that reminds me of Linux in 2005 or so where every window had it&#x27;s own UI style and the userspace was a mess of competing ideas and ecosystems.<p>Meanwhile over on Debian&#x2F;Ubuntu&#x2F;PopOS&#x2F;Plasma, I can finally run the latest games (thank you Steam &amp; Proton!), edit video with pro grade tools (thank you DaVinci) and I still have a great coding environment... Oh, and thanks to cloud based office software, that&#x27;s no longer an issue.')
