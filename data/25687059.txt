Your misinterpretation starts at the very first sentence. I said &quot;people with guns are less likely to be brutalized by the gov or literally anyone.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the &#x27;no&#x27; refers to?<p>Your original post said &quot;the gov or literally anyone&quot;.  Your second post only talked about the gov part, so I reminded you about the &quot;literally anyone&quot; part.  Where&#x27;s the misinterpretation?<p>&gt; trying to fighting against anyone isn&#x27;t self defense. no where did I say anything the like you just made that up.<p>Let me rephrase.  Self defense against the government with a gun is a terrible idea.<p>&gt; You are seem unable to completely read and understand my post. You cant just pick one part and ignore the rest. I clear said that if you cant defend yourself its not the same as if you voluntary dont want to.<p>You did say that.  You also equated choosing not to carry a gun with choosing not to defend yourself, with the phrases &quot;Who would have thought that people with guns are less likely to be brutalized by the gov or literally anyone.&quot; and &quot;their own actions or inactions makes them the victim&quot;<p>Are you telling me you didn&#x27;t mean to equate those?  If so then your original post was written misleadingly, and I don&#x27;t even know who you&#x27;re even accusing of victim mentality anymore.<p>If you <i>did</i> mean to equate those, then I still think your opinion is hot garbage.')
