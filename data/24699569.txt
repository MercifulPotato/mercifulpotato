Item(by='Balgair', descendants=None, kids=[24700125], score=None, time=1602001738, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24698720, text='I think the change is coming because Zuck couldn&#x27;t make his end of the bargain with Congress.<p>It&#x27;s a boilerplate deal. We&#x27;ve seen it with railroads, telecoms, sugar, cigarettes, etc. The industry gets a little too rowdy for the good of the country and other businesses. Congress gets them to testify for a few hours and makes sure that they tell a lie <i>somewhere</i> in that timeframe. Now, Congress has leverage on the industry. In return, the industry gets to write the laws surrounding themselves. They become, effectively, a poly&#x2F;monopoly. Sure, the big gains are gone, but so are the losses. Your industry, yourself, and all your relatives and descendants will never be poor again. You make a tidy 3% profit for eternity.<p>Congress gave Zuck that deal. Clean up social media; this Russia&#x2F;flat-earth&#x2F;vaccine stuff has got to stop. But Zuck can&#x27;t do it. The ML&#x2F;AI approach gets you to 99.9%. But to actually clean up the mess and get all the plebs to take their vitamins again takes 99.999% (or something like this). You need real people monitoring the site, like China&#x27;s 50-cent army. But those people cost <i>way</i> too much to make FB profitable. It&#x27;s the same for all the social media sites. They don&#x27;t have a business if it&#x27;s a clean one.<p>It took a while (hey, it&#x27;s Congress), but the folks on Capital Hill finally got the message that Zuck can&#x27;t do it. But, look, it just has to be clean. The mess is affecting other businesses now. Those 5G towers are expensive and took a lot of investment, we can&#x27;t have people just hacksawing them. So we&#x27;re going to see the congresscritters start to find ways to get the job done. One way, per this article, is to split them up. Take all the Facial-Feature-books (NoseBooks? EarBooks? EyeBooks?) and clean them up or let them fail outright. I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll see negotiations with Zuck in the near future.<p>But the end objective, powered by the hulking slow weight of congressional subpoenas, is the same: no more messes.')
