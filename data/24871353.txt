It&#x27;s way rougher around the edges than Pythonista is, but it&#x27;s moving fast and adding nice support for new iOS features. For one example, from what I can tell x-callback-url is the only way to get stuff into Pythonista (and I haven&#x27;t found a way to get stuff back out of it), but Pyto natively supports Shortcuts actions. There are lots of other things like that.<p>Pythonista is much more pleasant today for actually writing code in, though.')
