I love the Hackintosh community. Hackintosh forums are a gold mine of solutions to all types of ACPI DSDT problems. Many great tutorials, really helpful to Linux users. If the Hackintosh community doesn&#x27;t exist, it wouldn&#x27;t be possible. Not only DSDT, their EFI resources are also great, probably the biggest PC userbase of EFI bootloaders - earlier in this year I used a Hackintosh EFI device driver from Clover (free and open source) to help me booting from NVMe without BIOS support. In my previous life I also solved a non-standard graphics problem by backporting Hackintosh solution to Linux. Looking back, trying Hackintosh turned out to be a great decision, despite I only used it for a few months before quitting (I decided that voluntarily lock myself in a walled garden, then spent a lot of time installing a free software working environment back is unwise), otherwise I could not know its community and innovations.<p>&gt; <i>Using `acpiexec` was very helpful to simulate invoking sleep&#x2F;suspend and being able to follow the execution path of where it would get stuck. Also want to add that random wakeups can be triggered by interrupts hitting devices in `&#x2F;proc&#x2F;acpi&#x2F;wakeup`. These wakeup sources can be selectively disabled once the problematic ones are identified. I disable XHC (USB ports)</i><p>Thanks for the tip. I hope I&#x27;ll never have to use it, but it could definitely help if I had to use yet another broken laptop for some reasons.')
