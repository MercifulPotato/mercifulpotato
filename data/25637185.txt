For now... Let&#x27;s remember that episode of the Twilight Zone when the gold thief goes into the future only to find out gold is manufactured and worthless.<p>Gold lasts forever, it doesn&#x27;t tarnish, rust, or corrode, that much is true. But it still could be stolen, or potentially damaged (like a big house fire). I suppose bitcoin could be stolen or lost as well though, but as it&#x27;s not actually physical it should be easier to protect.<p>Gold is beautiful so that&#x27;s an excellent point as well. It can be turned into jewelry and such.<p>Bitcoin isn&#x27;t really the opposite though in every regard. It may not be physical but it&#x27;s very difficult to &quot;mine&quot; and it gets harder every year. Plus there will come a day when it can no longer be mined at all, making it even more rare than gold, and impossible to produce more of.')
