It&#x27;s a bliss to experience the best of both worlds at the same time and staying connected to my cultural roots while doing the same work I used to do when I was in the US. I have always been a bit of a loner so not so much of a change in social life. When I see my fellow farmers tending to their fields and the kind of work satisfaction they have, I feel I lack that sort of dedication to my job, it might be the case of large disconnect between what I work on (blockchain tech) and where I live (farming village)')
