Pretty ironic that users are implicitly coerced into voiding their liability protection at their existing bank during the course of opening an account at a new one. Who wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to turn around and also invalidate your liability protections themselves if you \nused your new bank&#x27;s credentials with Plaid elsewhere.')
