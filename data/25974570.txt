I pretty much swapped out alcohol for marijuana. Alcohol felt really bad for me physical, emotionally, and mentally. And marijuana doesn’t.<p>I found a lot of other benefits:<p>- unwind and integrate my brain. As an engineer my brain is constantly is “solve” mode, always thinking about problems at work or side projects. Marijuana stops that, my thoughts and brain feels much more integrated.<p>- easier to focus and be present with my kids. I wish that I could just sit and enjoy long periods of time with my kids, but my head is always uneasy, checking work, phone, thinking about problems. Marijuana dials that back and lets me be present and focused<p>- emotional introspection. I had some pretty shitty things happen to me in childhood. I’ve never really reflected on them. I’ve started to repeat some of the abusive behaviors that I experienced growing up. Marijuana has helped me to really introspect my emotions and be open to integrating that trauma<p>- helps relieve low level anxiety and depression, it’s uplifting. I eat low dosage edibles most nights and positive mood effects linger through the next day<p>- it’s just fun :$ it feels good and is recreational. Music sounds different, food tastes more intense<p>I never would have guessed It would be so positive for me. I smoked for a couple months In my late teens until it started making me paranoid. I never would have guessed It would provide me so much benefit. I certainly would never ever have guessed I would become a daily user in my later 30s AND it would significantly improve my quality of life')
