The rumor is that SIE reduced selling units for Japan and increased for US&#x2F;EU. It seems reasonable because anyway Japanese non-core gamers won&#x27;t buy Xbox Series S&#x2F;X.<p>Actually, PS4 launch in Japan was delayed 3 month from US&#x2F;EU so the PS5 situation is a bit improved, but still complained.<p>Another complain for PS5 (and SIE US) is that they changed ○&#x2F;×&#x2F;△&#x2F;□ button meaning. Previously ○ was assigned to OK and × was Cancel that&#x27;s opposite to foreign edition. Now on PS5, its assignment is same as foreign edition but it feels very strange use of symbol for almost all Japanese people. It should be PSX&#x27;s initial design failure.')
