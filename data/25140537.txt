We expect our Fellows to be ready for real work, and the Fellows experience is the measure of whether they are or not.<p>- We went with &quot;Fellows&quot; instead of &quot;intern&quot; because the program is designed very differently than an internship and we found ourselves often saying to companies &quot;it&#x27;s like an internship, except for X, Y, and Z.&quot; Was helpful to just change the title. But I hear ya on the &quot;Fellow&quot; sounding potentially more senior.<p>I&#x27;ll pass along your feedback to our marketing team, re: naming.')
