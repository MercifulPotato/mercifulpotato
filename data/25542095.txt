If you earn £1500 but your expenses are £500 effectively you earn £1000 month or more than those that are paid more.<p>So, solution is to earn more or learn how to live more frugal? Of course it is not possible to reduce some expenses, and some expenses are in % (as taxes) so more you earn you will pay more.<p>At one point you could get to the point you do not think how much are your expenses, but for most of the people until that time you will realized that you sold so much time that your life has passed in front of your eyes.<p>Anyhow, it is good advice to find something you love and do it, as often 300 hours of unpaid hobby can give more joy and satisfaction than, all the money in of the best paid job in the world you could earn during that same time.')
