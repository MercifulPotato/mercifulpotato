Linux devs want it. This is how most Android drivers were opened, for example. If some automaker chooses Android, any kernel-level improvements will eventually flow back to the mainline.<p>Unfortunately, improvements above the kernel stack will keep closed, since the Android userland don&#x27;t adopt GPL as much.<p>edit: for example, OpenWRT was created through a GPL enforcement lawsuit! Router companies weren&#x27;t complying with GPL and were closing their kernel (which had in-house drivers). The companies were sued and had to open their code. You would think that their customers weren&#x27;t interested in this, but actually.. many use openwrt to this day (arguably, there&#x27;s even an environmental angle to this - openwrt increases the longevity of the router by having it do more stuff with the same hardware, reducing e-waste)')
