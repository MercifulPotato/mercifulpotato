They aren&#x27;t felt as you&#x27;re literally typing the characters; they can&#x27;t be listed as concrete numbers in a budget. If an engineer is using a CAD tool and they add a part, they can see the space that&#x27;s no longer available for other parts. Or they can see that the product would have to be made physically larger to accommodate it. There is concrete feedback to contend with <i>during</i> the development process, not just a vague notion of future reliability.')
