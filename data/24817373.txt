(As a bonus, using Docker this way let&#x27;s you avoid &#x27;polluting&#x27; the host OS with various packages).<p>Sure, this case where it&#x27;s just coreutils + csvlookup, the benefit for the added abstractions isn&#x27;t so great. Using docker like this makes more sense if there are more dependencies. (Maybe it&#x27;s just easier to say &quot;use docker&quot; than to explain how to install a dependency on different OSs?).<p>In general, I think it&#x27;s fine for people to be able to solve problems without having a full understanding of the mechanisms involved in getting the tool to work. If they need to know it later, they&#x27;ll learn it then. This is a top-down approach -- But, naturally, there&#x27;ll be some awkward solutions on the way.')
