As young nerd, without a connection to The Internet, at a time where one would have you spend literally days online to download the amount of data a CD holds, these magazines were absolutely fantastic!<p>Every month, when they came out, I was off to the store to get my two or three magazines, for about half the price of a computer game, I&#x27;d get three CDs full of weird, strange, wonderful stuff to peruse. In a way, those CDs were even more like the Internet that was slowly developing, than the Internet today.<p>Not only were the articles in the magazines interesting and inspirational to young me, but there was simply no other way I could get access to all that wonderful random stuff that were on the CDs.')
