I even took the time to `brew install` it and was thinking about it again recently when I saw it update. The same is true with numpy or R - my work just doesn&#x27;t involve high performance numerical computing. And even if it did, it would always be secondary to some other purpose. Outside of a REPL, if I were to productionize some heavy computational work, even numerically based, I would probably still lean towards containerizing a C++ (or maybe Rust) binary.<p>It&#x27;s one of those &quot;right tool for the job&quot; type quandaries. For many popular languages (Javascript, Python, Go, C&#x2F;C++, Rust, Java, OCaml) I have an intuition on when I would reach for them based on my experience. With Julia - I am not sure the shape or character of the problem where I would reach for it.')
