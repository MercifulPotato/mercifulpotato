Then recorded media were invented and there was a fleeting moment in the 20th century when distribution was controlled, and the value of that invention was captured by a small group. And now it seems things have equilibrated so that the value of recording is distributed more broadly again. I don&#x27;t know if there are other examples like this in different parts of the economy (obviously it&#x27;s the same in video), but it feels like a good study in how technology disrupts an industry and then disrupts is again.')
