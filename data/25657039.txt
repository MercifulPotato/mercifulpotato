Additional Nano will never be minted.<p>Nano uses something called ORV (open representative voting). If you hold Nano, you can delegate the voting weight of your Nanos to any representative you want at any time. Representatives that get a certain amount of voting weight delegated to them become Principal Reps. If bad actors have 51% of voting weight delegated to them, they could block transactions from happening. But if this happened, Nano holders would just delegate their voting weight to different reps. If the bad actors actually owned 51% of the Nano supply, then they could block transactions indefinitely, but this would crash the value of the coin and since they would be holding 51% of the Nano supply they would lose money by doing this.')
