To be higher rated than maybe 1600 or so you&#x27;ve played more games which also gives more statistical evidence for the cheat detector so less likely you&#x27;re consistently cheating without getting caught.<p>That said, there&#x27;s probably some amount of higher rated cheating that is just smarter than playing every engine move and harder to detect (though chess.com says they have banned a bunch of GMs for cheating)')
