Burning gas on-site for heat is far more efficient than burning something far away, turning it into electricity at max 60% efficiency (usually more like 30-40%), transmitting it through the grid, and then putting it through a resistance heater.<p>If all or even most of that electricity were renewable or nuclear you&#x27;d have an advantage in terms of CO2 there, but it&#x27;s not. Renewable can peak out at &gt;50% of power during the day, but it&#x27;s also important to note that heat and cooking needs usually peak at night. It&#x27;s out of phase with renewable supply.<p>Politicians can set the <i>what</i>, but never ever let them specify how. They are not qualified. Set a CO2 target and let actual engineers figure it out.')
