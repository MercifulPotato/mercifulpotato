Item(by='ericmay', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608163362, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25449083, text='&gt; Just trying to encourage reasoning about viewpoints different to your own.<p>Great. Thanks. Always a good thing for people to do and we need more of that. I wouldn’t say it’s warranted here, however, because I can see viewpoints and also think they are “out of control”. (Just a term of convenience so please don’t read too much into that specific way of phrasing things).<p>For example, I can see good intentions or the viewpoint behind letting people defecate and do heroin in the streets, and also come to view that letting people do so is still a crazy idea. (And I do, in fact I think it’s absolutely out of control).<p>Similarly, I can understand a small town in Alabama wanting to teach the Bible in their public schools because it’s their schools and they pay for them, but also find that utterly incompatible with my views.<p>Good ole’ Midwest. Right smack in the middle ;)')
