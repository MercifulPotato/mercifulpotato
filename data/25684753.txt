I use them a lot even now, writing this comment.<p>Many of those keys require you to move your hands far from the home row (in ways that make it slower for me to type them).  I find that the vim equivalents are easier to touch type.  Plus many of the gains are not just in the motion, but in editing commands (as well as combinations of the two).<p>To each his own.')
