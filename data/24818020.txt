Do you avoid developers that introduce bugs? We don&#x27;t even keep track of that!<p>You can have the license taken away as a surgeon, I&#x27;ve never heard of anyone becoming unemployable as a developer.<p>You are not gonna get an equivalent outcome even if tomorrow all developers show up to work with an attitude of a heart surgeon.<p>However if suddenly all data loss and data breaches would result in massive compensation, and if slow and buggy software resulted in real lawsuits, you would see the results very quickly.<p>Basically same issues as in trading securities: no accountability for either developers or the decision makers.')
