For a pickup that means bed height and with a load that means a lower center of gravity (and easier loading&#x2F;unloading by hand). For an electric vehicle, there&#x27;s not a lot of reason to provide a drive shaft from front to back, so the depth of the frame has even less rationale. The same is true if the vehicle is front wheel drive as is the case for Ram Promaster (Fiat Ducato) cargo vans.<p>And the Ram Promaster is a real truck available as 1&#x2F;2, 3&#x2F;4, and one ton ratings. All are rated at 5000lbs towing capacity and 11,000lbs GVW. Even available as chassis only.<p>There&#x27;s folk wisdom and then there&#x27;s automotive engineering.')
