When you say &quot;asset X has never traded down over a 5 year period&quot;, it means if you look at <i>any</i> day, and then look at the price 5 years later, the price 5 years later will be higher. For a 12 year old asset class, just taking daily prices that means you have over 2500 pairs of prices (1 day compared to a day 5 years later) to look at, and in this case, in all of those 2500 pairs the later price was higher.')
