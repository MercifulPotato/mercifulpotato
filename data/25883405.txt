Item(by='0xbadcafebee', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611418939, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25880289, text='#1 had a practical solution back in 1896: replaceable batteries.<p>At the dawn of the 20th century, the electric car was the most popular type of car after steam-powered. Their range was limited of course, but they had many features that were improvements over Gasoline-powered cars. So, how was it that many cities around the world used electric cars and trucks more than any other type? Two ways: 1) fleets where you could drop off one car and pick up another, and 2) an easily-replaceable battery. Just drive to a service station and replace the battery and get back on your way. At least one company providing these services operated for 14 years.<p>Funny how tech people always look for a tech solution, and business people look for a business solution.')
