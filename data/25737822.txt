Whatever you can do with one form, you can do the same thing <i>plus more</i> in a game.  There is much greater artistic potential in this kind of software than anywhere else that doesn&#x27;t require physical presence (and even that can be simulated).  It also requires massive engineering skill, itself an art.<p>That being said, the medium has a very long way to go yet and there are still many areas it has yet to explore.  I&#x27;m very glad there&#x27;s a thriving indie scene where developers are continually experimenting with fresh, crazy new ideas.')
