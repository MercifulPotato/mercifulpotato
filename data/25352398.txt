Is there any field where that&#x27;s not the case? 20% of lawyers make 80% of the money. 20% of doctors make 80% of the money. etc etc.<p>The difference I think is if 80% of professional musicians can&#x27;t make a living &amp; it&#x27;s not clear that&#x27;s actually the case (i.e. streaming isn&#x27;t the only source of revenue). Similarly, music may have a higher &quot;stickiness&quot; for tenacity where people see it as a higher calling for them even if they&#x27;re not making money (vs someone not cutting it as a lawyer&#x2F;doctor to even pay the bills is going to quit &amp; find something else if they weren&#x27;t even weeded out during school).')
