Beware of Lock-In&#x27; section as &quot;be generalist&quot;.<p>It looks to me as generic career advice to not stay fixated to single all-in-one tech choice and role - SAP dev, Ruby dev etc. Ruby is just an example here (&#x27;even&#x27;, &#x27;frameworks too&#x27;), I guess the author witnessed the &quot;rockstars&quot; and evangelists hype wave of RoR circa 2005-2010. Possibly it could be e.g. ReactJS or Kubernetes today too.')
