The laser light just needs to carry away entropy, which can be achieved by modulating the beam so that it contains information. Of course, you&#x27;ll deplete your batteries to power the beam, and the laser itself will have inefficiencies. So with current technology, the system would likely generate more heat than it removed. A civilization with really good engineering could probably make it work, though even in that case, it would still use many joules of free (i.e. usable) energy to remove 1 joule of thermal (waste) energy.<p>A much more efficient method of heat removal would just be to have radiating fins. So you&#x27;re still converting heat into photons, but you lose much less energy in the process, because the photons you&#x27;re radiating have a higher entropy.')
