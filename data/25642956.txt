No one leaves their house except to go to the grocery store and pharmacy. No one leaves more than 2 miles away from their residence. It should be enforced by the military. Essentially martial law. It’s not something I suggest lightly. But 6-8 weeks of complete lockdown and pay people to stay home. It’s the only way that California is going to survive this.<p>Yes, I know that the death rate is low, ~0.2%. But when hospitals are full like this we need to have a circuit breaker and the only thing we have is a full, military-enforced lockdown. We should also stop all traffic on the highways. Set up tanks on the I-5 and 101 and turn people back. We have to stop this uncontrolled catastrophe.')
