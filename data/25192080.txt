They want others to fill that hole, to provide the answer or esteem that they have trouble providing to themselves; they put enormous power in others&#x27; opinions. The solution is not to talk about what others think but to find help them find those things within themselves - how do <i>they</i> feel about their choice, their action, their physical being.<p>This study (which I understand might represent only one aspect of your strategy with patients) focuses only on what others think as an answer to the patients&#x27; uncertainty. It <i>seems</i> to assume that the worth of the patients&#x27; own bodies depends on pleasing others, that the value of this body part is as objects of pleasure for others. And of course we know well that our society sends that message to women, about this body party in particular, very often.<p>And to avoid any misunderstanding, I&#x27;m not setting up some argumentative binary concept that people don&#x27;t care at all how they look. To varying degrees, everyone cares. But I worry far more about the self-esteem and emotional health of the patients than I do about how their breasts look (Edit: And I assume you do too and are acting in good faith). For their breasts, the only person to please is themselves.')
