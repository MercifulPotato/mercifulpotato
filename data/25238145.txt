A coin is chosen because it&#x27;s been a standard weight and measure-backed object for centuries. It is about the observer&#x27;s knowledge, which includes assumptions from every day experience.<p>You have to base a prior on assumptions. If you assume nothing and flip it 1000x, and calculate the probability, than you base that on assumptions of your own flipping ability, and hand wave it away with count divided by  trials.')
