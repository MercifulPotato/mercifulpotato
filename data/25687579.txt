Short of those actions it might have passed for a riot, and been trespass, but when it came to attempting to burn the elector&#x27;s votes and harass the members of Congress, it became a violent attempt to overthrow the government.  Had not the President said &quot;take back our government&quot; to the very people who invaded, the case would be much less than it is.')
