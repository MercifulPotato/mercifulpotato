The slang for a non-native was almost impenetrable.<p>And yet Dominic West&#x2F;Jimmy McNulty and Idris Elba&#x2F;Stringer Bell are English and Aidan Gillen&#x2F;Tommy Carcetti is Irish.<p>Idris Elba does an excellent job, but it’s a little easier for him since he’s given the most slang and dialect to use. Dominic West sounds American at least, but to people who know it, he doesn’t really capture the ‘Bawlmer’ accent.  With respect to accent, Aidan Gillen is not great.  It’s not quite “Littlefinger on the Chesapeake Bay”, but he never sounds comfortable in the accent. That it&#x27;s easily overlooked is a credit to the overall greatness of the show.')
