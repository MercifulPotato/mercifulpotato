Even <i>this week</i> I&#x27;m hearing and reading and talking to people who are telling me they&#x27;ll refuse a vaccine.  Yet... also complaining about a coming &quot;2 tier&quot; system where people who aren&#x27;t vaccinated will be locked out of some parts of society... but then also refusing a vaccine because... (no direct clear answer beyond &quot;rights&quot;).<p>So... we have the vaccine to hope for, but if not enough people get it, I&#x27;d think new strains might continue to develop and infect more folks.  :&#x2F;')
