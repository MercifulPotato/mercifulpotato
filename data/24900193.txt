It&#x27;s entirely possible that wouldn&#x27;t actually be a bad outcome for everyone involved:<p>- Source company which is financially strained gets some income in addition to reduced salary expenses.<p>- Destination company saves on paying other recruiting costs and acquires a pre-assembled team. They&#x27;re essentially buying a working unit instead of having to build their own.<p>- Employees avoid the uncertainty of being dropped in the middle of the process (or summarily laid off), assuming the right protections were in place in the agreement.')
