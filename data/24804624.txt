This is the shortest timespan that has been successfully measured to date.&quot;<p>Incredible.<p>Where the mind truly starts to boggle is remembering that a zeptosecond still falls incredibly short of the Planck time&#x2F;distance at 5×10−44.<p>It&#x27;s certainly exciting to speculate how much closer to an actual Planck &#x2F;measurement&#x2F; we may yet achieve.')
