Item(by='vkou', descendants=None, kids=[25084708, 25084501, 25085674], score=None, time=1605287384, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25084169, text='How quickly people who don&#x27;t live in Seattle shout nonsense about the CHAZ.<p>Let&#x27;s break down what actually happened.<p>1. After weeks of protests, police intimidation, beatings, and frequent gassing of the entire street (much to the delight of people living there, who were unable to breathe inside their own apartments), including a right wing chap driving a car through a crowd, and shooting someone trying to pull him out of his vehicle, the police leave the east precinct, based on an FBI claim that it will be burnt down.<p>2. The protest moves into the blocks around it, and starts protecting the precinct.<p>3. The precinct does not burn down.<p>4. The protest moves elsewhere, and a block party starts.<p>5. An idiot called Raz, and his boys start providing &#x27;security&#x27;. Nobody asked them for it. People who ran the protest didn&#x27;t ask for it. People living in the area didn&#x27;t ask for it. Smells like a gang moving into a power vaccumm to me.<p>6. Homeless folks move into the park area of CHAZ. The area gets a bit rough at night, but is still a block party during the day.<p>7. Someone in the homeless encampment gets killed in the early hours of the morning, presumably over drugs, but who knows.<p>8. A teenager steals a car and takes it on a joyride through the pedestrian areas of the CHAZ. (Remember all the car attacks against protest areas over the past few weeks in both Seattle, and the rest of the country? Not a smart move.)<p>9. Some unknown person kills him and injures his friend.<p>10. The police move back in to an unburnt district. They then set up a multi-block checkpoint, that demanded all entrants into the former CHAZ to show their ID to be allowed entrance. (When we were under the thrall of Warlord Raz, only drivers had to show ID at his checkpoint.)')
