Academic writing prioritizes <i>explanation</i>. Business writing prioritizes <i>decision-making</i>. They serve different purposes. If we were to hypothetically rewrite an academic paper using the pyramid principle, it might look like this:<p>- Combined Abtract + Conclusion (1-3 points)<p>- Results (1-3 points)<p>- Discussion (1-3 points)<p>- Everything else in the appendix.')
