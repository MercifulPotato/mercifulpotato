Depending on the seniority and visibility of your position this may extend towards so-called &quot;ethics clauses&quot; where you will be in breach of your contract if you disparage the company or otherwise associate the company they don&#x27;t want to be associated with.<p>Just look at Amy Cooper [1].<p>But it goes further than that. It&#x27;s generally a good idea not to do anything that might lead to a heading like:<p>&quot;Employee of X says [bad thing about X]&quot;<p>When I worked at Google, I made it a point never to comment publicly on any issue or thread where I could possibly be quoted. That&#x27;s just commonsense and (IMHO) completely reasonable for your employer. I&#x27;d suggest that if anyone chafes against such restrictions that they should probably seek other employment.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;26&#x2F;woman-fired-by-franklin-templeton-after-backlash-from-racist-park-confrontation.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;26&#x2F;woman-fired-by-franklin-temp...</a>')
