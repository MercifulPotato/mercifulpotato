Where trade-unions are a thing, for example, they often reduce working times &quot;in solidarity&quot; to avoid layoffs, it&#x27;s been the case for decades. Or they do week-on-week-off etc etc. I don&#x27;t expect those areas to significantly reduce their hours across the board, at least not until it&#x27;s normalized in white-collar sectors first.<p><i>&gt; The incentives just don’t align.</i><p>I am as suspicious of the owning classes as the next guy, but it&#x27;s not unusual to see the most enlightened industrialists trying to find a better balance for all parties in the equation. See for example XIX-century mill-owners building entire towns out of their own pockets, including schools and community centres, because it benefited them in the long run as much as the workers in the immediate.<p>I am not particularly suspicious of intentions here, but rather skeptical that it can work piecemeal. France tried something like that in the &#x27;90s but got weak-kneed when it came to enforcement, which means it didn&#x27;t work in practice and got watered down into irrelevance very quickly (I don&#x27;t know if it was eventually scrapped entirely).')
