I was pitched on Urbit by Curtis himself on April 20, 2012, long before it launched, and before it was even called Urbit.  He tried to sell me a block of Urbit address space at the time.  I don&#x27;t remember the asking price, but it was substantial, many thousands of dollars.  I declined.<p>Yes, the crowdsales priced individual addresses at less than one cent, but it&#x27;s a 64-bit address space, so even at one cent that puts the gross valuation of Urbit at many orders magnitude greater than the gross planetary product since the dawn of human history.  I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s overvalued.  Also, the addresses are not sold individually but in large blocks, with part of the pitch being that people who get in early can turn around and sell parts of their holdings to greater fools.  If memory serves, the first crowdsale raised $500k.  So even at 1 cent per, someone ended up writing some pretty big checks.')
