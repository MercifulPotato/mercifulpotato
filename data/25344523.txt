Eventually we learn what the issue is and make sure it doesn&#x27;t happen again. But if you look at all the tests we have in place, you have to remember that a significant number of them came from discovering stuff in the field rather than before the launch.<p>This applies to everything from building bridges (University of Miami), through software products (Mars Climate Orbiter) to designing new medicines (thalidomide &#x2F; paroxetine).<p>Arrogance that something is 100% safe is only ignorance. The point is we&#x27;d like to understand what the known risks are and the mechanisms are. Some of us would like to see a few hundred-thousand cars go over that new wobbly cantilever bridge design.<p>This is different from complete ignorance and denial which is a separate issue.')
