Trump is a symptom of the dissatisfaction with the status quo not the source.  Just go back and look at the reporting about how his message resonated and lead to his election.<p>Your comment is a great example of how to make things worse.  You are asserting that &quot;half the country&quot; are mindless Trump cultists. This is just another version of Hillary Clinton&#x27;s &quot;basket of deplorables&quot; attitude.<p>Resolving the divisions in the American electorate needs to be a tad bit more sophisticated than asserting that 70 million people have lost their minds and aren&#x27;t worth listening to. In fact if that is the type of approach taken by the Biden administration I think things will get much, much worse.')
