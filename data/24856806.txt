The bad things don&#x27;t cancel out the good, but the good things don&#x27;t make up for the bad.<p>The times I find myself talking about it are when things seem especially bleak, and a given positive spin just turns out to be that last straw of annoyance. Pointing it out just seems to bring back some sense of reality, sort of bracing for when the next awful thing inevitably comes up.<p>Personally, I <i>try</i> to keep it in my private notes, but sometimes things spill out. It&#x27;s not an attempt to bring others down.<p>Of course, this is comment is just as moot.')
