Am486 lagged by one year, offered lower performance and was still developed using Intel IP. K5 first 100% AMD design, slow and late, competed in the bottom low end, considered a failure. K6 100% external design by NexGen, let AMD move up to middle of the market. K7 designed by DEC Alpha team and manufactured in Motorola partnership, great success.')
