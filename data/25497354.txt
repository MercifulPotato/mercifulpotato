There are three possible explanations:<p>1. They haven&#x27;t thought of it.<p>2. They underestimate how profitable it would be.<p>3. It would be less profitable than what they&#x27;re doing now.<p>Option 1 seems ridiculous. Option 2 is possible if Facebook is blinded by corporate inertia, or if enough people working directly on the ads feel threatened. But there are a lot of smart people working there, who stand to make a lot of money by increasing profits.<p>So I&#x27;m going with option 3. They don&#x27;t do it because spying on everyone is more profitable.')
