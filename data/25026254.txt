Item(by='rkangel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604848664, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25014191, text='&gt; meant to be an easy to use all-in-one friendly to beginners<p>Unlike the &quot;normal&quot; Raspberry Pi this device has a fairly focused use case that you have summarised well here. It is designed to be plugged into an HDMI TV and used as a PC, with the great bonus of a cool GPIO connector. You make some choices and you make some sacrifices to meet cost and space targets. This also isn&#x27;t an iPhone that costs $800.<p>As for fitting the HDMI on, there <i>isn&#x27;t</i> loads of space for a full size port. I&#x27;m not saying it would be completely impossible but it would be challenging. Have a look at the photo of the board in this post:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.raspberrypi.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;designing-raspberry-pi-400&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.raspberrypi.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;designing-raspberry-pi-400&#x2F;</a><p>The non obvious thing looking at that photo is that the keyboard slopes back so you only have height at the front. Non-micro HDMI are surprisingly deep, without CAD looking up parts and looking up parts I can&#x27;t tell if just wouldn&#x27;t fit at all, but you certainly wouldn&#x27;t be able to get much behind it. Note also that they couldn&#x27;t work out a way to sensibly route the USB to the other side - it&#x27;s clearly a busy board.')
