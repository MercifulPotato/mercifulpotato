It&#x27;s not &quot;embarrassing&quot;, but it basically doesn&#x27;t answer the question. Instead, it argues that the question is equivalent to asking what&#x27;s the point of Python vs. C.<p>So in the end, the answer doesn&#x27;t provide any specific answer regarding SystemVerilog and Chisel. All I found is one mention of negotiating parameters, which Verilog doesn&#x27;t do. I would have loved to hear a lot more about examples of what Chisel makes more convenient than SystemVerilog.')
