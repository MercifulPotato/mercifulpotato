In the end you&#x27;re basically manufacturing narcissists, with a fragile falsely inflated self image covering a chasm of insecurity.<p>Precisely.<p>At the same time, I think that social connections divorced from physical reality -- as is on the Internet -- compound this to the nth degree.<p>I can pretend to be an amazing dancer or boxer or chef on Facebook, but it&#x27;s a very different thing when I need to demonstrate those skills as part of a community that actually Does That Thing.<p>To provide an example, I recall a few years back, at a dance social, meeting some kid from the Air Force that was an excellent case-study. He showed up, started dancing with partners, and it was obvious from the first (music) sentence in the first song that he simply did not know how to dance.<p>At all.<p>Like, when experienced dancers come from other styles, you can tell that they know how to dance. Maybe not this specific style, but they&#x27;ve got fundamentals. Ballerinas are particularly graceful, Latin dancers have a really specific flavor, ballroom people have really great structure, etc.<p>This dude was not a dancer.<p>Now, this is okay! The first rule of social dancing is that you want to welcome new dancers. But he was rude to every person that tried to help him out with picking up the basics, insisting that he was already a great dancer and that he didn&#x27;t need the help.<p>Falsely inflated self-image, meet room full of follows that aren&#x27;t interested in having their feet crushed.<p>Don&#x27;t know what happened to him after that, but imagine if his bubble had never faced critique -- and this was from a community that bent over backwards to be nice to newcomers.')
