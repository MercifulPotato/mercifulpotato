If you get booted from AWS, you can always go to Azure or GCP, or Digital Ocean&#x2F;Linode&#x2F;Rackspace&#x2F;etc.<p>I believe there are real antitrust questions regarding Amazon but getting booted from AWS doesn’t seem to connect with any of them. Amazon does not compete with Parler.<p>Seems like one of the funny things about the internet is that as “free” as it seems to be sometimes, there is no part of the internet that is really a public space. Everything on the internet is owned by somebody. There are no public roads, no sidewalks, no easements on the internet. If this were about a physical space like a store, you can get banned from the store but still protest outside on the sidewalk. If AWS were a “common carrier” then it would need strong justifications for banning customers.<p>I don’t see any of these legal arguments playing out here.')
