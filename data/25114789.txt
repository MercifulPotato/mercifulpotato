Someone needs to take over this business.<p>I don&#x27;t live in the heart of a big city.  I live about an hour away from SF.  Furthermore where I live is not at the heart of the city my address is at, due to unusual city boundaries, so services like grubhub and other delivery services do not work to my address, but if I put in my neighbors address they get a bunch of options I do not that are walking distance to me.  My point is, it helps to center restaurants by gps or similar, not to address, not to city.  Good luck! :D')
