Why? because I used to work in publicity (though not of the spinning kind). I recognise the style. I want the guy here and posting because we need facts not shouting but if he has a financial interest, we need to know. It should <i>not</i> stop him being there if there is because in some respects his pro-niclear posts are pretty good but it needs to be open.<p>Other problems - there&#x27;s a certain style of posting that proposes stuff with zero facts and magically gets voted to the top of the thread. No facts, slight whiff of fud, pushed to the top. That&#x27;s not actually how the HN crowd tends to react to info-free posts (or myabe there&#x27;s a subset who does, I may be mistaken). But how do I analyse the voting patterns when I don&#x27;t have the voting data?<p>I&#x27;ll not mention what happens when china becomes the subject.<p>Is it me? I don&#x27;t know. But then I can&#x27;t tell without evidence. There seem to be other problems. Is it me? I dunno. I&#x27;m posting less here because I feel good stuff is getting swamped (not just my stuff, a lot of other people&#x27;s stuff. My posts aren&#x27;t generally a pinnacle).<p>Edit: so how do I get the evidence you require?')
