I was addicted to m. for about 10 years. It was addiction because I couldn&#x27;t stop and I had no friends. It was in the beginning of the addiction that I discovered some unpleasant old memory of situation from my childhood that I repelled. That situation was so unpleasant that it changed the way I was treated by peers. It happened when I was 10 or 11. I remembered it when I was 20-22 smoking pot and doing occasional amphetamine. Here I am 40, 12 years after breaking my addiction and now I now that my memory is weak. I forgot a lot of things and it is hard for me to focus. The technology does not help, recently I learnt that keeping my brain constantly under dopamine flow (browsing the internet for cool things to read) degrades my ability to focus. Etc Etc. Life sometimes get you to the places you really want to go back and start again...')
