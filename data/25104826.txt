Most of our climate problems have come from humans disrupting this.<p>We didn&#x27;t come out of a void. We are a natural evolution too, with the only difference being that we reached this stage before other animals. Since we are disrupting our ecosystem, we are living proof that either:<p>- this ecosystem we are in is not function according to your definition\n - or functioning ecosystems do not maintain balance<p>&gt; The reason why we have so many ecological problems around the world is that humans have been constantly disrupting this. We introduce invasive species that dominate the landscape, cause extinctions and extirpations of native species and change the fundamental balance of the ecosystem.<p>Ecosystems are constantly being disrupted and have been long before humans evolved. Wind can carry the seeds of one plant into another ecosystem where it suddenly dominates because it has no &quot;natural predators&quot;. Birds can fly over an ecosystem, defecate and drop an entirely foreign species into another ecosystem.<p>Cyanobacteria are even attributed as the reason for one of the first mass extinctions [0]. Is that a sign of a functioning ecosystem?<p>&gt; Altering life at a fundamental genetic level goes even further than how we alter ecosystems.<p>Viruses and bacteria actively mess around with the DNA of other organisms in order to render them susceptible or make them carriers. Nature has been messing with itself long before we ever learned how.<p>We are in no way special in this universe or in our actions. We are just copying what we see in nature.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slate.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2014&#x2F;07&#x2F;the-great-oxygenation-event-the-earths-first-mass-extinction.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slate.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2014&#x2F;07&#x2F;the-great-oxygenation-e...</a>')
