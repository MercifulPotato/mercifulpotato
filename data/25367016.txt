I tend to read in certain threads for a while (I read a lot about the atomic bomb and Cold War this year, for example) but also tend to get interested in popular or award winning books, whether contemporary or not. I also read a lot of fiction, where my choices tend to be even more random than my non-fiction choices. Or I get interested in one author and read everything they’ve written.<p>My method isn’t necessarily bad but I’m thinking it might be time to optimize my reading a bit.<p>So HN: How do you decide what to read?')
