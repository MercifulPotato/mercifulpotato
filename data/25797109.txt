There are many people who are these anti-establishment, universally pro-union types, as if they improve everything they touch and there are no downsides. The reality is that unions are a big tradeoff. For grocery workers and warehouse workers and other low skill positions, they tend to make sense. Labor laws are definitely a better way to handle things.<p>Unions should also be a last resort. Folks need to stop assuming that their employer is oppressive and give them a chance to accommodate their grievances, and they should be reasonable in what they expect from an employer&#x2F;employee relationship. The best possible outcome is having an employer who gives you what you want (within reason) without a union. Folks who make hundreds of K per year, get unlimited vacation, flexible working time, free gourmet meals, the best health benefits on the market have a lot less reason ti resort to such a blunt instrument than a factory worker in a one factory town.<p>They should also be sincere in their evaluation of rebuttals. It’s import to build trust on both sides. Sometimes threats of a plant closure are bluffing as a negotiating tactic, but sometimes they aren’t.<p>For what it’s worth, I have been a union member and many of my family members are in unions. I do not have good things to say about them at all, but it’s true that some places are even worse without them.')
