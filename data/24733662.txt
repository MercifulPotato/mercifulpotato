They receive high salaries in anticipation of their doing a good job, and if they don&#x27;t they&#x27;re removed. Further, a disproportionate amount of their compensation is equity based to align their incentives. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s right or wrong, just that they are expected to justify their pay too.')
