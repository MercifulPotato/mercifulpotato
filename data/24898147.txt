Item(by='bigbubba', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603730667, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24890126, text='Personally I think our common definitions of intelligence are too narrowly defined, we have a bias towards recognizing intelligence similar to our own and a blindspot for intelligent systems unlike our own.  I agree with Paul Stamets that mycelia networks may have a form of intelligence quite unlike our own.  Large corporations likely have intelligence of their own (&#x27;slow AIs&#x27;) and may in aggregate pursue goals that no individual participant in the organization agrees with (preference falsification demonstrates how such a thing might occur.)  Closer to the traditional, I think reptiles may be far more intelligent that we usually give them credit for since we have a mammalian bias against their kind.  Mammalians seem to have empathy circuits that fire more often for other mammals, and this inclines us to not consider the possible intelligence of non-mammals.<p>So, GPT?  I think that&#x27;s probably a form of intelligence too, but not one that&#x27;s particularly similar to our own.  I also doubt that we&#x27;ll have much luck getting it to ever perform at near-human levels, when you consider the data and power requirements.  I think it&#x27;s not simply a matter of silicon vs wetware; I think the GPT approach is substantially more different from our own than the hardware it runs on.  It&#x27;s a form of intelligence but that doesn&#x27;t mean it is like our own.')
