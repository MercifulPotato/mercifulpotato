Doesn&#x27;t mean that people living in those areas don&#x27;t have to watch out. </i><p>I agree that there is some non-zero number of people in the U.S. who have to watch out for gun murder. The point I&#x27;m trying to make is that they make up a really small proportion of the population. Anecdotes are fun.<p>&gt; <i>As for gun murders being a rare death cause, indeed if you average over all age ranges they are. However, for younger people they are a major concern. CDC data [0] lists homicides in the top 4 reasons for death for age groups from 1 until 35. Which weapons are used for these homicides? A different statistic tells us most times it&#x27;s guns [1].</i><p>You&#x27;re right that, <i>among untimely deaths</i>, gun murders move up the ranking if you&#x27;re looking at young people. But this misses the main thing, which is that untimely deaths of any kind are super rare among young people, even rarer than overall. Why should we care if gun murders make up 50% of untimely deaths among young people if the likelihood of untimely death is sufficiently low? Your line of reasoning seems to indicate a 10% chance of untimely death with 1 percentage point of that being gun murder is preferable to a 1% chance of untimely death with 0.5 percentage points of that being gun murder.<p>As an aside, thinking about this (and many other things) in terms of ordinal rankings will often lead you down the wrong path. &quot;Top four reasons&quot; tells us nothing at all. If there are 5,000 categories constructed and they are roughly evenly distributed, &quot;top four&quot; tells us nothing. If 99% of the probability mass is in #1, &quot;top four&quot; tells us nothing. It&#x27;s like the classic &quot;The U.S. is [embarassingly] #44 in math achievement&quot;. This means nothing if the top 80 countries are tightly clustered around 98 math achievement points.<p>&gt; <i>But preventing gun deaths is important too.</i>\nMy point is that it isn&#x27;t important. There are much, much bigger fish to fry from a public health perspective. The marginal benefit of throwing one dollar at &quot;gun violence&quot; is &lt;&lt; the marginal benefit of throwing that same buck at something like trying to get construction workers to wear proper safety harnesses.')
