Tesla proved that it can be a great sporty car and family SUV. Now they all want to win over the demographic of people who want a heavy duty truck, and prove to them that they don&#x27;t need a heavy noisy stinky diesel to do it.<p>A lot of that demographic associate that noise, vibration, and smell with power, and think that electric vehicles can&#x27;t provide that same performance and feeling of handling. A lot of them feel that electric drive will only work efficiently for smaller vehicles, or that electric implies lightweight or small or otherwise not heavy duty.<p>Of course manufacturers want to prove them wrong, and try to get all demographics interested in electric vehicles. Electric trucks would be great for utility companies.')
