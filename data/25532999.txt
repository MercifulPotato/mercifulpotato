I don&#x27;t expect something for nothing. But the ads are getting really out of hand recently. You used to get an ad at the start of a video, and not even every video. Now it&#x27;s 2 before every video - and multiple ad breaks along the way. This is just a terrible experience and makes me hate using youtube.')
