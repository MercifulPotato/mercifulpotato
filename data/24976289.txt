Solar&#x2F;wind is about to drop under even natural gas in LCOE for even installed turbines. All of those have three year projections of continued double-digit percentage drops in cost and massive increases in scale.<p>Even worse for hydrogen, most of that is using existing infrastructure for transmission, so while charging stations need to be built out for EVs, it is far easier to do that than put in hydrogen storage &#x2F; transport infrastructure.<p>So even if some hydrogen article targets a certain cost on the batteries &#x2F; EVs &#x2F; power transmission lines, in five years things will look completely different.<p>Maybe aviation?')
