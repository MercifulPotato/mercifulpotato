Item(by='jively', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603245134, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24843531, text='NZ is pretty tight about who they let in, similar to Australia. There&#x27;s a high bar for an experience&#x2F;expertise based visa and its limited to certain industries (digital graphics for example - movies are a big deal in the South Island). The only thing it&#x27;s easy to bring in are seasonal workers from the Pacific islands to pick fruit &#x2F; work the vineyards.<p>Otherwise it&#x27;s sponsorship, marriage, or family.<p>Residency (not citizenship) needs to be applied to while outside the country, and the application can take up to a year to be processed (you get a dedicated case worker, you need medical checks, xrays and all kinds of evidence - I needed to submit photos of my wife and I to prove our relationship was legit as well as a bunch of tax records and existing residency proof - it was a lot - also, very expensive!), citizenship requires several years of actual residency.<p>The NZ passport is like the UK one and they can compel you to relinquish existing citizenship if you naturalise.<p>I don&#x27;t think that will happen with Gaben, Covid has stranded many temporary visa holders here without work or without access to benefits so there&#x27;s a large policy question about what to do with those that are stranded.<p>But anyone hoping to just emigrate over here because we seem to have our shit together (we don&#x27;t) is delusional.<p>A big reason that they are so careful about handing out permanent residency is that permanent residents (not temporary visa holders), can vote in parliamentary elections. Which is awesome - no taxation without representation - but gets the local right riled up because any govt can boost their voter count by opening immigration up, which means in general, there&#x27;s downward pressure on immigration from all sides.')
