I shouldn’t have to have a social media account in order to use a product that isn’t directly related to social media.<p>Accounts like Microsoft aren’t the same as Facebook IMO because they tie products and services I’ve purchased to my account, which I believe is a reasonable and relevant use of an online account in this context. Facebook doesn’t do any of that, nor does it exist to manage purchases of products or services I’ve made. It exists to siphon personal data about me to serve me ads.<p>If we’re serious about things like privacy, then we have to be equally serious about corporate attempts to coerce consumers into handing over data to use completely unrelated products. This is absolutely anti-privacy and should be dealt with.')
