If you started a 150-node mesh today with strictly ZWave+ devices, an Aotec ZWave hub, and perhaps Home Assistant to control and automate it all, you&#x27;d have a much more consistently positive experience.<p>So I&#x27;m left boiling down the complaints to &quot;I was an early adopter, so I got stuck with the crappy stuff, boo!&quot;<p>Also, if you&#x27;re paying &gt;$50USD per common ZWave fixture (like a dimmer, stuff like pool controllers can be more), you&#x27;re seriously doing something wrong.<p>Oh well, to each their own. I have a mesh of about 50 nodes across 2 stories, and it all works great. Can&#x27;t remember the last time I had to turn a light on when I entered a room. Among many other nice touches, which I am fine expending a bit more effort to upkeep than normal &#x27;analog&#x27; dumb homes.')
