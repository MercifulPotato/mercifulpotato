So are support vector machines, gaussian processes and gradient boosted trees. Yet the performance of neural networks is unrivaled in certain tasks, as has been proven over and over again.<p>As a whole, that paper is quite bad (and still unpublished, probably blocked by peer review) because (1) it only considers fully connected networks (which are a minority of models used nowadays) and (2) the experimental validation was done on tasks where neural networks are not very strong.<p>Show me examples of competitive polynomial regression models in language translation, image segmentation and Go playing and I will be convinced.')
