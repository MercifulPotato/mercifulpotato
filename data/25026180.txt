The key difference being that instead of an endpoint agent, it uses a browser extension.<p>Having a presence in the web browser like this enables a novel source of security data.\nThis gives you new capabilities and allows you to implements new controls in your IT environment.<p>Since Weaklayer gives a new data source, it isn&#x27;t a replacement for any tools you currently use in your security stack. It&#x27;s meant to be used along with your existing IT security stack.<p>A great example of the new capabilities you get is credential phishing detection.\nBy monitoring user interaction with web pages, you can see when an employee enters their corporate password into a non-corporate website.\nThe video on the Weaklayer homepage demos this.<p>Any and all feedback is appreciated!\nSend me an email if you prefer private communication or want a hand setting it up.<p>Finally, here is the source for the browser extension:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;weaklayer&#x2F;sensor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;weaklayer&#x2F;sensor</a>')
