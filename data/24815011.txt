Their most recent attempt, the Steam Machines, were not very well received mainly because most games wouldn&#x27;t run on it. I&#x27;m assuming Valve is gearing up for one of a few things:<p>1. Steam Machine 2: VR<p>Pairing a Steam Machine with an &quot;it just works&quot; concept of the Index that can play all of your old PC games (even ones that don&#x27;t run on Windows 10) and all of your VR games at a decent resolution.<p>2. Oh shit... Xbox Game Pass is actually a great deal....<p>They may want to piggy back off of Microsoft&#x27;s UWP concept to make a game-subscription service for the entire (or most) of the Steam catalog. Valve knows that games industry is going trough a large industry shift. Most consumers don&#x27;t really care that they&#x27;re selling out all of their rights for convenience (hell that was Steam&#x27;s main realization).<p>3. lol Google thinks people trust them with games haha... but Stadia isn&#x27;t too bad of an idea...<p>Containerizing games and packaging up their streaming software (Steam Remote Play) and maybe some edge hardware from #1 would be a great value for a PC gamer. The industry has been attempting to push itself to thin client fat server models for quite some time and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Valve wanted in on the action with some of their existing investments.<p>4. They may actually think they&#x27;re a compelling offering to the couch gamer.<p>Steam Machines, Steam Links, and the Steam Controllers were neat but, maybe, the execs at Valve think there&#x27;s enough traction to beat out the existing competition (Nintendo Switch&#x2F;WII&#x2F;Gamecube&#x2F;..., Xbox Series ..., Sony PS..).')
