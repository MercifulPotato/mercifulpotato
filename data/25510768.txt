You can buy pre-terminated or use quick connectors. Most don&#x27;t realize that fiber is cheaper to produce than copper; the expense comes from the fancy SFP switches and routers.<p>Wireless is horrible. In urban settings, the RF pollution will lead to all kinds of misery. If you are doing anything important with the connection, it must be wired. It&#x27;s also bad security because I can drive by in a van and knock out your whole block&#x27;s internet connections because so many people equate internet with WiFi.')
