However, the government was competent and honest, avoiding things like nepotism and suchlike. The result of all this is that starting from the mid-20th century, it grew from one of the poorest nations on earth to one of the richest. All this as a small island country that even has to import its own water.<p>China is basically a giant kleptocracy. My dad is fond of China, but I am hesitant. China is so corrupt that it&#x27;s hard for good things to come from it. I guess it is slowly industrialising and getting better, but it seems to be labouring under a heavy burden.<p>I have long been suspicious that the Chinese economy would collapse. My theory is that it produces returns below the cost of capital. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;ve seen movement in production from places like America to China.<p>My argument is that you produce wealth by creating returns that are in excess of the cost of capital. You destroy it if it&#x27;s the reverse. So we could find out that America has actually done the right thing by letting China do the manufacturing.<p>That&#x27;s all just my theory, though. I&#x27;ve been thinking like this since the 90&#x27;s. So far, I&#x27;ve been shown to be resoundingly completely wrong (at least as it appears on the surface. Will I have been proven to be very wrong until I&#x27;m proven very right, or is the whole thing just a completely invalid theory on my part).')
