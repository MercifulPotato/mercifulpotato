JavaFX&#x2F;OpenJFX doesn&#x27;t use Cairo anywhere. Some references appear in the codebase but only via the WebKit import.<p>Neither JavaFX nor OpenJDK use Cairo for drawing and AFAIK never have. I don&#x27;t know where this idea comes from. They use a pure Java 2D engine called Marlin when doing CPU based rendering. JavaFX is normally hardware accelerated though, in which case all drawing is handled using shaders and its own graphics engine.')
