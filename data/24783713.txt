I skimmed the whitepaper, though, and it seems what actually happens is the clients generate their own public&#x2F;private keypairs, which allows the clients to negotiate session keys without exposing the keys to Zoom&#x27;s server.<p>Of course since the client code is closed source, you just have to trust that it isn&#x27;t sharing the session keys with Zoom or a third party.  That&#x27;s the same potential flaw as with something like WhatsApp&#x27;s, Telegram&#x27;s, or FB Messenger&#x27;s E2EE mode: the app itself can intentionally break the security of the system, and you probably won&#x27;t know it.')
