If people would use more than just a handful domains&#x2F;providers for mail then single failures would not have that big of an impact.<p>I have been hosting my mail on my own domain for the past 3 years and have not been impacted by this incident. Currently I am happy for protonmail that I use to host my mails at. But I know that I can easily move on, if service drops, and even selfhost.')
