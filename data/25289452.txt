And, as an industry, we&#x27;re probably sticking our fingers in our ears more than we should about what happens when process shrinks really truly stop happening. And they will. There are still a variety of options but there&#x27;s very little evidence they have anything like the legs of CMOS process scaling even if we do dump a big part of the problem on developers who don&#x27;t get to develop for a largely unified architecture any longer or lean as heavily on high-level abstractions.')
