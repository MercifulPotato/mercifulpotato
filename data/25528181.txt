Help me understand: how is the AMA a union? Especially the sort of union people are suggesting for amazon. Specifically:<p>* do they negotiate standard wages, hours and work conditions?<p>* do they organise strikes and other action when they don&#x27;t get what their members want?<p>* do they also represent unskilled workers, say hospital cleaners (as was being suggested for the amazon Union)?<p>Help me out here. Am I missing something? I&#x27;m no expert so I&#x27;m happy to be corrected...')
