Fast enough that when I used to teach LaTeX classes to math department secretaries back in the late 80s, they would be impressed with my typing speed. So, while I don&#x27;t type properly, I type fluently. I suspect that most programmers type at some level of fluency, even if they don&#x27;t employ proper technique. Failure to do things like participate in online discussions, etc. are not a result of bad typing, but of the programmer&#x27;s personality.')
