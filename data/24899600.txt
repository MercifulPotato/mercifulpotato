Not being restricted by proprietary software and walled gardens.<p>And the point of libre&#x2F;open is the word from FLOSS you forgot to add: freedom, ie. being in a position to decide and control your software.<p>Libre&#x2F;open&#x2F;free software isn&#x27;t an end goal by themselves, they the means to be in control.<p>&gt; The year of the Linux desktop won&#x27;t come because apart from the kernel the ecosystem is incredibly fragmented and reaching consensus is pretty much impossible<p>Until Wayland came along, X11 was the only defacto window system for Linux - if you wrote an application targeting X11, it would work on <i>all</i> Linux desktop system.<p>Wayland <i>fragmented</i> the window system landscape.<p>&gt; so in 2020 we&#x27;re still deciding whether to do client side or server side decorations.<p>This wasn&#x27;t a question at the past, everyone agreed that server side decorations are better because they allow users more control through their window managers - with exception for special cases, of course (the WMs didn&#x27;t forbid it after all, applications could do both).<p>It wasn&#x27;t until some GNOME &quot;designer&quot; saw iPad, got jealous they didn&#x27;t thought of it and then mad that people could actually have choice in how their Linux systems looked and behaved that we got client side decorations.')
