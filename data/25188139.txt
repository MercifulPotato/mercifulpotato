It&#x27;s also about the story we&#x27;re telling about and through these bits. Are you claiming that a raw output of memory along with the concrete mathematical operations you can apply to it would suffice in satisfying your urge to play [Panzer General]? Does the visual &amp; narrative dressing not play a role in your interest (or others&#x27;) in the game?<p>It&#x27;s probably not harmful for most &quot;well-adjusted&quot; individuals (whatever that can mean); nonetheless I think it&#x27;s important to talk about how much the piece of media encourages (or fails to encourage) mindfulness towards what it represents. Even more so for interactive media like video games.<p>I further agree with the author that we can&#x27;t look at an instance of this in the void; it is important to consider what&#x27;s happening in the world at large. With all that has been said on the &quot;Clean Wehrmact&quot;, consider what role this game might have had in further propagating that narrative in, for example, kids looking for a fun wargame to play without yet having knowledge of what happened in WW2.')
