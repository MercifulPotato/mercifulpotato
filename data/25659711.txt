Many people don&#x27;t use facebook and still manage to make appointments and lead fulfilling social lives.<p>That said, it is clear that for many people the &quot;social cost&quot; is larger than the &quot;facebook evil cost&quot;, even for people demanding government intervention. I guess for those people, the cost for demanding politicians Do Something is even less.')
