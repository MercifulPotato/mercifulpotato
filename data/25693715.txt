Item(by='Melting_Harps', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610153430, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25689868, text='&gt; Technocracy is much worse than even representative democracy.<p>I never said anything about implementing, simply creating a proof of concept would be enough to show that we have tools to make them irrelevant should be enough of a deterrent effect and should in some ways ensure we don&#x27;t have a repeat of 2020 again. And start to test it to the low hanging fruit: UBI and Universal medicare is is overwhelming supported by the majority of the populace, yet the regulatory capture (who themselves benefit from State issued medical care and salary even in stalemates along in with all the &#x27;contributions&#x27; from donors and are exempt from insider trading conflicts of interest cases) refuse to even consider it on either side. Hell, even the $2000 stimulus seems to be defied yet again by this time a Democrat, Joe Manchin, despite the highly contested Republican majority in the Senate. Again, its all theater, and no one there has the best interest of the people in mind regardless of party affiliation.<p>There has to be some incentive here and all I&#x27;m asking is for a better stick if &#x27;representative democracy&#x27; is to remain. Furthermore a trawler of all known conflicts of interests of every politician should appear via QR code every time they speak in the house.<p>We talk about how all of these jobs&#x2F;Industries are going to be automated and are never coming back, but I have a very hard time understanding that the most corrupt of all (politics) is some how a given that it will remain intact. We deserve better and those in FAANG really should be self-reflective after what occurred and start asking what they could do to prevent it instead of just deplatforming, which is really the worst thing possible as it only emboldens those q-anon imbeciles into thinking they&#x27;re &#x27;being censored for telling the truth.&#x27;<p>Those riots we saw last year are really just waiting to happen again as we&#x27;ve seen that nothing has changed since then, and now the Trump factions now think they have a just cause and a martyr to back their &#x27;cause&#x27; this really is a ticking time bomb.')
