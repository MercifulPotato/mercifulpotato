I was sure it was 5 years away, tops. I was eagerly building profile pages using FOAF and trying hard to implement other ontologies in my work. I got a job in an academic library and pushed hard for semantic technologies. Seemed like Linked Data was such a hot buzzword and topic that we all wanted to explore but could... just.. never.. get going. In 2015 I gave it all 5 more years and then would consider it essentially &quot;vaporware&quot;. Maybe it&#x27;ll catch on someday but it&#x27;s 2020 and our data is siloed as much as ever. Feel like web scraping plus machine learning is the real winner in this space, but maybe that&#x27;s an unfair comparison.')
