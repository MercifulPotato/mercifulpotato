They see less infrastructure, they see less of the masses of students that have to be educated, etc. They tend to be pro-small government because they don&#x27;t have a daily view of the impact government has on daily life.<p>I don&#x27;t view that as gullible, I view that as a perspective that is incomplete due to geographical circumstances. And I am sure that&#x27;s probably a road that goes both ways, with people in urban &amp; suburban areas not seeing the full picture with respect to rural society.')
