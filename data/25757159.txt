I dream of communities where differences are celebrated, enhancing creative ferment; the tech industry as a whole won&#x27;t be that way within the foreseeable future, but there can be pockets where tolerance and constructive interaction are norms.<p>The Rust community is one of them.  Regardless of whether it is successful as a recruitment tool, regardless of the effect on productivity, building a kind community is worthwhile just for the sake of its members.<p>Because life is short, and every hour that we spend enjoying ourselves rather than enveloped by hostility is a treasure.')
