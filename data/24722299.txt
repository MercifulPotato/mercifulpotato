Engineering salaries are substantially larger than driver&#x27;s salaries. Also, there is the cost of years and years of extremely expensive research that needs to be offset, cloud infrastructure costs, hardware costs + costs of retooling factories for integrating the large numbers of sensors + compute. I can&#x27;t imagine (without doing any actual math) that there&#x27;s a cost savings within 200 years')
