The typical FAANG developer is not earning $200k base and $200k RSUs per year. It&#x27;s more like $130k - $180k and maybe $80k to $150k RSU. You have to be pretty senior to reach top 5% income at FAANG in the US--it isn&#x27;t as common as HN would have you believe.<p>And as I&#x27;ve noted in another comment, top 10% doesn&#x27;t put you in the same socioeconomic class as the actual wealthy (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;personal-finance&#x2F;how-much-income-puts-you-top-1-5-10&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;personal-finance&#x2F;how-much-incom...</a>).<p>There&#x27;s a gap between FAANG and, say, a janitor&#x27;s salary; that&#x27;s just not debatable. The gap is much smaller than between Mr. FAANG and Mr. Top 5%, and for all intents and purposes Mr. FAANG <i>is</i> Mr. Janitor when compared to Mr. Top 1%. That some FAANG employees are in the top 1% doesn&#x27;t negate this.')
