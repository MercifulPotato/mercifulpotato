Pity there is no more &quot;that graeber&quot; :(. To think Chomsky outlived him...crazy...<p>&gt; Or is that something you&#x27;re spit-balling just now? :)<p>Pure spitball. If predictibility causes bias, try randomness. PRNG is fine except one could exfiltrate the hidden state maybe? So try something even more black-box like a hunk of radioactive something.<p>&gt; Agreed on UBI<p>:)<p>&gt;  One thing I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about is the Ultimatum Game [1], and what it would look like to scale up that concept to a society. In a sense, that&#x27;s the realpolitik of every state: if the peasants are sufficiently unhappy, they show up with torches and pitchforks, even at the cost of their short-term interests. The modern peaceful version is &quot;vote the bums out&quot;, but that&#x27;s always been of dubious efficacy; and it feels especially toothless today, given the scope of regulatory capture and &quot;manufactured consent&quot; in the two-party system. The next closest thing (without resorting to violence) probably looks like a General Strike, but that&#x27;s one hell of a coordination problem.<p>There is the quote &quot;I have found out what economics is; it is the science of confusing stocks with flows&quot;. I had some crude thoughts in my own head, but with some friend&#x27;s advise on putting in that terminology, it seems both that the stocks are are more fictions and the source of the economic problems of society. I question the ultimate game example then because it seems very &quot;stocks first&quot;, dividing up some amount one off. I would much rather see &quot;capitalism without ownership&quot; or &quot;rents all the way down&quot;.')
