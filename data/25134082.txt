I encourage you to follow the good example of how Debian runs popcon (popularity contest).<p>By having your default be assuming user consent to surveillance, you have produced spyware that reports a user’s track log history to Google via IP geolocation and a persistent unique machine identifier included with the request to Google Analytics every time the user installs a package using brew.<p>I assume most Homebrew users are ignorant of this fact, because you never demanded informed consent before doing it.<p>You are part of a troubling and growing trend of remote developers misusing the computers of their users simply because network requests are, by default, invisible to the user.  Most users will <i>never</i> consent to such a thing if they are aware of it occurring.<p>It would be quite nice if, in my new machine setup checklist, I not have to include separate steps to disable my package manager’s spying on my activities in addition to the steps I already have to take to disable the macOS’s spying on my activities.')
