You could just stage some break-ins that just vandalize car glass. People will blame the guy whose glass was broken (why did you park there, was your car empty, blah blah). You&#x27;re just a glass repair shop so everyone sees you as the good guy. And no one will see that your network of auto glass companies is actually controlled by you.<p>Once upon a time, something similar happened with an upholsterer in the SF Bay area. They had the contract to repair seats on the train system. Then someone figured out that more repairs meant more money, so they hired some people to go around slashing seats...')
