(Inferring from mci&#x27;s comment, probably not.)  But let&#x27;s suppose we saw this phenomenon in a specific country&#x27;s population, measured without any sampling bias.  It could be from:<p>- selection pressure for some other trait that happens to involve some genetic material that affects the forearm arteries.<p>- the recent removal of strong selection pressure for having two arteries, on a trait that generally tends to drift towards three arteries in many directions.<p>- a dominant gene isolated to one province, which then got diluted across the population when people traveled more.<p>- a trait found more often in the rural population, which over the past century had more children.')
