Or are the predictions that China&#x27;s growth will decline true?<p>Some analysts think China&#x27;s population is too old and that youth will peter out, whereas others think that all the CCP has to do is ask its millennials to have more babies.<p>Some analysts think that democratic nations will band together and give China the cold shoulder. China could just as easily form alliances.<p>Others say that the West will build factories in India, Vietnam, Mexico, and Africa and stop single-sourcing the supply chain. China&#x27;s also playing that game with their One Belt initiative.<p>The West has bountiful resources. Oil, minerals. So does China.<p>The West has a huge military and space program. So does China.<p>The West has high-paying tech jobs because of its lead in tech, but China is catching up and has more people graduating into the field. This could drive dominance (and salaries) down.<p>China keeps reporting growth. Others say don&#x27;t trust the numbers. At the same time, look at what&#x27;s happening to Western economies and national debt. Is China pulling the same levers, or are they unscathed? What, if anything, can the West do to match that growth? Or is it impossible?<p>What&#x27;s going to happen? What&#x27;s the 20 to 30 year outlook?<p>Really hoping for some good analysis.<p>(note: this story was &quot;flagged&quot; and I was unable to reply, but I &quot;vouched&quot; for it because I really value conversation and want informed input to help shape my view. Maybe I was wrong to do so, and if Dang or the mods disapprove, I&#x27;m sorry. My opinion on this whole matter is constantly in flux, and I&#x27;d really like good sources of information so I can be up to date and well informed. It feels like one of the most important topics of our generation.)')
