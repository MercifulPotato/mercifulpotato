If a hypothesis is &quot;plausible&quot; than practically by definition it is above ridicule. But how do you decide which hypotheses are plausible?<p>Science, at its core, is a social system. One of the key goals of that system is prioritization. There are finite research resources and it&#x27;s important to allocate them to the most promising areas. Ridicule is one of the more extreme tools scientists use in that social process to reach consensus about which hypotheses are plausible.')
