On the other hand it just seems like another step into the direction of turning the chickens into optimized food machines. Would be more interested in seeing more means of producing tasty food without using animals and at reduced costs to the environment. Working towards one final giant culling of all unnaturally engineered animals and just continuing on with a small number of animals to live reasonably natural lives and produce goods for realistic, high, prizes to be consumed as a luxury or exotic thing. Sorry, I&#x27;m a dreamer I guess, continuously disappointed by a world that doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to set any significant goals nor pursue them at large scale unless it&#x27;s for profit and likely at the cost of the rest of the world.')
