And sshd had taken netcat down with it, killing the transfer midway.<p>As somebody who has experienced the described behaviour, I can empathise because it is super annoying.  But this isn&#x27;t a particular good point with which to illustrate it.  If you&#x27;re doing any sort of work on one or more remote servers that shouldn&#x27;t be accidentally terminated like a large data transfer, you should be backgrounding it with screen or similar.  Even for users without the idel connection dropping as described, the Internet can still fail.')
