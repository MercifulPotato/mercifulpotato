Item(by='joshuamorton', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607146025, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25311690, text='&gt; Whether or not you believe the 2 week deadline is a hard and fast rule followed 100% of the time, Jeff never made that claim<p>His words were, and I quote &quot;we require two weeks for this sort of review&quot;. That is an absolutely false statement, and Jeff knows it. I see no other characterization than a lie. I take no solace in that fact, priors were that Jeff Dean was an above average executive and ran a  more ethical then average org. I&#x27;m disappointed to see my trust was misplaced and that Jeff was willing to endorse that document, but I&#x27;m not going to not hold someone accountable when I see them do something obviously wrong, even if we work for the same employer. Ethics extend beyond that.<p>&gt; 1 day is certainly unreasonable.<p>It is not though. It&#x27;s the norm.<p>&gt; We were told specifically they _were_ given an opportunity to revise<p>This is not true (if you believe this to be true, can you cite said statement?). I&#x27;d be more than happy to discuss this with you privately, my username should be obvious ;)')
