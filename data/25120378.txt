They&#x27;re even cheaper than x86 servers. (Though also slower, at least AWS&#x27;s version.)<p>Where can I buy ARM server comparable with x86 server on performance? I&#x27;m not interested with clouds, I want bare metal server. I&#x27;m not aware of any server brand like HP or Dell producing ARM servers. I&#x27;m also not aware of any CPU manufacturer producing computer desktops with ARM comparable with x86, outside of Apple macs. I&#x27;m not convinced that ARM is the future. For me the future is both architectures co-existing.')
