Musicians and mathematicians can&#x27;t bullshit because other practitioners will catch on easily.<p>In real estates and startups, the &quot;system&quot; is usually esoteric, highly network dependent, and non-verifiable. You can&#x27;t tell if a startup founder is truly a genius, or just lucked out (or had access to his dad&#x27;s millions as seed funding).<p>Any field where knowledge remains locked away in closed networks essentially becomes the domain of bullshit.<p>Open knowledge breeds earnestness.<p>If everyone knew <i>exactly</i> how every real estate deal in the world was structured, there would be no bullshit real estate investors.')
