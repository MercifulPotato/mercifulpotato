Iceberg gets stuck next to an island - surely it won&#x27;t completely envelop it. The map shows the island is dotted with penguins breeding grounds so not all are going to be blocked, probably way less than half even. In the area where it will drag on the seabed some of the life will be probably destroyed, but this area can&#x27;t be very large compared to the size of the island.<p>I mean it would be better if it doesn&#x27;t happen but compared to the other climate catastrophes we&#x27;re facing this doesn&#x27;t seem very serious. Surely, penguins can deal with some floating ice?')
