They also were able to print peel-and-stick forms without melting the adhesive.<p>And then, about a year ago, their OEM toner cartridges suddenly became almost impossible to find and more expensive than the printer itself and the cheaper, third-party cartridges just don&#x27;t work well at all. So, I had to reluctantly abandon Samsung. I am still looking for a good replacement.')
