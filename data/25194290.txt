Both are the same exact pattern of notes starting at a different point. This means that playing C Major (Ionian) involves the exact same set of notes as A Minor (Aeolian).<p>&gt; C and Eb major look pretty different across a fret board, and if you want to shred, there is going to be a lot of scales in your practicing.<p>They look exactly the same. One is simply shifted 3 frets away from the next. That&#x27;s my point. Playing Eb major in the same position as C major would involve changing shapes, and playing Eb major in the same shape as C major would involve changing position.<p>To contrast, playing Eb major in <i>any</i> position on a piano requires playing a totally different shape than C major. That means learning totally different muscle memory for Eb major, which is not necessary on guitar.<p>&gt; Nothing is stopping you from becoming a virtuoso on something like an Ableton Push, but there just isn&#x27;t any short cut around the practice and that&#x27;s honestly the main slog.<p>There is nothing stopping me from becoming an expert on something like a Janko piano, except that I don&#x27;t have one. I do have a piano. My point is that if I had both, I would find it much easier to learn the Janko piano, because it requires significantly less learning.<p>&gt; 2 hand independence, internal sense of rhythm, syncopation, groove and understanding the relationships and functions of chords&#x2F;harmony take tons of dedicated practice.<p>That&#x27;s true. Factoring in different muscle memory for each individual key also requires tons of extra dedicated practice. That skill is totally unnecessary, and could be completely factored out by using a chromatic layout, allowing the learner to focus a significant amount more time and effort on those other skills you mentioned.<p>&gt; To get where this is second nature just requires a lot of time. Issues with the keyboard&#x27;s ergonomics are small in comparison.<p>Small? Arguable. Trivial? Definitely not.<p>&gt; Theory is descriptive not prescriptive; it&#x27;s how musicians can discuss what&#x27;s happening in a piece.<p>Yes, and our current descriptors are convoluted. If we had better descriptors, we would be better equipped to discuss.<p>Frankly, they are prescriptive. They prescribe we call &quot;loud&quot; &quot;forte&quot;, and &quot;fast&quot; &quot;allegro&quot;. They prescribe that we call the 14th half-step up a &quot;9th&quot;. The whole thing could use a complete overhaul, but professionalism demands we preserve antiquity.<p>&gt; You will need to practice and learn some goofy names, but pretty much it&#x27;s just a way to describe relative notes, groupings and relationships. Knowing your major and relative minors scales you can learn the other modes relatively easily; Mixolydian is a major scale with dominant 7th, Dorian is a minor scale with a major 6th.<p>You have illustrated my point well.')
