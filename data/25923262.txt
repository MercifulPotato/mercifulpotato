You know what ecosystem it&#x27;s a part of? The JS one. That &quot;entire&quot; one you&#x27;re talking about has produced superb work such as React, V8, is pretty much responsible for Rust existing, and so on.<p>JS has dumb flaws. It doesn&#x27;t mean anything is happening &quot;in spite&quot; of it. If anything, innovation is happening thanks to JS AND in spite of its flaws. But don&#x27;t think for a second we would have even one tenth of the developers we have at our disposal today if JS and the internet didn&#x27;t massively lower that barrier of entry. And less developers means less progress overall in the entire industry, not just less left-hand libraries.')
