Eventually something like that is bound to make its way down to the consumer level, but even short of that cameras have been getting smaller and more covert.<p>Today most people have to stand near and point their phones at the police to capture a decent image, but long telephoto lenses are available where you can capture video from far away, and technologies such as Google Glass proved that cameras can be integrated in one&#x27;s glasses.<p>That sort of thing will just get more and more prevalent and recordings of police and everyone else are likely to become much more common, no matter what the law says.')
