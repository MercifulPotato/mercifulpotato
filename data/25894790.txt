But this person was such an extreme case. He was always grumpy, would regularly take several minutes out of lectures to call out and belittle any student who was late or he didn&#x27;t think was paying attention. The only times he wasn&#x27;t sour was when he was describing unethical and torturous experiments on animals. Then he was overly excited and giddy.<p>The exam was, as was common at that university, essentially an essay which was then reviewed by the examiner who would ask for any clarifications or push with further questions. This exam asked us to describe a system solving a fairly standard AI task using neural networks. My answer was a few pages split into a few sections: a brief overview of the whole system, followed by detailed descriptions of each part. Wherever I skipped details in the overview I&#x27;d written &quot;(see p. X)&quot;. It took a bit of planning to get those numbers in there when writing that by hand with limited time.<p>When I finally gave the answer the professor skimmed through the overview and then proceeded to berate me for having neglected to write about some important detail. I politely pointed out that it was in the following section and that I&#x27;d included a page reference for things which I referred to before defining. He grumbled and kept skimming. After a while he complained about another thing he thought I really should have explained which was missing. I told him on which page he could find it and politely reminded him that he was reading the overview and that the details were in the next part.<p>This went on for a while and I got a bit more annoyed and a bit less polite each time, because it was getting ridiculous. After the tenth or so time I flat out told him that if he&#x27;d read past the overview, like I kept telling him,  he&#x27;d find all the details there and if he didn&#x27;t want to I&#x27;d be willing to describe any part of it orally but really, it is all there if he would just read it instead of complaining.<p>That&#x27;s when he asked the question about a third network and I, still very frustrated, was relieved to get an actual question, and I was certain it was a trick question trying to get me to say I didn&#x27;t think of it and then he&#x27;d call me an idiot and explain why it was unnecessary. I was really surprised it wasn&#x27;t a trick and frankly a bit delighted at inadvertently insulting him.<p>When I told my wife (well, girlfriend at the time) she was a bit shocked that I&#x27;d been rude to a professor, but I didn&#x27;t need those points and while it was very out of character for me I never regretted it.')
