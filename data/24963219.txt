Please don&#x27;t repeat wrong statements over and over. C++ is in no ways different from Rust in this regard - they all just provide a coroutine transformation and future type, but not a builtin executor. And there is nothing more interoperable about C++ solution than about Rusts.<p>Actually Rust ones might even be better, since there is at least a well-defined interface that executors should follow (through the `Waker` type). The C++ executor interface discussion is probably older than the coroutines proposal, but afaik there still hasn&#x27;t happened any standardization.')
