But created its own storm of them.  However, we backfilled the time that stuff freed up with other things.<p>Usually if scrum is failing is because of a lack of trust.  Someone wants to know every detail of what is going on and will use the only process they have, scrum, to bash it out of you.  They end up backing waterfall into scrum and thinking they are &#x27;agile&#x27;.  I am currently watching a perfectly functioning set of scrum teams being torn down due to a rethinking of what scrum is.  Adding in 20-30 mins more work per story.  Just to get the &#x27;paperwork&#x27; right plus 4 different review processes before a story can be worked on.  That does not sound bad until you realize the org is popping hundreds of stories every 2 weeks.<p>Then toss in &#x27;devops&#x27; where you have no responsibility to change anything but get all of the &#x27;responsibility&#x27; of being yelled at because it is broken.  Hanging out with a pager just incase something breaks.  And it will, usually at 3am on a sunday and the tech support guys just call you without even opening the logs because that is what it says to do in their RTS guide.  But it turns out you need the guys who wrote the code to look at it because they just checked in something 2 weeks ago and the whole thing just went O(N^N^N), and his phone is on mute.  But you have no auth to check anything in or change the machines but the dev does.')
