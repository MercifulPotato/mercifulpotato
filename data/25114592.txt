The big outsourcing trend of the 2000s failed due to a combination of difficulty of managing remote teams effectively and consulting companies padding teams with poor quality workers.<p>I feel like these issues have been alleviated, and the pandemic has served as proof of this.  And if you&#x27;re okay with hiring a remote person in Burlington, Vermont, it&#x27;s not a stretch to include candidates from Sherbrooke, Quebec.  Once you do that, hiring someone from Santiago, Chile isn&#x27;t so much different.<p>If that happens, then I&#x27;m going to guess that these remote workers won&#x27;t stick around for the pay cuts.  They will move back to the economic centers they migrated away from in hopes of the higher wages they left behind (assuming they are still available).')
