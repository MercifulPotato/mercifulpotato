There are reports of Teams taking <i>dozens of gigabytes of RAM</i> --- that&#x27;s just not something you would see with a native application with the equivalent functionality, unless it was written extremely horribly. Dozens of MB is a comfortable amount of memory for such an application to use, and the old MSN Messenger (native! with many third-party clients too!) was in that ballpark. Remember that Skype used to have a native Linux client too. Microsoft is a <i>huge</i> company. They can certainly afford it.<p><i>is textbook waste of money.</i><p>So it all comes back to corporate greed. Inflicting a dismal user experience on everyone, for what would be an essentially tiny savings on their end.')
