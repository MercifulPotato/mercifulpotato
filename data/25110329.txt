Beating level 3 is just about capitalizing on the obvious blunders it makes. It feels completely unrewarding.<p>Playing against humans, even significantly stronger ones, is so much more fun and rewarding. It&#x27;s just way more exciting when both sides can capitalize on smaller mistakes, so the game becomes about building and maintaining an advantage. Or setting up a tactic that feels great to pull off.<p>The computers will usually not yield any incremental advances at all (and they won&#x27;t fall for tactics) until they make a dumb move that invalidates all the advantage they built up. Whether you win or lose depends mainly on how often the latter happens, and learning how to make that happen is both opaque&#x2F;unfun and useless for playing against humans.')
