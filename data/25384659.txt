Item(by='chriswarbo', descendants=None, kids=[25384825], score=None, time=1607687092, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25384298, text='There is a distinction between &quot;constructive&quot; mathematics (AKA &quot;intuitionistic&quot;) and &quot;non-constructive&quot; mathematics (AKA &quot;classical&quot;).<p>In constructive mathematics, the only way to prove that something (e.g. a number) exists is to give an algorithm that constructs it.<p>We can do this in classical mathematics too (roughly speaking, it&#x27;s a super-set of constructive mathematics); but we can also prove that something exists in another way: by disproving that it doesn&#x27;t exist (i.e. a double negative). In other words, classical mathematics lets us use a proof of &#x27;not(not(X))&#x27; as a proof of &#x27;X&#x27;. There are some other ways to express this, which are essentially equivalent; e.g. the &quot;law of the excluded middle&quot; &#x27;for all X, either X is true or not(X) is true&#x27;. These proof steps are not constructive, since knowing that not(X) is false doesn&#x27;t tell us how to actually find&#x2F;construct X. Likewise, the law of the excluded middle is like writing an if&#x2F;then&#x2F;else statement where both branches will arrive at the same result, but it doesn&#x27;t tell us which of those branches to take.<p>We usually talk about <i>proofs</i> being constructive or non-constructive, rather than values (e.g. numbers). A constructivist shouldn&#x27;t agree with a non-constructive proof, but they should agree with an alternative, constructive proof of the same result.<p>The interesting philosophical question being made here is: if a value&#x27;s existence can <i>only</i> be proved non-constructively, should constructivists disbelieve in that <i>value</i>? In this case that value is the busy-beaver function: it can&#x27;t be defined constructively, since no algorithm can decide the halting problem.')
