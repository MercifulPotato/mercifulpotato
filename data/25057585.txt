Item(by='a_imho', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605095500, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25057460, text='Yes. I claim it is textbook weasel wording. Which <i>to me</i> sends the opposite message. Call it illogical if you will.<p>No, the statement can be true and does not support the title. Say we have X AI offered goods and Y traditional promotions where |X| &gt;&gt; |Y|. Then it is not surprising more people buy AI offered goods. The statement remains true, but not what it wants to imply. Also we do not know other factors about the goods, say Xs are popular while Ys are not, they are not controlled for. Literally apples to oranges.')
