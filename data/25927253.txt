In 2008 on Ubuntu 8.04 it was the last time I didn&#x27;t have any video tearing. I used every lts ever since. When I recently upgraded to 20.04 it replaced existing vertical tearing with brand new diagonal tearing which is even worse. The whole system is more complex every year and install requires more tweaking in every new generation.<p>OS&#x27; only job should be to let use ran apps and every year they find a way to make it more annoying.')
