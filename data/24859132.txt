Especially if they are making the numbers pretty like Tesla does.\nEven the fastest at home charger you can buy will take ~22 hours to charge the vehicle, or more like 18 hours if you do standard 20% to 80% charging. If you daily drive this thing 300 miles a week, you will need to charge it for almost an entire day of that week. Let&#x27;s take 40 miles a day as an example, it will need a charge by Saturday, and it will basically charge all the way until late Sunday...<p>The 800v charger they are referencing has no network, I cannot even find one in the entire state of Florida. This thing is years out from being practical, where as a Tesla is practical today.')
