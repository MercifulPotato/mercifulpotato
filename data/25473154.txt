What&#x27;s the end goal? I just want to rid myself of Whatsapp and Telegram, is that even a valid use case for the Matrix system anymore? Should I start looking in other directions?</i><p>XMPP isn&#x27;t dead at all.  OMEMO offers all the benefits of Signal&#x27;s double-ratchet encryption and it&#x27;s supported by at least one good client on every platform.  Both ejabberd and Prosody are actively maintained servers, and there are still over a hundred XMPP hosts with open public registration.  [And countless other hosts that aren&#x27;t public.]<p>And it&#x27;s way way way faster than Matrix.  The servers are lightweight and don&#x27;t require tens of GB of RAM, and the modern clients (like Dino and Conversations.im) are quick and snappy.')
