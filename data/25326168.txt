Item(by='jonahx', descendants=None, kids=[25326310], score=None, time=1607284852, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25326071, text='&gt; I tried my hand at making some back bets by hand using the terminal programme I made illustrated in [2], and no bets were matched.<p>&gt; Now the problem is to figure out how to, given the exact odds for each outcome, successfully lay all outcomes. This involves ensuring the correct amount of money is matched for each outcome.<p>I must be still missing something... If no one is matching bets, why would figuring out how to &quot;successfully lay all outcomes&quot; change that?  At some point don&#x27;t you need a &quot;sucker&quot;, no matter how many outcomes you lay?')
