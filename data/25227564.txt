Item(by='vertis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606474668, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25227381, text='Agreed if he didn&#x27;t use style.<p>On the flip side though, there is difference between the different Parmesan cheeses, so potentially he was trying to be accurate.<p>It really depends on whether people are going to YouTube and searching &#x27;How to make Grana Padano&#x27; or just happening across the video and clicking in, and at that point how much difference the work Grana Padano has to Parmesan in terms of whether people would watch it. I don&#x27;t know the answer to that.<p>I&#x27;m in favour of protecting origin terms, but it really should apply to the sale of items rather than home hobbies. Sure this guy is potentially making money adjacent to that by explaining HOW to do the hobby, but he&#x27;s not making and selling Grana Padano (I haven&#x27;t watched his channel before, so correct me if wrong).')
