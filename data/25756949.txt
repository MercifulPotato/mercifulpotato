Some are reliable and some are unreliable.<p>For the ones that are reliable (like Abbott&#x27;s test), they are highly accurate at determining whether someone is <i>currently infectious</i>. So you could have been infected but not capable of transmitting to others yet. These tests would be highly useful for onsite testing, such as if airlines required a rapid test right at the airport.')
