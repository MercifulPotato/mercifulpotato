So right now where I live, healthcare workers and people 65+ can get the vaccine and it looks like it&#x27;ll be another month before they add more eligibility. Perhaps you would open up another lane to say, frontline workers (retail, teachers, etc.) so they can get the J&amp;J vaccine right now or wait until the eligibility for the mRNA vaccine gets relaxed to them. Upside is this gets the most at-risk individuals access to significant protection the quickest. Downside is that forego &quot;really good&quot; protection for &quot;amazing&quot; protection and get sick while they&#x27;re waiting.')
