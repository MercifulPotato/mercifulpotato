The main problem is that you have to remember to delete them after reading them.  That&#x27;s not really a problem for good articles you remember reading, but the crap articles you don&#x27;t remember, or quit reading are easy to forget to delete from the bookmarks.  So, you end up reading the same crap articles several times.  With a tab, you close the window and you&#x27;re done.  With bookmarks, you have to close the window, go through your bookmarks, find the one that was crap that you have already forgotten and delete it.<p>There&#x27;s several other advantages to tabs too:<p>Like the fact that they&#x27;re naturally organized by window based on the task you&#x27;re doing.<p>You&#x27;ll see them more often, and thus be reminded more often.<p>They save context, like forwards and back history, and information you may have typed in, or a UI you may have manipulated.')
