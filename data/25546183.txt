This high rate of mutation comes from the lack of proofreading ability in RNA polymerases. These enzymes make mistakes, but they can’t correct them. Therefore the mutations remain in the newly synthesized RNA.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.virology.ws&#x2F;2009&#x2F;05&#x2F;10&#x2F;the-error-prone-ways-of-rna-synthesis&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.virology.ws&#x2F;2009&#x2F;05&#x2F;10&#x2F;the-error-prone-ways-of-r...</a>')
