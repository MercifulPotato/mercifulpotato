This high rate of mutation comes from the lack of proofreading ability in RNA polymerases. These enzymes make mistakes, but they can’t correct them. Therefore the mutations remain in the newly synthesized RNA.&quot; [0]<p>none of these error prone generated mutations are surprising, they are to be expected espescially when the virus is given opportunity to replicate at a high cyle rate.\nthis is very much not a surprise, if you are aware of the properties of +ssRNA virus.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.virology.ws&#x2F;2009&#x2F;05&#x2F;10&#x2F;the-error-prone-ways-of-rna-synthesis&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.virology.ws&#x2F;2009&#x2F;05&#x2F;10&#x2F;the-error-prone-ways-of-r...</a><p>you may find this interesting[1] however this is primarily post polymerization [RNA readout] modification mechanism not error correction.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;103&#x2F;13&#x2F;5108" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;103&#x2F;13&#x2F;5108</a>')
