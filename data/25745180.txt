They just see their development team as a huge cost that needs to be reduced. Or they have trouble hiring locally.<p>When the daily rate of developers overseas is substantially lower, the company also doesn&#x27;t care about those developers. They will want to outsource the least creative and satisfying work to them. They want to just fire and forget: &quot;here&#x27;s the spec, go and build it&quot;. Lower productivity is less of an issue if the &quot;resources&quot; are cheap. I&#x27;m over simplifying and I&#x27;m sure some companies try to work more in equal partnership but you get the picture.<p>Also, the move to outsourcing is often done suddenly; it&#x27;s more like wielding an axe than an organic growth or shift in development model. Companies don&#x27;t tend to invest in overseas developers as individuals.<p>In my view it&#x27;s not great for either set of developers, or for the customers of that company. Perhaps when done right it can be more beneficial and I hope things will improve overall.')
