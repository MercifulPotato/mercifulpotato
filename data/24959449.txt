Most cancellations are of moderates.<p>JK Rowling&#x27;s view that Women, and Men who transition to women, while they should have &#x27;equal rights&#x27; - are not the same thing, that there is a difference and that difference should be respected - got her cancelled. They are out for here in droves.<p>This is a mainstream view and probably extremely popular.<p>In fact, outside of hyperbolic politics I&#x27;ll be basically anyone that even accepts &#x27;trans folks&#x27; (because a lot of people wouldn&#x27;t in the first places) actually feels that way.<p>The movement to &#x27;erase&#x27; any possible difference that people might view Women&#x2F;Trans Women differently is rooted I think in a really emotional, almost child-like concern&#x2F;anger&#x2F;will to &#x27;defend rights!!!&#x27; in such a way that anyone who disagrees must be destroyed, without conceding some probable, basic realities.<p>I actually think that in a more calm, moderate, less hyperbolic situation, nobody would want to cancel her. It&#x27;s the aggressive voice of less than 0.1% on the fringe who&#x27;ve internalized a lot of their academic views into emotional one&#x27;s.<p>They tried to cancel Steven Pinker recently for suggesting, that according to the science, Americans are more generally subject to quite a bit more police aggression overall, and that though Black people to face disproportionate ire, that the problem is more general and widespread whereupon Black people have an acute situation.<p>Which personally always felt was the case, and absolutely nobody is willing to say it.<p>Put in other words, he almost said, in an academic kind of way that &#x27;All Lives Matter&#x27; i.e. police aggression is more or less a general problem, not just a Black problem.<p>For this there were signatories, back room pushes etc. to cancel him. Fortunately, he&#x27;s respected enough that he didn&#x27;t have to worry but any &#x27;less famous&#x27; prof. would have been destroyed.<p>This is again similar to JK Rowling in that a very basic, factual and what should be &#x27;not even controversial opinion&#x27; gets you in a lot of trouble.<p>Almost ironically, during a CBC interview, Pinker spoke politely at length about the issues and used soft language to refer to the &#x27;more extreme&#x27; on the left - but hilariously he used the language &#x27;Social Marxist&#x27; which is almost identical to the term &#x27;Cultural Marxist&#x27; (a derogatory term coined apparently by some bad person). It&#x27;s funny because the logic of the terminology, which is to say that while Marx spoke about &#x27;class struggle&#x27;, the &#x27;Social Marxists&#x27; (Pinker&#x27;s words) use the same language but for race, gender etc.. If Pinker would have been anyone else, on a US outlet and had used slightly different words, he would have been publicly pilloried. It&#x27;s funny how that works.<p>The fact that even Steven Pinker has come to the very obvious conclusion that this is very similar ideology but instead of &#x27;class&#x27; you have &#x27;race&#x27; or &#x27;gender&#x27; - but that literally using any terminology to reflect that could get you in hot water, is Orwellian.<p>Imagine if the Nazis made a rule to suggest that <i>any reference to the existence of Nazism or the power of the government will be met with prison or death</i>. People all running around in that totalitarianism without even the language to point to said totalitarianism. It&#x27;s probably the most &#x27;Orwellian&#x27; of all &#x27;Orwellian&#x27; concepts.<p>There is an interesting historical parallel during the Weimar republic, the German Communist Party (KPD) hated the &#x27;centre left&#x27; socialists (i.e. people like Rowling, Pinker) more than anyone.<p>&quot;The party directed most of its attacks against the Social Democratic Party of Germany, which it regarded as its main adversary and referred to as &quot;social fascists&quot;; the KPD considered all other parties in the Weimar Republic to be &#x27;fascists&#x27;.&quot;<p>Literally anyone &#x27;less Communist&#x27; than them, was a &#x27;fascist&#x27; and subject of most of their ire.<p>Actually, this is not even &#x27;parallel&#x27; - this is the the same social response being played out.<p>There are surely some &#x27;Real American Nazis&#x27; who feel the same way, but I don&#x27;t think anyone actually supports them, they have no power at all, whereas the &#x27;Social Cancellers&#x27; have control over academia, a powerful wing in Congress, and weirdly enough extensive influence in the board room and are now trying to drive corporate social policy with some success which I think is due to the fact there&#x27;s a lot of mostly good intention there, hard to separate from the more radical stuff.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Communist_Party_of_Germany" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Communist_Party_of_Germany</a>')
