It can not be &quot;taken home&quot; or downloaded or whatever, for confidentially reasons. Similarly, if you work in a trial you can not have any direct contact with patients.<p>A trial involves administering a substance and then recording its efficacy by examining certain parameters (lab results, images, a questionnaire etc). Someone from the pharma company has to look at these results and then check the patient medical data to make sure there&#x27;s no unrelated conditions that could have influenced that data (this was my job for a few years).<p>The company will have lab results with numbers instead of names and in a blind study, the treatment they received will be unknown to the company until it&#x27;s &quot;unblinded&quot; at the end of the trial, which is usually done by an external company.')
