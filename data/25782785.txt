E.g. Tcl works very well together with sqlite and with its own toolkit Tk. This makes it the perfect tool to build platform independent database user interfaces. The &quot;everything is a string&quot; philosophy makes it also the perfect candidate to make simple user interfaces for command line programs. Gitk is such an example. Would you use tcl to create a new browser, a large website or any type of large project? Obviously not.')
