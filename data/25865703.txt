It seems unlikely that you can skirt their AUP terms by constructing a service that makes it impossible for you to comply with their terms.<p>Amazon can enforce their contracts selectively. The contract isn&#x27;t a statute; it&#x27;s an agreement between two parties. Amazon could presumably strike up a side agreement with a customer that overrode the &quot;master&quot; contract. I&#x27;m not a lawyer, but stuff like that happens in consulting somewhat regularly, where you have an MSA governing all your projects, and specific contracts for weird projects.')
