Is she to be the first female VP? Or does &#x27;highest ranking woman&#x27; refer to her present position in the senate?<p>I think I understand now that it&#x27;s the former. It just seems strange to me to lead with the <i>more</i> specific &#x27;firsts&#x27;. I would have written something more like:<p>&gt; Kamala Harris also makes history as the first female Vice President, and, notably at a time when the US faces a reckoning in racial justice, a black woman, and the first of South Asian descent.<p>(Borrowing phrasing and emphasis from the original nevertheless, since I understand they may be more relevant in the US than they perhaps are to me.)<p>I just honestly didn&#x27;t realise from that paragraph originally that she was the first woman entirely. It was sort of there, but so hidden that I thought I was wrong.')
