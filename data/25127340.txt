The centralized model is better for companies, but ClearCase really makes its best to make your life miserable:<p>- You have to think twice before modifying a file, because the steps to be able to modify a file can take from 30 seconds (if you already created the activity) to a few minutes (if you have to create it)<p>- Activities are supposed to be like branches, summing up all the changes. But there is no way to see all changes in one go. It&#x27;s click everywhere, waiting for the server to reply on each click.<p>- Because there is no way to display the branch content in any way other than envisioned by IBM, there is no way to discuss a changeset. No pull requests, no exchange, nothing.<p>- Horrible UI&#x2F;UX all around. It&#x27;s slow, it&#x27;s unreadable, random bugs happen all the time where the only fix is to restart the service, .... and it&#x27;s expensive.<p>I&#x27;m not advocating for a system that only works when online (although the fully integrated system of Google does sound good), just that it be architectured around a point of centralization. This is the way I&#x27;d like to use git:<p>- A branch created locally will be synhcronized and visible to everyone by default<p>- A branch that I manually tag as private won&#x27;t, but it will still be saved on the server<p>- A branch that has a conflict between me and someone else will be marked locally in some way (maybe a second branch ?)<p>- Bonus: my working repo and staging area are also synhcronized to the server')
