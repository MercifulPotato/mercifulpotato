A newcomer to the language has to deal with error handling right away, long before you need to know about either `Box` or `dyn`.<p>I sort of wish there was some official `Outcome` type defined as an alias of `Result&lt;T, Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;&gt;`:<p><pre><code>   fn main() -&gt; OutCome&lt;()&gt; {\n       foo()?;\n       Ok(())\n   }\n</code></pre>\nAnd then all the crates that offer their own `Result` types would have offered an `Outcome` insteaad: `io::Outcome`, `fmt::Outcome`, etc.<p>It&#x27;s not that big a deal, eventually we&#x27;ll all struggle through â€” but `Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;` is a bit confusing at first.')
