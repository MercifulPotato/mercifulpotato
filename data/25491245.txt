In that case you&#x27;d have more to worry about in terms of timing, dataflow, and synchronization. And some platforms might conceivably have analog circuits that play an important role too, although I guess you might be able to abstract that out by trying to create a rough digital functional equivalent even if it isn&#x27;t completely faithful to the behavior of the analog part.')
