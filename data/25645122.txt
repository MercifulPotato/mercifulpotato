I&#x27;m guessing you had the luck of joining a new project, or a company doing very small projects very fast. I personally only know one developer who seems to be able to onboard himself in a week or two, and that&#x27;s in frontend webdev.<p>In my experience, even if all the bureaucracy and ops goes smoothly, any kind of reasonably sized existing project will take weeks to months before one can reach anything approaching full capacity. Learning the structure of the codebase, abstractions used, testing and deployment pipelines, the who&#x27;s who, protocols for dealing with issues and customers, etc. takes a lot of time, and often can&#x27;t easily be batched (i.e. you won&#x27;t learn as much as you need even if you read the codebase end-to-end, you&#x27;ll also be learning as you do your first tasks).<p>I had one experience with one-day-to-full-speed onboarding in the past. That was when I was briefly borrowed to a kind of bottom-feeder software house, whose job was to take garbage projects that were outsourced to <i>way</i> too cheap and unskilled labor, and beating them into something mostly working. At that job, once I got necessary accounts provisioned, it was just one unending stream of pushing items on a Kanban board at high velocity. You didn&#x27;t have to own anything or care about anything, just do the fastest possible change that brings some aspect of a project up to customer&#x27;s spec. Ain&#x27;t particularly proud of that one (though I didn&#x27;t have much of a choice here, their boss was a friend of my boss and needed a favor). Ain&#x27;t something I&#x27;d even consider a proper software job.')
