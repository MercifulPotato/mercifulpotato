Our primary node went down and the cluster didn’t failover to either of the secondaries. We got to sit with our production environment completely offline while staring at two completely functional nodes that we had no ability to use. Even when we managed to get hold of support they also seemed unable to trigger a failover and basically told us to wait for the primary node to come back up. It took 90 minutes in the end and has definitely made us rethink about the future and the control we’ve given over.')
