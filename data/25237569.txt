C is simple enough to create a compiler from scratch in less than a year (as proven by Tiny CC), but sinking your precious time into a behemoth like Rust (or other language-to-rule-em-all with open research problems) is on another level altogether in terms of commitment. As the language hasn&#x27;t finalized, can change at any time, only people with inside knowledge of Rust will be able to work on such projects. Others will have to take a significant risk of their Rust code base becoming obsolete, or Rust simply imploding due to lack of new devs outside the inner circle able to pickup. Which makes Rust an irrational choice in the presence of alternatives.')
