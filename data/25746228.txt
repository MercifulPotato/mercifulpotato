For creative work you can walk through the assets produced and everyone can theoretically see that there is value being created. I believe software development gravitates towards heavy processes mostly because it&#x27;s hard for &quot;decision makers&quot; to accurately gauge good software from bad, or even understand what progress is being made at all.<p>Having more engineers in decision making positions certainly helps, but I think it boils down to whether the organization is set up for trust.')
