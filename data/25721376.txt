Ironically anarchist and antifa groups have always tried to burn down cities where globalists meet, G7 etc. They might have different explanations but in the end it&#x27;s fight for the capital.<p>Corbyn for instance, very much left wing, opposed EU because of all the globalist bankers and buerocrats in Brussels controlling the society, cheap labor bringing down wages.<p>If you&#x27;re a bit older or have better knowledge, then trumps policies are far more similar to someone like Sanders if they really wanted to team up. (I&#x27;m not talking about his speech and the way of saying things)')
