I work in auto finance.\nAbout my company: we finance in the USA and we focus in &quot;sub prime&quot; (aka bad credit), but we are a &quot;full spectrum&quot; lender.<p>Dealerships TOTALLY make money on the financing. In your example, it might be $1000 - it sounds like you have pretty good credit, and the margins are thin there. You should remember that if someone is leaning YOU money, they just want a reliable investment for their portfolio - they&#x27;ll make their money on the next guy.<p>If you are getting &lt;1% offers, that is probably financing from the manufacturer (that is, Toyota Financing is lending money for a Toyota, at a Toyota dealership). These deals are HOT because Toyota Financing&#x27;s #1 job is to sell Toyota&#x27;s - making money is #2 or #3.<p>Also, did you buy a warranty or gap coverage? Cause that is profit for the dealer, too.<p>You probably think you got the &quot;best rate&quot; because you SAW ALL THE OFFERS. Nope. Dealerships see the rate from the bank and can bump it up. Did Wells Fargo offer you 2%, well, let&#x27;s show him 3% and I keep the difference.<p>Also, yup, getting a &quot;direct rate&quot; is difficult. The bank doesn&#x27;t really know the car you are buying, and they might see that you were already approved at the dealership and give you a WORSE rate DELIBERATLY simply to maintain a relationship with the dealership.')
