Item(by='wj', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609359869, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25580637, text='StartOpz (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.startopz.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.startopz.com</a>) is expense reporting, time-off tracking, and what not for small businesses. I had hoped to make it basically a Workday-light. The launch kind of ran into having a second kid and it wasn&#x27;t really something I was passionate about.<p>If I were to do things differently I would maybe refocus it on a niche to start with (e.g. target office managers of a professional firm (law offices, accounting firms)) or really try to focus on remote teams. I had also tossed around the idea of just turning off most of the modules and making it just an expense reporting or just a time-off app. Never did that though.')
