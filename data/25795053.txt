I would think some group of publishers would partner with some micropayment tool. Maybe, you buy a pool of tokens, and if you don&#x27;t have a subscription to a magazine, you can apply a token. I think it would require some cash, management, and connections to create an initial pool of publishers that would make the service viable (ie, I already have 10 subscriptions, so I would need n more that I don&#x27;t want to before I would fund some pool). Because it doesn&#x27;t exist, and seems so obvious, I also expect that it doesn&#x27;t happen for other contractual&#x2F;competitive reasons. But, here&#x27;s hoping some entrepreneur takes it on.')
