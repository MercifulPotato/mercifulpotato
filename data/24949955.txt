Item(by='qchris', descendants=None, kids=[24950564], score=None, time=1604134509, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24946681, text='Maybe it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m not regularly re-building Rust projects with enormous changes, but I very rarely experience the compile time in Rust to be an issue compared with a language like C++ or even a Jupyter notebook that&#x27;s re-evaluating a cell. I usually code with a bottle of water or cup of coffee nearby, and when I hit &#x27;enter&#x27; on the &#x27;cargo build&#x2F;run&#x27; command, I often pick up my cup and take a sip. By the time I&#x27;ve put the mug back down, the compilation is usually over. So I guess the quantum of time when I&#x27;m coding is a sip of coffee, and anything less than the time it takes to do that feels functionally the same to me.<p>Granted, first-time compilation takes a while, but once that&#x27;s taken care of, I don&#x27;t update my toolchain often enough for it to have a noticeable impact on my workflow. I guess if you&#x27;re getting a new nightly build every day and re-compiling everything, that might be a pain, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the root of most people&#x27;s complaints.')
