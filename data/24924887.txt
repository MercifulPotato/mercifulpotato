Sure there are some headed for promotion, but deciding between an average and underperforming manager can be a tougher call. And getting rid of one just means that all their ICs get reassigned to some other manager, but the immediate impact to projects&#x2F;deliverables is probably pretty minimal in the short term at least.')
