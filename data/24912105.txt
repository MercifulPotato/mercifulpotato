Item(by='ajarmst', descendants=None, kids=[24913731, 24913247], score=None, time=1603833901, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24910211, text='I often get irritated when people treat &quot;correlation does not imply causation&quot; as a slam-dunk refutation of a complex argument, although you do rescue yourself from this by shifting to the use of the word &quot;proof&quot;.  In the sense of &quot;logically entails&quot;, or &quot;proves&quot;, then it&#x27;s trivially true that correlation does not imply causation. In the sense of &quot;is evidence supporting&quot;---which is nearly universally (outside of Math and Philosophy departments) the way that the word &quot;implies&quot; is used in English---correlation absolutely implies causation. It&#x27;s a good heuristic for deciding where to focus research dollars, if only to uncover a more complex causal relationship. The absence of correlation is one of the most commonly used proofs in science. Surely its presence can be used as good evidence, if only because we have to operate in a universe where the excluded middle isn&#x27;t self-evident.')
