In the 1980s, I lived in a small town, and my Dad learned that the phone company still offered &quot;party line&quot; service for cheap - you could share a piece of copper with everyone on your street. I guess for most of the 20th century there were social norms about how to ask to use a shared phone line, how to know if a call was for your house instead of for a neighbor&#x27;s house, etc - but by 1980 or so, everybody had household-private lines. So my Dad&#x27;s insight was that he could save some bucks by paying for party-line service and we&#x27;d be the only house using it, so it would be de-facto private. But the side effect was that, since it meant we were using antique hardware at the phone company, it didn&#x27;t support touchtone dialing! So we kept some 1960s-era rotary phones around, and when we got new phones we had to find the little hidden &quot;tone&#x2F;pulse&quot; backwards-compatibility switch on the handsets (and my geeky friends would come over, click the touchtones back on, try to use the phone and say &quot;hey, your phone is broken!&quot; dude, you broke it. Presaging a long career in tech support, I suppose)<p>We had to switch to modern lines after we got a 1200 bps modem. Someone from the phone company called and said &quot;you&#x27;ve connected an electronic device to the party line, that&#x27;s not allowed, &#x27;cause how would your neighbors let you know they need to use the line?&quot; apparently the argument &quot;we&#x27;re the only house on this line!&quot; was not convincing. So touchtones started working, and presumably Southern Bell got to retire the last party line hardware at the switching station.<p>So I&#x27;ve long wanted to do some kind of hacking with a rotary phone! I&#x27;ve seen lots of DIY projects that use analog phones as audio inputs, but they almost never including dialing, so this is exciting to see! I&#x27;ve always assumed you&#x27;d have to build your own pulse-counting circuit, I had no idea there was a commercial option, that&#x27;s kind of mind-blowing, but I suppose they were needed to support old hardware.')
