Heroic efforts from an excellent machine translation stack and a team of quality checkers and editors can help clean it up, but at the end of the day you&#x27;d probably save time and money by just hiring someone fluent in both languages.<p>It&#x27;s always interesting to see research perspectives on this. I think there&#x27;s considerable room for improvement, especially given that current translation tech doesn&#x27;t take into account things like panel layout, horizontal&#x2F;vertical layout of text, different typeface use, hand-written vs. typeset text, and mixed katakana&#x2F;hiragana&#x2F;kanji usage - all things that an author may use to convey tone, implicitly identify the speaker, or add subtext. There are also things with no equivalent in English literature&#x2F;comics whatsoever, like using furigana to attach a second reading (or dual meaning) to a word.<p>I can imagine some of this info eventually being pulled in by built-for-purpose MTL tools if a research group puts in the time and energy to do it - the paper appears to be a couple brief steps in that direction because they&#x27;re feeding in basic information about panel layout and the genders of the people in the panels, but little else. Excited to see what happens in this space even if the idea of even more people trying to translate dense comic prose with Google Translate fills me with dread.<p>EDIT: I should have done more research before posting this... digging into the authors of this paper, two of them are working at a company that is trying to sell this current technology to authors <i>right now</i> despite the fact that it is not adequate for the challenges of translating comics to other languages. How depressing.')
