Item(by='velcro', descendants=None, kids=[24998578], score=None, time=1604489006, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24985817, text='Yes of course there are synonyms in all languages - but I specified &quot;a lot more words&quot;. If you look at the link I included in my first reply under &quot;vocabulary comparison&quot; you&#x27;ll see an example of what I mean. And thats just the biggest one - there are islands in Croatia where I (as a native speaker) might have better luck understanding Czech than the local variants.<p>Don&#x27;t think that undermines my claim at all - they understand the words because they&#x27;re familiar within the slavic language group in general (even though they might be derivations and used or spelled differently). Its like saying Italian&#x2F;Spanish are the same because speakers might understand words between them. With the translation argument - you also of course have to ignore the fact that Serbia writes in cyrillic and Croatia in latin alphabet.')
