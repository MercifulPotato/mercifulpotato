If it does, honor the revocation request. They have at most one business day to revoke. For evidence of actual compromise (e.g. not a first party revocation request) they have 24 hours. Note that the the CARB rules don&#x27;t allow the CA to delay revocation for compromised certs, even if the true owner asks for it.')
