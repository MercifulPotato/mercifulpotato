What they found is evidence that there aren&#x27;t <i>health</i> benefits to the <i>ions themselves</i>, and there are potential harms from the ozone pollution that many of those generators create.<p>But for <i>air filtration</i>, properly working negative ion generators certainly cause particles to leave the air: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=y7QFJgTjzcc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=y7QFJgTjzcc</a><p>The thing is, that means they end up on surfaces near the ion generator. That isn&#x27;t necessarily a good thing. Proper HEPA filters are more likely to be what you want, as they remove particles entirely, putting them in a filter that can be disposed of.')
