I mean, the alternative is to sit white-knuckled until I die in a food riot. I am well aware of the changes that are coming, and it&#x27;s one of many reasons why I&#x27;m not having kids: I <i>don&#x27;t</i> believe progress will continue like it has (which was always unsustainable, even without deleterious effects on the climate), and I think the future earth will be much harder for humans in the short term. Sure, humanity will probably adapt, but millions of people might die in the process.')
