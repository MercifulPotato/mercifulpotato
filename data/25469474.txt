The class was 5 assignments (...)<p>I guess you were unlucky! Teacher from the art department, and a class with only 5 assignments?! Didn&#x27;t your university had a CS department with CS-competent people to substitute? For instance, the CS department of my college has at least 40 teachers, and it&#x27;s a polytechnic school (more like a vocational school than a theoretical university)..<p>What I want to say with this is that maybe your university is also questionable for delivering CS courses like that..')
