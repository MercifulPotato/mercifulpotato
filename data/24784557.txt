Item(by='millstone', descendants=None, kids=[24785870, 24786439, 24784966], score=None, time=1602732075, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24783948, text='GOP is talking big about Section 230 reform, but it is absurd on its face.<p>Prior to Section 230, if you censor ANY content (say, child pornography) then you are &quot;moderating&quot; the discussion and are liable for ALL content. If Twitter deletes a death threat tweet, why didn&#x27;t they delete the defamatory tweet against Hunter Biden or whomever? Biden could sue. So Section 230 allows websites to delete the kiddie porn without becoming a &quot;publisher&quot; of everything that gets posted. Biden can sue the poster but not Twitter.<p>Reforming (weakening) 230 would force Facebook, Twitter, etc. to choose between allowing all content, and blocking anything that could be the basis for a lawsuit. Of course Facebook and Twitter are not going to become an 8chan free-for-all, so they would be forced to crack down harder, censoring much more aggressively.<p>Also far-right sites (e.g. InfoWars) very much do not want increased liability here.<p>So &quot;230 reform&quot; is a useful rallying cry for conservatives who feel censored (rightly or wrongly) by social media giants, but the idea is so obviously bad that I can&#x27;t imagine they&#x27;ll go beyond minor tweaks.')
