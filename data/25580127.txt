Indirect evidence suggests immunity lasts longer, namely the persistently low re-infection rate - since the first wave is so long ago, you&#x27;d assume there was more reinfection by now if immunity lasted just 3 months, right?  But maybe I&#x27;m reading this wrong; do you have a citation to back this surprising estimate?')
