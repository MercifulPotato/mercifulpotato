Item(by='munchbunny', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602940851, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24808257, text='&gt; Do you reboot your machine regularly as a matter of course? I do not. My desktop machine is always up -- except when I am forced to reboot by Microsoft.<p>I don’t either, but also the forced reboots only happen once a month for me, right after patch Tuesdays. I’ve found that setting updates to manual and proactively updating on that day gets rid of almost all forced reboots. Of course now you have an extra thing to remember, but it does generally fix the problem.')
