[3] it’s not as though the batteries suddenly stop working then, they just have less capacity. So 3-5 years of equipment life is not a realistic estimate.<p>Putting 12 hours of battery storage right next to 3 weeks just makes the 12 hours look suspect too. 3 weeks is just crazy numbers from people that haven’t studied the problem much. Most zero carbon grid modeling selects far far less than 12 hours of battery storage.<p>But even if we stick with that 12 hours of world energy of batteries, 60 TWh is only 5x more than the 12 TWh of US energy. I apologize for misinterpreting your stats and being off by 5 in the comparison of numbers, but a 5x or 10x or even 100x growth is well within the range of sustained exponential growth.<p>As grid storage plus solar becomes cheaper than natural gas, we will hit an inflection point that will drive massive expansion of battery storage production capacity, even beyond what is currently being built for EVs.<p>Will there be a massive interchange of technologies and production capacities. Yes, it will be huge, so from one perspective we are a long ways away from our target, but from the perspective of our current trajectory and from the perspective of what is currently being planned just for EVs, an entire industry is being built. It will take a little while for energy guys to wake up to this new reality because they are a slow changing industry, but they will be brought along for the ride whether they know it now or not. There’s a good reason that NextEra surpassed the market cap of Exxon recently, as the market is finally waking up to the new reality too.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.utilitydive.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;inside-construction-of-the-worlds-largest-lithium-ion-battery-storage-faci&#x2F;431765&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.utilitydive.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;inside-construction-of-the-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesla.com&#x2F;powerwall" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesla.com&#x2F;powerwall</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hornsdalepowerreserve.com.au&#x2F;faqs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hornsdalepowerreserve.com.au&#x2F;faqs&#x2F;</a>')
