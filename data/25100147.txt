The punishment is meaningful, but hardly life or career changing. Just because something has been said in rap lyrics does not mean it&#x27;s OK to say in all contexts. Do you know the context and what she said? Surely it&#x27;s conceivable that what she said really was harmful to community. Consider why free speech exists: to protect public debate and essentially hold up the light of transparency to power - clearly there&#x27;s no trivially obvious line to draw that will protect only that speech, nor a trivially obvious line to draw that will protect all non-harmful speech. So when a society, in a healthy debate not too different to the one we&#x27;re having now chooses to draw the line somewhere between those too extremes: that&#x27;s just fine.  Personally, I think the US protects speech that simply undermines society (and the US), and that doing so is at worst self-destructive, and at best irrelevant. Yes, we need to protect speech - but we don&#x27;t need to pretend the line between constructive speech and hate speech is terribly subtle, nor that there is going to be some kind of chilling effect from rules like this.  Do you feel threatened by this court outcome?  No, right?<p>I do agree that some of the laws are bad, for instance the law in Germany that protected Turkish politicians from well-deserved criticism.  As I hear it, they think that in Germany too: this law isn&#x27;t some new development by thought-controller wannabe&#x27;s, it&#x27;s a bad law on the books that&#x27;s rarely enforced and that&#x27;s quite-old; pre WW2. Put in on the pile of failings of the Weimar republic. It&#x27;s not a small pile.<p>Regardless, though bad laws should be repealed the larger point stands: these countries have not devolved into Orwellian nightmares. If anything, the real threat isn&#x27;t Orwell&#x27;s 1984, it&#x27;s A Brave New World: a populace that <i>chooses</i> to close its eyes to the truth by simple social feedback loops that reinforce groupthink as opposed to critical examination. If you like literary references, we need to remove our machine-learned equivalent&#x27;s of Dr. Strangelove&#x27;s CRM 114 discriminators. To protect discourse, we need to shape the environment it happens in to steer those feedback loops away from outrage-inducing echo chambers that filter our perception of the world to distinguish us from politically others -and instead towards truth-enhancing critical thought.  Ideally, all without a central, abusable source of power: sure!  But the alternative shouldn&#x27;t be that we&#x27;re all forced to inhabit balkanized bubbles of media, carefully curated to be free of all of those pesky facts that might undermine a firmly held opinion.')
