Or do you disagree with it on moral grounds?<p>I mean, &#x27;we&#x27; (as in &#x27;the west&#x27;) try to deplatform Jihad based terrorism. I think it&#x27;s a pretty effective strategy, just not complete. Why should we _not_ deplatform far right white supremacy violence and terror?<p>Of course you also need a deradicalization approach, but that doesn&#x27;t scale to the current levels of extremism. We need to stop this massive rise of fascist violence rooted in conspiracy thinking from spreading, which was amplified by social media in the first place, only then can a targeted deradicalization approach be effective.')
