Generally be able to produce working, maintainable application.<p>In Clojure (and other Lisps) this absolutely requires you to be able to structure application.<p>If you use other languages, the frameworks that are there do the work of structuring for you. That&#x27;s why when you are Java developer, every web app largely looks the same. That&#x27;s because you don&#x27;t actually structure application, as much as use structure that is offered with Spring ecosystem.')
