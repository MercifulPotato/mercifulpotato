Item(by='jbergens', descendants=None, kids=[24696048], score=None, time=1601974431, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24695150, text='&gt; But I agree. .NET will not replace Java or any other serious language.<p>I think you have to specify a domain to make that statement reasonable. \nI think .NET is used more than Go for example. Maybe more than NodeJs also for server systems. Less than Java. If we compare to C++ it is very much down to domains. I don&#x27;t hear about many enterprises using C++ for server backend code but of course they exist. And so on. .NET (or C#) may already be &quot;leading&quot; against a lot of other languages and then the question is if the others will replace C# or not. And if it will take some of the market from languages like Java which I think it will but not all.')
