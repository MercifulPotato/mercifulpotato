It seems criminal to create your own Dockerfile just to develop the business logic of a lambda where you only use that Dockerfile for development.<p>Then there&#x27;s the whole problem of running your split out business logic without it being triggered from a lambda. Do you just write boiler plate scripts that read the same JSON files, and set up command line parsing code in the same way as sam local invoke does to pass in params?<p>Then there&#x27;s also the problem of wanting one of your non-Serverless services to invoke a lambda in development so you can actually test what happens when you call it in your main web app but instead of calling sam local invoke, you really want that service&#x27;s code to be more like how it would run in production where it&#x27;s triggered by an SNS publish message. Now you need to somehow figure out how to mock out SNS in development.<p>Serverless is madness from start to finish.')
