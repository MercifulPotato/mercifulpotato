Instead, we effectively were &quot;pre-announcing&quot; that some future advanced features (yet to be developed) would instead be released under the Timescale License or under a paid-only commercial license (although still source-available).<p>Fast forward to September 2020 and Timescale 2.0, and we (i) made some aspects of the Timescale License <i>more</i> permissive (e.g., &quot;right to repair&quot;, &quot;right to improve&quot;), and (ii) moved all the previously enterprise (paid-only) features to be available for free under the Timescale License.
