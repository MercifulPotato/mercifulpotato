TypeScript correctly infers that type of the variable is a Proxy for a Date object. If you do not supply a Date object as first argument, the code won&#x27;t compile.<p>The part that breaks things is that when f invokes a.getDate(), the Proxy get trap changes will return another function instead of Date#getDate at runtime, and that wasn&#x27;t validated at compile time.')
