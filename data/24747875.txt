And to make it working on a global scale is much more effort as the data quality in OSM and how addressing works can be very different for the different countries.<p>BTW: we also provide our own geocoding which is based on photon an open source geocoding projects where we also invest, additionally to financially supporting the &#x27;main&#x27; OpenStreetMap geocoder Nominatim project.')
