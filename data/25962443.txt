Item(by='dragontamer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611953831, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25962275, text='&gt; GPUs don&#x27;t need to have SIMD instructions;<p>Except NVidia Ampere (RTX 3xxx series) and AMD RDNA2 (Navi &#x2F; 6xxx series) are both SIMD architectures with SIMD-instructions.<p>And the #3 company: Intel, also has SIMD instructions. I know that some GPUs out there are VLIW or other weird architectures, but... the &quot;big 3&quot; are SIMD-based.<p>&gt;  if you give one a fully scalar program it just needs to run a lot of copies of it at once.<p>Its emulated on a SIMD processor. That SIMD processor will suffer branch-divergence as you traverse through if-statements and while-statements, because its physically SIMD.<p>The compiler &#x2F; programming model is scalar. But the assembly instructions are themselves vector. Yeah, NVidia now has per-SIMD core instruction pointers. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that the hardware can physically execute different instructions: they&#x27;re still all locked together with SIMD-style at the physical level.')
