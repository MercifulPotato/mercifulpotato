Item(by='twblalock', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607925062, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25413928, text='&gt; Clearly written by someone who hasn&#x27;t ridden a bike since childhood.<p>Try again. I know when the last time I rode a bike was. You don&#x27;t. Hint: it was quite recent.<p>Condescension reeks throughout your entire post. You are wrong about who I am, you are wrong about my bicycling habits, and you are also wrong about how realistic it is for me to ride my bike to work. Yet you think you are in a position to dictate to me what I ought to be doing.<p>This is typical of bicycle-commuting advocates and it is the reason you are a fringe minority.<p>&gt; As for how people have responded to the pandemic, more have turned to bikes than cars. Car prices are always being hiked, that&#x27;s the whole reason manufacturers are pushing SUVs: same chassis, same engine, higher price, free profit.<p>Explain how this applies to <i>used cars</i> which is what I mentioned in my post. Of course you won&#x27;t, because you have already put on your ideological blinkers and ranted about manufacturers pushing <i>new SUVs</i>, which I never mentioned. Instead, please explain why <i>used cars</i> are up in price compared to a year ago.')
