Political parties are, at core, freedom of association: you and I agree to put our differences aside in support of the things we overlap on. I&#x27;ll support your things if you support mine, and we&#x27;ll both oppose the others. Once we reach 50% of the people to make that bargain, we&#x27;ll win everything.<p>Subverting that isn&#x27;t easy without giving up something that seems necessary. You can eliminate majority rules. You can eliminate freedom of association. You can eliminate voting. Even term limits don&#x27;t help: you can eliminate the politician but not their constituents, who will find somebody equivalent to send.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s impossible, but it&#x27;s not as simple as &quot;eliminate political parties&quot;. Even if you could wish them away with a magic wand, they&#x27;d come right back.')
