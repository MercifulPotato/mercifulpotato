Systems like these also often have multiple embedded feedback loops in them, which can make it impossible to identify a single cause once the flywheel gets going.<p>It&#x27;s when you <i>combine</i> the USDT&#x2F;BTC correlation with the available evidence for Tether&#x27;s unbacked issuance that the problem becomes clearer, in my view. When issuance is unbacked, it can be decoupled from real demand — and that&#x27;s a degree of freedom that <i>allows</i> Tethers to be injected arbitrarily into the system. Coinbase&#x27;s stablecoin is backed by audited reserves, so USDC is constrained by demand — making it more plausible that USDT is the causal factor rather than USDC.')
