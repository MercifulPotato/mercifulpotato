I almost always worked as an employee of a technical contractor---I was an IRS W-2 employee; they withheld taxes and provided (sometimes decent) health benefits (although I decided it was better to buy my own rather than changing insurance when I moved). I had no more than the usual accounting and organizational challenges.<p>For me, getting into it was easy. I packed off a resume to several of the local contracting companies. They pass the resumes to the ultimate company, who will do an interview (usually very low stress because it&#x27;s easy to get rid of you) and then the contracting company and the employer work out all the details. (It may have changed, but at the time of my last such deal about 2005, the contracting company absorbed about 15% of what the end company was paying for you.)<p>Do realize that you need to keep at least 6-9 months of your income in a readily accessible account (savings, money market, or (whoo, I&#x27;m old) CD). I never went for more than a week before I could another job, but I have known people who had more trouble.<p>I have since gone into federal government contracting, which is another whole bag of stinky fish heads.')
