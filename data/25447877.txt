Very much like the smart phone and smart watch and tablet it will be a toy for techies until a company with real design chops and solid software&#x2F;hardware gets behind it. I also believe that Apple is the most likely to be that company, solid design and a well liked ecosystem, plus a proven history at creating&#x2F;shaping new consumer tech device markets.
