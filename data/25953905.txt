The dollar is being devalued<p>I don&#x27;t follow. Could you explain? If the dollar is losing value, then wouldn&#x27;t interest rates &quot;really&quot; be lower than they&#x27;d appear to be without accounting for the devaluation? Here&#x27;s my reasoning:<p>Imagine the dollar loses 50% of its value in the next year. You park $100 in a 1% APY 12 month CD today. After a year, you&#x27;ve earned $1 in interest. But your CD has actually lost value in that time, even accounting for the interest money the bank gave you. In real terms, the interest rate was less than 1%; in fact, it was negative! So the 1% interest rate appeared higher than it &quot;really&quot; was.')
