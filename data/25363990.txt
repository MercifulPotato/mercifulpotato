If they don&#x27;t have a system already in place to issue these, I think it&#x27;s unlikely they will be able to roll it out at this point.<p>Basically, I&#x27;ll believe it when I see it. To me it seems like a very hard thing to enforce and implement. I suspect the companies are more interested in &quot;security theater&quot; to facilitate normal business operations as soon as possible than actually excluding people who haven&#x27;t been vaccinated.')
