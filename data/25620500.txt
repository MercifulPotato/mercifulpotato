Across apps on the same device you use OAuth essentially. Across devices you scan QR codes to authenticate other sessions and grant permissions to them. Keys never leave your device.<p>Your keychain would essentially be a small blockchain that is decrypted on clients (think Keybase). You could remember one password, and send the rest using Shamir Secret Sharing to N friends. If you ever need to recover your account you have to get M of N friends plus your password. That way if you’re kidnapped you can lock yourself out fo your phone and legitimately claim that M of N friends have to agree to participate.<p>And btw ... phone numbers and even emails will eventually become obsolete, because you will be able to just authorize notifications to the user’s browser or app instead, and receive a client ID which you can use to send notifications - while the user will be able to manage them (unlike email SPAM) and everyone will be able to run their OWN bots to automatically parse notification data and act on it (unlike trusting Google to parse your email so they BBC can extract flight tickets etc).<p>In fact, notification delivery would be encrypted with the user’s public keys, and users may choose not to receive the notifications right away (as this will expose their anonymity to timing attacks, and also makes them dependent upon Apple&#x2F;Google to deliver the “last mile”).<p>And even DNS will become obsolete as we will have non-human-readable addresses for resources on the Web, with DHT replacing federated databases like DNS. People will realize that document metadata (titles, icons) is cached locally or on search engines anyway, and that DNS is just a glorified search engine for root URLs, a tiny subset of URLs.<p>The result: no central servers, no domains, no cookies and no accounts. Just cryptocurrency paying for use of resources. People’s contacts in this new system would essentially contain resources on some DHT. People would choose whether to prove to their contacts they control private keys A and B,  instead of having Telegram or Facebook announce that their friend joined. It would be totally decentralized and users would be in control.<p>Prediction for 2040')
