But if you’re trying to build and launch a web app, you have to know a little bit about a lot of things.<p>It’s hard to know where to start.<p>My goal with BugTracker is twofold:<p>1. Cover all the topics you need to know to build, deploy, and optimize your own SaaS app<p>2. Build reusable components so you don’t have to repeatedly reinvent the wheel as you go.<p>It’s built with my preferred tech stack of Ruby on Rails, Sass, and Bootstrap.<p>What features or general topics would you like to see covered next?<p>Any and all feedback is welcome!')
