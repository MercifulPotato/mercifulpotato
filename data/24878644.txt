This site is based around such as notion. Statements from a group member carry more weight and you can speak to shared ideals. It doesn’t mean your statement can’t apply to others either. Similar things were said about the other media you list but one can’t deny that there are both qualitative and quantitative differences between those media. The danger I think lies in the replacement of human interaction and is proportional to the amount of time consumed.')
