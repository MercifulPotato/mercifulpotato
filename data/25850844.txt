Item(by='masklinn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611171118, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25848625, text='&gt; Apple introduced a translation cache that likely removes this overhead completely for most applications but it does not work for code that is output by a JIT. With the native build, this second translation is avoided completely and weâ€™re back to having a snappy browser.<p>Indeed while Rosetta does have support for JITs (which is really impressive in and of itself), every piece of machine code generated by the JIT has to be translated on the fly.<p>While the hiccup at the initial run is not too costly &#x2F; annoying for a regular application being AOT-compiled in its entirety and Apple can then shove the result somewhere nearby, for a JIT it&#x27;s basically constant, continuous overhead which can&#x27;t be cached because it won&#x27;t be around next run. I&#x27;m not surprised that the gains are significant there.')
