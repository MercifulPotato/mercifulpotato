I see, perhaps, a call for more empiricism in certain fields, and a call for recognition of our society and it&#x27;s flaws, and how those flaws may extend into systems embedded within our society, such as the scientific community and our educational system.<p>I mean, it&#x27;s clear you agree with some of these criticisms: in the same post you staunchly defend science as, presumably a source of everything productive, but criticize &quot;academia&quot;. Yet how do you propose to differentiate between the two? You&#x27;re both criticizing different parts of the social system scientific discourse is embedded in. What makes the other criticism inherently invalid?<p>&gt; The end of this line of thinking is to destroy mathematical education and leave children ignorant<p>I want to call out specifically that there is <i>absolutely</i> nothing you&#x27;ve quoted that supports this claim.')
