What I was saying is that none of that shall be allowed once a power of attorney has been given to a tool (obviously unless the website access is paid, then it&#x27;s perfectly fine to charge for API access but then it should be offered on something like FRAND terms). Think of Chrome extensions detected and blocked by some websites, this would not be allowed under my proposal.')
