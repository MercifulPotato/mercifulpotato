Her job is to min&#x2F;max space use, organize for hiring pushes, keep the office space humming, revamp existing space as needed, plan out new space... etc. etc. etc. It&#x27;s an interesting job, she&#x27;s probably the person you&#x27;re pissed at when your desk gets seemingly randomly moved to another floor.<p>Right before COVID, she was managing a HUGE densification project to get more desks in their company&#x27;s current footprint. That obviously got entirely axed March 2020 (over a year of work down the drain), and it&#x27;s been her job the last year to figure out WFH and what post-COVID-19 workspace looks like.<p>The executives are wanting people back in the office. They&#x27;ve seen enough they don&#x27;t like about full WFH that they do want people back in the building at some point when it&#x27;s safe. But they also don&#x27;t want everyone in the building at the same time anymore. Basically, they want to operate the building at pre-pandemic capacity of 50% or so, rotating who is in and who isn&#x27;t.<p>With that comes some unique space challenges, including but not limited to how does having a desk work if only 50% of people are in the office on a given day. They haven&#x27;t chosen a final solution yet as there are A LOT of moving pieces, but it has been interesting to watch.')
