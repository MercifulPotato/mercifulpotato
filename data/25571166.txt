Assuming that one doesn’t have issues with firearm ownership in general, then there doesn’t seem to be anything fundamentally wrong with someone collecting a large number of firearms. You might find it odd, but there doesn’t seem to be a social level difference between someone owning a handgun and someone collecting them. (Correct me if someone can show a link between number of guns owned and violence).<p>There <i>is</i> a major difference between someone averaging a drink every other day or so, and someone having 10 drinks a day. The latter group is unquestionably addicted, with extremely negative personal and social consequences for that addiction.')
