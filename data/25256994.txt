One I had on Calculus (or was it Linear Algebra?) was way harder than a comparable closed book exam. You really needed to know the subject to pass vs just memorizing a couple of formulas and plugging them in the right place.<p>We&#x27;re discussing this in relation in relation to COVID, so no large gathering. This means no open book in person exams, I&#x27;m specifically talking about take home exams.<p>&gt; Another professor devised an exam that used your student ID as a variable of the first question, and subsequent questions used the previous answers as inputs. Impossible to cheat.<p>Really easy to do so in a take home exam.')
