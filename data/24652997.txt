Our core team has deep domain experience having worked for tier-1 funds (on the discretionary and systematic sides) and at other successful startups prior to starting the company. We launched our services just before the pandemic but have nevertheless seen strong growth and we now count some of the world&#x27;s best funds among our clients. The company is revenue and cash generative with a very strong balance sheet - we are funding most expansion organically through revenues but, in addition, we have raised a small amount of money from excellent investors and have won a research grant for the coming year.<p>As a result of the demand we have experienced in the last six months and our strong current pipeline we&#x27;re looking to scale up our operations as quickly as possible by hiring or contracting a mid-level&#x2F;senior full stack engineer.<p>Our tech stack:<p><pre><code>  * Python  \n  * AWS (EC2, S3)  \n  * Flask  \n  * React\n</code></pre>\nWe also use the Ray framework for parallel compute, which is pretty cool.<p>We are a small company (only 3 full time employees) and we are genuinely passionate about our space and finance more widely. If you have an interest in finance (in whatever form) and want to experience developing and improving products for some of the best funds in the world, we think you would enjoy working with us. We are an early stage company and that means everything you do will have immediate and lasting impact on the business: you will be able to work on a wide variety of projects, with real ownership of core elements and very little management overheads to deal with. We are positioned as the highest quality provider in our space and this focus on quality runs through our entire culture - we really enjoy our work and spending time with colleagues but our environment is a professional and respectful one.<p>If all this sounds like a good fit for what you&#x27;re looking for, shoot us an email at bogdan@fdb.systems with a resume and, optionally, any projects you are happy to share.<p>Owing to a grant helping fund the development of our products, we can only consider applicants who can be hired as PAYE-registered employees. (i.e. who have previously worked in the UK)')
