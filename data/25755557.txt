At least for now, it&#x27;s really more of a convenience thing when app stores remove apps; limiting the feature set of your product offering to apps only may make sense, but it is an educated risk. If you feel you want the most people to access your content, you make it work on mobile and desktop computers without requiring a specific app store gatekeeper.<p>If you disagree with Apple removing something from an app store, you buy an Android compatible and enable side-loading, or you buy a Linux compatible phone, or if all else fails, you connect through a web site.<p>When I used Windows Phone, it was <i>annoying</i> that I couldn&#x27;t download an app for my bank, <i>inconvenient</i> that I still had to use ATMs to deposit checks.
