I would treat C++ like, say, kind of like a cabinet full of chemicals, rather than like (say) a typical home toolbox. You (hopefully) don&#x27;t just grab containers and mix their chemicals and expect to learn by doing that 5 times a year; you really need to start slowly and take time to learn all the dangerous pitfalls properly, or otherwise expect to be told <i>exactly</i> what to do down to the most minute details. Adequate training for it is simply a prerequisite. C++ is kind of similar in that respect.')
