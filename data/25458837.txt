When wanting to part way, either side has the full right to choose an earlier date.<p>People choose their end date all the time.  That&#x27;s just standard.  Sometimes the company moves a date up, sometimes the two parties negotiate a different date for some reason, sometimes people are fired.<p>If it&#x27;s an at-will employment state, both parties can choose whatever date they like.  But if the employer terminates employment early, that&#x27;s generally a firing.  If an employment does so, we call it quitting.<p>&gt; Let&#x27;s look at a small example. Say I&#x27;ll commit suicide if you go and see your kids today. Now it&#x27;s only one day, and you (as a decent person) will probably skip seeing your kids for one day to save one life.<p>&gt; Now if I say I&#x27;ll quit my job if you go to see your kids today. You would probably say &quot;Then, please quit.&quot;<p>Use whatever analogy works for you, ultimately the point is the same.  Someone can threaten to do something, but if you do it for them it&#x27;s different than if they do it themselves.<p>If someone says &quot;I&#x27;ll quit&quot; and the company disables their badge and security escorts them out, they&#x27;ve been fired.')
