There&#x27;s so much potential for various products that would benefit from having multi-kWh storage capacity available, and this potential will only increase as the cost per kWh drops further.<p>As a case in point, this Slovenian company makes sustainer systems for sailplanes, which is awesome, but their system is limited to two battery packs. I imagine that pack design, form factor and availability is a big limiting factor in projects such as these.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.front-electric-sustainer.com&#x2F;technology.php" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.front-electric-sustainer.com&#x2F;technology.php</a>')
