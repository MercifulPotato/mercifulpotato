Mostly as tests as features get implemented, e.g. live-playing incoming audio, or playing forward through multiple messages at a time, but it&#x27;s kind of addictive so we&#x27;ve ended up just chatting sometimes too.<p>Heysync definitely shares concepts with iMessage&#x27;s audio snippets (or WhatsApp&#x27;s, Signal&#x27;s, etc.), but automatic transcriptions let you decide to read or listen at will.<p>It&#x27;s also different in that it&#x27;s got features similar to IRC or a slack-like, so channels and DMs, markdown and code highlighting support, and soon enough reactions, threads, bots, etc. Beyond that, I&#x27;m also working on adding built-in support for &quot;structured&quot; meetings, like daily standups, because that seems to be a major use case.')
