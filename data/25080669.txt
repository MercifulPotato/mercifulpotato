Now that this has happened, the only comments I see are &quot;heads should roll&quot;, and &quot;we must complain and be heard by high-level execs&quot;, but never &quot;let&#x27;s move away&quot;. This just reinforces my impression of the Apple ecosystem as something akin to a cult: Once you get in, you never get out again.<p>There are good alternatives - many people, including software engineers, use non-apple solutions on a daily basis and they are still productive. Why not give Linux a shot, or <i>gasp</i> even Windows? The age-old argument of &quot;MS is evil, Apple good&quot; is moot. Companies are generally not good or evil, they are profit-oriented. If the market demands privacy, they care about it, otherwise probably not so much.')
