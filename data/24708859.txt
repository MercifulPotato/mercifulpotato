I&#x27;m guessing the larger heatsink is to make sure the console survives long enough to make up for the massive losses this generation. It&#x27;s possible that they need a larger heatsink due to overclocks. Maybe they plan to reuse the same system with an upgraded &quot;pro&quot; chip and wanted to save design and tooling costs. Maybe it&#x27;s just the normal conservative design choice common in Japanese companies.<p>Some interesting room to conjecture.<p>EDIT: 315w for xbox vs 350w for PS4 isn&#x27;t that big of a difference. \nIn any case, massive graphics cards like the GTX480 or those old AMD dual 4xxx&#x2F;5xxx cooled more than 350w with a much smaller heatsink (though in a larger case with better airflow -- though not all of that power goes just to the CPU&#x2F;GPU in the consoles).')
