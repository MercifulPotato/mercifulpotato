Trump hasn&#x27;t really singled out Chinese manufacturers.<p>Second - the populist&#x2F;lazy&#x2F;naive theme here is the supposed belief that &#x27;political bootlicking magically prints money&#x27; - which is ridiculous - businesses have to make money somehow, there are generally no easy&#x2F;magic handouts of this kind.<p>So the bootlicking in this circumstance enabled Foxconn to take on some really nice subsidies (!) but there is no way Foxconn comes out of that in the black without doing something productive. Even if it&#x27;s on the margin.<p>Foxconn blew this, and possibly lost money on this and we can all agree that &#x27;bootlickers&#x27; do not like losing money.<p>Nobody does.<p>Foxconn makes the #1 consumer product on Earth - the iPhone, and that is definitely <i>no joke</i>. There are divisions of Foxconn that are not only <i>not fuckups</i> just the opposite, are world leaders in manufacturing, probably surpassing everyone of their peers, anywhere.<p>So given that 1) bootlicking gets you nice things but not free profits and 2) Foxconn has operationally superior divisions ...<p>... the story runs short.<p>There are just as many question marks as answered questions.<p>Finally, I would say that whatever one thinks of this guy Scott Walker is besides the point - superficially this was probably a reasonable deal. Such subsidies are not uncommon and usually done with credible companies. There was risk obviously but what happened is outlandishly weird. I don&#x27;t think the politicos who made this deal are so much &#x27;to blame&#x27; other than the subsidy thresholds should have been tighter obviously.<p>I would say this is a good example of &#x27;How even good Chinese companies do Business in 2020&#x27; and the results should be on display for bureaucrats and would-be belt-and-roaders everywhere.')
