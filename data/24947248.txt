As a Korean I am deeply offended</i><p>Perhaps, but it&#x27;s still true.<p>This was followed by 13 months of political instability as South Korea was led by a weak and ineffectual government. This instability was broken by the May 16, 1961, coup led by General Park Chung-hee. As president, Park oversaw a period of rapid export-led economic growth enforced by political repression. Park was heavily criticized as a ruthless military dictator, who in 1972 extended his rule by creating a new constitution, which gave the president sweeping (almost dictatorial) powers and permitted him to run for an unlimited number of six-year terms.<p>The years after Park&#x27;s assassination were marked again by political turmoil, as the previously suppressed opposition leaders all campaigned to run for president in the sudden political void. In 1979, General Chun Doo-hwan led the Coup d&#x27;état of December Twelfth. Following the Coup d&#x27;état, Chun Doo-hwan planned to rise to power through several measures. On May 17, Chun Doo-hwan forced the Cabinet to expand martial law to the whole nation, which had previously not applied to the island of Jejudo. The expanded martial law closed universities, banned political activities, and further curtailed the press.<p>Chun and his government held South Korea under a despotic rule until 1987, when a Seoul National University student, Park Jong-chul, was tortured to death.[128] On June 10, the Catholic Priests Association for Justice revealed the incident, igniting the June Democracy Movement around the country.<p>South Korea was formally invited to become a member of the United Nations in 1991. The transition of Korea from autocracy to modern democracy was marked in 1997 by the election of Kim Dae-jung, who was sworn in as the eighth president of South Korea, on February 25, 1998. His election was significant given that he had in earlier years been a political prisoner sentenced to death (later commuted to exile).<p>That&#x27;s just Wikipedia, mind you, not some bizarro source.<p>The citizens fought for democracy, but SK was not exactly a paragon of democracy until well into the late 20th century. And even then it has been problematic:<p>Putting aside the decades of brutal dictatorship that ended with Chun Doo-hwan stepping down in 1988, every South Korean presidency since has been rocked by corruption scandals. Roh Tae-woo collected $10 million per month in slush funds while in office, Kim Young-sam stunned the nation with his pay-for-play Hanbo scandal, Roh Moo-hyun jumped off a cliff while under investigation for bribery, Lee Myung-bak is serving 15 years for corruption, Park Geun-hye is serving 24 years and then there&#x27;s President Moon Jae-in.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;davidvolodzko&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;25&#x2F;is-south-korea-sliding-toward-digital-dictatorship&#x2F;?sh=12b26e21648e" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;davidvolodzko&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;25&#x2F;is-sou...</a>')
