However, the reduced grip strength (admittedly small <i>N</i>) is notable.  If that is a change that occurs on a relative short timescale (i.e., starts when you start cracking your knuckles and stops when you stop), it&#x27;s potentially feasible to study with an RCT.  I bet you could even estimate compliance with knuckle-cracking instructions using something like a FitBit.')
