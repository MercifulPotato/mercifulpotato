The difference between the 2 treatment groups did not exceed the noninferiority margin of 8 points.<p>&gt; Meaning:  These results demonstrate noninferiority of physical therapy compared with early surgery with arthroscopic partial meniscectomy for improving self-reported knee function in patients with nonobstructive meniscal tears.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamanetwork.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;jama&#x2F;fullarticle&#x2F;2705186" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamanetwork.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;jama&#x2F;fullarticle&#x2F;2705186</a>')
