In the UK, there was fairly consistent opposition to fighting the Nazis. Even after France was overrun, there was a fairly large minority in the UK saying that the UK should surrender and ally with Germany (some of these were right-wing, some of them were not). In the US, unsurprisingly given the huge number of German migrants to the US, there was fairly unanimous opposition which is why the US joined so late. The connection with Britain and France was only really present in the elites of US society, isolationism was the default.<p>Also, it is worth remembering that what we know about the Nazis today is not necessarily what people knew about the Nazis then.<p>I think myths about WW2 are quite damaging. Everyone today appears to think that they are in a good vs evil battle. Not only is this quite clearly not justified by the facts today (for example, comparing the Capitol with Kristallnacht, as Schwarznegger did, is a chilling inaccuracy...particularly from someone who hails from Austria), it wasn&#x27;t the situation then...no-one in WW2 in the US regarded it as a good vs evil battle (only Churchill did, and he was lambasted for it).')
