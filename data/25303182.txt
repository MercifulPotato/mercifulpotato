My boss got me into using nicer notebooks, and I&#x27;ve been doing it for years (about 6).  \nI then switched to MD files, eventually ending up using Stackedit extensively for a while similar to the tablet effort.  \nNow, between work, hobbies, being a DM; I&#x27;ve given up and spent some time in One Note... and now that&#x27;s where I&#x27;ve\nmigrated everything. I&#x27;m always interested in how others do this in case they&#x27;ve figured something out.  \nI still use a paper notebook as a personal journal, important notes, etc. I also still use a notepad for those daily notes &#x2F; thinking on paper that you can throw away at the end of the day.')
