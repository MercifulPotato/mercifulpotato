I don&#x27;t want to stay in SF long term and have been debating starting in NYC or London with a slight preference for London. My plan is to be remote till covid settles and then decide on a base location.I&#x27;ve lived in both cities for &gt;2 years and have no immigration restrictions.<p>Would being in London vs SF&#x2F;NY be detrimental to the success of a B2B SaaS company?<p>Thanks!')
