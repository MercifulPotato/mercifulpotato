Item(by='Rusky', descendants=None, kids=[24841066], score=None, time=1603219450, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24840666, text='Four of the five pieces of accidental complexity I listed were present in C++98, so I&#x27;m not sure what the relative ages have to do with this. (You&#x27;ve also not mentioned any accidental complexity in Rust...) Instead, I attribute it to hindsight and differences in priorities- C++ today is still introducing new features with the same level of unforced complexity (e.g. compare C++ lambda capture clauses and coroutines, to Rust closures and async fn), while additions to Rust instead tend to &quot;fill in&quot; inconsistencies to <i>remove</i> edge cases and exceptions.<p>I&#x27;m also not trying to convince you to drop Zig and settle for Rust! You can use either or both or neither, I don&#x27;t mind! Rather, my point is that Rust&#x27;s direction relative to C++ is the same one you praise Zig for- it provides the same control with <i>drastically</i> more economical application of fewer language features. Just because Zig goes further (again, at great cost to things like tooling, error checking, and messages) doesn&#x27;t mean Rust didn&#x27;t make a lot of progress.')
