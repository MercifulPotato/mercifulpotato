Though I agree that it is quest-y in its approach to each episode&#x2F;sub plot and personally don&#x27;t mind it, what makes it any different from the &quot;hero story&quot; structure?<p>Sure there&#x27;s a formula, but few stories, if any at all, are original in their foundations. Their success seems to be more in the execution of such story&#x2F;production and immersion of audiences.<p>Or is it more of an issue of the predictability in knowing what the &quot;quest&quot; objectives and items are, and from that extrapolating the outcome? Imo, both cases are understandable, as many times the main story quests can feel on rails&#x2F;going through the motions, but again those quests seem to be more about the audience&#x27;s immersion (including player playthrough&#x2F;execution in games) in the modeled experience.<p>Tldr:\nI totally understand your point, and can agree to an extent. Though I believe one can find enjoyment in well curated&#x2F;executed experiences&#x2F;productions&#x2F;writing&#x2F;immersion, rather than seeking &quot;originality&quot; in story telling, as on rails&#x2F;predictable as they can be')
