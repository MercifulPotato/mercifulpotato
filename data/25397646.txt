Item(by='Symbiote', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607773123, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25397378, text='+44 115 1234 123 is also more difficult to explain than &quot;0115 1234 123&quot; or even &quot;1234 123&quot;, but it enables the whole world to telephone that number.<p>What alternative do you propose, that gives us more addresses but isn&#x27;t longer?
