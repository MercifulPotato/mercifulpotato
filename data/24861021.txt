The reality is that we &quot;pay&quot; for inequality with reduced productivity. A great example of this is &quot;single family home neighborhoods&quot; in urban areas. They have no societal benefit, they are essentially subsidized land use patterns for the well off, and it makes it harder for less well of folks to move to areas where they can get a better job&#x2F;improve their lot in life and grow the economy. There is a very strong case that one reason for sluggish economic growth is the concentration of assets and wealth in so few hands, and the continuing stagnation&#x2F;decline in wealth&#x2F;living standards&#x2F;etc of bottom 40% of the US when measured in things like &quot;healthcare&quot;, &quot;education&quot; etc. A redistributive wealth tax that was well structured could be a huge boon to GDP growth.')
