Item(by='lota-putty', descendants=None, kids=[25187819], score=None, time=1606144795, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25187014, text='CGTN is to China what RT is for Russia.<p>Economics is a zero-sum-game; if they lifted everyone in China out of poverty, then poverty is exported to other countries or the nature paid all the costs.<p>Edit:<p>Nature is a silent sufferer in the economics. It acted as cushion to our misadventures, a-bomb(wars), oil-spills, co2 &amp; other gases, industrial wastes, nuclear wastes.<p>For a person to become rich, they have to earn profit dishonestly; if profit is shared equally nobody is richer. Somebody is getting short end of the stick to make someone else richer.<p>If everyone is self-sufficient through out their lives, then technically there is enough to go around. Otherwise, one who holds the resource in high demand won&#x27;t share it fairly.<p>Simply put : Income disparity will thrive in resource hungry society where resources are held by few members. Even in self-sufficiency, if population grows then nature has to pay the price. Resources are finite for all kinds of life on earth. If one thrives some other suffers.<p>Anyway, now it&#x27;s downvoted; wasted my time wording it.')
