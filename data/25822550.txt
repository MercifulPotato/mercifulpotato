This makes extensions one of the worst of all software markets. Users just expect extensions to be free.<p>Also, the browsers vendors themselves can make it difficult to monetize extensions. Firefox eliminated its extension store several years ago, and Google is eliminating Chrome Web Store payments next month. If anything, the Mac App Store is now the easiest place to monetize extensions IMO.')
