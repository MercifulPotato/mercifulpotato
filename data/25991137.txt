He also seems to work really long hours and weekends, even though he has a family.  He also does not seem to want to negotiate for a raise.  I&#x27;ve chosen to not be likey coworker and so far I&#x27;ve been promoted, gotten 10 and 15 percent raises, etc.  I do tend to rub coworkers and leadership the wrong way sometimes, but that&#x27;s a trade-off I am fine with.  I would rather be happy with my work hours and well paid than well liked.')
