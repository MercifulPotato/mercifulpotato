You seems to avoid the moral codes mentioned in the same book that encourage genocide, rape and slavery.<p>How do you know which morals to cherry pick? That would be humanistic morals - you pick the ones that we follows. The ones that encourage being good to others and respect their wellbeing.<p>Religion provides no benefit or advantage over atheistic humanistic morals. It does provide benefits to the region - money, power, control and the ability to avoid responsibility.<p>Jesus encouraged people to devoid themselves of personal goods and family and follow him.
