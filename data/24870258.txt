These conflicts  about chans and censorship and conspiracy theories are artifacts of categories I think we&#x27;ve all seen before.<p>I&#x27;d agree that truth in public is as welcome as truth to power, perhaps because they are related. The point of a separate public is to keep the ball in the air so we can coexist under conventions and merciful pretenses, whereas when it becomes overpowering and breaches the private sphere, it&#x27;s just Hobbes&#x27; war of all against all.<p>Feminist critiques I read at school back in the day about the Private sphere as the origin of patriarchy bring the division into a modern context. If we imagine the current trend in global internet culture as an extension of that revolt against the private sphere, it yields some uncomfortable questions about what the endgame looks like if that animus swings out of balance. Hence, I see a lot of the crazy online stuff as people expressing their instincts for  what&#x27;s going on and what they fear is going to happen to them, but they don&#x27;t have the critical tools or the privacy to develop and articulate them.<p>HN provides the closest thing we have to an elevated semi-private discourse to raise this stuff.')
