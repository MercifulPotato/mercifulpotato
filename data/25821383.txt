Item(by='baobabKoodaa', descendants=None, kids=[25821457], score=None, time=1610975029, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25821183, text='Hey, to all the people downvoting my comment: the article paints a pretty clear picture that this person was staying in the arrivals area which is accessible to passengers, and the reason for his arrest and prosecution was that he was embarrassing airport security. At no point does the article claim or even hint at the possibility that the person used the stolen badge to enter other areas besides the arrivals area. So why are you just &quot;assuming&quot; that the person entered other areas with the badge? We&#x27;re talking about a person who has already been doxxed and embarrassed for their mental health issues. On top of that you want to add your baseless speculation that he did some crimes? And you don&#x27;t want to give any explanation why you believe that he did some crimes? You just want to smear the man some more, because hey, let&#x27;s kick him while he&#x27;s down?<p>Furthermore, I find it ironic that the people who downvoted me are giving me less courtesy than I did with my downvote, where I explained the reason for downvoting.')
