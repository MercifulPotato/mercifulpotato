This looks like it&#x27;ll do that. Performance and power efficiency look good, and they implemented most of the Nvidia early adopter features. If they want to really compete with Nvidia as a premium option they&#x27;ll need to match the non-performance features that Nvidia has:<p>- Driver stability. Nvidia is not perfect but the 5700 series was awful from AMD (had to return mine). They need to at least match Nvidia.<p>- DLSS. It started out as a gimmick but with DLSS 2.0 it&#x27;s just 70%+ free performance improvement with the only downside being somewhat limited game support.<p>- Video Encoder. Nvidia&#x27;s encoder has very high quality and is well supported by streaming and recording software. I wonder what sort of improvements the RX 6000 series has?<p>- CUDA, Tensor Cores, Ansel, etc. I don&#x27;t really use these things but if I&#x27;m paying the same amount I want similar capabilities.<p>It&#x27;s kinda crazy that they&#x27;re using the same silicon in all three cards; the 6800 has 1&#x2F;4 of the CUs disabled! It is a big chip for 7nm, though. AMD has said that availability won&#x27;t be an issue (which could give them a leg up on Nvidia in the near term), but I do have to wonder about it.<p>The 80CU 6900XT was rumored months ago and there was a lot of speculation and incredulity about the memory system to feed all those cores. GDDR6X is Nvidia exclusive so some said a 512-bit bus, or HBM2, or even a combination of HBM and GDDR6. The big cache is an interesting solution, I&#x27;m curious how it&#x27;ll perform. It makes sense in a gaming context where a lot of buffers and textures get reused over the course of a frame. I&#x27;m a bit worried about tail latency affecting the 99-percentile frame times which have a huge impact on the subjective experience of smoothness. Also bad for massively parallel compute work.')
