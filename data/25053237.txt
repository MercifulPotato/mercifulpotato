I&#x27;m fairly certain my original issue was caused by playing basketball. The running and jumping really does put a lot of strain on the body. I have never played ball again since the injury.<p>As I mentioned, I also changed my entire workout regime. While strength is super important, 500+ pound DLs maybe not so much at my age. Both basketball and powerlifting I love, so it was definitely a mental shift. But, now I&#x27;m probably in the best complete shape I have ever been in. My cardio, strength and flexibility are balanced and good. COVID has actually been a good thing since I can jump up at any point in the day and take a 15 minute yoga class.<p>Good luck, I hope neither of us have to deal with back pain again :)')
