Maybe I would like to connect on FitBit with my personal trainer but not on Instagram or Pokemon Go.<p>Anyone I consider a friend that I didn&#x27;t meet online I will always have their phone number, even if that isn&#x27;t my primary form of communication with them. A phone call will always go through without regards to any data limits and is less spotty in areas with bad service.<p>I&#x27;d love it to be a standard so that social networks could also be connected together in a similar asymmetrical way but that would require even more cooperation from people proven to be bad actors.')
