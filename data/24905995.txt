Item(by='mlindner', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603794233, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24905970, text='&gt; How does a link like this hold up with different weather?<p>Entirely dependent on how it was implemented. So not really possible for anyone to answer based on available information. There&#x27;s numerous variables that go into it, some of which are known some of which aren&#x27;t. Short list of some: Frequency used (known), bandwidth per channel, software used in base station and satellite (error correcting algorithms and signal processing), percentage of the time the dish is aimed at satellites directly overhead (less atmosphere&#x2F;stuff to go through) which will improve with time, altitude of satellite (known).<p>&gt; Are there people here who have internet from geo-stationairy sats?<p>Geo-stationary isn&#x27;t really comparable as it&#x27;s a much older technology, as are the base stations. The satellites are also much further away (as in over 70 times further away).')
