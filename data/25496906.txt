It becomes impossible to plan around an employee who may or may not be able to contribute on a given day. Eventually, it becomes clear that relying on an employee to maybe or maybe not put in a couple of heroic days to catch up each week isn&#x27;t as good for the team, as a whole, as someone who puts in steady and predictable work, even if the overall pace is slower.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to detract from your personal issues. However, I would suggest that you work on finding a position that allows you to average out your productivity better over the course of a week.')
