Item(by='woofie11', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602337177, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24736933, text='You&#x27;re allowed to comment.<p>People are allowed to point out when that comment is appropriate for a different context. They&#x27;re allowed to do that with imperfect language too.<p>You&#x27;re allowed to acknowledge you&#x27;re wrong, and move on. You&#x27;re also allowed to push back and explain why you think it&#x27;s fine for this context.<p>The only person who has control over you is you. This is a web forum. A Random Stranger on the Internet calling a comment inappropriate shouldn&#x27;t lead one to believe that &quot;criticism is not allowed&quot; in a particular forum.<p>And I think it&#x27;s a nice toy. I haven&#x27;t seen people break for using toys. I&#x27;ve mostly seen people break when they only do things one way, and habituate to believe other ways are wrong or bad. Toys are for playing, and great ways to discover which things work and which ones don&#x27;t. Even IOCCC didn&#x27;t result in broken programmers. Java sometimes did.<p>So I don&#x27;t see either your comment or their response as ideal, but that&#x27;s okay. I&#x27;d estimated 25% of my comments are poor, and you&#x27;d probably estimate me at 50% since I probably don&#x27;t always realize my comments are poor. That&#x27;s okay. Poor comments are parts of conversations. Pointing out they&#x27;re poor is part of conversation too. Continuing to talk (and sometimes make poor comments) is too.')
