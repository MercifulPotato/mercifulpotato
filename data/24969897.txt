I watched someone try to dig in to this a bit with someone pushing the idea that Bill Gates was trying to control us with vaccines&#x2F;5g.<p>&quot;Why would he do that?&quot;<p>&quot;Oh, there&#x27;s money!  There&#x27;s lot of money in controlling people with vaccines.  I know if I had that kind of power, I&#x27;d want to make money like that&quot;.  (paraphrasing, but only just).<p>I think people have a difficult time comprehending the level of wealth&#x2F;power someone like Gates or Bezos <i>already have</i>.  Having wealth north of $100B is something only a handful of people will ever experience.  To think someone has worked their whole life to get that sort of money, then... someone, would decide to say &quot;I want to control people with vaccines because I can make a lot of money that way!&quot; is ... off-the-radar silly.  For a time, Gates had a lot more potential control over the information itself, and likely could have enriched himself even more directly, without needing to resort to medical intervention.<p>People are scared.  The world is changing around us faster than many are able to keep up.  Focusing your fears on a few outsized larger than life names to try to make sense of things is... I guess understandable to a point, but... these &#x27;theories&#x27; can&#x27;t seem to stand up to much basic logic.')
