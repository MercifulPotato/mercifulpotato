I tried and I still don&#x27;t, nevermind someone who doesn&#x27;t even care.<p>I mean, I know the theory, I know the individual parts, but can&#x27;t quite fully understand how a complete processor works.<p>If someone from as early as 1920 would find an advanced robot that is a combination of some Boston Dynamics model and offline&#x2F;autonomous Google Assistant (so it could walk, listen&#x2F;talk&#x2F;reply, and maybe pick stuff up), they would not be able to figure out how its &quot;brain&quot; works. At best they&#x27;d have a general idea&#x2F;theory.<p>Same thing with our brains and current understanding of it. I believe it is possible to reverse engineer it completely, but not with today&#x27;s tools.')
