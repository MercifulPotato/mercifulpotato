Going east to west is a nightmare of transfers, going north to south (in non-COVID times) is a nightmare of sitting on either Guadalupe for an hour to go two miles or sitting on Lamar for an hour to go two miles. And that&#x27;s IF your CapMetro bus is running on time that day.<p>You&#x27;ll do marginally better driving your own car if you catch that section of Guadalupe going south <i>right at the perfect time</i> when the lights slowly cascade to green as you approach Riverside.<p>(Course the tradeoff here in Chicago is looping the block endlessly looking for a parking spot, but in non pandemic times, I&#x27;d trade the CTA for CapMetro in a heartbeat)')
