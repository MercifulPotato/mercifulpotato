Without private property it was impossible to motivate people to do some kinds of work - taking on risk, organizing production, and some kinds of innovation - to a sufficient degree and without many drawbacks.<p>If someone found a way to motivate people to do those kinds of labour properly - and force doesn&#x27;t work well for many reasons, so it would have to be non-violent, but without having to allow ownership of capital and wealth concentration, why wouldn&#x27;t we consider it? The Communists of old thought they found a way to do so and were wrong, but if someone today found a way to do it that doesn&#x27;t cause many drawbacks, it would be foolish and dogmatic not to consider it, and if it works well, implement it.')
