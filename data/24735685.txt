Failure isn&#x27;t fun to share, failure implies a need to re-think and strategize, failure means you can&#x27;t delegate enough of your responsibilities to specialize in appearing quick and decisive to your investors, failure means you aren&#x27;t in the startup circle anymore and aren&#x27;t looking to cultivate your relationship with Sam Altman, and so on. Any one of those effects could singlehandedly create the observed trend without implying that quick response times lead to healthy businesses.')
