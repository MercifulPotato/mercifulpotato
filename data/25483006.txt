(But not exactly, since the angles are different)<p>A tall thing and a lower thing nearby it are protected onto the same spot. (Usually in a video game the tall thing blocks the behind thing, instead of blending with it.)\nBlending the two images makes the front-looking thing look transparent, when in really you are seeing <i>around</i> one object (since the observation angle is not the same as the <i>imaginary</i> viewing angle of the image) and then drawing both objects in the same pixel.')
