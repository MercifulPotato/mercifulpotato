When the iPhone was brand-new, Apple had a ton of trouble negotiating with carriers who were used to controlling what goes on their network.  Nowadays, carriers have very little say beyond things like PCTRB certification and a mostly-cursory review of OS-level OTA updates.  When it comes to apps (or even app stores), the carriers don&#x27;t even get notified, let alone get veto powers.')
