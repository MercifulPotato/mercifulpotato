Even Apple cannot, and they claim to care about the environment.<p>Beats got a bad name, so I just skip that. There&#x27;s a reason they did not attach that brand name to their Airpods products.<p>We just had BF and I saw great deals for Airpods. All of them.<p>XM3, which has superb ANC, just had a successor (XM4) which has multiple device support. XM4 goes for 350. XM3 was 200 on BF.<p>Now compare that with Airpods Max price tag and features.<p>I bought XM4 as a successor to my Logitech G933. Logitech G933 has no ANC, not so good sound quality, it has a proprietary dongle (the dealbreaker for my use case due to USB-A and dongle requirement), it has microUSB, it has 3.5 mm, battery lasts 8 hours. Battery replacement can be bought directly from Logitech, easy to replace yourself, and costs 10 EUR. Compare to XM3&#x2F;4 3.5 mm, Bluetooth, superb ANC, USB-C (in contrast to microUSB or lightning), and the battery is good... but I doubt it still is in 3 years.')
