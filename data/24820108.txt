Impressions in vrac:<p>- The website is very... monochrome. Seems like a very basic theme. The UI is not adapted to a desktop (vertical, hidden menu), I haven&#x27;t visited the website on mobile. I wouldn&#x27;t expect that from a game website.<p>- The rules need images!<p>- It&#x27;s missing a rules button in the game interface that doesn&#x27;t change page, but opens a popup or something similar.<p>- More colors!<p>- There&#x27;s scrolling in the play area, remove them.<p>- Without the direct link for a game found in the HN comments, I would never have gotten to even play a game. It seems there&#x27;s no way to create a game as a guest. I hate registering on websites, if you ask me to register before I even can see what the game looks like, I won&#x27;t.<p>- Is there a chat? I might have missed it. It seems like an important feature if your goal is to have far away friends play together.<p>- Games? I see only one, and nowhere I can find mention of others in work.<p>About the pricing:<p>- For the free tier, I don&#x27;t understand what you mean by &quot;Freely given to all users; limit one.&quot;<p>- Subjectively, I dislike the &quot;pay what you want&quot;. It&#x27;s like tipping, I don&#x27;t like feeling cheap by tipping too little, I don&#x27;t like feeling like I&#x27;m wasting money tipping too much. Either way, I will feel bad.<p>- The pay for 10&#x2F;20 games is... surprising. Seeing how fast the games are (2 minutes per game!), the minimum price of $2 for 10 games is <i>exorbitant</i>. Specially for something that seems in alpha. I want a monthly subscription, not a &quot;pay for X number of games&quot;.<p>- And most of all... this is very, very early access. There&#x27;s only one very basic game. There&#x27;s many free online multiplayers games out there, more complexe and polished. What do you do (will do) to differentiate from them?<p>- The game itself is fun.')
