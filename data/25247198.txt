A family working ten acres of corn with hand- and mule-power did not in any sense benefit from the fact that other landowners had slaves. It would be more accurate to say that they were in <i>competition</i> with enslaved labor. One might as well ask American factory workers how much they&#x27;ve benefited from cheap overseas factory labor.<p>Upthread you claimed that such small farmers also used slaves. That may have happened occasionally, but the basic requirements of agriculture in a temperate climate (there is a limited time period during which particular tasks can possibly take place) would have made it rare.')
