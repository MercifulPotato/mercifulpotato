But I wouldn&#x27;t assume that this changes everything, we can already determine how proteins fold by experimental work. The disadvantage is that this is a lot of work, though the methods there also improved a lot.<p>One question is how robust the predictions are that DeepMind produces. I would also assume that right now it can&#x27;t e.g. determine protein structures in the present of other small molecules, or protein complexes. A lot of the interesting stuff lies in the interactions between molecules.<p>And in general in life sciences any new development will take at least a decade until it hits day to day life, likely even more. We&#x27;re living with a exception to this rule right now due to the pandemic, but in general things take quite a bit of time in that space.')
