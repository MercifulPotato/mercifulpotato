How much time does the above code take to run?<p>Answer: 250 clock ticks: doA() is run with 16-threads, then doB() is run on the 16-other threads afterwards.<p>That&#x27;s how SIMD systems work. If this were non-SIMD 32-core turing machine, it&#x27;d take 150 clock ticks (And the threads doing doA() would have spend 50-clock ticks doing something else). The most important thing about SIMD from a performance perspective is that you &quot;add&quot; both halves of the branch from a performance point of view.')
