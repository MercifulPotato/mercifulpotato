The current math says there may be essentially infinite worlds created in infinite time, where yes there is least one in which you are a billionaire married to a supermodel. The only constraint is in the properties of nature (e.g. a world will never be created in which an electron has 0 spin).<p>However, I agree with you that it seems implausible because it implies absurd situations like, there is a world in which someone lives a life of celebrity because every time they roll some dice it always lands on 6, and every time they flip a coin it lands on heads, etc.')
