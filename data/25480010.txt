Through years of marketing they promised &quot;unprecedented&quot; levels of AI and interactability with NPCs. They promised things like situational police presence&#x2F;response, etc. But currently, the game has NPC AI that&#x27;s years behind (games released 5-10 years ago have better AI).<p>The fact that such features were promised is what is causing people to think (hope?) that these features are simply unfinished. If it is an intentional design choice and CDPR has no plan to improve them, that&#x27;s a whole other issue with what was promised vs what was actually intended.')
