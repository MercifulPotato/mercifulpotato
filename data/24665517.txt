If a country has figured out how to provide for its people w&#x2F;o jobs, so what? For example if we had perfect AI-robot slaves we&#x27;d all be jobless. Would it be a problem?  Maybe we should ask people why they want a job, maybe what they want to do doesnt require one?<p>&quot;Living with their parents&quot; - Again, so what? Much of the world and across much of history this was just how it was. No one denigrates someone 0-20 for living with their parents, why should a 30 yr old be denigrated for the same. Plus, for many of us so lucky the same scenario, with opposite take, will occur-- our parents will move in with us later in their life and we&#x27;ll &quot;live with our parents&quot; again. Plus when you add that median sq foot of homes (at least in USA) is rising, you can comfortably live with more people in &quot;home&quot;. With double master bedrooms more common and more square feet we&#x27;re blurring the lines of what a single home means. Some houses are so big that you could just put a dividing wall and a separate entrance and you&#x27;d have 2 homes...')
