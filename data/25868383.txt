And even if elastic offers a 2x better product at 1&#x2F;2 the price, your cost of traffic for an external service will easily 4x versus using AWS services. And that&#x27;s really the frustration for these service providers.<p>You can NEVER compete. Ever. Against an equivalent service offered by AWS because the egress pricing acts as a pricing barrier.')
