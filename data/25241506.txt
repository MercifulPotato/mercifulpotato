If I write a program that dynamically links a library performing the same GPL&#x27;d fluid sim calculations, it is presumably forced to be GPL, because it links to it.  What if someone comes along and runs the program but at runtime uses LD_PRELOAD to override the dynamic linker, linking it to an alternative library that presents the same interface.  Is the program still required to be GPL?<p>I don&#x27;t really have an answer to your specific proposed loophole, it&#x27;s pretty clever and is a very good question; but I don&#x27;t think the <i>calling mechanism</i> is part of the issue.  You could make the same argument whether you are talking about a &quot;program&quot; or a library.  The calling convention is a meaningless detail imho.<p>I think you are specifically responding to my &quot;does not work without&quot; interpretation overly literally.  Clearly if the program is written for and tested against a specific interface of a GPL&#x27;d program, it is intended to work with that program.<p>On the other hand if it&#x27;s written to call into some kind of <i>standard</i> interface, it no longer <i>requires</i> that GPL program specifically, but could work with any program implementing that interface.  And I will admit that whether a program is written <i>only</i> to work with a GPL program&#x2F;library&#x2F;whatever, or is more <i>general</i>, may be up to interpretation, what is considered &quot;standard&quot;, etc., but that is exactly my point -- law is nuanced.  If it were possible to codify laws perfectly with overly simple rules like &quot;the copyright applies because it&#x27;s a DLL and not a program&quot;, then we wouldn&#x27;t need lawyers.<p>In law, intent is important.  If I write a non-GPL program that depends on the functionality of a GPL library, I can go find all sorts of ways to not &quot;link&quot; to it but still use it, e.g., as a program, a service, etc. -- and it happens -- but the <i>intent</i>, which was to find a way to use GPL software without adhering to its license,  is still quite clear.')
