However, skipping all the stuff which wasn&#x27;t intended for me I&#x27;d like to jump to the last sentence of your commentary to note that it hangs on a hypothesis that our actions are result of just thought processes completely detached from say metabolism, and pre-programmed reactions. I don&#x27;t think its true. There&#x27;s a lot of empirical evidence to claim that various things like sleep deprivation, peer pressure, level of glucose, hormons, age do affect human decision-making even if thought-information[1] remains the same. Humans btw show great ability to re-rationalize made decisions afterwards, essentially fooling themselves to believe they came to them purely by thinking.<p>Math is unlikely to be affected by this, but politics, relationships, and a lot of other decisions - easy.<p>[1] Technically, hormons, and instincts are information inputs as well, but they are usually processed outside of concious thinking.<p>EDIT: added the last para.')
