We’re a group of engineers who wanted an open source tool that made reading Docker logs more enjoyable. We’ve come up with Dockter and hope to get some very early feedback. The product is in its infant stages and works best for newly run containers outputting a low amount of logs. We realize there is a lot of work to be done (especially in terms of optimization) but we thought this early feedback would be extremely valuable.<p>We want to emphasize that the ultimate focus is to build a nice UI that makes extracting meaningful information from Docker logs a pleasant developer experience. We’re very much open to suggestions on how to approach log collection and want to make sure we’re not reinventing the wheel here.<p>Here is where we’re headed next:<p>- We’ve already received interest from someone in the open source community who is willing to implement a CI&#x2F;CD pipeline<p>- Our plan is to transition to a timeseries DB in order to accommodate the large volume of log output<p>- Optimizing the filtering feature<p>- Data visualization for log metrics')
