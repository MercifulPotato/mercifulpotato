I would like evidence that this is effective, given the challenges this pandemic has put in evidence. Particularly, note that this is supposed to be aimed at <i>all</i> children, not just particularly motivated or interested ones that will sit quietly learning at their computer.<p>2) 1-on-1 tutoring does not happen online. In which case you either have to add the cost of getting the kids to the tutor (if the tutor stays put, maximizing their throughput) or getting the tutor to the kids (reducing their throughput and their student count).<p>Beyond that, modern schooling is an entire <i>system</i> that addresses many many problems in society including:<p>- Daycare for kids ages 5-18<p>- Logistics of getting kids to and from school (in the US)<p>- Logistics of providing shared facilities for things like experimental science classes .<p>- Logistics of providing shared access to higher level computing facilities than individual poor students can afford.<p>- For a nontrivial number of students, access to <i>food</i> during the day.<p>- Many more, because I am not an expert and I literally came up with this list off the top of my head.<p>Are these problems unsurmountable? Do they all <i>need</i> to be solved by the educational system? Maybe not. But imperfectly as it solves them, it does <i>address</i> them for now. You can&#x27;t throw out a significant part of the public service provided by public education and claim you successfully replaced it.')
