My experience is the exact opposite - too expressive language make devs have different dialects and be too &quot;clever&quot; for the teams long-term good - and I&#x27;m pretty dumbfounded that you can try to make sense of that.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter what language you use - cleverness will come in anyways. Only the way it is achieved is different. Cleverness in the case of go will just be difficult to understand reflection, where it will be difficult to understand types in Haskell.<p>With go, every line of code will be simpler when compared to Haskell (picking Haskell as an arbitrary example here). However, the go program will also 10x bigger. And complexity grows over proportional with the amount of code. In the end, the understand what the whole thing is doing you will have a harder time compared to the more dense but also much shorter code in Haskell _if you are very familiar and experienced in both languages_.')
