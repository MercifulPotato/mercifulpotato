I’m going to use pseudo-statistical language to illustrate my point so please try to be charitable. In a usual model I’d base my actions on the mean outcome for a given set of choices. For covid, I think it’s smarter to choose to minimize the maximum, worst outcome. Ie assume the absolute worst and react in the harshest way. This new strain may prove to be nothing major, but personally I’ve decided it’s wise to be even more distanced  from possible disease vectors.  I suspect this may be a good strategy in a universe in which an already rare occurrence has been observed, in a larger sense.')
