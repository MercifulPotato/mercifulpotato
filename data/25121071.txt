Item(by='didibus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605597964, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25118764, text='&gt; You can allow a user to sort by likes, retweets or time. Anything else is considered publishing.<p>I think this is also editorial in nature. That&#x27;s what I think Obama was referring too when he said &quot;even without algorithms&quot;.<p>Because even likes and retweets are a way to editorialize what people are most likely to see. It promotes what is popular, and that&#x27;s often click bait sensational things (which are often inaccurate or worded in misleading ways). And it also makes them a target for abuse, in that you can create bot campaigns or use human farms to push things to the top by having them artificially retweeted and liked. Or to hide things if there are downvotes as well.<p>Think about Hackernews, even it still needs moderation even though it only has upvotes&#x2F;downvotes.<p>Now I think they are more tame compared to algorithms and machine learning models, but you can still argue they are a form of editorialization.<p>Sorted by date isn&#x27;t editorial. Same for search by keyword. Filtered by category or tag or user or date and all those are not editorial in nature.<p>And if you think back to Google, the big breakthrough for search was to consider the number of backlinks to some content. I think that be a great way to replace sort by likes and retweets. Basically, force a user to post something new that talks about another post and links to it. And then you could have a sort be &quot;number of reference&quot;. As long as you force the new post to not only be a link to another one, like require some additional content to be there as well, so someone adds to the conversation, even if it&#x27;s just: &quot;This is a great read: link&quot;.<p>I feel that create a much higher quality content.<p>Edit: Okay, re-reading this, I&#x27;m thinking my last idea is a lot similar to retweet, since it&#x27;s basically a new post that back links to some existing one. So most retweeted might be fine. And I&#x27;m thinking why that is. I think it&#x27;s because by retweeting, you&#x27;re not promoting existing content above others, you&#x27;re creating more copies of the same content. In a way, it is very transparent as to how many people have the same voice about something. So it makes it clear that it is users who are being vocal about some topic, and not the platform using some metric to promote one thing over others. Where as with likes, it&#x27;s not clear if it&#x27;s a user trying to push something to the top, thus editorializing, or if they are just trying to also say the same thing. I don&#x27;t know, need to think about it some more probably.')
