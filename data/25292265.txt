And this is the only drug I do occasionally. (and not at all since some time)<p>And I do support total legalization.<p>Out of the philosophical point of view, that adult people should own their own body and life. And what I do with my body, is my buisness and not anyone else.<p>How can I think of myself as free, when other people regulate what I am allowed to consume?<p>And from movies, literature and some people in real life, I know what coke and heroin does to people, so I have no intentions of consuming them. Same with alcohol btw.<p>But if other people think its beneficial to them - I would try to convince of the big risks not worth the effort. But ultimately I would (and did) it accept as their choice. Even if that means they destroy their life. It is their life, after all.\nThis usually does mean tragedy, I am painfully aware of that - but with the criminalization it means even bigger tragedy.')
