An alternative is <i>to collect multiple assessments</i> --- to check references, or sample public opinions.  Reading additional reviews on a given online site (Glassdoor, Amazon, Yelp, RottenTomatoes, etc.) is appealing for ease of access, but is subject to various problems, whether unreliable reviews, curation (negative <i>or</i> positive), rater kickbacks or extortion, etc.<p>Essentially these are examples of the censorship, propaganda, surveillance, and monopoly dynamic I highlighted recently:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joindiaspora.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;7bfcf170eefc013863fa002590d8e506" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joindiaspora.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;7bfcf170eefc013863fa002590d8e...</a> (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24771470" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24771470</a>)<p>A preferred mode is to <i>bypass any intermediary</i> and directly sample those with relevant experience.  Where such experiences are thin, this is difficult.  For broader experiences, forms of statistical sampling are powerfully useful, and, contrary to widespread popular opinion <i>given random sampling</i> &quot;large number&quot; estimates can be achieved with sample sizes of as low as 30, and reliable <i>small-sample</i> estimates well below this.  Sample <i>bias</i> matters far more than sample <i>size</i>.<p>For advice on theory, validation can be performed through experiment or by checking with trusted authorities.  Note that &#x27;trusted authorities&quot; != &quot;appeal to authority&quot;.  That is, <i>trust</i> is based on <i>both</i> expertise <i>and</i> reliability, rather than position or office.<p>That&#x27;s easiest when specific references are given,[1] but even here, @lordnacho has provided both keywords and reasonably cogent arguments supporting their views.<p>Their comment is a great example of why the vetting problem is so hard and enduring, though.[2]<p>________________________________<p>Notes:<p>1.
