Facebook has strong network effects (i.e. everyone you know is already on it and you want to see what your friends post) whereas YouTube has much less of a social network element.  Can&#x27;t someone just host their videos elsewhere?  I understand most random viewers are on YouTube, but if there was a niche video site for woodworking, chess, or bass guitar I don&#x27;t think it would be too hard to convince YouTubers to go check out those sites')
