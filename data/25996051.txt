Stadia is the only one that actually requires games to integrate with its API, similar to Steam with Steamworks, and this allows them to provide a far more integrated experience, with friend lists, friend invites, voice chat, achievements, and so on. None of the other services can provide that. Well GFN does but that&#x27;s just running Steam. In the short term it will slow down adoption, but in the long term the experience is night and day, imo. Being thrown into a VM instance where you have to login to Steam is nothing like pressing one button and being thrown right into a game.<p>Also, yes if you already have a huge Steam collection, the thought of buying games on a different store is not great, but I don&#x27;t think Stadia is aimed at people with a PC gaming rig and 1000 steam games, it&#x27;s aimed at people who don&#x27;t have a gaming PC or console, and want to play the latest EA Sports or AAA game. Having to just pay 60$ is far better than paying 60$ + 500$ fo a console + waiting for shipping and installation.')
