Visual J++ was closer to what you mean - it was the Java language and VM with some things deleted from Sun’s distribution (RMI) and some things added like WFC. They also made some breaking language extensions like delegates that later became part of C#, and were somewhat analogous to features that appeared in Sun’s Java 1.1.<p>Funnily enough, I learned Java in the summer of 1997 in the VJ++ IDE from MSDN tutorial videos, spent a good chunk of my early career doing Java at various places and now work for MSR where I often use Java (or the JVM) on Linux.')
