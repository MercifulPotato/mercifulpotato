My wife&#x27;s little Toyota CH-R does just that: it tries to correct the car&#x27;s trajectory, does give feedback both through vibration (in the steering wheel) and through an audio signal.<p>I think it&#x27;s more realistic to settle for that kind of features than to wait for a real 100% complete autopilot.')
