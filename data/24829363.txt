Item(by='dalke', descendants=None, kids=[24829893], score=None, time=1603132355, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24827889, text='Yes, it looks like &quot;Sjukdomsfall per dag&quot; is more correctly translated as &quot;Disease cases per day&quot;.<p>Though to point out, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Disease#Concepts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Disease#Concepts</a> says &quot;many cases, terms such as disease, disorder, morbidity, sickness and illness are used interchangeably&quot; and &quot;The terms illness and sickness are both generally used as synonyms for disease;&quot; so I&#x27;m not clearly wrong.<p>It then goes on to make your point &quot;however, the term illness is occasionally used to refer specifically to the patient&#x27;s personal experience of his or her disease. In this model, it is possible for a person to have a disease without being ill.&quot;<p>As you can see from my earlier comments, I agree that the &quot;sharpening&quot; of Swedish recommendations is nowhere the big deal that the referenced article implies it is, and the local media is not making a big deal of it. It&#x27;s preparations for any local outbreaks, ahead of time so people can be prepared, and knowing that existing practices are no longer as effective.<p>But, why the emphasis on &quot;without a microscope&quot;? Isn&#x27;t early the right time for things like this?')
