It is thought-policing.<p>Terrorists have easy ways to talk to each other securely, using GPG and email, or even SSH for that matter. They don&#x27;t need fancy apps, filters, masks, stickers and other UX candy.<p>General population, on the other hand, wants these things, and uses a small number of apps that government wants to control. Turns out, not just in authoritarian countries, but in a supposedly democratic EU too. It is common people who are most affected by lack of privacy, and the goal is the same that STASI &#x2F; KGB had: to filter out dissidents who might pose risk to those who are currenlty at the top.<p>Such powers can be abused easily, and it special services will be granted such powers, they WILL be abused. So a duty of every free person is to fight such proposals and kill them outright.')
