It’s possible that action might be needed in the short term to moderate these channels. But we must also consider the longer term in a world that is rapidly evolving.<p>I’m less concerned about specific, currently existing platforms like Parler, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. These “social media” platforms are mere trinkets and could go away and society would carry on. In moderating or completely dissolving them we lose little.<p>I am more concerned about the nature of communication when the channels of communication are centrally controlled and&#x2F;or controlled by private entities. We have no idea how digital communications will evolve or how important they could become.<p>Our lives are increasingly become digital… Imagine a world 50 or 100 or X years from now when people <i>never</i> leave their homes (except perhaps through VR?) and nearly all human interaction is via digital means. There’s a good chance those digital means will be run by private entities. So if we want to preserve the liberties we have today we need to think about how those would be protected in the future, and that means being careful about what precedent we set today.<p>Are we really willing to have <i>all</i> of our communication moderated or potentially terminated in a such a future?<p>It’s true that we might need to take action in the present, but let’s not forget that we are simultaneously shaping our futures.')
