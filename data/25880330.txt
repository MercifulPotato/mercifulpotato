Social media proliferates and in different forms and it does so internationally with popular and unpopular opinions easily spreading like wildfire. I have no problem with the Facebooks and the Twitters of the world running their servers with the carte blanche of the private property owners that they are because what you and others perceive as a lack of options and alternatives looks more to me like there’s not a lot of options today compared to how many there will be 20 years from now.<p>Go look back at the history of the web, here’s an incomplete and not comprehensive list of sites and internet services which have existed, do exist, ceased to exist, got gobbled up by bigger fish and spawned smaller networks of their own and probably in some small way contributed to the political conscience of most Americans alive today and definitely not concerning ourselves with all of the countless web forums, Usenet groups, and mailing lists: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_social_networking_services" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_social_networking_serv...</a><p>Classmates.com: 1995<p>GameFAQs: 1995<p>Newgrounds: 1995<p>ICQ: 1996<p>AIM: 1997<p>CaringBridge: 1997<p>Slashdot: 1997<p>Penny Arcade: 1998<p>Yahoo Messenger: 1998<p>BlackPlanet: 1999<p>Blogger: 1999<p>Fark: 1999<p>Kiwibox: 1999<p>LiveJournal: 1999<p>Metafilter: 1999<p>Neopets: 1999<p>Something Awful: 1999<p>Xanga: 1999<p>CrossFit: 2000<p>DeviantArt: 2000<p>Radio UserLand: 2000<p>Wikipedia: 2001<p>YTMND: 2001<p>Yahoo Groups: 2001<p>last.fm: 2002<p>Meetup: 2002<p>4chan: 2003<p>Gaia Online: 2003<p>LinkedIn: 2003<p>MEETin: 2003<p>MySpace: 2003<p>Second Life: 2003<p>Steam: 2003<p>WordPress: 2003<p>Digg: 2004<p>Facebook: 2004<p>Flickr: 2004<p>hi5: 2004<p>IMVU: 2004<p>PatientsLikeMe: 2004<p>RoosterTeeth Forums: 2004<p>TV Tropes: 2004<p>World of Warcraft: 2004<p>Yelp: 2004<p>Vimeo: 2004<p>Dailymotion: 2005<p>Google Talk: 2005<p>LibraryThing: 2005<p>Ning: 2005<p>Reddit: 2005<p>YouTube: 2005<p>CafeMom: 2006<p>Flixster: 2006<p>Goodreads: 2006<p>iLike: 2006<p>ReverbNation: 2006<p>Twitter: 2006<p>Chess.com: 2007<p>Italki: 2007<p>SoundCloud: 2007<p>Tumblr: 2007<p>Hacker News: 2007<p>Justin.tv: 2007<p>Academia.edu: 2008<p>GovLoop: 2008<p>identi.ca: 2008<p>Nextdoor: 2008<p>Formspring: 2009<p>Foursquare: 2009<p>Grindr: 2009<p>Pinterest: 2009<p>Quora: 2009<p>WhatsApp: 2009<p>Friendica: 2010<p>Instagram: 2010<p>Untappd: 2010<p>Duolingo: 2011<p>Fishbrain: 2011<p>I Had Cancer: 2011<p>Letterboxd: 2011<p>Twitch: 2011<p>Whisper: 2012<p>Google Hangouts: 2013<p>Slack: 2013<p>Vine: 2013<p>Voat: 2014<p>Yo: 2014<p>Discord: 2015<p>Periscope: 2015<p>Gab: 2016<p>Houseparty: 2016<p>Mastodon: 2016<p>Peach: 2016<p>micro.blog: 2017<p>Parler: 2018<p>So let’s break this down.<p>&gt; Sure, there isn&#x27;t a shortage of digital communication, but they are responsible for a large proportion of that communication and they hold the power of tilting democracies by choice of those in charge of the company or by seemingly random bearucratic decisions made by their employees.<p>No. <i>We</i> are responsible for our own communications and when we don’t trust the messenger, we encode our messages or we use a different messenger. We are also the ones responsible for the upkeep of our own democracy and the upkeep of the institutions which maintain it because it’s <i>ours</i> and <i>our responsibility</i>. Corporations, as it turns out, as organizations which represent the aggregate interests of their owners and employees, are <i>also</i> actors in aggregate within the framework of our democracy, much like name a group of three or more people.<p>How ten thousand people voted in one place or fifty-thousand voted in another isn’t Facebook’s responsibility, or Twitter’s, or Reddit’s, or Slack’s. It’s the responsibility of every single person who cast their own vote, which should be <i>all</i> of the people who cast votes in every election.<p>&gt; They are a medium of information distribution.<p>They are a handful out of the millions of ways that exist to distribute information.<p>&gt; They are a for profit business ruled by one individual that has extraordinary power. As a society, are we really supposed to just let them do whatever they want just because there are less popular alternatives?<p>They are dust. If our free speech depended on the whims of one Mark Zuckerberg and one Jack Dorsey, then we didn’t have free speech to begin with. Facebook and Twitter are critters of the last 20 years, there have been others, <i>and</i> there will be more like them, but also entirely unlike them.<p>The way people talk about social media companies today they make it sound like we need some sort of Social Media Public Commission to control the moderation policies and enforce the publication of government speech. We don’t, because we have what we need: competition and the many many technologies that enable it and a free flow of cash and labor and capital.<p>It’s disgusting to me how freely conspiracy theorists, socialists, PRC apologists and neo-Nazis can easily congregate and talk themselves up into a furor about seizing the means of killing the Jews before Bill Gates takes over the world and prevents Chairman Winnie the Pooh from leading us into glorious revolution, but that’s the mark of a free society that they <i>can</i> find a way and will always find a way. So is being able to tell the President and anyone else to get off your lawn and&#x2F;or servers.')
