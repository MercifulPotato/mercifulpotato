The fast inverse square root routine was in the vicinity of 10 cycles.<p>In Quake, each vertex needed to have its normal vector calculated, which resulted in... I dunno, 100,000 inverse square root calculations per second, assuming you&#x27;re pushing 100,000 polygons per second. Assuming a 100MHz CPU, the x87 inverse square root calculations would consume 11% of the CPU cycles, the fast inverse square root routine would consume 1% of the CPU cycles.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;X87#Performance" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;X87#Performance</a>')
