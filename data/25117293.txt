Most stuff that I&#x27;ve seen looks pretty academic, obscure, not very well maintained, etc ...<p>Pure [2] is the only practical language I&#x27;ve stumbled upon that appears to be general purpose _and_ based on term rewrite.<p>I wonder if XSLT could fall under this umbrella? It rewrites trees into other trees ... not sure if that&#x27;s enough to be considered a term rewrite system. If yes, then maybe CDuce is also an interesting thing to check.<p>The author of Ragel also has a program transformation system [4], but I&#x27;m not sure what state it is at, he seems to have been working on it for a long while but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be something nearly as popular as Ragel.<p>Edit: I think specter [5] and meander [6] also could be, perhaps tangentially, related to rewriting. Meander expressly mentions rewrite as inspiration&#x2F;fondation. Curiously these two look a lil bit like xpath&#x2F;xslt but with EDN as data model instead of XML infoset.<p>--<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_program_transformation_systems" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_program_transformation...</a><p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;agraef&#x2F;pure-lang" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;agraef&#x2F;pure-lang</a><p>3: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cduce.org&#x2F;#whatis" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cduce.org&#x2F;#whatis</a><p>4: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.colm.net&#x2F;open-source&#x2F;colm&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.colm.net&#x2F;open-source&#x2F;colm&#x2F;</a><p>5: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;redplanetlabs&#x2F;specter" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;redplanetlabs&#x2F;specter</a><p>6: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;noprompt&#x2F;meander" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;noprompt&#x2F;meander</a>')
