I don&#x27;t know what caste, except that he wasn&#x27;t Christian or Muslim, probably because he didn&#x27;t think it worth mentioning.  He hired based on demonstrated skill, so we had a diverse group of coworkers.  He actively encouraged the group to eat together, arranging meals out with careful consideration for the group&#x27;s preferences.  He was approachable, personable, considerate, friendly and kind.<p>People are people and stereotypes do not always fit.')
