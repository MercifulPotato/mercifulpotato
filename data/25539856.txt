But there no being a single certain measure of quality doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t some things that most people would call crap. Google employs a large number of search quality raters and these folks can likely distinguish the terrible from the OK.<p>Google is far from ideal and getting worse but you seem to be exposing a pure democracy of algorithm conformance, which is guaranteed to result in hot, steaming idiocy.')
