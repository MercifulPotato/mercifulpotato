Reading your comment about UI i guess you&#x27;ve heard of it regarding usage in World of Warcraft ? (that seems to be a subset of Lua proper by a simple googling)<p>Lua has de-facto been more or less the standard go-to scripting language for 20 years or so by now, i remember that we picked Lua for scripting a PS2&#x2F;Xbox game that was shipped in 2004 because it was already gaining popularity among other gamedevs(yes we were probably late on it).<p>Apart from those embedding it themselves (probably far more than is known publicly). There is literally countless Lua only games since it&#x27;s the base for user created games on the Roblox, Pico-8 and Love2d platforms.<p>These platform based games probably far outnumber those that embedded Lua because they are simple platforms to get started with, even my 12 year old kid is making Roblox games and writing Lua to wire up things.')
