I&#x27;m charging for it and don&#x27;t provide a trial since I think it&#x27;s worth the price for what you get (maybe even priced too low). A few people immediately ask if I&#x27;m planning on open sourcing it or else act disappointed that it&#x27;s not open source&#x2F;free.<p>It&#x27;s frustrating to work on something and have somebody just come along and say, &quot;Hey, that looks nice. Could I get it for free?&quot; I think it&#x27;s akin to artists who get requests for free art. The people asking generally think that it takes zero effort to create the art and that they should be entitled to a drawing.<p>It&#x27;s also kind of amazing that someone will easily spend a few dollars on games (often upwards of $60-70) or food + drinks, but they see software as something that absolutely has to justify its $5 or $10 price tag.')
