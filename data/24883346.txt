That’s what their minds can handle and that’s what the  market responds with.<p>TO expand on my other comment on this thread, I think what we need to do is train the next generation to handle and demand more, rather than lock them into appliances based on what the older generations supposedly can&#x27;t handle. Maybe we need to look to historic systems like Lisp machines, NLS (the subject of Engelbart&#x27;s &quot;mother of all demos&quot;), or the original PARC Smalltalk system to recapture a more ambitious vision for personal computers, from before Apple decided that they should be appliances.')
