I also think that you are building flippant strawman in &quot;shouldn&#x27;t be judged based on how nice she was to people and how great her writing skills were&quot;.<p>You dont want to judge people on their actions, you want to build enemies to make it easy to judge people. I am not interested in that. You dont care about what who believed, actually tried to push for and why the old system malfunctioned or was impossible to reform.')
