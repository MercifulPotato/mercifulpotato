The marginal costs are for additional power once you own the plant.<p>I believe around 80% of the lifetime cost of a fossil fuel plant is the fuel itself, so even if you&#x27;re gifted a plant for free it may not be economical to run.<p>The fly in the soup is intermittency, but grids are generally able to absorb more renewables (wholesale price dropping below 0 is the indicator saturation has happened). And electric cars are going to mean a bunch more dispatchable demand and eventually V2G.')
