You can get a good entry level canon (M50) and a quality kit lens for 600$<p>Or you can get a Sony A6100 and crappier kit lens for 700$<p>These cameras have significant strong (e.g. aps-c sensor size) capabilities not found in anything except mirrorless and DSLR cameras. Seems not to be overpriced to me.<p>Overpriced is like what nvidia does to the quattro cards...')
