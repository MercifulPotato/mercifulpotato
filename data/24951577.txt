The entire trilogy could be summed up as follows:  &quot;And God smote his enemies.&quot; Three books building up to a final conflict, and in the end it feels like one side wasn&#x27;t even needed, since God takes care of it anyway.<p>To boot, his use of allegory on Perelandra was just hideous. If you&#x27;re going to make an allegory, you don&#x27;t have a character <i>explain</i> the allegory while it&#x27;s in progress!')
