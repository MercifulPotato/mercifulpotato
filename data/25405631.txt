My crime? I was driving 100km&#x2F;h instead of the supposed speed limit of 80km&#x2F;h.<p>Every day I drive down that section I slow down to 80km&#x2F;h while everyone else rightfully drives at almost twice the speed at 130km&#x2F;h or even faster without getting a ticket. I don&#x27;t think this is safe. It&#x27;s also not good for me psychologically. It means the rules are stupid and arbitrary and not worth trusting.')
