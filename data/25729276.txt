Maybe there&#x27;s an accident, and police are directing traffic? Does the truck understand hand gestures (which aren&#x27;t necessarily standardized)? Or maybe the police aren&#x27;t there yet, damaged cars are blocking the road, and the truck may need to get out of the way for emergency services to arrive (possibly requiring going a little off road). These happen less on highways, but they still certainly happen, and not having a human in the loop can make things dramatically worse.<p>Do they have to stop at weigh stations? Do they understand the signage? I suppose most would have the system where you don&#x27;t have to stop, but I don&#x27;t know if all weigh stations support that.<p>There are lots of instances you can imagine that don&#x27;t require driving skills, but actually require a general intelligence with knowledge of the world around them.<p>(I suppose you can have a command center where someone can take control or give commands to the truck. Sounds tricky but possible).')
