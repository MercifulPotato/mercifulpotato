Item(by='oxfordmale', descendants=None, kids=[25464526], score=None, time=1608246027, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25459434, text='It is likely the seller flagged your review as off topic as it doesn&#x27;t actually cover the product. Any minor reference to the delivery (package arrived damaged) is reason for rejection. I had to rewrite a few negative reviews as they got initially rejected based on such technicalities. For one of the negative reviews I rewrote, the vendor contacted me and offered a refund for removing the negative review. Another vendor, who never delivered the package to my parents, tried to emotionally blackmail me suggesting their business would go bust and they would lose their house if I didn&#x27;t remove my negative review. I forwarded this to Amazon, but apparently this was all within the guidelines as no action was taken.')
