The functional impact of this arrangement is that manufacturers could take USB 3.0 products, slap a &#x27;USB 3.1&#x27; label on them, and market them as New and Improved for only the cost of new markings and marketing material.<p>Nice money if you can get it.<p>USB-C is even worse because every feature that end users actually want is optional and, in some cases (such as DP alternate mode lane support), isn&#x27;t even listed in the fine print. Customers who don&#x27;t have the awareness to spend many hours doing detailed research will very easily find themselves stuck in an expensive game of trial and error to buy USB-C devices that will actually work together.<p>Nice money if you can get it.<p>Like most modern tech products, the entire USB ecosystem reeks of the distinct smell of extractive scam.')
