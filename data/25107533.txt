So they opened the hatch back up and inspected it for “FOD” (I think foreign object debris). They found some piece of FOD, removed it, and closed the hatch again. Then the pressure test passed. I did not see the debrief where they said they’d talk more about what they found. But needless to say they are checking and fixing so many tiny and big things I’m sure.')
