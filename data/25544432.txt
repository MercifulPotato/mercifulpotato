Engineers nearly always overlook practicality and chase perfection.<p>Heres the thing: It&#x27;s not about efficiency, it&#x27;s about convenience. Transferring 2700 megajoules of energy to an f150 via gasoline in a few minutes is very convenient, something that would take a Tesla a few hours. If consumers were concerned with efficiency the same way engineers were, we&#x27;d all be driving electric hummers and cybertrucks.<p>Hydrogen isn&#x27;t aiming to be as efficient as batteries. It&#x27;s assuming to be as convenient as gasoline, but with little environmental impact.')
