Item(by='CryptoPunk', descendants=None, kids=[25251507], score=None, time=1606702255, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25246152, text='I&#x27;m referring to the terms &quot;institutional&quot; and &quot;racism&quot;, when put together. If an ideological camp wants to put the terms together, and refer to a class of properties that are not both institutional and racism, I have no obligation to accept their arbitrary redefinition of the terms, and I can point out that the term is extremely misleading, like the &quot;wage slavery&quot; used by Marxists.<p>&gt;&gt;This is just staring oneself blind on the letter of law, ignoring everything else. That&#x27;s not how societies work.<p>This is just ignoring what the terms &quot;institutional&quot; and &quot;racism&quot; mean, to push a grievance ideology narrative that castigates society.<p>I&#x27;m commenting on &quot;institutional racism&quot;, not racism in general. Institutional racism is &quot;racism that is embedded as normal practice within society&quot;, which only occurs through the mechanism of systemic properties like its laws or rules, or its social contract, just as I explained.<p>&gt;&gt;It&#x27;s pointless to discuss subjects with someone who will just redefine them entirely and then refuse to even recognize anything else<p>You&#x27;re the one redefining &quot;institutional&quot; and &quot;racism&quot;, and resorting to ad hominem when any one points out the pure absurdity of your narrative.')
