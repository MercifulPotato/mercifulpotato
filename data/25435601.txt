There&#x27;s very little local European news in the British media, and what does appear is often jokey and condescending or slanted in a negative.<p>A snowstorm in the US will get significant coverage, but an equivalent major weather event in France and Germany won&#x27;t.<p>The reality is the British Establishment simply doesn&#x27;t understand Europe as a social and political project. It has no clue what consensus building, social responsibility, and political integration are for, and simply sees the EU - at least, saw the EU - as an exploitable if rather shifty trading partner.<p>Now the EU is a competitor, the US has limited interest in the UK, the former commonwealth countries have been looking elsewhere, and the UK&#x27;s rather minimal level of independent leverage is about to become very obvious.')
