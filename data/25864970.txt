My other tweets to them, such as inquiring about a recent increase in spam, received replies.<p>I&#x27;ve admittedly put in very little effort to obtain postmortems from Fastmail. But I also posit that I shouldn&#x27;t have to. Postmortems should be made readily accessible, just as the outage was. I reserve my detective skills for figuring out my own service&#x27;s outages.')
