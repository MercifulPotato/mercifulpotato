You&#x27;re basically allowing educational institutions to sell green cards. If you thought almost-unlimited-student-loans inflated education prices, you don&#x27;t even want to see what selling green cards would do<p>That&#x27;s pretty much how it&#x27;s done in Australia. It props up a massive industry (education was the fourth largest export in 2018-2019) whilst ensuring a supply of qualified applicants for residency.<p>Prices for locals are still set by the government. So, whilst there is inflation, disadvantage to locals is limited to there being fewer places available to them. Whether it&#x27;s morally okay is another question but the economics seem to work out pretty well.')
