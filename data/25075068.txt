Now it just redirects to a spam&#x2F;ad website, but before HN had a search bar it was very useful.<p>Also interesting that it contains at #55: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;best" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;best</a><p>But not the ostensibly more useful: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;active" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;active</a><p>The url &quot;u.ly&#x2F;73I&quot; #63 is very interesting, its not seen almost anywhere else on the web (at least on Google), and is apparently spam, now, and when you click on mentions for that matter you get:<p>&gt; We found no comments matching u.ly&#x2F;73I<p>What&#x27;s the deal with that one?

It may be since some of the others were spam, like this one: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;l5v0b" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;l5v0b</a><p>It&#x27;s impressive how little spam spam (as opposed to submarines, this is where I link to PGs essay) is on HN.')
