I actually think it would be nice if more abandonware would be released but &quot;it&#x27;s too much effort&quot; and &quot;it exposes me to unknown risks, especially if I don&#x27;t take the effort to do due diligence&quot; are not silly excuses.<p>I did eventually open source some code from a popular shareware utility years ago after people asked me to. (No one ever did anything with it of course.) It took me a while because I did use some third party code but eventually decided the company that wrote the code was long gone and no one would care. But a business with lawyers would not have allowed that. And even documenting what would be needed to replace the routines would have taken a fair bit of work.')
