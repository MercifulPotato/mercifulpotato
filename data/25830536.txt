It’s definitely better in terms of ease of use. Still not as good as Pytorch, in my opinion. Pytorch is still just more... ergonomic, I would say.<p>However, I don’t think the Pytorch ecosystem really matches tensorflow yet for production, with TFX and all the other nice-to-haves that google and others have open sourced.<p>As someone who spends a lot of their time doing POCs and research work, I strongly prefer Pytorch. But I have colleagues who mainly productionize language models, and they all seem to like Tensorflow. I don’t know if that’s just inertia on their part, or the result of a considered choice however.')
