Spark was the in thing for a while so a lot of places are using it but probably don&#x27;t need it and could have been better off running various SQL scripts to do some transformations. I worked on a project exactly like this where we should have used SQL scripts instead of Spark.<p>But I also think that a lot of enterprise pipelines went all in on spark and so now moving to something else (SQL scripts, Snowflake, etc.) just isn&#x27;t worth it. So Spark is dead, long live Spark.')
