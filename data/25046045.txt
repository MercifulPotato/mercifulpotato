Item(by='RubenvanE', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605017296, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25046037, text='Hi Hacker News!<p>This summer I wanted to learn some new technologies, in particular Postgres, Hasura and Tailwind. To learn these technologies in a fun way I made HackerDaily. It’s a way to read Hacker News in a more informative and less addictive way.<p>I love the articles and conversations on Hacker News, the articles shared are enlightening and the conversations often add insight and nuance to the articles. Despite many HN users complaining that “it isn’t what it used to be” I think its still an awesome resource and one of the most civil communities on the internet. The problem is that (like all social platforms) it easily becomes too much of a slot machine. I think there are two main reasons. Firstly, it&#x27;s the constantly changing website: every few minutes the front page changes. Secondly, it&#x27;s easier to just read the comments than the articles themselves, since the articles are on a (often unknown) website that takes time to load; it also takes time to orient yourself with a new design before you can start reading the article itself.<p>HackerDaily is built to alleviate these problems as well as a few others:<p>- The posts are grouped per day, starting from yesterday. So, the posts on the front page get updated once a day (at midnight, your local time) and they are sorted by their score (only posts with a score above a hundred are shown).<p>- The articles are readable in an outline.com style so you don’t have to load a whole new webpage to read an article (and get the usual spam, pop-ups, and cookies). The webpages from which an article could be extracted are marked by the book icon in front of the title<p>- It has an improved collapsing comment system<p>- It’s a PWA, so you can install it to your homescreen and use it as an app<p>- It has a dark mode<p>- It&#x27;s open source[1]<p>Maybe some of you can also find value in it. Any feedback is appreciated!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackerdaily.io&#x2F;opensource" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackerdaily.io&#x2F;opensource</a>')
