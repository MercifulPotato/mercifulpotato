It’s the worst precedent you can ever set.” as if it’s an equally unquestionable fact that this is a bad thing with no good side effects.<p>I’ve spent 20 minutes scanning the discussion, and didn’t see anybody saying “there are both pros and cons here, but on balance, I think this is mostly-[good&#x2F;bad]” - only 100% one way or the other :( (Feel free to correct me if there’s a ton of posts like this that I somehow missed)<p>How can we be so sure we know what’s best for a platform of billions, when we can’t even stop our own community of thousands from being so polarised?
