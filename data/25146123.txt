So it is not far fetched to assume whatever MS is doing with Pluton would at the very least not prevent Linux or BSDs from booting on x86 hardware. And with the Microsoft of today they might even release the specs - after all there is talk about Pluton being used in Azure - and Linux&#x2F;BSDs can benefit from it too.')
