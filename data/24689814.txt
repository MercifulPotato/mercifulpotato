It&#x27;s a great product, apparently we&#x27;ve been happy customers since they were 20x smaller :)<p>I found the note about luck in the Zero to One section interesting. I don&#x27;t know anyone who runs a bootstrapped SaaS that&#x27;s made it past 1M, who doesn&#x27;t feel like they got super lucky with their first customer. We did exactly the same thing - a random connection that just happened to work out. And yet, most people starting new companies don&#x27;t seem to focus much on making this luck happen.')
