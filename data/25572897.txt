The ideology and methods of naturopathy are based on vitalism and folk medicine, rather than evidence-based medicine (EBM).[2] Naturopathic practitioners generally recommend against following modern medical practices, including but not limited to medical testing, drugs, vaccinations, and surgery.[3][4][5][6] Instead, naturopathic practice relies on unscientific notions, often leading naturopaths to diagnoses and treatments that have no factual merit.[7][8]<p>&gt;Naturopathy is considered by the medical profession to be ineffective and harmful, raising ethical issues about its practice.[7][9][10] In addition to condemnations and criticism from the medical community, such as the American Cancer Society,[11] naturopaths have repeatedly been denounced as and accused of being charlatans and practicing quackery.[7][12][13][14][15][16]<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Naturopathy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Naturopathy</a>')
