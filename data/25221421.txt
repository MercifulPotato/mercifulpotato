It&#x27;s very interesting. Maybe it&#x27;s on the Blender roadmap to become attractive to movie studios, but I haven&#x27;t checked.<p>A question on pipelines: are those different from what&#x27;s mentioned on Blender&#x27;s Pipeline page? [1]<p>&gt; Finally, the major studios like to have support contracts to expedite fixes to blocking issues.<p>It seems like blender has something along those lines provided by the Blender Institute [2]<p>&gt;&gt; Co-Development with Blender Institute<p>&gt;&gt; If your company or studio has specific development targets or needs, you can contact the Blender Institute to discuss options.<p>&gt;&gt; We will hire or involve the developers for topics that align well with the Blender roadmap <i>and</i> benefit the contractor well. Such agreements can have milestones and deliverables. Co-development will especially work well when aligned to other projects that run in Blender Institute. Only projects that involve multiple months of work will be taken in consideration.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blender.org&#x2F;features&#x2F;pipeline&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blender.org&#x2F;features&#x2F;pipeline&#x2F;</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blender.org&#x2F;foundation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blender.org&#x2F;foundation&#x2F;</a>')
