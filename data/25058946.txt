None of these can satisfy the energy needs. We have data[1]. The only technology that displaces cole &amp; natural gas power supplies is nuclear (&amp; hydro technically but that&#x27;s generally tapped out).<p>To me, Professor MV Ramana in the article raises far more valuable concerns&#x2F;questions than Greenpeace &amp; he&#x27;s actually an expert on SMR and nuclear energy policy:<p>&gt; He says UK SMR&#x27;s 10-year time-scale for its first plant may prove optimistic. The one constant in the history of the nuclear industry to date is that big new concepts never come in on time and budget, he says.<p>&gt; He is sceptical[sic] that the factory concept can deliver significant cost savings given the complexity and scale of even a small nuclear plant. Smaller plants will have to meet the same rigorous safety standards as big ones, he points out.<p>&gt; He says where the concept has been tried elsewhere - in the US and China, for example - there have been long delays and costs have ended up being comparable to large nuclear power stations.<p>&gt; Finally, he questions whether there will be a market for these plants by the 2030s, when UK SMR says the first will be ready.<p>&gt; &quot;Ten years from now, the competition will be renewables which are going to be far cheaper with much better storage technology than we have today,&quot; says Prof Ramana.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ted.com&#x2F;talks&#x2F;michael_shellenberger_how_fear_of_nuclear_power_is_hurting_the_environment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ted.com&#x2F;talks&#x2F;michael_shellenberger_how_fear_of_...</a>')
