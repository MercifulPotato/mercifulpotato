Browser vendors choose not to ship standards that major browsers don&#x27;t all agree on, which means that Apple&#x27;s singular objection scuttles the process by design.<p>Of course this is one of the risks you have with standards, one bad actor can screw everything up. It&#x27;s why standards often suck and it&#x27;s a happy miracle that the web is as good as it is. When Apple themselves are screwing up a standard that they directly compete with (web vs native iOS), well, that&#x27;s just too convenient for them.')
