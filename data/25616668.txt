Everything runs from a big NFS cluster.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deadline.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;weta-digital-pacts-with-amazon-web-services-for-cloud-based-visual-effects-and-animation-1234568247&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deadline.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;weta-digital-pacts-with-amazon-...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.itnews.com.au&#x2F;news&#x2F;dreamworks-animation-steps-towards-hybrid-cloud-486393" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.itnews.com.au&#x2F;news&#x2F;dreamworks-animation-steps-to...</a>')
