Good advice for a junior developer writing WordPress plugins is not good advice for a mid-career embedded systems engineer, which is not good advice for a senior machine learning specialist.<p>Don&#x27;t give advice to strangers about chronic medical conditions without first taking a few minutes to learn about their situation. If you&#x27;re not comfortable asking about how long they&#x27;ve had the condition and what remedies they&#x27;ve already tried, then you&#x27;re in no position to offer advice. It should go without saying that if the person doesn&#x27;t want to discuss the details of their condition, then they don&#x27;t want advice.<p>Context matters, people.')
