Religion invokes various kinds of altruism - often though not always limited to the in-group - and it clearly &quot;works&quot; in some sense and has survived for millennia. I guess it&#x27;s hard to recommend religion to someone on that basis though, because that is not the basis that religion recommends itself on. You can&#x27;t become a Christian because you think (like Rodney Stark) that Christians are very helpful to each other. You can only be a Christian by accepting Christ as your personal saviour.')
