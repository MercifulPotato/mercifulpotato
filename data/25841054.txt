If the batteries are non replaceable you&#x27;ve essentially made a disposable car with a 10-year working life. By comparison, my current ICE car is ~12 years old and less than 1&#x2F;5th through the useful life of the engine. This is quite possibly one of the most decadent and completely wasteful things I&#x27;ve ever seen.')
