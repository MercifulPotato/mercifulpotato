No matter how terrible.  I can see one star after one star helpful review but it will still be 4.5 stars for items that just fall apart and are obviously defective.  The sellers just game the reviews until they get to that magic 4.5.<p>Goodhart&#x27;s Law: “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”<p>Luckily Amazon will take back anything and they are eating massive return costs from me for not having working, non-gamed reviews.')
