Are you sure? AFAIK, that&#x27;s pretty much impossible in Erlang&#x2F;Elixir.<p>I do get with what you are saying with the second part of your post. That can indeed become an issue sometimes. Certainly one that I&#x27;ve struggled with myself, especially when things were still new to me.<p>But in my experiences, all those (apparent) conflicts&#x2F;challenges can be mitigated&#x2F;solved with proper architecture. Granted, that takes experience, which not all programmers may have (yet).<p>At the end of the day, programming is a skill and (inexperienced) programmers can always dig themselves a hole, in any language. Elixir is not a silver bullet, that magically solves problems without having to work (hard) on finding the right solution&#x2F;architecture for a given (complex) problem. Still, in my experience, Elixir makes large&#x2F;complex distributed systems, and in particular concurrency, a heck of a lot easier than it used to be (for me).<p>#jm2c')
