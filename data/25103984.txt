I&#x27;ve worked in places that had a dogmatic aversion to ever writing raw SQL, and to a one they always suffered for it in performance sensitive code.<p>At the places who did handle this well, the &quot;high-performance code&quot; that needs to be hand-tuned SQL is usually much smaller than you think (a few queries here and there), and ActiveRecord is still great for your simple queries or for smallish tables.')
