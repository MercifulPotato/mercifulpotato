It tells you it&#x27;s doing this but offers no ability to opt out.<p>Subsequent updates have restored the autoupdate switch to on, explicitly reverting my choice. It&#x27;s now part of my iOS point release update checklist to ensure that autoupdates are disabled.<p>I don&#x27;t think Gruber is being entirely up-front here. Apple very aggressively wants all iOS devices on the latest supported version.')
