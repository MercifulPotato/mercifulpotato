Item(by='wott', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609074302, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25549478, text='&gt; As a European I ask myself why thereâ€™s no proportional voting system at all in the US.<p>As a European, the elections in my country are:<p>-- Presidential: uninominal majority (of course).<p>-- Assembly: uninominal majority.<p>-- Senate: no universal vote, voters emanate (mostly) from municipal councils majorities.<p>-- Regional: allegedly proportional lists, but in fact a majority vote, since the leading list gets a majority bonus of 25% of the seats, and then only proportional applies (and still, it is a two-round vote in which lists under 12.5% are evicted from the first round, and then can be evicted again at the second round, even from proportional). So in practice the leading list is always granted more than 50% of the seats.<p>-- Departmental: uninominal majority<p>-- Municipal: in large towns, allegedly proportional lists, but in fact a majority vote, since the leading list gets a majority bonus of 50%!!! so there is not even a slight theoretical possibility of having a balance; in villages: plurinominal majority (so a list where every member gets 50%+1 votes gets 100% of seats).<p>So, not a single actual proportional election, even in those which purport to be such.<p>(That&#x27;s France, if you wonder.)<p>As a practical note, I would like to add that concerning the Assembly, the uninominal voting system used to produce a sort of balanced result, because of differences in history, culture, sociology, traditions and so on in different voting districts; but at present the populations are mixed, the medias are national, everything is more standardised, and so votes are more uniform, and as a consequence a party who has a small lead now has it almost everywhere and can get an overwhelming majority of seats despite only having that small lead.')
