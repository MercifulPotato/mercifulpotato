Like, &quot;Obviously I&#x27;m perfect, but to give you something to do, I added a mistake, and now it&#x27;s your job to go digging around for it.&quot;<p>Instead, I try to reassure junior developers that they should feel comfortable making suggestions and asking questions in the code review, even if they&#x27;re not finding things that are officially &quot;bugs.&quot;')
