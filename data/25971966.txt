Their PR releases claiming this was clearing house related was already highly dubious, and is self-contradicting because they are blaming it on a liquidity issue while saying it&#x27;s not a liquidity issue.<p>But this is happening at the same time was mass account withdrawals&#x2F;closures, and we&#x27;re now learning this not only threatens their general solvency but ability to execute trades. This could easily cause a feedback loop that empties their accounts, at which point people are going to be unable to withdraw their cash which is goign to cause a bank run and drill the nails into their coffin even further.  Healthy companies don&#x27;t need to emergency borrow a billion dollars. If you have less than $250,000 on Robinhood, your account is FDIC insured so you&#x27;ll eventually get your money back...but I think most people would prefer not to go through that process.<p>Robinhood is on a death spiral and prudent financial advice is to move any assets you have off of it as soon as possible.')
