Note that objects sending messages to other objects has very little to do with that â€“ it would look more like lots of identical objects emitting lots of identical messages into a shared medium, and lots of objects receiving none, some, or many of those messages (a stochastical process) and reacting in a more or less deterministic manner.<p>Such a system would be hell to develop, debug, and maintain. Which is why we don&#x27;t design systems that way. Which is exactly my point.')
