You identify something Google doesn&#x27;t deliver and which people care about enough to use your search engine. I don&#x27;t think anyone knows right know what that hypothetical killer feature is, and most probably assume it doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>On another level, though, incumbents have a habit of buying potential threats (which can be a pretty good deal when you&#x27;re in venture capital land and need to show your shareholders high returns). Google&#x27;s bought a number of companies with a different take on search over the years, such as Like.com and Clever Sense.')
