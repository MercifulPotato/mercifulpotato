In particular, it has the &quot;signal&quot; package which is a somewhat limited clone of the corresponding matlab toolbox.  Depending on your specific needs it may be alright for your application.  In my experience the &quot;core&quot; parts of packages are well-replicated, but the user-interfaces are somewhat lacking in the octave side.  Since I use octave mostly non-interactively, I do not really care about that.')
