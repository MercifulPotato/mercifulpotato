Breakthrough Listen may be the world&#x27;s largest SETI program, but it is certainly not the world&#x27;s largest program, whatever that would even mean.<p>So this is some particular group of SETI specialists, which I highly doubt represents the interests of the astronomical community at large (I would guess that only a small fraction of astronomers even work on SETI).<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m not criticizing the project itself, just the misleading title of the article and the general decline in journalistic standards.')
