This particular pesticide comes in the form of a pill, which is planted with the seed.<p>2. It is very targeted on a particular pest (german name is Rübenrüsselkäfer).<p>3. Without it, the whole field will be lost.<p>4. The replacement is a conventional broad band pesticide. It kills everything. He said that after using it once, when he walked the field he saw all kinds of dead bugs and worms - which are kinda important for the soil as well. He said &quot;farming like this makes no sense&quot; and stopped growing sugar beets.<p>The real killer however is this:<p>5. Sugar beets do not blossom.')
