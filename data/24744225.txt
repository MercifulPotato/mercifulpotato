Even for simple software you don&#x27;t want to clobber rendering and collision detection together into the same object. The algorithms also naturally become O(n^2) and it&#x27;s not possible to fix that without major rewrites, undoing the OOP. OOP is notoriously bad for CD. I&#x27;d suggest a simple data oriented design approach here, e.g. pushing collisions into a new container instead of setting flags in some object that the rendering code then uses.')
