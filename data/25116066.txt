Especially early on, when we didn’t know much, it provided a rich universe of interesting economic, tactical, and strategic problems to solve.  I spent countless hours studying the game, practicing, competing, and hanging out on the MrFixit forum.  I once played one AOE game after another nonstop for 33 hours.  Like you and many others, I eventually concluded it was too much of a distraction and uninstalled it permanently in order to focus on other endeavors.  That was about 18 years ago.  It’s nice to see there are still plenty of people enjoying the game.')
