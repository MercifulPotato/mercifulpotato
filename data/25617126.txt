You may have some brand new 96 core 512 GB RAM machines mixed in with some several year old 8 core 32 GB machines. When a technical artist is submitting their work to be rendered on the farm, they often have an idea of how expensive their task will be. They will request a certain number of cores from the farm and a scheduler will go through and try to optimize everyone&#x27;s requests across the available machines.')
