I&#x27;m not sure what happens across the sound barrier, but I believe it gets worse.<p>There is a wikipedia article on the topic (of course): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fuel_economy_in_aircraft" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fuel_economy_in_aircraft</a><p>&quot;Concorde, a supersonic transport, managed about 17 passenger-miles to the Imperial gallon, which is 16.7 L&#x2F;100 km per passenger; similar to a business jet, but much worse than a subsonic turbofan aircraft. Airbus states a fuel rate consumption of their A380 at less than 3 L&#x2F;100 km per passenger&quot;<p>But the real comparison should not be between subsonic and supersonic trans-ocean business trips. It should be between taking the trip or not taking the trip at all. The best way to reduce emissions is to avoid long-distance air travel completely.')
