Sometimes this act is talked about as if there was some email address like public_messaging@florida.gov or whatever, and someone sent an email to that address (which forwards it to thousands of other people). IANAL but I&#x27;d imagine that would not be illegal.<p>The other possibility is that there is some marginally secured website, where you log in with user:admin, password:password, and from there you can send a message to thousands of people. I&#x27;d imagine doing that without authorization, even if the security is dead simple and easy to bypass, would be illegal.<p>My guess is that the latter is what happened, and they have a comcast IP address logged which is associated with her address.<p>Maybe she didn&#x27;t do it, but it seems likely she did. Perhaps her husband did, because he found the common username&#x2F;password on a sticky note in their office?<p>In any case, some law was probably broken by someone in that household.<p>Regarding the guns drawn while serving the search warrant, the only thing I can say is that yes, it appears silly to think that someone who just really cares about COVID procedures is going to kill some cops, but dumber things have happened that resulted in the death of a cop - things which they probably watched training videos on - and police have been trained to protect themselves first rather than risk being overpowered.<p>If she really did wait 20 minutes to come down after the police served the search warrant, I can&#x27;t blame them for having their hackles up.')
