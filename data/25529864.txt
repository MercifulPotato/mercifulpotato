We were in Tahoe. He was playing... blackjack?  craps?  He wasn&#x27;t great at either but he got a high off small wins. After losing a couple grand (not tens), he started making noise about having spent his rent money. He was probably looking for some kind of empathy but I don&#x27;t have it for foolish decisions. I told him the same thing I&#x27;d tell you, if we were friends or family: Don&#x27;t gamble with money you can&#x27;t afford to lose.<p>I&#x27;ve bought and sold some crypto. Nothing earth shattering. I&#x27;ve made a couple bucks and lost a couple. Same with cheap stocks. I get a thrill out of gambling too but I would never stake my livelihood on it. I wouldn&#x27;t take a job where the base comp couldn&#x27;t support my family, no matter how many options, and I won&#x27;t risk my mortgages.')
