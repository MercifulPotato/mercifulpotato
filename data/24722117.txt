Such as the recipe example.<p>So someone who authors a WordPress plugin for recipes could incorporate it.  Or, and this is more scalable but obviously very difficult, it may be possible to create plugins for web frameworks that automatically inject the semantic markup using AI.  Maybe.<p>Then there could be another AI program that converts natural language queries into semantic knowledge queries.<p>But I think that AI could play a big part in rolling it out.  I mean, if you had the AI systems without the semantic web, for open systems you would still want a way for them to share data unambiguously.')
