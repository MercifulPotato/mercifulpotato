I have one comment:<p><i>&gt; The equivalent of `finally`&#x2F;destructors is `unwind-protect`, which has to interoperate with the condition mechanism but doesn&#x27;t deal with conditions itself.</i><p>It actually doesn&#x27;t need to interoperate with the condition system; it has to interoperate with the stack-unwinding primitives - `go`&#x2F;`tagbody`, `return-from`&#x2F;`block`, and `throw`&#x2F;`catch` - that are one of the foundations of the condition system.<p>If it works with those, then it works with a condition system, since all control flow that happens inside the condition system is a derivative of those primitive operators.')
