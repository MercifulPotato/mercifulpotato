The conflict of interest between Robinhood and Citadel is just too great.<p>This.  A thousand times this.<p>I&#x27;m so sick of people dismissing everyone&#x27;s concerns as as conspiracy theories.  There is a clear motivation for RH&#x27;s actions, basically nothing stopping them from acting on that motivation, and <i>billions of dollars on the line.</i>  Their alibi seems to check out, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they acted appropriately or that we shouldn&#x27;t investigate them to be sure.')
