It&#x27;s not for everyone, and I don&#x27;t know if I actually recommend it, but here&#x27;s how:<p>- Audiobooks at 2-3x speed. I listen while doing chores, while walking my baby in a stroller, while eating (not socially), going to bed, driving, etc.<p>- Ebooks, with a text-to-speech reader (I use @Voice aloud on Android). It takes more work to get used to, but I find that I can listen at a faster speed (3-4x) due to the clarity and regularity of the sound. Whereas (for fiction) an audiobook is a performance by a professional actor, this method is much closer to reading a physical book â€“ after a while the voice of the machine fades and your own brain adds the richness of voice and tone (like you do with a physical book).<p>For both options, it takes practice to reach the levels I&#x27;m at. I think it&#x27;s worth doing so, as it&#x27;s a skill which pays large dividends over time. I should also note that more than 50% of these &quot;100+&quot; books are heavy-plot fiction. I slow down the playback speed for non-fiction I need to think about more carefully, or types of fiction where the quality and subtly of the prose is a major feature.')
