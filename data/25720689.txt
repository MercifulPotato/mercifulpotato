I meant the wholesale import of a school of knowledge to a new place. As happened for instance with the arrival of many modern sciences in the US; lots of fields where everybody&#x27;s family tree goes back to germany.<p>The germans you mention were certainly well-informed about foreign traditions, but their knowledge didn&#x27;t create a living continuation of these traditions where they ended up.<p>(The context is, since it&#x27;s been a few hours, was a claim that education was a way to circumvent this 50-year institutional forgetting, which I took to mean national institutions. And the counter-claim is that many places have good education and terrible institutions, why haven&#x27;t they imported this ersatz institutional memory? If it works for local preservation, why doesn&#x27;t it work for international transplanting? And I don&#x27;t completely know, but the successful international knowledge grafts seem to be technical subjects. )')
