For the suffix case you need backward matching to confirm the regex match after the substring match. Hyperscan actually decomposes the entire state machine graph into &#x27;re1 string re2&#x27; style fragments, which lets them select the fastest implementation technique for each sub-machine.<p>I think Russ Cox talks about backward matching in his article series on regular expressions, so it&#x27;s probably used somewhere in re2.')
