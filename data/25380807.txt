It must be easy just to think I&#x27;m some fringe element going nutso like some Trump supporter living in Florida.   I&#x27;m far from that.   Go ahead, treat all arguments with anyone you disagree with that way.   You may feel right, but it&#x27;s not right, and the more you dismiss someone based on that the worse you will get surprised.<p>All I said was that we don&#x27;t have to speak like we don&#x27;t know that someone is a man or woman with a high degree of certainty, based on a name.  Bending over backwards to neuter someone&#x27;s pronoun on a 1% chance is silly.<p>I guess that makes me a grammatical nitpicker if you can only oversimplify it.  And sure, attribute it however you like, but I don&#x27;t speak in vagaries when something is specific and known.  And it counters an accurate use of the English language, for some political purpose.<p>I&#x27;m against the dumbing down of discourse at the hands of people who are riding the latest bandwagon, and on other people&#x27;s behalf no less.<p>Finally, about your example of obscuring during someone&#x27;s hiring candidacy by calling him&#x2F;her &quot;they&quot;.  That is ridiculous to the extreme.   I guess that&#x27;s what happens when you buy into the idea that your world is dominated by evil bias, and everyone around you is repeating that mantra.')
