The further the voter is from the matter of the voting, the less informed the vote is.<p>Voting for local changes or electing an official  within your small village or a city precinct works well, because the voters both actually know what the matter is, and directly feel the consequences. This is how it works in the only directly democratic country I know, Switzerland.<p>OTOH voting for a national leader in a country with 100M population cannot enjoy the same effect. Very few people have any opinion about candidates based on more or less close interaction. Neatly all opinions are manufactured by the PR people hired by the candidates, publicity stunts, and the big media. Getting more useful information is hard. This is why elections tend to become a popularity contest and involve emotionally overloaded rooting not unlike on a stadium. This is not how you can make a balanced, rational choice which can keep a democracy running well.')
