Unfortunately, I think the documentation is perhaps more intimidating than the tool (its target audience is programming language theorists; not people who just like noodling around with programming language design).<p>My favorite Redex hack is that you surface your Redex model as a hashlang (Racket&#x27;s way of providing replacing&#x2F;extending the language), and get a fully-featured algebraic stepper in DrRacket!
