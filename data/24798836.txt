Zero sum end-game: the subjugated class comprise the entire world. (I&#x27;m not sure I actually believe this can happen.)<p>Also, there isn&#x27;t always a determined individual or cadre that decides on a goal of total domination. There are structural societal issues that tend to progress in one direction. It&#x27;s politically harder to repeal laws that were put in place for reasons of &quot;security&quot; and were built on fear. Not always, but often. This tends to secure power in the hands of the few, over an expanding swathe of the public.')
