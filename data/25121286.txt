I listened to parts of it. My dilemma is that my notion of divinity&#x2F;god&#x2F;theisâ€™ has its beginnings in Hinduism, the religion of my ancestors.<p>I reject all monotheistic&#x2F;Abrahamic faith based notions outright.<p>When I first came to the United States and became a card carrying member of American atheists, I was carried away. Rationalism was the name of my game. Except ...what if a religion can be religion? But soon I realized that my polytheistic faith of birth origin was a completely different animal. And I had to start from scratch again. I called myself agnostic and then ignostic rather than atheist.<p>I outright reject all monotheistic notions of God as in organized monotheist religion but I do recognize the common strain it shares with polytheistic faith that is Hinduism. So..what is THAT? It is just a deeper layer of religion that delves deep beyond superficial notions and motions of organized religion. That is just the packaging. What is The Gift? I want that. If it exists. A rational religion and a compatible God. How wonderful would that be!!')
