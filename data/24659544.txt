For instance, the data IO doesnâ€™t limit the system throughout of iteratively running a hash algorithm a million times, the CPU does. An IO bound process might be something like reading a lot of data off a disk (or over a network) with a small, quick transformation on the CPU. Where you saturate the data bus, but the CPU is comparatively idle.')
