I built Forgo because React is no longer &quot;it&#x27;s just JS&quot; (actually it never was). The patterns, practices and vocabulary used in the React ecosystem present considerable hurdles to a newbie - hooks, reducers, actions, flux etc. All of them are React specific, and locks the developer into framework related knowledge.<p>But there is one idea from React which made a ton of sense; from the time I started using it nearly seven years back. That&#x27;s JSX - instead of shoehorning expressions into markup, move markup into the programming language. Forgo embraces JSX and skips most of the other ideas in React in favor of a more plain vanilla approach.')
