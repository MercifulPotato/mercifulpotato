When the number is greater than 1000, you always upgrade your unit, so that the numerical value is never greater than 1000 [0]. Instead of &quot;1500 Hz&quot;, You say &quot;1.5 kHz&quot;. OP is an engineer and I guess she has been trained to always do it.<p>[0] These rules are not always enforced, and there are alternative notations, but the 1-1000 rule is the most common convention, writing &quot;3500 MHz&quot; instead of &quot;3.5 GHz&quot; is just awkward.')
