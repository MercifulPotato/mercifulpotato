Some work better on low alphabets (eg DNA), some are better for text or high entropy data, some take advantage of CPU instructions, some are generic.  The real challenge is picking the right algorithm.<p>I&#x27;ve implemented a few of them in java here, and extended them to support multi byte matching at any position:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nishihatapalmer&#x2F;byteseek" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nishihatapalmer&#x2F;byteseek</a>')
