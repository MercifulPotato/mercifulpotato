There&#x27;s no other option other than handing over your phone number which is a horrific idea. Just search SIM-swapping attacks (very common) or SS7 attacks (rare). You&#x27;ll be surprised.<p>If you really want to use Signal, buy a throwaway SIM or probably use a Google Voice number to verify and login.<p>Honestly, I personally don&#x27;t recommend using Signal unless they get rid of that phone number verification &#x2F; login process. But I also don&#x27;t blame general users for not using Element (Matrix) either (Which I think is more secure and works without a phone number, but it is unfriendly to use compared to Signal).')
