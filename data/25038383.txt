The fact is that many central banks have failed in the past, and is failing today (see Venezuela). That is not a leftist or rightist position, that is just reality. He also makes a huge and inexcusable omission of the 2008 financial crisis and the Occupy movement under which Bitcoin was created from. This omission is intellectually dishonest as the Occupy movement and “too big to fail” are leftist movements that parallels Bitcoin’s development. In summary, the author’s thesis is incorrect and over simplified. Even if he was correct, the viewpoint is so narrow (looking at Bitcoin in the current American political context) that his analysis has limited use.”<p>Emojipaste is broken so… emoji face with rolling eyes….&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;standardcrypto.wordpress.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;30&#x2F;whiny-academic-whines-about-bitcoin&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;standardcrypto.wordpress.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;30&#x2F;whiny-academ...</a>')
