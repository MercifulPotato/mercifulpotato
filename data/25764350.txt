It&#x27;s very rewarding, and I intend to keep growing after lockdown ends. Writing marketing copy is harder than mentoring for me, so my website is lacklustre, but it works well enough at hosting my calendly link:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imagineer.school" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imagineer.school</a><p>Mentorship doesn&#x27;t replace the entire school experience, though. For that, I&#x27;m using the Sudbury Valley School model, and once everyone is vaccinated we&#x27;ll open a K-12 physical school in Toronto 2025.<p>Is anyone else here working on democratic education models?')
