Whether it&#x27;s cost, frequency, coverage, reliability, frequency, comfort, etc., something that seems perfectly adequate or even pretty great to a sometimes visitor seems less so if you&#x27;re commuting at rush hour every day in all sorts of weather.<p>You mention Swiss train service for example which seemed pretty great as a visitor--but it sure wasn&#x27;t cheap as is true of a lot of European train service. Ditto for the Shinkanzen in Japan.<p>My personal experience is Boston. As someone who takes rail into the city and then the subway maybe a few times a year, it seems just fine. When I depended on it for regular commuting, I did not love it.')
