I don&#x27;t (personally) agree that the &#x27;black lives matter&#x27; protests should be considered as &#x27;terrorism&#x27;, because fundamentally they began as a protest against the systematic mistreatment of a certain race&#x2F;demographic of people. While it can be viewed as political, it&#x27;s not <i>quite</i> the same as &#x27;storming the capital of a country to overturn the result of an election&#x27;, which is undeniably a political goal. While some BLM rioters eventually did conduct what could be described as terrorist acts, it fundamentally isn&#x27;t the same thing.<p>2. You&#x27;re welcome to disagree on that point, but it&#x27;s not what&#x27;s being discussed in this thread.<p>3. Yes, media overreach is an issue, but it&#x27;s not the topic of the conversation.<p>4. I am still sad that people are trying to downplay the issue, and not just because some people don&#x27;t want to call it terrorism. People saying &#x27;oh in the future it won&#x27;t even be remembered&#x27; etc etc is also problematic as it&#x27;s downplaying the event itself.<p>Edit: Added point 2')
