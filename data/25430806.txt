It&#x27;s basically impossible to get new housing development, and the &quot;affordable housing&quot; requirements for any new development in this place have been 100% seniors-only (i.e. aged 55+) housing in the last few years.<p>The local government committee meetings on these matters is predominantly filled by two groups of people: those same seniors, and people who are effectively independently wealthy. It&#x27;s NIMBY-ism all over the place here driven primarily by the wealthy and the old. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the same in other communities or towns in this area, but that&#x27;s what it is here.')
