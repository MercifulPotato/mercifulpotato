Item(by='coldtea', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610968834, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25819935, text='&gt;<i>Even things like selecting text, or moving the cursor around are super non-standard and complicated</i><p>This doesn&#x27;t even make sense. Those things in XCode are as bog standard as it gets, and I&#x27;ve also used vim, Eclipse, Idea, ST and nowadays VSCode.<p>I&#x27;d buy the UI setup (with connections between actions etc) being confusing in XCode (especially things like Storyboards), but text editing? Cant even understand what you could mean. Any concrete example?')
