It&#x27;s stable, it&#x27;s well-understood, there&#x27;s a ton of examples and docs everywhere and it hasn&#x27;t changed much in a decade.<p>I&#x27;m mainly an Android developer, so I&#x27;ve never made anything serious for the Apple ecosystem (only some tiny Mac apps for myself), but I just hate moving targets with burning passion. It&#x27;s hilarious to look at all the &quot;community&quot; with their Kotlin and support libraries and jetpack and other abstract-the-evil-OS-away stuff changing and breaking everything three times a month while the only changes I see myself are those to the raw underlying system APIs whenever there&#x27;s a major OS release.')
