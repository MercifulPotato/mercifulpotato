Utterly.<p>People work for incentives. People on HN work on their startups - why?<p>They could get a SW job and leave the stress behind, why do they have to struggle?<p>Some people will take the basics and be happy - thats their call. MANY others will do what it takes to get paid because that is what they want.<p>So if you aren&#x27;t getting enough fruit pickers, well pay more. If apparently your going rate isn&#x27;t high enough, well then those strawberries are perhaps not economically viable in the first place, since no one in your economy wants to do that work.<p>Obviously its a lot more complex, but the essence of economics is always - people act according to incentives.')
