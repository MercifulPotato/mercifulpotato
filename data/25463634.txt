And how often have you lost weight eating junk food yourself? I have done it...no effect. Satiety doesn&#x27;t matter...thinking that it does is why people don&#x27;t lose weight. You will be hungry, it will be unpleasant, but continue. Again, this is the fat person with the diet soda effect...most diets that exist don&#x27;t work, that is why there are so many fat people. Reduce it to something simple, measurable, and it works. The idea of Good&#x2F;Bad food is destructive for weight loss because it introduces guilt and complexity.<p>Also, your basal metabolic rate means you can lose weight eating two medium pizzas a day...again, it is very hard to gain weight the way many people do, it is competitive eating amounts of greed done daily, and very few people have a strong idea of the calories in food...just vague moralising about Good and Bad.')
