Thanks HN commenters, glad you’ve got my back.<p>Edit: I know it’s frowned upon to complain about downvotes but <i>give me a fucking break</i>. I’ve been almost killed cycling perfectly safely in supposedly safe areas, both because of the design and because people have literally used their cars as weapons. If you want me dead because I don’t find that acceptable for my own transport, downvote away. If I’ve said anything else harmful to the discussion please have the decency to explain what it was.')
