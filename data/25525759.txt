I don&#x27;t agree with that happening either but to say they are regularly deported just isn&#x27;t true.<p>If you serve in the armed forces and don&#x27;t commit crimes, and apply for citizenship you will most likely get it.<p>Also the US accepts alot more immigrants than Japan, China, and many other countries.<p>Most of the complaints about immigration come down to this, there is much more demand than &quot;supply&quot;.')
