Bigotry is not static. It&#x27;s a dynamic reaction to progress being made in the rest of society.<p>Her views are not a reaction to fringe whackjobs on twitter screaming for some rights that the rest of society is not willing to give them.<p>Her views are a reaction to changes in government policy that do not happen overnight, are themselves a result of decades of progress made in conjunction with medical and scientific subject matter experts.<p>&gt;  they are thought out, and reasonable.<p>They are not. They are based on strawmen interpretations of trans people&#x27;s lived experiences, and their desired outcomes. It would take a really long time to go through all her points and point out the various logical flaws in it, but the main issue is they are founded on her own personal beliefs, anxieties, and prior trauma, not a reasonable detached view of the status quo. Contrapoints just did a pretty thorough deep dive analysis[1].<p>&gt; The issue is not &#x27;people not buying her books&#x27; - the issue is that people are trying to suppress and silence her<p>An author&#x27;s interaction with their audience, and their &quot;platform&quot; goes far beyond the books they publish. They have other channels, and other ways to reach people - in Rowling&#x27;s case millions of people, primarily children.<p>While not everyone would agree with me on this, but if Rowling was quietly harboring transphobic beliefs, and made no further follow-up, I wouldn&#x27;t care, and there would be no uproar.<p>Instead, she is using her notability, credibility, and large reach to post long essays promoting an opinion that is intended to regress social progress, and make life harder for trans youth (including lack of access to medical resources, increased bullying, and the corresponding increase with depression&#x2F;suicide)<p>So, again, what you&#x27;re calling suppression and silencing is simply consequences to her explicit actions - not just beliefs.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7gDKbT_l2us" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7gDKbT_l2us</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jkrowling.com&#x2F;opinions&#x2F;j-k-rowling-writes-about-her-reasons-for-speaking-out-on-sex-and-gender-issues&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jkrowling.com&#x2F;opinions&#x2F;j-k-rowling-writes-about-...</a>')
