If you&#x27;re skinny as a twig in the US, you&#x27;re probably considered normal in Japan. If you&#x27;re actually an obese person (again, in the US standard), people here wouldn&#x27;t even look at you straight. This kind of environment put a huge pressure for one to stay in shape.<p>- INSANE obsession for health. I hear that Americans are obsessed with health, but oh boy, have they looked into Japan. Small clinics are everywhere and they&#x27;re always filled with anxious patients because they have a benign stomach pain or something. Physical checkup is mandatory for most companies. I also read that the fear of COVID in Japan is the strongest in the world, despite a relatively low infection&#x2F;death number here. People are always talking about their health, and so is the national media. If you watch the Japanese TV, you&#x27;ll also feel sick, simply because there&#x27;s so much fear! Maybe this is good for public health overall, but I bet there&#x27;s a certain mental toll.')
