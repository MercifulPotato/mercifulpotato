They serve like a natural chromatography column, and some of the strata contain double-digit amounts of the ion (by molar mass, not weight, lithium is quite light).<p>There&#x27;s no salar like Salar de Uyuni, so no, it isn&#x27;t a simple matter of looking harder.  There&#x27;s plenty of lithium-bearing rock, for some value of &#x27;plenty&#x27;, but this is both expensive, and entails grinding and leaching ore, which is enormously more environmentally destructive and energy intensive.')
