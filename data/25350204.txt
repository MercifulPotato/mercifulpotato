I say this as someone who did his BSc in pure mathematics, MSc in CS and has worked as a programmer for a number of years. I meant to read it back in university, but I instead decided to keep applying the ‘Feynman method’, which I find for me is less efficient and more error prone due to my comparatively lower intelligence. The principles in the book shouldn’t be too hard to apply to both coding and debugging code.<p>They say you can’t teach an old dog new tricks, and you can’t increase IQ, but I’ve recently burnt a lot of actually quite simple coding interviews due to things like a missed edge case, and I wonder whether I can discipline myself to do things in a more disciplined and systematic fashion with this book. Not only for Leetcode&#x2F;Hackerrank style questions, but for work as well.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;How_to_Solve_It?wprov=sfti1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;How_to_Solve_It?wprov=sfti1</a>')
