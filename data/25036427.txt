A charitable reading of his whole stance:<p>• We can enter into a formal contract where I actually <i>do</i> owe you work-on-this-project in exchange for pay;<p>• but without such a contract, donations to me are just that — donations — and don’t influence my work;<p>• but this is an open-source project, so <i>you’re</i> free to put whatever work <i>you</i> like into it, and keep&#x2F;use&#x2F;share the results (in your own space, that I don’t have to referee.)<p>• I’ll just be over here, doing what I want, unless&#x2F;until someone makes a contract with me to do what <i>they</i> want. (Which, of course, they’re not obligated to do; they could just as well hire someone else to fork and maintain the project, rather than hiring me. That’s their choice.)<p>• So, in short, you’re not the boss of me; unless you’re literally my boss. (A patron is not a boss.)')
