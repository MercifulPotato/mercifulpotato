Consider the example of abortion: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.gallup.com&#x2F;poll&#x2F;235469&#x2F;trimesters-key-abortion-views.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.gallup.com&#x2F;poll&#x2F;235469&#x2F;trimesters-key-abortion-...</a>. While 60% of Americans believe abortion should generally be legal in the first trimester, just 28% think it should generally be legal in the second trimester (13 weeks+). (If you dig into the data, they think it should be illegal after that except to protect maternal life, fetal abnormalities, etc.) In fact, nearly every EU country generally prohibits abortion after 12-14 weeks.<p>Under U.S. Supreme Court precedent (specifically, <i>Roe</i> and <i>Casey</i>) abortion cannot be prohibited before viability--usually around <i>24 weeks.</i> Nearly all EU abortion law would be unconstitutional under American standards. In the U.S., therefore, the words written 250 years ago by the framers is deemed to prohibit the states from adopting abortion laws that would be entirely consistent with other advanced liberal democracies.<p>Similar reasoning has been invoked to ban school prayer (which is mandated by statute in the U.K. and allowed in Germany and Italy) and government funding of religious education (which is common in the EU, and is a constitutional right in Germany, Belgium, etc.) The majority of Americans, however, still support things like school prayer. Again, a 250-year old document has been invoked to strike down laws and practices that are widespread in other advanced liberal democracies.<p>When activists wield 250 year old words to strike down popular laws, people get very interested in exactly what those words mean! These conflicts tend to be more intense in the U.S. than elsewhere, because we&#x27;re a country where the coasts are France and everywhere else is Poland. Originalism doesn&#x27;t exist in Germany, but neither do cases like <i>Roe</i> where the Court invents new rights out of thin air. Social consensus is much higher in Germany. It&#x27;s a little bit easier to amend the German Basic Law than the Constitution (2&#x2F;3 vote in both houses versus 3&#x2F;4 vote of the states) but the German Basic Law has been amended 62 times since 1949. The U.S. Constitution has been amended just 17 times since 1792.')
