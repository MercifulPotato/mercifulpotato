Sometimes most people do things for good reasons and it&#x27;s worth knowing those reasons and participating in the same actions. Sometimes most people do things for bad reasons and you should avoid doing them even though it will make you unpopular.<p>Don&#x27;t decide to buy a house because everyone else is doing it or not doing it, buy a house because it&#x27;s a sound financial decision based on your own personal life situation.<p>In general, focus on the reasons, not on the popularity.')
