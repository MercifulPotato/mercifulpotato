Understanding the data is crucial for complying with FCC licensing and transmission regulations. It appears to be a zipped collection of pipe-delimited files, but it cannot be parsed using any standard CSV parser, let alone specialized ones (like CleverCSV) which attempt to sniff out the correct format. (We&#x27;ve solved the problem with a custom parser).<p>Even if you succeed at parsing the files, the data quality is horrendous. Core data is missing. Geospatial records use non-standard serialization formats and often result in invalid polygons. Licensed frequencies may be outdated, or even impossible (such as lower_frequency &gt; upper_frequency). There are cross-table inconsistencies. Incorrect codes are used everywhere.<p>Because the ULS doesn&#x27;t actually process all of their rules regarding interference with adjacent licensees, sometimes a license that has perfect data still results in an incorrect representation of the license rights <i>because an adjacent license has incorrect data</i>. Therefore, the data quality problem is actually viral...bad data for one license can result in dozens of licenses not knowing their actual license rights.<p><i></i>This data is meant to be authoritative<i></i>. It has been used in court cases and regulatory rulings. It is the first point of reference in license disputes. From our testing alone, which is not exhaustive, over 70% of licenses (in the subset of bands that we process) have at least one data quality error, and the virality of bad data effectively means nobody knows their license rights. What can actually be done about this? I&#x27;m starting to think that suing the FCC is the only way to get them to fix their problems, but that seems extreme. There have to be better options. Have any of you accomplished the task of getting the government to do a technical job better?')
