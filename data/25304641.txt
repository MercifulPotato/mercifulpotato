Or a different slumlord?<p>I have nothing but empathy for someone who can’t drive and cannot afford normal housing in the same place they receive services. I totally understand how some of those people would choose to have fewer services and leave, or god forbid be homeless.<p>But do those people you’re describing, who actively login into AirBnb - if they didn’t get something they paid for in-platform, or if the listing is lying, are you saying Airbnb doesn’t come through? It almost certainly does. A giant corporation is honestly better equipped to go to bat for a wronged customer simply because it has the money to provide a remedy and a case manager does not - the case manager must get all remedies from the richest institution of them all, the government.<p>Personally I believe Airbnb should just design a high minimum rental cost and ban all transactions that are too cheap. But I wouldn’t describe Airbnb as exploiting these people, they are obviously victims of landlords?')
