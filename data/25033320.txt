To understand how large the 10 least populous states have a population put together of about 9 million people. The 10 most populous states have about 179 million.<p>What you are suggesting is that we weigh small state voter as equal to 20 large state voter. That isn&#x27;t an &quot;equal say&quot; its tyranny. To put it in perspective you are suggesting that say Wyoming and Vermont whose population amounts to a million people out to be able to out vote Californias 40 million.<p>This is in fact such a terrible idea that were in implemented it would be in and of itself so terrible that it would sufficient reason for the dissolution of the entire union as rich populous states rebelled and left.  You would do less damage to the union by picking a state with a map and a dart board and nuking it.')
