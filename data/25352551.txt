In the past, an album on CD sold for ~15 dollars. With that, a purchaser owned unlimited plays as well as the ability to copy the CD.<p>Now, with streaming, 1 play is nothing more than 1 play. Sure, the argument that a musician used to make more off of 1 CD sale than they currently make off of streaming, but I&#x27;m not understanding where this perceived value is from? If I only stream 1 song, off of 1 album, I would assume that&#x27;s worth less than a single cent to the musician.<p>Most musicians don&#x27;t make money selling their music - this has always and will always be true. 80% of musicians make less than 200 a year, but compared to pre-streaming tech, would they have made more?')
