I think you just mean reactance at higher frequencies (since resistance is DC), and total impedance is then DCR + frequency-dependent reactance.<p>No, he&#x27;s correct. Ferrites are a specifically-designed lossy inductor over a targeted frequency range. There is more than just DC resistance + a linearly-increasing reactance with frequency. Just like dielectrics exhibit loss and can be characterized by complex permittivity and a loss tangent, magnetic materials are also lossy and have a complex permeability. Here is a ferrite I used on the data lines for a GPS module:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.murata.com&#x2F;en-eu&#x2F;products&#x2F;productdetail?partno=BLM15HD102SN1%23" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.murata.com&#x2F;en-eu&#x2F;products&#x2F;productdetail?partno=B...</a><p>Look at the impedance chart at the end and you&#x27;ll see the resistive component is basically zero at DC and starts to increase in the HF range, peaking close to 1 GHz. The reactance of it is also highly nonlinear.')
