We went in there with impunity, didn&#x27;t even use the full capabilities of our forces, changed their government, killed over a hundred thousand of people, destroyed their economy, incapacitated their military... So can one individual cause a little damage to the US military? Sure. I wouldn&#x27;t call it effective by any measure.')
