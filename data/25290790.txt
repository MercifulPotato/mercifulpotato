Probably because &gt; 50% of tech managers there are Indian nationals.  In fact they promote Indian labor union formation there, which Amazon calls Bof&#x27;s.  They are absolutely entranced, though, in attempts to extract one more penny from blue collar jobs such warehouse, trucking, and security guards which are predominately staffed by white, black, and latino Americans.<p>Amazon&#x27;s tech labor costs have to be in the tens of billions per year. They are paying SDE&#x27;s, SDM&#x27;s $200k-$1MM and but are surveilling $15 people who are stealing candybars.')
