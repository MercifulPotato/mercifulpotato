There isn&#x27;t one solution for it, there should be many different solutions.<p>It&#x27;s been a long time we want to make programming simple. And we&#x27;ve tried a bazilion solutions already: easier languages (e.g.: Basic), specific purpose languages (e.g.: Cobol, R, Logo), visual programming (e.g: LabView, Scratch, Lego Mindstorms), dozens of IDE&#x27;s and CASE systems, programming courses for everyone, specific purpose tools (Access, Excel), etc...<p>So far, the one solution that I&#x27;ve seem coming close to success is teaching Python to kids in schools. That might be the best approach: make a simpler solution for a simpler problem and make education a little smarter.<p>Now, regarding grown-ups, just forget them. They&#x27;re a lost cause, like teaching new tricks to an old dog. In general, grown-ups are allergic to learning, they think they know everything.')
