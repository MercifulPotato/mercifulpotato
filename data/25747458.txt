It&#x27;s great for handwriting and good for reading. I had an onyx boox note 2, which would be a good size for reading text books, but it&#x27;s even more expensive. Seems like anything with a large e-ink display is expensive. Right now I use an Onyx boox poke 3, which I found reasonably priced for a flexible e-reader. It&#x27;s small but I mostly read non-technical books so it&#x27;s fine.')
