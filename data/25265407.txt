Some people just care more than you do about certain principles, even if caring about those principles means that they have to endure a lower &quot;quality&quot; product.<p>Most blockchains are strictly inferior to a modern financial system when it comes to things like speed and cost of transferring small sums of money - which is the use case that most people have. But, if you are running Wikileaks, blockchain payments are superior because the credit card companies can&#x27;t decide to stop processing your payments.<p>Does anyone else need it? Right now, I think the answer is &quot;no&quot;. But nobody really needed a Linux desktop either, and 25 years on we have Chromebooks and Android.<p>Ethereum allows you to upload complex scripts to it, where those scripts are executed by a variety of different nodes which compare results and ensure that the script was executed faithfully. Do I personally need this? Probably not, no. There&#x27;s a competitive market in cloud hosting and very few circumstances where I would be afraid that Amazon, Google, or Microsoft is going to tamper with my computation, or refuse to execute it. But there are situations in which it is difficult to get multiple parties to agree on a trustworthy host for data and applications, and current political trends point toward that problem growing in significance. <i>Maybe</i> at some point we will want to use blockchain systems to maintain audit trails or even to coordinate our computations.<p>If these systems can prove robustness and reliability over a long period of time, maybe it makes sense to write the rules for multi-party computations as Ethereum scripts, and it becomes a ubiquitous low-level part of the stack. Maybe everyone ends up having an Ethereum account and we use it in place of the current payment system. Who knows? These scenarios are unlikely, but then nobody in 1995 would have believed that in 2020 both the majority of the world&#x27;s servers and the world&#x27;s most popular personal computing devices would run Linux.')
