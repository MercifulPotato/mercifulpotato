I&#x27;m not in a very intense tech job, however it still requires lots of reading, trying to figure out things and some days are nerve wrecking and tense,which often results in headaches,etc. So why do it for low money if I could go and many other jobs that would require additional reading once a year and won&#x27;t have to sift through  stack overflow comments to be able to do my job..')
