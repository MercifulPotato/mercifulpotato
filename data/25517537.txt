I always tell people Youtube has <i>accidentally</i> created the world&#x27;s greatest MOOC[1] for everyday life and also for ultra-niche topics like computer science deep learning discussions.<p>+ Videos to help with every day living:  E.g. my Samsung dryer broke and I wondered if I could repair it myself.  I went to Youtube and sure enough, many folks uploaded videos with step-by-step instructions on how to replace the heating element.  That video saved me a $300 repair bill! \n My 70-year old friend used to ask me how to do something on her iPhone but now just goes to Youtube whenever she wants to learn how to change a setting.  She also uses Youtube to learn about products (like Instant Pot) before buying them. Searching on Youtube for any topic has become a reflex for her now but I dare say most people are <i>underutilizing</i> Youtube to help with life&#x27;s tasks.<p>+ Specialized niche topics:  E.g. Youtube has channels talking about the latest deep learning research papers.  There was nothing like that decades ago with USENET or dial up BBS.  In the old days of network television, only mass appeal topics like NFL football or would get commentary videos.  Youtube allows a ultra-narrow niche videos to be monetized for tiny audiences.<p>For the education purposes above, Youtube&#x27;s recommendations algorithm work great.  On the other hand, their <i>advertising algorithm</i> is very strange.  E.g. a truck repair video showing how to replace the struts (99% male demographic) gets pre-roll ads for L&#x27;Or√©al cosmetics for women.<p>I <i>never</i> get steered into the radical toxic videos that everyone complains about.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Massive_open_online_course" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Massive_open_online_course</a>')
