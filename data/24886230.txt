Item(by='rndgermandude', descendants=None, kids=[24886252, 24886495], score=None, time=1603633733, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24886057, text='The RIAA letter was a takedown notice, tho from the looks of it a rather frivolous one.<p>They used a DMCA (17 U.S. Code ยง 512) takedown notice not to complain about infringing content but to complain about &quot;circumvention&quot; (17 U.S. Code ยง 1201). This is probably outside of the scope of DMCA notices, but courts often rule like common people would not expect (shout-out to Google vs Oracle).<p>Github then followed the letter of the law (and case law and jurisprudence) and processed the takedown request without looking into the merit, just making sure the notice had the required elements under the DMCA. Doing anything else would potentially open up Github to liability.<p>Now it&#x27;s up to yt-dl to file a counter-notice, pointing out that the RIAA members do not actually own any copyright to the code itself (and maybe also state that yt-dl is not &quot;primarily&quot; a &quot;circumvention&quot; software according to 17 U.S. Code ยง 1201), and see what happens.<p>RIAA can then file a lawsuit, which at this point they would probably win just because they can throw more money at it. Hurray for the US civil law legal system, where the richer party almost always wins.')
