I&#x27;ve interviewed for senior&#x2F;staff positions before when they immediately start talking about big o notation and asking me to reverse a string on a white board (seriously). Sorry but your CRUD line-of-business app with 150 total and ~10 concurrent users can use whatever algorithm the developer wants, and if anyone is reversing a string manually there is a problem. It&#x27;s not even worth continuing the interview if they&#x27;re asking a senior candidate junior-level questions.<p>Interviews for senior level positions should contain almost no technical questions at all - you can tell pretty quickly if someone knows what they&#x27;re talking about by digging into their experience with earlier projects. How was a solution architected? What other ways did they consider? Why did they go the route they did? And my favorite, &quot;think about the most complex project that you had a hand in architecting (for architects) or developing (for developers), and teach it to me.&quot; You can immediately see where they focus, what things they gloss over, and if you have time and it&#x27;s an engaging conversation, changing one of the core pieces and asking how they&#x27;d change the design can be a lot of fun (for an interview, anyway).')
