Item(by='fakedang', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611149139, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25845893, text='100k USD (for one person, non family), depending on your taxes, can get you a reasonable apartment in NYC, perhaps even a fancy place in Brooklyn (and if you&#x27;re lucky, a good place in Tribeca or the Meatpackers District).<p>It can get you a pretty mediocre apartment in Central London but who lives there? You&#x27;ll easily get a comfortable place in Zone 5 or outside for cheaper too, with a better QoL. Parking costs might have to be factored in though.<p>Singapore, you can literally get an apartment next to MBS in 100k USD - if you like living in a weekend ghost town. If you like to live in a more lively place, I think apart from Sentosa (which is filled with tourists anyways), places like Bukit Timah and Tanjong Pagar are comfortably within your reach. Or you can stay in Jurong where all the expats are, for much cheaper.<p>The only exception here is San Francisco, where 3k USD pm will get you a cardboard box inside someone else&#x27;s bedroom, or possibly even bathroom. That&#x27;s the Bay Area&#x27;s fault for really shit planning (which, I was surprised, managed to beat London&#x27;s planning by a mile - in shittiness).')
