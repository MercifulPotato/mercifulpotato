And when you decide to join another company, to continue to work in a managerial position, there&#x27;s gonna be just as little coding there.<p>But still they insist you to do the same cookie-cutter DS and Algo questions.<p>(Note: this obviously doesn&#x27;t apply for every company - but there seems to be a lot of cargo-culting going on, and trying to generalize the interview process for everyone in the industry)')
