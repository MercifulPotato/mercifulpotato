I have ~20 different savings accounts that I use for budgeting envelopes (you can have up to 25, I think) and each has their own routing&#x2F;account numbers so you can set up services to pull directly from them and I set up automation to put $X in them from a &quot;main&quot; income account every 2 weeks, so I don&#x27;t have to manually move money from account to account unless it&#x27;s for something out of the ordinary. It effectively lets me set up envelope accounts that get automatically filled each month and automatically withdrawn from as charges happen, which is quite nice (and sounds similar to what Simple was doing?).<p>Dunno if it helps as a straight-up Simple replacement, but it works well for me so I thought I&#x27;d give them a shout out.')
