In can have different levels of synchronizations:<p>- no synchronization at all: conservatives (especially American ones) flagging socialist-sounding posts (often upvoted by Europeans when Americans are asleep), Gophers &amp; C++ guys flagging Rust posts, etc.<p>- loosely synchronized: some content is getting popular on &#x2F;r&#x2F;rust, or &#x2F;r&#x2F;python, some people there will connect to HN to upvote it here.<p>- strongly synchronized: some influential Twitter handle posts a message about how “some shit went to the front page”, zealot followers come and flag the submission.
