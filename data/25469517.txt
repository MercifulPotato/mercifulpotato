But &quot;being principled&quot; is a matter of degree and perspective.<p>Clearly, there is a gap between what a particular individual <i>wants</i> of their elected representatives (&quot;reps&quot;) versus <i>what they get</i>. Why?<p>Sure, there are charitable explanations. First, reps have to balance competing interests. Second, some reps may make &#x27;principled&#x27; compromises in order to prioritize certain values over others.<p>There are less charitable explanations, too. First, many reps seek power as an ends unto itself, but doing so pulls them into a system where &#x27;principled&#x27; decisions (e.g. ones directly for the benefit of voters) become harder. Second, some reps have questionable ethics and are willing to take money at the expense of their proper responsibilities. And so on.<p>All of interpretations are true, to some degree.<p>If people in a (more or less) democratic system want to change it from within, it is not effective to simply hope for reps to behave more ethically. We have to: (1) adjust the rules; (2) change our expectations; and (3) get involved: run for office, volunteer for campaigns, give money and resources, and vote. (Tell me if I&#x27;ve left anything out!)')
