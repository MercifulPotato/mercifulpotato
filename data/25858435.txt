Look it up.<p>Anecdotally, I am Muslim and I notice that Muslims who grow up in the West have this pattern. If they are very Westernized in morality and thinking, then they are less likely to work in STEM fields. If they are religious they are almost 100% likely to work in STEM fields. I think religious Muslims get their source of ultimate truth from somewhere other than humanities and philosophy so they aren&#x27;t drawn to them in college and thus they all funnel into STEM.<p>Women in the US are probably drawn to humanities and men probably drawn out of them in college (where feminist&#x2F;sexuality lens is high in humanities), which could possibly lead to STEM being highly male.')
