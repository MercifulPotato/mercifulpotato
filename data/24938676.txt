Compression occurs at a shock, but this is not heating due (solely) to adiabatic compression.  This is clearly seen by considering the case where mach number goes to infinity: in that limit, the fraction of heating due to compression goes to zero (as the gas density remains below some finite limiting value.)  What is causing heating is a dissipative process in the shock itself.  This dissipative process is more akin to friction than it is to compression.')
