So I took a taxi home from the airport.  The tax driver had his wife on speakerphone the entire ride.  They weren&#x27;t even really talking, she was just on in the background, with an occasional sound&#x2F;remark.  The driver also made me provide step by step instructions.  It was not sufficient for me to give him the address and let him navigate there using his favorite gps app.')
