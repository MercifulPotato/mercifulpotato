The biggest hurdle I&#x27;ve found with &quot;selling&quot; optimality solutions is explaining the benefit.  While it is great to show the technical and optimal savings it isn&#x27;t always clear to the final user of the solution.<p>The best way to &quot;sell&quot; the solution is to translate it to real savings that the end user understands.  For instance if it is a public municipality show them how much time is saved to open up resources.  For private institutions show them how much money is saved that will improve profits or reduce costs.')
