Basically, they give out any innovations they create, while shielding themselves from any external innovation.<p>I don&#x27;t see how this could possible benefit them over any measurable amount of time.  Sure, they can do private repos for sensitive stuff, but the benefit of an open system like github is not in the closed off stuff... it is in the openness and propensity to inspire collaboration.  Without the openness, they will only fall behind from the second they enable their one way information shield.')
