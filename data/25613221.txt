The documentation didn&#x27;t say anything about complications from attempting this, so a lot of people just tried it as soon as they could, thinking it would go as smoothly as when they tried WSL. But nope... it many cases, it doesn&#x27;t just work out of the box. There&#x27;s network configuration and gateway issues, snags with vpn, and now this git repo corruption. When you look on git issues, it&#x27;s just people randomly shot-gunning suggestions, some of which work, some of which don&#x27;t. I think WSL2 was rushed out too early, or at least it&#x27;s lacking a comprehensive troubleshooting guide to get it up and running.')
