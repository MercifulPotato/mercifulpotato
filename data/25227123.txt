So the current form of a bird species is very much constrained by the form of what it evolved from.<p>I&#x27;d also add that it seems evolution isn&#x27;t even turning bicycles to cars bolt by bolt, but is adding whole subsystems at a time. It&#x27;s as if each bike was made of a set of standard ACME parts, and came with a set of blueprints for many other kinds of ACME parts - and evolution, at the large animal level, is just replacing one standardized part for another, or adding new ones where they didn&#x27;t exist, or altering the manufacturing timings, etc.<p>I&#x27;m of course referring to the findings of evolutionary developmental biology - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Evolutionary_developmental_biology" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Evolutionary_developmental_bio...</a>.')
