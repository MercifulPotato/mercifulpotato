Now im running a (headless) ubuntu server on the host with a windows VM with GPU passthrough on top. With a modern 6-8 core CPU + extra RAM (+ a cheap 2nd GPU for linux if you want a desktop environment on both linux and windows active at the same time) you can have both windows &amp; linux running simultaneously with no need to dual-boot. VFIO &amp; GPU passthrough makes the VM run pretty much at native speed although it does take some tweaking to set up.')
