Item(by='beckler', descendants=None, kids=[24651162], score=None, time=1601562159, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24650718, text='I really like interoperability and ubiquity of USB-C, but I think the part that I find frustrating is that the actual cables themselves are not standardized around data transfer rates.<p>I recently bought a small USB-C hub that allowed you to connect to it with your own cable, and it has an HDMI port. I also decided to buy a longer, but cheaper USB-C cable to connect it to my machine, thinking it would work. Well the HDMI port wouldn&#x27;t work at all. Everything else was fine. I actually ordered a replacement because I thought the hub was defective.<p>Come to find out, it will only work with USB-C cables with e-marker that allows a higher data rate. This info wasn&#x27;t clearly stated anywhere, it was only listed deep in a support post. So that was a fun discovery...')
