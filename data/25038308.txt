The problem with municipal ISPs is that they are very likely to end up providing worse service and being more expensive than private options, but hiding the true cost by using tax money to subsidize the operation. Thus, you end up with a very expensive, low quality option that makes alternatives non-viable (as most people won&#x27;t be willing to pay for the true cost of the service on top of all the taxes being used to pay for the municipal one).')
