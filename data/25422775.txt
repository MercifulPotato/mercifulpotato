Of course a person who stopped bathing for a few weeks would smell terrible, but I do wonder if a person who hadn&#x27;t bathed in months or years would smell so bad? Honestly, I imagine that the smell would be strong, and not entirely pleasant, but not horrible. More akin to a roofer coming home after a hot day. Smelly, sure, but it&#x27;s not overpowering, and I could see that smell just fading away if everyone smelled that way.')
