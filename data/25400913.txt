And I&#x27;d add to that that sometimes there&#x27;s significant work in the <i>pre-buy</i> phase as well:<p>- Researching what your options are &#x2F; what&#x27;s already out there.<p>- Comparing different alternatives.<p>- &quot;Hopping on a call&quot; with a sales rep to get a product demo (there&#x27;s this super annoying trend where many SaaS companies&#x27; landing pages don&#x27;t explain what they do and the only option they give is to &quot;schedule a demo&quot;).<p>For CRUD-like internal tools or simple 3rd party integrations, my experience has been that it&#x27;s often much faster (typically &lt; 1 hour) to build a production-ready app on Retool (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;retool.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;retool.com</a>) than it is to even get started with SaaS vendors.')
