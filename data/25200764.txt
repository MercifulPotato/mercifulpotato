The CEO can choose what criteria to use, and so the people reporting to the CEO can make your argument. The manager of a team of CX reps might not have that power to chose the criteria, so the people reporting to that manager are just as powerless. Then there’s the whole spectrum in between.<p>This is actually one of the privileges I’m most thankful for. That I have been able to make it work in an industry where I (and my managers) have the agency to decide how I should be evaluated. I have friends who aren’t so lucky, even when they push hard for the people below them to be evaluated more sanely.')
