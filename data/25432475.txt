When we first moved in the landlord straight up told us, then said that it was a safe neighbourhood because of it.<p>He mentioned the one time some kids decided to spraypaint a bunch of doors in the neighbourhood, nobody called the cops, but the next day those kids were cleaning everything up.<p>There was never an graffiti or anything in the neighbourhood until after they closed the clubhouse down.<p>They didn&#x27;t seem to do much. They&#x27;d show up in nice trucks pulling trailers with bikes, then hang out sitting on their bikes watching tv.<p>Pretty sure they owned a few of the other warehouses on the block. There was one that was completely fenced and barricaded off you never seen people going in or out of, but there was always people there. No signs or any indication of what the place was.<p>&gt;But it was the closest I ever got to experiencing what it&#x27;s like to living in a gang-controlled area, and it was weird.<p>The thing i&#x27;ve come to learn, is that even if an area doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s gang controlled, it probably still is. They&#x27;re just more discrete about it. You won&#x27;t find out unless you&#x27;re involved in shady things though.')
