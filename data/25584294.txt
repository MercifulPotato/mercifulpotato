What this means is that a lot of landlords in CA have super low mortgage&#x2F;property tax costs because they bought a while ago and they can &quot;afford&quot; to charge a low amount of rent because their costs are so low.<p>The biggest factor for me in regards to buying is the mobility that I need, especially while I&#x27;m young and uncertain of where I want to settle.')
