Item(by='extra88', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605529541, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25106878, text='&gt; If the first amendment said, &quot;A well read electorate, being necessary to a free state, the right the people to free speech, shall not be infringed,&quot; would you say it only covered political speech?<p>I would say the intent is much narrower than the actual text so while &quot;a well read electorate&quot; would call for more than just political speech, such a First Amendment <i>would</i> be allow more laws to restrict speech without being unconstitutional.<p>People in the armed forces don&#x27;t own the weapons they use now. Today, the National Guard is basically the &quot;Militia.&quot; Even if you think militia needs to include organizations not directed by governors, weapons can be owned by smaller political entities (towns, counties, etc.) or NGOs. In any case, weapons for a militia can be stored in an armory, not in every member&#x27;s home or on their person all the time.<p>Yet again, even if some of the weapons <i>were</i> stored in the home, there&#x27;s nothing unconstitutional about laws requiring trigger locks or other safety measures for their storage.')
