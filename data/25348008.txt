As a next step, we decided to catch-up in person.<p>I visited his office on a Sunday at around 10:00am and then we left for lunch at around 3:00pm - finishing our meeting at around 6:00 pm. The conversation just flowed and both of us exchanged a lot of information in those 8 hours.<p>Towards the end, I told the founder I am interested. And he asked for two days time to get back to me.<p>He reverted back after 5 days on Friday evening where we spoke for another 20 minutes, and he asked about my intent and my compensation etc. - he said, he will get back to me the next day after an internal discussion with a final yes or no. We both agreed to speak around 3:00 PM the following day - Saturday.<p>The following day, I left him a text saying &quot;I look forward to speak at 3:00 PM etc. in the morning&quot; to which he did not respond. And then he didn&#x27;t call at 3:00 PM. Not leaving any text etc.<p>I waited from Saturday until Tuesday morning and called his investor who introduced us. Investor asked me to call him fora final closure and if he doesn&#x27;t revert then he will investigate.<p>At this point, the Founder-CEO hasn&#x27;t responded.<p>What should I do? (I don&#x27;t want the investor to follow up with him as that might trigger some phobia about my reach with his board member.)')
