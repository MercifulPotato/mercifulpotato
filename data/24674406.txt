It&#x27;s better compare the clock with a brick.<p>In the example of the clock there is a temperature difference that can be used to extract &quot;useful&quot; energy. You can use it to move the clock, or make a sound or light or something.<p>(I&#x27;m saying &quot;useful&quot; as in the a quote of the main author of the paper <i>&quot;What we did was reroute the current in the circuit and transform it into something useful.‚Äù</i> .)<p>If you put a brick in a oven and keep it at the same temperature for some time, until the temperature, humidity and other properties have stabilized, you reach thermal equilibrium. It doesn&#x27;t mean that the heat energy in the brick is perfectly constant, it exchanges heat with the oven.  The heat energy has small random variations.<p>But unlike in the clock scenario, you can&#x27;t use this additional accumulated energy for something &quot;useful&quot;. To check if it is in a high or a low, you need a variant od the Maxwell&#x27;s Demon. You can measure the energy exchange and analyze the theoretical and experimental properties anyway.<p>(Also, if you put the clock in the oven at a constant temperature for a long enough time, it will stop working.)<p>Stealing the name from a sibling thread, to make the grapheme device produce &quot;useful&quot; energy, you probably need a Maxwell&#x27;s Diode.')
