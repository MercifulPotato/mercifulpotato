I live in Scandinavia but work for a multi-national where English is the working language. I&#x27;m constantly trying to work out people&#x27;s version of English (not really level) and adapting to match. It&#x27;s a relief when I talk to someone who&#x27;s lived in the UK as no translation is necessary, and we can each swear as much as we normally would.')
