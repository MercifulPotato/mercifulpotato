Who <i>specializes</i> in arithmetic (number theorists and spreadsheet wizards aside)?  If you define “pedagogy” as a specialty, perhaps, but that’s not the generalist&#x2F;specialist discussion here.  Even high school teachers generally only require a Bachelor’s degree...two years of content study (Junior-Senior...first two years is general education) out of an adult lifetime of, say, 50 years.  Any “working professional” in a discipline wouldn’t count that for much.  The media and courtroom teaching...you’d have to expand that discussion a bit for me to believe it.  Law school, media studies...well, that’s another matter.<p>It’s not <i>that</i> rare to contribute across multiple disciplines...the entire discipline of systems engineering is predicated on it.<p>BTW: Can anyone summarize the thesis?  This isn’t a tl;dr situation.  I’m too old to read articles that look like the argument, if any, hinges on semantics with evidence that is, at best, anecdotal.  (Frankly, we all are.)  And so I don’t.<p>PS:  I really like the “&gt;” indent style for quotations for block text in this UI.')
