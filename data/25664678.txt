Part of the problem is that many of those who are aware of the problem blame the individuals themselves for falling through the cracks in the system (like you do, based on some notion of &#x27;choice&#x27;). One possible solution (it seems you agree with me here), is to remove the division between public and private systems. The first step ist to accept the existence of a problem instead of denying it (blaming individuals is a form of denying systemic issues).')
