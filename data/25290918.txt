There&#x27;s an entirely reasonable argument that single-thread performance is oversold as a metric, and that the focus on it advantages some platforms over others.<p>At the end of the day, benchmarks are inherently only an approximate measure of how real-world code will perform. SMT, basically by definition, is rarely going to benchmark well, but is inherently going to show more of a benefit when running real-world mixed workloads.')
