I don&#x27;t know, so i&#x27;m asking - but my immediate thought is that you treat it like science. You isolate an environment, advertise, and see if it has an affect. But the implication there is that if it doesn&#x27;t have an affect, money is on the table.<p>If this is even remotely close to reality then it makes sense to me. Companies are more concerned with constant growth than strict efficiency, imo. They&#x27;re throw as much money around as possible, and every cent lost or left on the table is panic inducing.<p>I also imagine different types or products and&#x2F;or markets behave quite differently. Eg a new product might very well benefit from advertising - since no one can buy your product or visit your store if they don&#x27;t know it exists.')
