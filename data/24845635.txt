Some of the earliest massively parallel machines like the Connection Machine were thought to be useful for it. Itâ€™s totally plausible that physicists were crazy enough to build a custom Supercomputer for it. They routinely build complex custom ASICs for particle detectors. Note also the time (2004) nowadays they use GPUs for lattice QCD.')
