Item(by='wcarron', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608312485, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25468876, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t value seeing most content at more than penny per view in general and fixed transactional costs make it impractical to send that to each creator.<p>I find this interesting. What about books? A quick search yields average paperback novels are 300-400 pages long and between $14-18. That&#x27;s between 2.1-2.9c&#x2F;page, roughly.<p>Many articles from quality content creators are &gt; 1 page long. So applying the book pricing, between 5-25c per worthwhile article, give or take. Seems like a penny is pretty heavily undervaluing the product you&#x27;re getting, then.<p>As for the impractability of actually distributing those monies to each creator, well, no argument there.')
