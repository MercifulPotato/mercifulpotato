Trucks have many axles to distribute the load, and are forced to stop at weigh stations to verify that they are within weight requirements.<p>As far as road tax, the current system works pretty fairly for ICE engines, in my opinion. The larger the vehicle, the more powerful the engine, and thus the lower the efficiency.<p>So semis are paying higher road tax than a little sub-compact car.<p>Also, the more you drive, the more fuel you use, which means the more road tax you end up paying.<p>With an electric car, the incentives are all out of whack.
