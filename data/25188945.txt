There are two examples I can think of that demonstrate this middle ground (although I can&#x27;t remember the names of either game).<p>In game 1, there was a scene where you had infiltrated a terrorist cell as an undercover agent, and were accompanying them in an attack on an airport. You were involved in this massacre of innocent people, and you could choose to either participate in the shooting or not. It was very controversial but I think it was an interesting psychological experiment to play on players.<p>In the second case, another war-type game, you were a general who had to make a call whether to use white phosphorous bombs against a group of enemies. After it was over, you have to walk through the scene and see up close the destruction and horror that you inflicted.<p>Both of those, I think, are interesting ways to engage with evil, because they both prompted thought. I don&#x27;t see any evidence that Panzer has any depth or thought in their treatment of this dilemma.')
