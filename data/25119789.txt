Because British kedgeree (as kedgeree is) is distinct from what any Briton I know would call &#x27;curry&#x27; - even given the disservice we do India by calling almost everything &#x27;curry&#x27; - and further distinct even from khicadi (खिचड़ी) from which it takes its name, and moves to breakfast.<p>Sorry, I know you were just joking.')
