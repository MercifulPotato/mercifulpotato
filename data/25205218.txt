As a memory management strategy, reference counting will always use more ram because a reference count must be stored with every object in the system. Storing all of those reference counts requires memory.<p>A reference counting strategy would be more efficient in processor utilization compared to garbage collection as it does not need to perform processor intensive sweeps through memory identifying unreferenced objects. So reference counting trades memory for processor cycles.<p>It is not true that garbage collection requires more ram to achieve equivalent performance. It is in fact the opposite. For programs with identical object allocations, a GC based system would require less memory, but would burn more CPU cycles.')
