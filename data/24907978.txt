With Terraform, you always type &quot;yes&quot; to proceed, so it turns into muscle memory. You stop reading the output, and you&#x27;re already typing &quot;yes&quot; before you even see the prompt. Terraform&#x27;s output is also verbose, and many changes show up as &quot;1 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy&quot; because they don&#x27;t separately list a &quot;replace&quot; category. It&#x27;s pretty bad; you&#x27;ve got cognitive overload, confusing output summary, and a predetermined continue answer. And this is often an action you&#x27;re performing under duress. I&#x27;ve been bitten by it plenty of times.')
