I&#x27;m only concerned with whether or not they do. My point is that for a civilization to have an unlimited lifespan it either has to exist in multiple star systems or progress beyond the need for a star system at all. A single planet is just too vulnerable. Nuclear war, biological war, grey goo, supervolcano, gamma ray burst, ecological collapse. To exist for billions of years on one planet requires that a species be dynamic enough to create hyper-advanced science but so peaceful it doesn&#x27;t kill itself with it while being so incredibly culturally stable that doesn&#x27;t change for eons. I don&#x27;t buy it. Living on one planet is a death sentence in probably much less than a billion years.')
