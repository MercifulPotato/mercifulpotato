But it reduces the common area we can even discuss anything going on this week in politics.<p>Taking a step back...<p>We&#x27;ve got these two sides.  Regardless of the merits, each side believes they know the truth, and that the other side is delusional.  And it is easy enough to engage with your media outlets of choice, and get your beliefs reinforced.<p>How can we have a meaningful discussion as a nation, when there is no apparent common ground?  No set of agreed-upon facts?<p>Now I of course have my own very strong opinions and I&#x27;m sure I have a good comprehension of the truth.  But that isn&#x27;t going to convince anyone on the other side anymore.
