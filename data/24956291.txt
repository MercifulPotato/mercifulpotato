Maybe clearer is<p>swap = f ↦ ((x, y) ↦ f(y, x))<p>The rule this satisfies is<p>swap(f)(x, y) = f(y, x)<p>and the type for swap is<p>swap : (X × Y → Z) → (Y × X → Z)<p>for some types&#x2F;sets X, Y, and Z.<p>(Also, note that tuples might not be anything like a vector space.  For example, for String × [Int], you wouldn&#x27;t usually write (&quot;hi&quot;, [2,3]) as &quot;hi&quot;𝑒₁ + [2,3]𝑒₂ since there&#x27;s not really a good commutative addition operation for strings or lists.)')
