Me neither.<p>You don&#x27;t like Facebook. Guess what?

And your solution is to destroy them by executive order and give all this power to... the US State!<p>The cognitive dissonance is so strong you simply refuse to acknowledge this point every time I mentioned, and you prefer to distill more diatribes against the US.<p>I am not interested in more diatribes against the US government. I dislike it and distrust it already to know that I don&#x27;t want it to have more power. What I want to understand is what do you propose besides measures only seen in totalitarian dystopias.')
