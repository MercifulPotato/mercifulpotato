There is no pay-to-delete button. There are however ways to have non-factual, incorrect, offensive or a myriad of other types of posts removed. How a review is judged as violating policy is an internal decision. Which reviews are surfaced on the front page or how the &quot;average&quot; review is determined or slew of other details that affect how a restaurant or company looks are are also under the control of yelp&#x2F;glassdoor.<p>There are enough ways to put the thumb on the scale that you can honestly say that you don&#x27;t have a delete bad review button, yet money can still strongly influence how positive or negative an org looks on a review site.')
