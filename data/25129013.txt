Run your own crawler or be part of a network that distributes this out to each participating node.<p>Every centralized search engine has immensely hard-to-resist and powerful incentives to play &quot;The Eye of Sauron&quot; with your data. Additionally, they offer single points of compromise to other, far more powerful actors. Whatever guarantees DuckDuckGo gives you -and right now they don&#x27;t give any- don&#x27;t mean much, if they&#x27;ve been thoroughly (willingly or unwillingly) compromised.<p>Which doesn&#x27;t mean one should always steer well clear just that one should at least be aware of the tradeoffs one makes when using a centralized search engine. And with DuckDuckGo&#x27;s misleading marketing, I feel that this point is lost on significant chunks of its userbase.')
