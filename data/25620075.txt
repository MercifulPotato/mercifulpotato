Your entire password entropy is effectively reduced to the few added characters.<p>On that note though, I use an actual cryptographic hash of a master password plus a concatenated domain. The resulting password to any specific site is leakable without revealing the master password.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dheera&#x2F;scripts&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;passenter" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dheera&#x2F;scripts&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;passenter</a>')
