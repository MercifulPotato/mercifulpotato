As a Svelte user I find Tailwind counter-intuitive, as the CSS is already scoped to the component. I also found the added build step slows down the otherwise snappy dev server. I had purchased Tailwind UI but got a refund after I ended up needing to write custom CSS on top of the Tailwind classes.<p>I would be interested in your setup (I generally use sapper).<p>As an aside, can Svelte reactivity add Tailwind classes? For instance class={`color-blue-${someNum}`} or does all that need to be available at build time (I&#x27;m assuming the latter).')
