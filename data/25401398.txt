Aggregating various recent polling, it seems that about 1 person in 8 is OK with that, and maybe 2 more (for a total of 3&#x2F;8) are passively in favor - that is to say, they won&#x27;t do anything about it, but won&#x27;t object if it happens.<p>An important problem nowadays is that our media and interpersonal communications take place at lightning speed, but out political technology is many respects still rooted int he 18th century, and our administrative technology covers a span from 19th century unresponsive bureaucracy to 21st century oppressive surveillance. Politics as presently constituted does not work well for a lot of people, and so they are not invested in maintaining the status quo.<p>Put simply, our economic infrastructure is highly distributed, but power is highly centralized and that makes a lot of people angry.')
