That being said, I doubt you&#x27;ll find one on HN who is going to bother to translate a Hindi video about how to create spam PRs, so you&#x27;ll have to make do with a native speaker (who isn&#x27;t a professional translator) has said -- hence my comment.<p>And my follow-up comment about being suspicious was about the vast majority of people who do translations (especially online), and I would go so far as to argue that some degree of suspicion should also be applied when newspapers use translations as though they are direct quotations. But I wasn&#x27;t (generally speaking) talking about professional translators.')
