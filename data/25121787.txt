It&#x27;s has a fair amount of natural semantics (eg., &quot;play like a fantasy&quot;),<p>There is only an <i>embedding</i> or re-presentation in some less informative form. ie., you have to choose some partial measurement system and apply this to the images of scores to produce a numeric representation.<p>This is, in part, why a midi-file is always going to sound worse than an orchestra operating from sheet music.
