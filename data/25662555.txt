The game is the same but the parameters are larger. It takes time to work out at the gym, make quicker decisions, cleanup some weakness. There are many other factors like how their strengths will play into the teams structure, etc.<p>Is this the model you would apply? What are the parameters that are key to founders beneath the idea itself?')
