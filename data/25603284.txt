Their accuracy is much lower than their reputation<p>Venezuela is often painted as a &quot;Bitcoin solves this&quot; poster child. Yes, Bitcoin is sent from the USA and other countries into Venezuela, mostly by Venezuelan expatriates to family. It&#x27;s useful for buying USD in Venezuela. But USD liquidity in Venezuela is very weak, so Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t really solve much at all there. You can&#x27;t buy groceries in Venezuela with Bitcoin<p>&gt;Does anyone know if you can tell country of origin of a transaction request?<p>You can not<p>&gt; Maybe the IP sending the request is public to the network?<p>If the sender is using his own Bitcoin node, the sender&#x27;s IP is known only to the other nodes the transaction was broadcast to. If the sender is using a third-party service, that service records the IP addresses of its customers in the same way as any Web site does, just as my IP is known to ycombinator when I submit this comment')
