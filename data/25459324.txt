We&#x27;re only discussing this because the Navy CTO got personally involved with the USPTO. This involvement apparently led to the review process being bypassed&#x2F;relaxed.<p>Based on the insanity (why try to patent this?), I suspect the author is a kook who convinced non-experts (e.g., patent attorney) to create this patent application, with no effective internal peer review. The author&#x27;s colleagues and managers either lack the specialization in the field to call B.S., or decided to stay out of it because a patent application is not worth the drama.<p>The oddity here is still the involvement of the CTO. Who I assume is far detached from the actual research, lacks the expertise to review, and trusted the author&#x27;s claims.')
