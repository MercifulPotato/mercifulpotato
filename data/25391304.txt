With the Taycan? Which starts at &gt;$100k, with half the range and slower 0-60 numbers than a lumbering $70k base model Model S? (I know they&#x27;re not direct competitors, I expect the Porsche to have significantly better fit&#x2F;finish and handling, and the Taycan doesn&#x27;t really sit 5 comfortably). At the top end, it looks a bit better, but then it&#x27;s priced in the range of the 2021 Roadster, which seems likely to be a monster.<p>VW&#x27;s offerings are obviously more affordable, but they don&#x27;t seem to offer the same range per buck that Tesla does?')
