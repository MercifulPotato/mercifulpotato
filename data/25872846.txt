Just to be clear, at least from non-US person point of view - US action clearly state that &#x27;your life is worth less if you don&#x27;t hold US citizenship&#x27;.<p>We can&#x27;t have 21st century discussion about race and gender equality and then ignore this glaring fault. I know some people will come and say &#x27;you know this is how states and secret services and whatnot should operate blablabla&#x27;.<p>Its plain wrong. Justice and equality of human beings simply don&#x27;t exist if inconvenient. It doesn&#x27;t matter if its my or your state doing it.<p>And arguably the worst part - from all I could ever read on it, this different type of racism doesn&#x27;t even bring any proper safety results for US that would justify it in some twisted optics. It for sure pisses tons of people all around the world though.')
