We just need to stop the hospitals from collapsing.<p>We live with all manner of sickness and disease every day of the year without trying to eradicate them.  Covid is only different from heart disease, lung cancer, and rabies in that it has the potential to swamp us.<p>Adjusting the throttle for spread might mean jewelry shops being open but sandwich shops being closed.  It might just as well involve lockdown for anyone born in an odd month, or with a name ending in a vowel, or ginger hair.  The measures are arbitrary and only used as a throttle for the inevitable spread.<p>This is how I sleep at night.  The alternative is the worrying thought that no one in power really knows what they are doing.')
