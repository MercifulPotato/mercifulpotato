Item(by='UncleOxidant', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612030883, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25971285, text='I&#x27;m imagining YouTube (or maybe even HN) comments becoming dominated by stories of harm supposed people have supposedly experienced. There&#x27;s no way to tell if a person you&#x27;re interacting with in these kinds of contexts has actually experienced the harm they claim or if it&#x27;s just being used to manipulate. So I&#x27;d agree that in the case of internet forums I&#x27;m not entirely sure this is a step in the right direction. For person-to-person, face-to-face interactions IRL it would be a different story as you could rely on non-verbal cues to help determine validity and you might have a history of relationship with the person you&#x27;re interacting with.')
