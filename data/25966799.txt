I’d be fairly confident the same applies to US investment advisers.<p>It’s totally the sort of ‘feature’ that the user could have been advised of around say the 30 day mark. “We’ve set you up a margin account that’s valid for your first $1000, please now confirm if you’d like to continue to carry a margin call risk otherwise were converting you to a standard account.”<p>It’s also super common for margin facilities to allow investors carrying the risk, 24-48 hours to contribute to retain the position, auto-selling out is a last resort.')
