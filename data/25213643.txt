It&#x27;s amazing to me how concerned they tell their audience to be, and how excited they are that our deliverance is at hand thanks to the imminent availability of a 90% effective vaccine.<p>Never mind that the vaccine has not been shown to do anything to help people who are deficient in vitamin D or zinc or any other kind of malnourishment, nor to help deal with the darkness that happens the same time every year.<p>Some people think the Asian countries did well because they&#x27;re mask ninjas. Another theory is that the countries that have done well just have more exposure&#x2F;cross-immunity [0] to coronaviruses (from bats&#x2F;etc), or there may be some protection from TB&#x2F;pneumonia vaccines that are commonly used in Japan&#x2F;South Korea&#x2F;etc.<p>I&#x27;m more likely to believe those who say the response to COVID-19 is much more of a problem than the virus itself:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;MLevitt_NP2013&#x2F;status&#x2F;1331506523915382786" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;MLevitt_NP2013&#x2F;status&#x2F;133150652391538278...</a><p>Governors are more likely to be skeptical than their plebs, but they have to balance managing their party&#x27;s partisan hysterics with their actual risk factors (less likely to be malnourished, etc).<p>&gt; Fewer Republican governors have been caught violating their own orders â€” in large part because they have not implemented the same kinds of restrictions that public health experts say are critical to curbing the spread of a deadly virus.<p>Floridians and North Dakotans and Swedes are fortunate to have more enlightened leadership that question the supposed &quot;public health experts&quot;.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cross-reactivity#In_immunology" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cross-reactivity#In_immunology</a>')
