I also don&#x27;t trust them because they pay for positive reviews, I know this because on of the &quot;review writers&quot; offered money me to translate some of the reviews he&#x27;s written to English.<p>I love Switzerland but I will never use a Swiss host because you pay more and get less every time.')
