And my point is that it&#x27;s easier to measure present cost of $THING. And to compare to other so-measured things than it is to guess at time to fix. You can assign some cost to that security thing can&#x27;t you? You can assign a risk and then assign cost to that risk.<p>I never stated that client time was the thing to measure. I&#x27;m saying (now repeating) that PRESENT COST is a better basis than FUTURE TIME GUESS.<p>The whole problem is management wants to maximize dev-time so they try to cram bugs to make your time full - based on a guess.  It&#x27;s ass backwards.<p>Measure the problem then budget resources to fix.')
