The best example would be .map on streams&#x2F;collections.<p>You can only do it with unchecked exceptions in Java. In Rust, you can transparently do it with iterators and the result type.<p>So given xs: [A] and f: A -&gt; Result&lt;A, E&gt;, it is trivial to typesafely get Result&lt;[A], E&gt; by xs.map(f) where map: forall T. [T] -&gt; (T -&gt; S) -&gt; [S]. This is outright impossible with Java. You have to circumvent the type system, or emulate Rust&#x27;s approach.')
