If you have a big enough keyspace to worry even in the slightest about collisions in 122 bits, you have a bigger index than will comfortably fit in memory. Under those circumstances, random key lookups will thrash your cache. If you access multiple rows at a time which were allocated close together in time - not unusual with normalized schema - you&#x27;ll want them adjacent in the index too.')
