It feels like each time I take another step up the mountain, the mountain itself grows.<p>Doesn&#x27;t matter how much time&#x2F;effort I expend, there is just no way to keep up to date with every moving piece in our industry (from hardware, to firmware, to software, to laws, to programming languages, to cryptography&#x2F;security, to web standards, to multimedia standards&#x2F;codecs, to physics etc). It seems like every single action that we take comes with trade-offs and that we can never make an ultimate good choice - that choice is only valid for a short time before it&#x27;s trade-off gets triggered.<p>A carpenter has a set of tools. He has a set of materials. He has a set of blueprints&#x2F;techniques. He can consistently build table with x qualities. When he is done with the table, it is done. He doesn&#x27;t have to spend all of his time relearning how to build tables over and over, and for old tables to quickly self-destruct if he stops baby-sitting them. Or for some 12 year old carpenter in Russia to cause his table&#x27;s wood to rot.<p>Every year that passes by, humans accumulate more and more knowledge. It would be impossible for a few individuals to know everything as their time in this life is limited. Thus we get forced to specialize, else we can get pulled into the general knowledge stream which can be overwhelming.')
