My mbp is my main workhorse, but as a freelance SRE &quot;devops&quot; guy, the Apple ARM platform won&#x27;t be suitable for my job any time soon, if ever.<p>Docker is not yet available - but even when it would become available, emulating virtualised x86 code is explicitly not going to be supported. That in many cases means pulling a docker image built in a ci&#x2F;cd pipeline where a dev screwed something up and debugging it locally is no longer an option. If I wasn&#x27;t freelance, I could probably get away with some cloud instance to run all my docker stuff, but I&#x27;m dealing with too many different environments, for clients with various different legal requirements making this simply &#x27;not an option&#x27;.<p>Too bad, because the machines look very promising for everything else. Development tools aren&#x27;t there yet, but I expect that to be fixed pretty quickly.')
