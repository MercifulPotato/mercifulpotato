Since &quot;child&quot; means anyone under 18, &quot;child porn&quot; therefore includes teenagers sexting their boy&#x2F;girlfriends; some of those relationships could be called abusive, but surely many could not be, unless you think a teenager taking pictures of him&#x2F;herself is inherently (self-)abusive.  But I&#x27;m sure no internet content moderation policy, nor likely any police raid, would look into the background of a nude picture of a 14-year-old and determine that no abuse was involved and therefore the picture is permissible.<p>See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;22144707&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;22144707&#x2F;</a> .  &quot;The cases involved &quot;youth-produced sexual images&quot; that constituted child pornography under relevant statutes according to respondents. ... US law enforcement agencies handled an estimated 3477 cases of youth-produced sexual images during 2008 and 2009 ... Two-thirds of the cases involved an &quot;aggravating&quot; circumstance beyond the creation and&#x2F;or dissemination of a sexual image. In these aggravated cases, either an adult was involved (36% of cases) or a minor engaged in malicious, non-consensual, or abusive behavior (31% of cases). An arrest occurred in 62% of cases with an adult involved, in 36% of the aggravated youth-only cases, and in 18% of the &quot;experimental&quot; cases (youth-only and no aggravating elements).&quot;')
