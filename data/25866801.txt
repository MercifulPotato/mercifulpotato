So all these FIDO2 keys will work with LUKS2.<p>And if any maker of keys is reading, please reach out if you&#x27;re implementing U2F but want to upgrade to the full FIDO2, including the hmac-secret extension.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;solokeys&#x2F;solo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;solokeys&#x2F;solo</a>')
