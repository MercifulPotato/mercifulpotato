Is a self-driving car system safer than a human, or not? You&#x27;re correct that self-driving car systems lack a &quot;general learning and intelligence model,&quot; but they also have several obvious advantages over humans, like potentially better-positioned cameras, a more reliable &quot;attention&quot; system, faster reaction times, potentially more &quot;experience&quot; with different road conditions and scenarios, etc.')
