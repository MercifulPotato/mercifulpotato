All good insights.<p>W&#x2F;r&#x2F;t the whiteboard thing - one of my interviews recently used google jamboard, and my input was lagging by like 30 seconds. I was writing a solution, and talking through it, and one of the interviewers started trying to help by starting a solution directly on top of mine. So apparently I just sounded like I was talking about hypothetical code. No harm, really - the interviewer was embarrassed, we moved on. But it was pretty awkward not inhabiting the same visual reality, and thus building divergent mental models of the interaction.<p>I live with a therapist, who confirms that their rapport building is encumbered via video chat. She&#x27;s incredibly warm and emotive, and I think this compensates: her content is presumably affirming, and her tone (which comes through the thin walls) just oozes authenticity and positive regard. Certainly rapport building isn&#x27;t dead, but the relative value of the parameters seem to have shifted.<p>You&#x27;ve inspired me to go read one of the guides on videoconferencing lighting I keep seeing. Hopefully to let my, um, inner beauty and competence shine through.')
