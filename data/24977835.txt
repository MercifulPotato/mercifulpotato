I&#x27;m not a huge fan of Capital One, but afaik they are the only credit card company that offers this.<p>I should note that Privacy.com provides this service as well and I really do like their mission, but they have the limitation of only being able to be used with a debit card backing the account and I&#x27;ve also ran into some issues with their cards not working with some online vendors.')
