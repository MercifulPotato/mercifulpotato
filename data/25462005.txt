If VSCode was not snappy and responsive, it would never have been a viable product for its target market.<p>Chat is the other way around. Slack is on my computer and there’s nothing stopping me from using it, but every org I’ve been at has mandated official communication channels, and for me it’s teams. Chat platform decisions are not made by the same metrics that software developers use for editors. I’m not excusing it, but I don’t see how it could work another way. I would assume teams project managers are incentivized to deliver a list of features and integrations that are targeted squarely at the desires of mid to senior level enterprise IT execs.')
