More or less, these rates are similar across western Europe (except for Switzerland). In the US, tax brackets are far more permissive [3].<p>Also, in the UK a £25k salary is fair enough to guarantee a visa [3], or €40k [4] in the Netherlands, hinting that these governments think that such a salary is high enough.<p>Most policies enacted by governments, I think more through ignorance rather than malice, assume that workers making ~€50k have enough and shouldn&#x27;t need to get increased.<p>While other factors (lack of big companies &amp; lack of VC investment) probably have a higher impact on the low wages, I think that government policies also have an affect on it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;income-tax-rates" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;income-tax-rates</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.academics.com&#x2F;guide&#x2F;taxes-in-germany" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.academics.com&#x2F;guide&#x2F;taxes-in-germany</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;uk-politics-51430811" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;uk-politics-51430811</a>\n[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iamexpat.nl&#x2F;career&#x2F;employment-news&#x2F;2019-income-requirements-residence-highly-skilled-migrant-netherlands" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iamexpat.nl&#x2F;career&#x2F;employment-news&#x2F;2019-income-r...</a>')
