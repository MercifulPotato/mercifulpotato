I can&#x27;t believe this puritanical bullshit in North America.<p>In Japan you can legally date Jyoshi Kousei schoolgirls and nobody gives a damn.<p>I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;m into that, I SPECIFICALLY mentioned they were 18 and now everybody thinks I&#x27;m Jeffrey Epstein for christs sake<p>I&#x27;m sick of puritans in this country judging people like me because they are jealous. They know their wives are old and unattractive and they freak out because they see 30 something old with an 18 yo.<p>It&#x27;s legal for them to be filmed on camera doing all sorts of depraved stuff and sold online but OH NO-WE CANT LET A THIRTY YEAR OLD dudes dating 18 yo.<p>I can&#x27;t wait to leave this god damn country.')
