In particular, the professional officers it attracted tended to be mediocre at best.<p>&gt; Organization, mindfulness<p>Armies in general have poor cost control, and an army at perpetual peace has even fewer repercussions to fear, so there is virtually no accountability. Your workforce can&#x27;t quit because it&#x27;s drafted, parliament sometimes gives you a higher budget than you asked for, because reasons, and you perennially plan for fictional wars that thankfully you never have to fight.<p>&gt; and the ability to give and receive orders.<p>It&#x27;s easy to give orders if your workforce can&#x27;t quit and goes to prison if they don&#x27;t follow the orders.<p>&gt; What is wrong with having something that is common across generations and backgrounds that allows people to connect with each other?<p>This aspect, that (mostly) men of all backgrounds served together, was maybe the one positive thing about the army. But nowadays, a smaller part of each generation serves, so that seems to go away as well. And it should be possible to implement a common service for other purposes than an army.')
