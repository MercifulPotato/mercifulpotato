Pfizer&#x27;s T-Cell responses are off-the-charts good. This could affect your immune system&#x27;s memory ability and could offer longer protection. Both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccine offers CD4 T-Cell responses. CD8+ is a nice-to-have, so the Pfizer vaccine would be an A+ grade, and this Moderna one is a solid &quot;A&quot;.<p>The 2nd key takeaway here is that while 5 patients in the vaccination group tested positive for coronavirus, none of them had severe disease. Which means to me that while this vaccine isn&#x27;t a magic shield, if you do get it, it will keep you out of the hospital and probably make it a very mild experience.')
