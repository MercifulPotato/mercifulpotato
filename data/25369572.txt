Item(by='nl', descendants=None, kids=[25369837], score=None, time=1607573245, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25369531, text='&gt; people were banned for posting the information<p>No, him using that as an excuse is the BS. If he could actually prove anything - instead of it just being yet more allegations - would be explosive, and being &quot;banned&quot; (by who exactly) wouldn&#x27;t matter.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not familiar with US law, so tell me, if you&#x27;d have some kind of sensitive data, can you decide that you will only present the data straight to the judge or should every relevant piece of information be included right away? Just to entertain the idea.<p>Of course, there are plenty of closed court methods of doing this.<p>&gt; I guess that we hopefully won&#x27;t have to wait too long to find out what&#x27;s bullshit and what&#x27;s not.<p>Unfortunately this isn&#x27;t true. It&#x27;s already 100% clear what is bullshit, but some people keep claiming otherwise, and will continue to do so for the next 4 years at least.<p>Put it like this: is there <i>anything</i> that would convince you that these claims are all BS? I mean - Trump appointed judges keep throwing the claims out of court. - what more do you need?')
