Item(by='MrBuddyCasino', descendants=None, kids=[24717689, 24717420], score=None, time=1602148690, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24716594, text='&gt;&gt; One other important aspect is Metal implementation is much simpler than a Vulkan one – more on that later – so in some sense I’d prefer a Metal -&gt; Vulkan wrapper instead of a Vulkan -&gt; Metal.<p>Read this so often that it seems to be the consensus by now. I used to think &quot;why doesn&#x27;t Apple just hop on the Vulkan bandwagon and everyone will be happily united under one API&quot;, but given that Metal came before Vulkan, and it still has better DX, Apple was right.<p>What excuse does Vulkan have being the second iteration on the same concept, but still be more tedious?')
