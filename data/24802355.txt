The light rail was originally going to be to the University District by 2006. Ridership wasn&#x27;t even close to original predictions. It&#x27;s slow and will never replace more than a small fraction of traffic by design; the stations are too small, the area around them isn&#x27;t zoned dense enough to bring in more more people, and there are no express bypasses so it will always be slow.')
