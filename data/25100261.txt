Claims like &quot;order of magnitudes faster&quot; should be supported by a reference, because from my own experience making something order of magnitude faster is really difficult and sometimes impossible. This is btw why Blend2D provides a benchmarking tool, to not claim something that cannot be verified.<p>I&#x27;m the author of Blend2D and I have never stated what you claim I did. I just gave up trying to compile SKIA. The benchmarking tool Blend2D uses is open source, maybe you can contribute SKIA backend to the tool and use it as an evidence? Otherwise all you say is just unfounded, sorry.<p>BTW SKIA team was positively impressed by the performance of Blend2D when it came out and we are in contact. I would not be surprised if SKIA started using similar techniques like Blend2D - for example JIT compiler. They are exploring new territories like Blend2D does.')
