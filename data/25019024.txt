It&#x27;s an excuse to attempt to distill belief systems into a very narrow point of view precisely like you&#x27;ve described with the whole &quot;only reason&quot; nonsense. I&#x27;d really appreciate it if one could describe why they consider themselves one since it&#x27;s totally meaningless to me when someone self identifies as a centrist.<p>Just like in marketing it&#x27;s all about how you frame a question to a person. Realistically most people share common beliefs at the fundamental level in what they want to see out of the power structures in our society. In other words, the vast majority of people in this country want to improve upon their material conditions. The rest of the circlejerk is just grifting.')
