I&#x27;ve avoided buying a U2F&#x2F;FIDO2 device (eg. YubiKey) for a few years thus far, as I&#x27;m &quot;happy enough&quot; with TOTP. I know the differences in terms of implementation&#x2F;security, but not enough services even offer TOTP, let alone the U2F&#x2F;FIDO2 protocols. It&#x27;s not worth the investment right now for how generally unsupported it is.<p>Do most services that support such devices really only support a single key&#x2F;device? Do they offer the same one-time recovery codes that are generally offered with TOTP (though the storage&#x2F;security of such codes server-side is dubious), for the eventual failure of the Yubikey (not if, but when)? Surely a tiny hardware device reaching the end of its lifespan doesn&#x27;t mean you lose access to your account.')
