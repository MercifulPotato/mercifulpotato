Original iPhone was extremely hyped before it was announced in the tech &#x2F; Apple circles. In case anyone arguing that is a small niche, the same argument could be used for Games as the OP used in examples. It is very rare to see Technology Announcement being used on Front Page newspaper.( Remember that thing we used to buy every day?) And this wasn&#x27;t just in US alone.<p>Original iPhone ( 2007 ) was only available in US, and it was very expensive at the time, $499 <i>with</i> contract. And Apple was selling every iPhone as fast as they could make it. And around the world iPhone continue the same strategy of only contract with iPhone. Arguably it wasn&#x27;t until iPhone 5 before it was readily available , I guess Steve Jobs relented on making iPhone Just in Time before passing away because it could never match the huge demand.<p>And yes, not only did it lived up to its hype, it was more than anyone could ever imagine.')
