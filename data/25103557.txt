It doesn&#x27;t require for an EVSE to actually be installed, but the building has to have the capacity for it. That&#x27;s important because adding say 20 30 amp EVSEs is a non-trivial increase in the total capacity a building needs.<p>BTW, even a 30 amp EVSE isn&#x27;t great in an apartment. Because commercial service is almost always 3 phase, you&#x27;ll only get 208v. That&#x27;s 6.2 kW. In my townhouse, I have a 40A 240V circuit (50A at the breaker, but the 80% rule means the EVSE only puts out 40A). That&#x27;s 10 kW. A 61% increase.')
