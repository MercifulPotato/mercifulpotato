That being said, just being able to look to see what my blood sugar is at without having to poke a hole in my finger was a massive change in how I managed my blood sugar. Having alerts for low (or dropping) blood sugar is a great thing, too. Man, I love my CGM (Dexcom G6)... can&#x27;t say enough good things about it compared to manual blood testing.')
