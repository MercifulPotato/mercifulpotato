Malcolm Gladwell went over this in a podcast with an NYT chief editor, the way it is structured makes in ambiguous whether the intention was for militias to have access to firearms, or the people. That&#x27;s why it is a such a hotly contested topic, that and we&#x27;re talking about guns. To say it&#x27;s &quot;already dreadfully infringed&quot; completely depends on your interpretation of that amendment.<p>I think pro gun advocates need to distance themselves from irresponsible gun owners and the NRA. It doesn&#x27;t help your cause. Promoting responsible gun legislation without spouting &quot;they&#x27;re going to take our guns over my dead body&quot; just makes you sound like a nut. We also need to address the vastly different circumstances the city living has compared to rural in terms of gun ownership. As well as stop burying the conversation when it comes to mass shootings, they happen way to often and absolutely would not happen if gun control was stricter, the entire world is evidence of this. Making guns harder to acquire makes them less likely, but only if that applies to an entire geographic region. If DC makes guns really hard to get, but Virginia makes them super easy, then it doesn&#x27;t matter at all.<p>I just don&#x27;t have much hope for anything bipartisan to actually work. Things are too split, and there&#x27;s very little upside for people to change sides.')
