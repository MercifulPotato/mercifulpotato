Do you then sync all the binaries when you go online?</i><p>Yes. Your news reader (nee aggregator) would use the NNTP protocol to tell the server &quot;please give me a list of articles in groups X, Y, and Z&quot;. Your reader would know you read up to article 234 in a group previously, but now there were 266, so there were 32 new ones. You&#x27;d tell the reader UI to go into that group, which would cause it to download the new articles (headers) and display them to you. If you saw a particular thread you liked you&#x27;d select that and the body of the article(s) would be downloaded.<p>If you wanted to do offline reading there was a file format call SOUP which would allow you to download it to your local machine (remember, this was often in the age of dial-up). There is no article on SOUP, but a similar idea was QWK for BBSes:<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;QWK_(file_format)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;QWK_(file_format)</a><p>To distribute articles&#x2F;posts globally an NNTP server would talk to other NNTP servers: technically peer-to-peer was&#x2F;is possible, but it was often hierarchical. One could also have site&#x2F;local-only groups and global groups.')
