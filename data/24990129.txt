I like appliances (printer or otherwise) that just work. If I ever have to buy a printer again, I&#x27;ll seriously consider Brother.<p>I currently use HP InkAdvantage 2135. Everyone at home uses Linux and it works flawlessly. Didn&#x27;t have to particularly install anything for printing.<p>After reading the comments here, I&#x27;m starting to believe that we got lucky.<p>Here are the downsides of my HP:<p>1. You cannot print a lot of pages on a single cartridge. They claim just 480, but I would put the realistic number to below 400 pages. And the cartridges are NOT cheap.<p>2. No auto-duplex<p>3. No wireless connectivity option for this particular printer.<p>But I knew about 2 and 3 while making the purchase, so it&#x27;s not really a downside.<p>However, considering that Brother printers are cheaper and paper yield is substantially higher, I feel that I should&#x27;ve bought that instead.<p>I&#x27;m secretly hoping my existing printer goes kaput :)')
