Item(by='Gene_Parmesan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605830255, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25154004, text='&gt; Are there whales who buy everything you can put in front of their face, or a different demographic who searches for something to buy and then changes their mind in precisely 850 milliseconds?<p>Maybe, maybe not, but site load time has a very well documented correlation with bounce rate. And if a user bounces, they&#x27;re obviously not going to end up spending money.<p>I believe it&#x27;s more about keeping the user in a sort of sales&#x2F;marketing &#x27;funnel&#x27;. If I&#x27;m just browsing and come across a service I might be vaguely interested in, perhaps I&#x27;ll click the link to view their page. Now I&#x27;m at the top of the funnel. With each link I have to click to follow, there is an opportunity for me to get bored, get distracted by something else, or so on. Maybe I&#x27;m not buying anything then, but maybe somewhere along the funnel is a free trial of the service, and if I&#x27;m in a pleasant mood, maybe I&#x27;ll do the trial. But if I bounced because of a 5 sec load time, chances are good the mildly impulsive mood I was in is not going to persist enough to encourage a subsequent visit.<p>So it might not be an immediate thing, but better engagement does lead to more sales. I like to consider myself a mindful shopper, but there are definitely a handful of $5&#x2F;month services I am subbed to because I was in a vaguely impulsive  mood and stumbled into something I thought might be useful -- and their signup process was silky smooth.<p>And if you are instead shopping for an item and browsing several different sites, if one of them sticks out because of its slow load times, that&#x27;s a tab you are going to close.')
