Fun fact: The whole thing was well known in advance and even observed online by law enforcement.<p>What kept &#x27;regular people&#x27; from hopping onto a widely derided and supposedly extremist platform, where threats of exposure of ones personal life simply for being there stopped them from noticing extremism?<p>Are you sure that is a good argument?<p>Firstly, almost no average FB or TW user knows of those forums, let alone the ones that do being willing to also &#x27;go there&#x27; given all the stigma.<p>My point still is, if you force these people into places like that, where their plans are easily observable, and 99% of people wont go there then it will fester in silence.<p>Whereas the other potential is..sunlight. Let them say their statements in the sunlight, rather than ban them.<p>1. Family or friends will banter them down<p>2. Friends of friends will bring them to center rather than extreme (on EITHER side)<p>3. its one place rather than 35 distinct forums for LEO to follow.')
