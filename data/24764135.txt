They save energy over a simple vent by transferring heat (or lack of heat) from stale conditioned exhaust air to incoming fresh air. I think ERVs also deal with moisture.<p>A separate device called an air-side economizer can be added to a central air conditioner system. It can save energy when itâ€™s colder and dryer outside a building than inside. When conditions are right, cold, dry outside air is pulled in and warm building air is exhausted reducing the need to run the AC compressor.<p>Air-Side Economizer | Products | ENERGY STAR\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.energystar.gov&#x2F;products&#x2F;low_carbon_it_campaign&#x2F;12_ways_save_energy_data_center&#x2F;air_side_economizer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.energystar.gov&#x2F;products&#x2F;low_carbon_it_campaign&#x2F;1...</a>')
