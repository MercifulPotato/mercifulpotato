I don&#x27;t know any. Not Dell, or HP, or Lenovo.<p>Apple still sells 13&quot; Macbook Pros that go up to 32GB RAM, they&#x27;re just Intel ones. If you need more than 16 GB in a Pro Mac, or a Mini you can still get it. So these options have not been taken off the table. The M1 machines simply offer a new tradeoff of smaller but faster memory if that works for you. Not every machine needs to offer every possible configuration.')
