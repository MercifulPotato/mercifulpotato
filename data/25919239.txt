Item(by='shaftway', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611684753, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25918266, text='&gt; Windows 2000 was super neat compared to the old clunky Win 98<p>My dad had a friend with an MSDN subscription, so we got a pre-release developer copy of Windows 95. Moving from Windows 3.11 to that was pretty jaw dropping.<p>But after a while we had an issue with the machine. Sectors on the hard drive were going bad, so we brought it into a shop to have someone confirm that. When we booted it up in the shop the tech&#x27;s eyes went wide and I think he started drooling a little bit. He offered to swap the drives and copy all of our data from one to the other for free (I assume he thought he could make a copy of the OS for himself too). We declined and he was pretty crushed.')
