Do you honestly think that was his life’s experience - that every single minority he’s met has expressed hatred towards him? It seems pretty clear that you’re concern trolling here and not arguing in good faith.<p>Or maybe you’re not, and you genuinely believe that &#x2F;rjkennedy98 has met every black person and knows us well enough to judge our hearts. Can you please explain if you think he’s met every black person, that he can pass group judgement?')
