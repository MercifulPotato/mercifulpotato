Item(by='mrandish', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610048195, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25675076, text='&gt; You&#x27;re going to be down the road with no benefits, no growth, no title, and nothing to build the rest of your career on.<p>&quot;Benefits&quot; aren&#x27;t free. Every company budgets the cost for everything an employee receives as &quot;Total Compensation&quot; from health plan to gym to educational credits to free food to stock options.<p>I used to think &quot;free stuff&quot; was great until I started understanding how the money really works in this situation. Now I would much prefer the freedom to choose the benefits I value at the level I choose instead of having them chosen for me in a &quot;one size fits all&quot; plan. Just give me ALL the money in that Total Comp number and let me choose what to keep in my pocket and what I wish to buy.<p>Comparing a low-skill job like driving an Uber with higher skill, more specialized work is apples vs oranges. In a free employment market, being an independent contractor tends to the most beneficial arrangement for most workers - it&#x27;s just harder to see the full picture when the costs of &quot;benefits&quot; are hidden and the true &quot;Total Comp&quot; of an FTE vs IC isn&#x27;t disclosed transparently.<p>I prefer more transparency (information), more choice, more flexibility and more control being in my hands.')
