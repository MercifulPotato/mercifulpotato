Second, electronics is trivial, very trivial even. Software isn&#x27;t so much. Especially effective software that can automatically manage all interconnections between LUTs. It is not a rocket science tho, but significant entrance barrier to the market. That is why all the &quot;FPGA&quot; companies hold so much their binary formats as a secret and not open sourcing any tools.')
