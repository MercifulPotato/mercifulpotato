Turned out to be hugely useful both at their desks from the screen real estate (3440x1440) and using them for mid-year and year-end demos.<p>When my interns rolled off me and my employees naturally repurposed the monitors and within a couple of months everyone had gotten so used to them we had to have one at home for remote work days.<p>My desk is an old english game table that is 36&quot; wide so two 20+&quot; monitors is a little crowded. But one 34&quot; monitor is perfect for me. Same idea: lots of screen real estate. The fact that everyone on the team has one with the same resolution at home makes screen sharing between us perfect.  The other team members still have multi-monitor setups, so they can always screen share off of their second monitors when presenting to people with lower resolution displays. I have to scooch my browser to the far left and blow up to 150% before people can read anything.  Minor downside, but still worth it.')
