Some of them are more thoroughly curated, others are a snapshot of the most popular articles, etc.<p>What I could not find easily was a full English Wikipedia with images and all available in an easily accessible format (like the Kiwix snapshots). I&#x27;d put a whole hard disk for this purpose, because the size is in the gigabyte-terabyte range.')
