Period.<p>If the immigration system doesn&#x27;t allow that, then either you&#x27;ll hire remote, or you&#x27;ll be beaten by an international competitor with more liberal skilled immigration rules. Neither is a great outcome.<p>There are simple ways to ensure H1-B is used to hire this type of talent. The recent rules that prioritize H1-B applicants based on their salary are positive IMO and address a lot of the Tata&#x2F;Infosys abuse (which is real). If you are truly going after the best global talent, that won&#x27;t be cheap!<p>H1-B is super old school. The notion is that you only hire someone in H1-B if there&#x27;s nobody that can do the job. However, the challenge today is not if you <i>can</i> do the job, but can you do it better than the global competitors? That concept is super foreign to immigration legislation (no pun intended :).<p>Short of a whole new immigration framework, increasing the number of H1-Bs and prioritizing based on salary would be a good short term fix - no lawsuits needed.')
