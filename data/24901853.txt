For example, when I write C# in Visual Studio, the IDE remains amazingly helpful even when the code is incomplete and would be rejected by a traditional parser. I&#x27;d guess that Microsoft simply has the budget to have the VS&#x2F;C# dev teams grind out hundreds or thousands of special cases that are specific to C#... but I would love to learn that there are some fundamental techniques that would fit into a few credits worth of CS education.')
