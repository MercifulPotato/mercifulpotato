In its early days, WSB was almost entirely a bunch of rich wall street traders with extra tens&#x2F;hundreds of thousands to spare on crazy bets. Nowadays, it&#x27;s one of the largest subreddits on one of the largest websites in the world. WSB isn&#x27;t some niche gathering of &quot;average joes&quot; - all of the major wall street firms monitor it, and it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me to learn that many of them downright manipulate it via astroturfing.')
