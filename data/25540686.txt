The primary reason for using these languages appears to be that they are easy to learn when getting started (either as a new developer or a new project). But when you think that you&#x27;re optimising to save a couple of months coming up to speed on tech over a lifetime of maintenance and performance benefits ... it seems lazy to me.')
