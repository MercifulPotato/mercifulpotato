So shocking that I basically didn&#x27;t believe it, so I tried myself (in C++, but it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference). With 2000 threads, the computer had no problem whatsoever, the process only took around 16 megabytes of memory and not very much CPU.<p>So I bumped it up to 20,000, thinking that would probably work as well: the computer immediately crashed and rebooted. I didn&#x27;t even get the &quot;kernel panic&quot; screen, it just died (this is on a 2018 mac mini with a 3.2 Ghz Core i7). When it turned back on, this was the first line of the error message:<p>Panic(CPU 0, time 1921358616513346): NMIPI for unresponsive processor: TLB flush timeout, TLB state:0x0<p>Weird. I really thought that this wouldn&#x27;t be an issue at all. And: if it was an issue, that the OS would be able to handle it and kill the process or something, not kernel panic.')
