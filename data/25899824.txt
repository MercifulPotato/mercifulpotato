Item(by='nine_k', descendants=None, kids=[25902330], score=None, time=1611554352, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25898878, text='I agree that you can glue flat paper in a way that connects disparate points without making it spherical and thus breaking the Euclidean properties: parallel lines, sum of angles in a triangle, distance, <i>except</i> for the teleport points. You can draw two lines parallel to a given line through a given non-teleport point: one passing through a teleport, another not passing.<p>Since the very notion of a line or a distance in the Mountain Valley world is ill-defined, I would not call it Euclidean either, even though each static configuration of it may be Euclidean, minus doors (which are teleports again).')
