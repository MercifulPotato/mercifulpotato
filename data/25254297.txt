You threw a parting shot over the bow, <i>then</i> wanted to walk away.<p>Not very sporting, now is that?<p>You&#x27;re saying you believe individual&#x27;s rights trump company&#x27;s rights.  Well sure, I agree with that.<p>But that is an insanely broad statement, and yet you&#x27;re claiming I see it differently, which really can be used to infer that I&#x27;m some sort of careless bastard.<p>Let&#x27;s be clear.  When <i>you</i> mentioned &#x27;individuals&#x27;, what you&#x27;ve meant this entire time is &#x27;a person in a foreign country, working in software engineering&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s it.  That&#x27;s the extent of your definition of &#x27;individual&#x27;.<p>Any other &#x27;individual&#x27; can go suck eggs, as far as you&#x27;re concerned!  You literally have thrown away all logic on living costs, not to mention you&#x27;re heartlessly and carelessly disregarding all taxation!<p>What about all those taxes, federal, state, sales tax, gas tax, property tax, city taxes, which go to help the homeless?  Those are a part of that salary too.  Yet, you literally cannot understand, or refuse to get, the concept that salary pays, not just the engineer... but instead the entirety of cost to <i>support</i> that engineer.<p>People get so upset, that various governments don&#x27;t help the poor, build infrastructure to help those in lower income brackets, try to make sure schools are funded, and so on.<p>California has crazy taxes, and a lot of that DOES go towards additional social programs.  And therefore?  That tax creates upward pressure on engineer salaries, which means?<p>Part of that wage is &quot;high&quot;, due to that taxation.  Yet you aim to use that AGAINST companies, and instead, force them to pay that SAME SALARY, without local taxation, to some guy in ... well, anywhere but the US, as you&#x27;ve said.<p>Like places with reduced human rights.  Or horribly restrictive laws.  Or a disregard for the rights of women, minorities, and more!<p>Yup, screw it all and nail a bucket to a post, just gimme gimme gimme that salary.<p>And say anything to make it a reality.')
