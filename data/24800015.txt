Our first attempt was an Octopus, holding on to the ear with its tentacles! But here&#x27;s the problem with the spider web design: if you put a circuit board + battery front and center, sticking forward, it looks like a gigantic tumor on the ear. There&#x27;s no way to avoid that. Which is why we focused on designs that hid the board behind the earring. We also wanted the earrings to be swappable (because I don&#x27;t see most women wanting to wear the same look every day.) Our challenges were: hiding the circuit board, positioning the speaker near the canal, <i>and</i> allowing swappable looks. We spent <i>months</i> just figuring out how to solve these design issues.')
