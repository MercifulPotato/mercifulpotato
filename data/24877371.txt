Green sources simply collect zero-cost fuels that are available to everyone, everywhere, without mining or transportation or political borders. Nuclear is expensive.<p>It costs money to store green energy for future use. It also costs money to store nuclear waste ... for what use?<p>2. I&#x27;m not afraid of nuclear -power-. But the risks are quite clear, much greater, and more costly. The industry has consistently demonstrated that the nuclear path is vulnerable to human error, acts of god, deliberate shortcuts and cost-cutting , lack of maintenance, undetected deterioration, sabotage, bad design, and so on. Each risk can result in leakage of very dangerous and persistent toxins into the environment.The cost of remediation - if that&#x27;s even possible - (Fukushima for one  example) can be much, much higher than the cost of avoiding the problem. How much windpower could Japan create with the money they&#x27;ll invest in Fukushima in coming decades (for what return)?<p>The technology is already available to allow us to go Green, at much lower cost, on a much faster timeline, with much less waste and environmental risk, anywhere in the world where there&#x27;s sun and wind.')
