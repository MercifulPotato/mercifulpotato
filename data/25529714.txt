Railgun up the side of a mountain on the equator and an orbiting station with a capture mechanism that is in a sense the strongest bungee cord imaginable. 17k mph is a lot of speed to make a grab. Exiting the railgun at mach 3-4 at 30,000 feet has engineering issues and still has accelerate above mach 20 for a stable orbit.')
