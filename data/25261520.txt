The TMS9900, the CPU used in the TI-99&#x2F;4A, had three hardware registers: a program counter, a status word, and what was called a Workspace Pointer (WP). General purpose &quot;registers&quot; lived in RAM, and were referenced by an offset off the value in the WP. Subroutine calls were initiated by saving the PC and changing the WP to a fresh new register context before branching.')
