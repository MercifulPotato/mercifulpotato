Item(by='Aengeuad', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602078288, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24707459, text='11k Lines of code seems like a lot especially if you&#x27;re insisting that it was just wholly ripped out of an existing codebase but that isn&#x27;t the case here at all and even Oracle make that clear in their analogy:<p>&gt;It says what Google has done is like taking key parts of those books — chapter titles, character names, the first sentence of each paragraph — writing a new book, and selling it.<p>If you&#x27;re reimplementing APIs as Google has done then at some point you _need_ to copy the structure of the existing API, the method signatures, the names of the methods, the descriptions of what they do, etc, and while you may be able to dig out a thesaurus to claim enough original creative work at some point it&#x27;s all for moot because there&#x27;s only so much you can do before you&#x27;ll start infringing upon Oracles creative expression of their API which severely limits what you are able to do with it.<p>If Oracle wins this case it will have huge implications for any reverse engineered work like Wine or graphics drivers where such projects will cease to exist, because it won&#x27;t actually matter if it&#x27;s 100% your own implementation as any interface to existing APIs or hardware _will_ infringe upon other companies copyright.<p>As far as Youtube Content ID goes it doesn&#x27;t actually matter if it&#x27;s 3 seconds or 3 minutes of copyrighted work, if it&#x27;s matched then Youtube will let those companies claim revenue from your video which may be an hour long. The alternative here is the legal system and courts which may absolutely agree that 3 seconds of use in an hour long video is fair use, but you&#x27;re still going to end up in court to defend that usage. It&#x27;s unlikely that Oracle has enough sway to force Github to implement a similar content matching system but if they did it doesn&#x27;t really matter what threshold the courts set for fair use for reimplementing APIs just like it doesn&#x27;t matter for Youtube, best make sure all your repos don&#x27;t use something like XMLHttpRequest() or your repo may disappear, and of course if Oracle doesn&#x27;t have the sway to force Github into implementing such a system you&#x27;re still going to have to go check through all your your repos because if they feel you&#x27;ve infringed upon their creative work they&#x27;ll be able to issue takedown requests and your only recourse will be through the courts.')
