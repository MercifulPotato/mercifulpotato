Or you accept the fee and start using the card. It took an act of congress to stop them from doing that.<p>Around that same time the credit card companies were also getting a lot of flack for issuing cards to newborns, pets, and the deceased. That also took an act of congress to stop.<p>The US credit agencies themselves are only a few decades old, people have been borrowing and lending for a bit longer then that - you can read about it in the Old Testament.')
