I wish I had never left it and the reason for doing so was because I didn&#x27;t want to stare at a computer screen for the rest of my life. I went to college... loved it... studied psychology... attempted to get a job in multiple areas, found out some of them were not for me, only to realize that I would need to utilize that skill I had taught myself at 12... and welp, I&#x27;m good at what I do... and I stare at a computer screen all day for work and have done so for the past decade. Sometimes... you just can&#x27;t escape your fate. In choosing this career path, I also had to give up pursuing a woman I was in love with.')
