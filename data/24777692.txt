Will NOT TOUCH.<p>A seasons show that got canned on cliffhanger wasn&#x27;t getting touched in a way which would justify the cost, anyway; they are writing in off and stopping lighting money on fire when they are cancelling it.<p>They don&#x27;t want to invest the kind of money they put into these series for something people already committed to the platform might try out, the expensive, heavily promoted at launch series need to be drivers of the decision to subscribe or stay subscribed (there’s plenty of stuff that’s cheaper, less promoted, and probably fine for them if it&#x27;s essentially catalog filler, but that&#x27;s not the series that get attention.) And if it&#x27;s not doing that, throwing another (even truncated) season’s worth of money to slightly boost it&#x27;s value as catalog filler might make some artistic sense, but it doesn&#x27;t make a lot of business sense.')
