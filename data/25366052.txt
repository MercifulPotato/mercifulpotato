A lot of stuff they added used to be handled by gems - password hashing, attachments, background jobs, caching, etc. all got rolled into the core framework.<p>Another comment mentioned <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.rubyonrails.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.rubyonrails.org</a>, which is good.
