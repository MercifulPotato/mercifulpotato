How?<p>Your account is unable to access _any_ private repository after being flagged as being from a sanctioned country. That&#x27;s regardless of where you&#x27;re actually accessing your account from.<p>While you could create a new account, you still couldn&#x27;t grant that new account access (since you can no longer access private repositories from your primary account). Also a new account still runs the risk of getting flagged if you accidentally access the account without a VPN enabled just once.')
