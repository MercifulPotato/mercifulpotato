It means we can (with reasonable probability) expect the software to be fast and lightweight in terms of memory usage, and it means itâ€™s probably a lot easier for new contributors to jump in than an equivalent C or C++ codebase. That last bit is about a lot more than memory safety. Rust is basically designed from the ground up to make it relatively easy to onboard a new engineer safely onto a project in comparison to legacy systems languages.')
