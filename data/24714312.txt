One of the first signs that you have made substantial progress in a foreign language is that you no longer have to translate your internal monologue when speaking.<p>If you are by yourself, then reverting to the native language can happen. That&#x27;s assuming you can even &#x27;hear&#x27; your internal monologue, that&#x27;s not a given. Would this impair language learning?<p>What about children exposed to multiple languages from an early age? Surely the external voices wouldn&#x27;t always match what&#x27;s in their head - they still learn very quickly.')
