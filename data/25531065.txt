I can’t believe how good they all were in their roles, phenomenal performances.<p>The one minor scene that always wrecks me is where Bodie is talking to McNulty near the end of the series and says, “I feel old...”<p>The character is supposed to be a late teenager in that scene, and is already feeling worn out of life he has almost no chance of escaping.<p>That to me was the big takeaway. Too many things are stuck where they are: people, systems, etc.<p>As Marlo says, “You want it to be one way, but it’s the other way.”<p>Okay I’m done fan-boying. Yes, I’m this annoying when I tell my irl friends about the show as well.')
