When people say the Fed “prints dollars” it’s not literally printed, it’s a number in a computer representing the reserve account of member banks. When you use a bank card, it’s just changing numbers in bank databases.<p>No country has a gold-backed currency. The USD is not backed by gold, or anything. It was historically backed by gold until the US defaulted in 1971 (The Nixon Shock), because they didn’t have enough gold to service foreign debt obligations. The US had increasingly issued more dollars than it had gold backing it (fractional reserve banking). When they defaulted, the US abandoned the gold standard altogether and let the dollar float freely. The US can create as many dollars as it wants.')
