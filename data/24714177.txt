The recent talk about it running &quot;hot&quot; misses the point; the heat has to go somewhere. A MacBook running hot (and boy, does it) matters to the person whose lap it is on, but not so much for a console sitting at the other end of the room, as long as you leave enough room for air flow.<p>The fact that the Xbox Series X previews universally report that the console runs quietly is promising. (Yes, they all tested with X1&#x2F;360&#x2F;original Xbox games, as opposed to Xbox Series native games. But they are all getting upscaling and HDR added, so the console still has to do work.) This may change in seven years when the new GTA8 pushes it to the limit just before the next Xbox comes out.')
