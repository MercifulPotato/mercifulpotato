Similarly, I&#x27;d witnessed (and participated in) mocking of domain-specific jargon when I was younger, and I see it still today.<p>It&#x27;s not data, but my experience in the space strongly supports the suggestion that a dismissive, reductive, and aloof posture is quite common in tech.  It&#x27;s one reason that I regularly tell team members that engineers should be professional pessimists, especially about themselves and their ignorance.')
