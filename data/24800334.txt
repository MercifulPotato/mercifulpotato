Still, it&#x27;s an improvement from the little green unripe acid pellets that most people are buying. With table grapes, consumers demand seedlessness, which means there&#x27;s quite a low genetic diversity since most trace their breeding back to Thompson Seedless.<p>I grow wine grapes, and grow in the northeast (Ontario) so I don&#x27;t grow anything like this. I grow cold hardy hybrids that trace the majority of their ancestry back to wild vines that are native to eastern North America (which is the centre of diversity for the genus, BTW).<p>The vines I grow for wine mostly come out of the University of Minnesota grape breeding program; they are pretty bulletproof vines.  I could probably grow vinifera here, but it would involve bucketloads of pesticides that I can&#x27;t be bothered with.<p>Here&#x27;s a recent podcast interview with the head of the grape breeding program at the University of Minnesota, if you&#x27;re interested: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.organicwinepodcast.com&#x2F;e&#x2F;matt-clark-grape-breeder&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.organicwinepodcast.com&#x2F;e&#x2F;matt-clark-grape-breede...</a><p>I have plenty of &quot;weird&quot; grapes here because I hobby breed. I mainly work (play) with a wild species that is rare in Ontario and around the northeast, called vitis aestivalis bicolor. V. Aestivalis is a species of grape that has lower acids, higher tannins, higher disease resistance, and more neutral flavour than most of the wild grapes -- but it&#x27;s also a pain to work with because it does not propagate from dormant hardwood easily, so it&#x27;s been neglected in breeding. Bicolor is its northern variant that is hardy up to about latitude 43, around the southern great lakes region. I am trying to cross it with other, more cold hardy, hybrids to produce something with the lower acids, higher tannin, and more neutral flavour that bicolor has but with higher sugars and more cold hardiness. I have a number of vines here from other hobby breeders that I&#x27;m playing with as well.<p>High quality wine from cold hardy and disease resistant hybrids is still a &quot;Work in progress&quot;; growers, breeders, winemakers, and wine marketers have a lot of work to do still. But it&#x27;s imperative because vinifera is becoming less and less viable every day and it&#x27;s stupid to be growing it in places like Ontario. And in any case the same thing every day is boring.')
