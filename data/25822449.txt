If the leaders of a society stop being creative, they can no longer lead by inspiration and example and so need to start to dominate to retain and exert power. Maybe you could see censorship as part of that, but it&#x27;s a bit early to tell for sure.<p>But what&#x27;s more interesting is what he says comes after: in reaction to a dominant leadership, the masses withdraw their loyalty and start to devise new religious forms (or maybe repurpose old ones). So a growing religious fervour could be a sign of things going wrong. I don&#x27;t think we see that yet, but it could be something to keep an eye out for if people lose faith in the power of politics to improve their situation.')
