Often these services actively tried to block us, and we would spend weeks or months working around their changes. Yahoo was notorious for this.<p>It&#x27;s not entirely different than the current situation, in that regard, but there was also less security baked in on the older services, and much of the protocols were in plain text.<p>It&#x27;s funny.
