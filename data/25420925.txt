I grew up in a house with a dad who fully bought into the &quot;wear a sweater&quot; philosophy. He&#x27;d make us go around all winter wearing two sweaters, a hat, and shoes indoors, and I still froze. My nose ran constantly and my hands got so cold I couldn&#x27;t use my computer.<p>Now I&#x27;m an adult and I&#x27;ve learned that the extra cost to heat my condo to 23 degrees all winter is basically the same as my Netflix subscription, I recognize that philosophy for the idiocy that it is. If it&#x27;s too expensive to heat your house correctly, then you have a problem with your insulation and you need to fix it.<p>My parents finally insulated their attic and bought a heat pump this year, and for the first time in a decade I can visit them in the winter and be comfortable the whole time.')
