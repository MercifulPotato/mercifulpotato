I have been using VirtualBox nearly every day at work for the past 4 years, and my experience is that if anything, it&#x27;s <i>improved</i> in quality and free features since the Oracle acquisition.<p>I do realise how toxic it is to have the proprietary extension pack as the source of advanced features, but the only thing that&#x27;s I really, really need from that is USB 2.0. It&#x27;s not like new features are even extension pack exclusives either, most of them land in the open core from the start.')
