If you lived on the Scotish borders or the Welsh marches you would be very likely to see combat on a regular basis. Raiding was a way of life for both sides... England was probably relatively unusual in having a relatively stable core for a relatively long time, but even then civil strife was not uncommon, and wars were fought as soon as either side could afford them. I think that a medieval knight that didn&#x27;t take martial training really seriously risked being killed pretty promptly. On the other hand I guess that there was a large random element and there may have been a bit of &quot;it makes no real difference so sod it&quot; in their attitude, I don&#x27;t suppose we will ever know because it seems that there was no real attempt to codify and share the knowledge - it was an oral tradition.')
