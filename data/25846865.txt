While there&#x27;s lots of room for debate over &quot;I need this job because I need the money, even though the job is bad&quot;, in this case it&#x27;s very simple: there&#x27;s no money. So you don&#x27;t have to take the job.<p>The modal open source project receives no money. Then there&#x27;s a long tail of projects that get just enough donations to keep going, a few ones that have secured a commercial sponsor, and then one or two big enough to have a &quot;foundation&quot; (Mozilla, Apache).<p>&gt; We live in a very different world compared to 1989 when the GPL was first published<p>Could you articulate which differences you feel are relevant please?')
