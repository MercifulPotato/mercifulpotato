Item(by='Eugeleo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610288787, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25704567, text='&gt; You realize 70+ million people are not nazis, right?<p>(not the OP) Sure, but that&#x27;s just a strawman, as nobody is saying they are. Twitter, Facebook, and Apple are specifically trying NOT to deplatform all of the 70 mil &quot;alright&quot; people, but only those few who go against the laws, right? Nobody&#x27;s banning r&#x2F;concervative, only the T_D got taken down.<p>&gt; Platform would ideally provide controls for you to hide things you don&#x27;t want to see. [...] This is the future and what we should be aiming for.<p>I like this idea very much! This already happens to some level, by following only certain accounts, being part of certain subreddits, or by switching to certain platforms, but I think a &quot;physical&quot; explicit checkmark to hide specific themes might make people think more about what they&#x27;re actually doing â€” closing their eyes and ears and hiding themselves in echo chambers.<p>With that said, I&#x27;m sure we both can agree that most companies wouldn&#x27;t want to provide a platform for nazis and pedophiles (...to discuss their nazi and pedophile things), even if the other users could hide their posts. Because, why would you do that? F*ck them.')
