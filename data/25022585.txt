The large power amps with built in DSP tend to process the audio signal before it reaches the power amp circuit. Artifacts such as harmonics can be driven down way below any credible threshold of audibility, with conventional techniques.<p>Especially in big amps, the power amp already has some rather heavy responsibilities, just to be stable when driving odd loads, and generally not blowing up. This tends to discourage putting a lot of weird stuff inside the feedback loop.')
