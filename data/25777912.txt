(Which is really unfortunate timing.) At some point I must&#x27;ve clicked on the wrong article while seeing what the &quot;other side&quot; was up to. And now my feed is full of tacticool insurrectionist chic.<p>The most disconcerting to me was an ad showcasing a &quot;tactical hooded trench coat&quot;[0], with the model holding an AK in the FB ad. I mean, nobody is going hunting, or defending their home, with their <i>tactical hooded trench coat</i>. Seemed pretty squarely targeted at the aspiring insurrectionist crowd.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m all for letting people buy whatever strange clothes they want. If I have any point here it&#x27;s that maybe FB doesn&#x27;t get to claim the moral high ground when they&#x27;re pushing ads using AKs as props, targeted at the crowd that stormed the capital (also, they need to fix their algorithm if they&#x27;re pushing them to me).<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;bxcK7zb" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;bxcK7zb</a>')
