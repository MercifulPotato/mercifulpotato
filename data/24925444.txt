Then suddenly the add recipe form finally appeared. Blazing fast! On your dev laptop maybe.<p>- click payee, nothing happens. URL changes though. God I hate SPAs<p>- adding an item to your shopping list causes a &#x27;item added&#x27; popup to appear. Over the add item button so you can&#x27;t add another item without dismissing the popup. It&#x27;s probably only an issue on mobilr, but this popup is only necessary because it&#x27;s a SPA<p>- I&#x27;m on the &#x27;create shopping category page&#x27;. Try and click the 3 dot thing in the top right. The new menu appears underneath the body of the page...<p>- on the recipe page, you can click the M? button and it displays a link about &#x27;markdown&#x27;. Click the link, it takes you to a blank page, which then redirects back to the homepage after a second or two. Bye-bye all your existing input<p>- this is more of a bug, but if you try and use markdown in the directions text box for recipes, you can&#x27;t. Start with a # and all your input just disappears (Firefox mobile)<p>A few other comments I&#x27;d add:<p>- Get a designer, or maybe buy an off the shelf design. That green is err, not nice. The design looks like a developer made it. I&#x27;m not great either but you can get a decent design, based on bootstrap or whatever, for like $50 and just adapt it. There are even free designsz like AdminLTE<p>- why are the top corners of the input boxes rounded, but the bottom corners square?<p>- Every time I go to the login screen, the logo pops in later than the rest of the screen. And then the Google login pops in even later. I&#x27;m on my mobile so can&#x27;t check, but that screams bad browser cache settings on your images&#x2F;static assets<p>- why are the + buttons slightly elliptical instead of round? Looks odd<p>I generally like the idea behind the app though, though won&#x27;t use it as it&#x27;s all in $s. I wonder how much traction you&#x27;re going to get though as it&#x27;s going to be really intensive setting it all up')
