Did they do <i>any testing whatsoever</i> before migrating the live production system? They misformatting the domain name should have broken even basic functionality tests.<p>I wonder if they <i>didn&#x27;t</i> actually test the literal &quot;gmail.com&quot; configuration, due to dev&#x2F;testing environments using a different domain name? I had that problem when on my first Ruby on Rails project due to subtle differences between the development&#x2F;test&#x2F;production settings in config&#x2F;environments&#x2F;. Running &quot;rake test&quot; is not a substitute for an actual test of the real production system.')
