Or 100 million acres.<p>I don&#x27;t really follow. The use case is that you want to prevent small farmers from encroaching on the jungle. This will only ever happen at the border between where the small farmers end and the jungle begins. If you buy land <i>behind</i> the border, that&#x27;s nothing but a waste of your money (until the border is so thoroughly dejungled that your old hinterlands is the new border).<p>In turn, this means that all of the land you&#x27;re interested in is border. You can&#x27;t rely on the fact that a circle has a high ratio of area to perimeter to claim cost-efficiency, because you&#x27;re structurally constrained to owning maximally cost-inefficient strip shapes.')
