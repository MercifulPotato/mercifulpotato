Item(by='cabalamat', descendants=None, kids=[25987985], score=None, time=1612181339, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25986604, text='&gt; but I can&#x27;t get onboard with Gemini until it offers the same support for screenreaders as HTML. (For example, an equivalent of span lang=XX tags is missing, so if you quote a foreign-language word(s) in your text, you can&#x27;t let screenreaders know what language to read it in).<p>The problem with this you&#x27;ll get a million other people saying &quot;Gemini is a really good simple format that the internet needs, but you need to just add feature X&quot;. But if Gemini added all those features, it would become as bloated as HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS!')
