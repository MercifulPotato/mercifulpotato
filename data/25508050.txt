I have no idea what point you&#x27;re trying to make here.<p>Is there anything in my above comment you actually disagree with? It seems like you&#x27;re just advocating for 100% socialism where individuals don&#x27;t have private assets.<p>Suppose you have $100. You go to the grocery store and have lots of choices, you can buy basic groceries to feed yourself for the week for $50 and then give $50 to research to a rare disease which impacted a family member, or you can spend the full $100 at the grocery store buying brand name prepared foods. Are you saying people shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to make the choice between those? Are you saying the first person is doing something bad by giving their money to medical research instead of spending it?')
