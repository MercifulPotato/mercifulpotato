How many people actually create, and create and share in general though. Since I got into art and sharing it people tell me they also create but don&#x27;t share it online anywhere. People might want to participate but don&#x27;t for whatever reason.<p>The internet does also give a equal megaphone to everyone. Actual crazy things can sound reasonable. The act if down and upvoting on reddit is also similar. 4 or 5 downvotes, which in reality is only 4 or 5 people can bury a thought, essentially censoring it and makes it seem more unpopular then it is. It was only unpopular to those 4 or 5 readers.')
