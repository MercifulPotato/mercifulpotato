I am looking at possibly replacing AppDaemon as we speak.<p>This is a great software, bit it is really distinct from HA and simple automations require quite a bit of code anyway.<p>I was thinking about having a mixed mode: the very simple automations (covers up at 9:00) would go into the YAML and more complicated would use the Python scripting described here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.home-assistant.io&#x2F;integrations&#x2F;python_script&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.home-assistant.io&#x2F;integrations&#x2F;python_script&#x2F;</a> (also from automations, but the real work would be done in the script)<p>Now I see with your comment that there is a HACS component as well - have you compared both and chose one of them for some specific reason?')
