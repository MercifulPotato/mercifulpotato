Item(by='RC_ITR', descendants=None, kids=[25261205, 25260799], score=None, time=1606777045, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25259251, text='I think you missed the reference to reordering.<p>In the case referenced, there were 3 transactions on one day, 2 of $10 &amp; 1 of $20.  User has $20 in account.  Do you take the true chronological order of transactions (10&#x2F;10&#x2F;20) &amp; charge 1 fee, or do you go highest to lowest (20&#x2F;10&#x2F;10) &amp; charge 2 fees?<p>A bank executive would likely argue why it&#x27;s &#x27;fair&#x27; to charge 2 fees because a business day is the relevant period for a bank (closing at end of day, etc.) &amp; that method of accounting is mentioned on page 85 of the checking account TOS that a user signed.<p>Many consumers would argue that the bank&#x27;s relevant period is meaningless, especially in the age of computers.  They would also argue that it is unfair to lay out complex rules like this in an opaque way because of the asymmetrical information advantage that a bank has.  They wouldn&#x27;t complain that the rule was enforced per se, they would complain that the rule (which is plainly anti-consumer) exists.<p>Same is true of this cheating stuff - I think in general, students want a fair platform for grading.  They just want that platform to be actually fair.')
