I cover everything from logos and business cards to websites and web apps (Node + Mongo). If you have an idea and a plan of attack, I can build it out for you.<p>I&#x27;m proud to be the designer of the branding for io.js, which has since become the new Node.js — <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;behance.net&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;23269525&#x2F;IOJS-logo-concept" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;behance.net&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;23269525&#x2F;IOJS-logo-concept</a>. I also did the social marketing banners for their Twitter: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;official_iojs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;official_iojs</a>.<p>Previously, I was a front-end engineer at Infinera working on web-based telecom solutions, mainly focused on bringing their Java-based DNA NMS to the web using Angular and D3.js. The highlight of my work there was building a D3.js-based semantic zoom-pan interface that allowed customers to start at the node level and drill down into the servers at each node, then into the racks inside the server, continue still further down to the chips and lasers inside the racks. This works similar to how you can zoom-pan from the world map all the way down to the street level in Google Maps. This allowed navigating the interface with zero clicks so NOC engineers can see an alarm and simply scroll to dig deep down into a node and identify the faulty piece of equipment. Besides this, I also designed and implemented a standard style guide&#x2F;design language for all their internal apps along with a unified icon theme.<p>Over the years I have been lucky to have found quite a few clients from these threads and it has always been exciting to work with HNers. My one and only regret so far was when I <i>almost</i> landed the logo design for jsDelivr CDN; even though they paid me for the job, I found out later they later decided to go with a different design that has an angular.js&#x2F;HTML5 bent to it. I use their service quite a bit and I would&#x27;ve loved to see my work on their website. That would have been a big break for me and I&#x27;m sad to have missed out on it.<p>Hope to redeem myself soon with my next project. Looking forward to meeting some new faces this time around, cheers : )')
