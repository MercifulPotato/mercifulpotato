So e.g. smaller ARM CPUs donâ€™t use micro-ops at all. But that also means they cannot do things such as OoO.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t agree with this. What do uops have anything to do with ooo execution. I can easily make a CPU with no uops doing ooo execution. Unless I&#x27;m misunderstanding and the article is just saying smaller cores don&#x27;t do ooo since they are trying to stay within a certain area&#x2F;power footprint.')
