This is&#x2F;was possible because they was a strong-ish push a decade ago by GNU aligned projects to force this down the throat of each package because OpenSSL had a problematic license exception deemed incompatible with GPL by some. The heathbleed fiasco helped this push. Then with LibreSSL, diversity survived a bit longer.<p>However, now that OpenSSL work to solve &quot;all the problems&quot; is starting to get into releases distribution actually can use (OpenSSL 1.1.1*) and will eventually be able use after extensive effort (OpenSSL 3), I don&#x27;t think this support for TLS diversity will survive very long. The technical and licensing being solved, only the philosophical&#x2F;political ones remain, which isn&#x27;t enough for the large effort required to support multiple TLS libs.')
