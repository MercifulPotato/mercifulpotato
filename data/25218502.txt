Item(by='Erlich_Bachman', descendants=None, kids=[25218792], score=None, time=1606384699, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25218468, text='&gt; If you believe in theories and falsifiliability<p>I don&#x27;t know why you would phrase it that way. What does &quot;believe in&quot; mean?<p>That they are a tool that can be used for some purposes? Yes sure.<p>That they are the only tool that has any meaning, the only one that matters, or even the one that produces most truth? In that case - no, not even close.<p>I wrote that your original statement is more of an opinion&#x2F;spiritual statement than a falsifiable scientific statement. Then by extension and simple logic, of course the exact opposite of your statement (does care vs does not care) is also obviously an opinion&#x2F;spiritual statement. As such, it of course doesn&#x27;t neither have falsifiable indications. How could it be any other way?<p>It just didn&#x27;t sound like you realize that what you wrote is an opinion, and not some hard-cut proved and obvious statement, so I was wondering whether you realize it? Or do you have an illusion that you have provable grounds for it?')
