I&#x27;m not sure if y&#x27;all will find it useful, but I wanted to publish it to share the love.<p>I wrote k8s-harness so I could create disposable Kubernetes clusters for my tests. This way I could deploy my apps for my local &quot;integration&quot; tests without having to worry about spinning up infrastructure.<p>I&#x27;m somewhat new to Kubernetes and didn&#x27;t know if there are better ways of doing this. If there are, please, do tell!')
