This kind of slowness in everyday usage tends to not bother a lot of people but it really grates on my nerves. I don&#x27;t think anyone needs faster flagship phones every year or two (my current one has already been close to two years) but performance due to higher specs does translate to an overall smoother experience. Also, I think thats kind of the point of the pinephone - those who are happy with 3 year old specs can continue so and those who want to upgrade to, say, a higher-res screen or a better camera can do so without ditching the entire phone.')
