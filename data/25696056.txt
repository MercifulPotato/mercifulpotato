Many of the suits haven&#x27;t technically included Trump personally, or his campaign entity, as a party. However, they seek precisely the same results, and recycle many of claims in suits he has filed in his own name.<p>Example: The Texas motion to the Supreme Court to bring a case against Pennsylvania and other battleground states did not include Trump or his campaign as a plaintiff. Trump did, however, seek permission to join the lawsuit. That was doubly odd, considering the reason the states thought they could go directly to the top court was its &quot;original jurisdiction&quot; for suits between states.<p>Either way, does the defeat of the states&#x27; petition to the Supreme Court count toward the number of suits lost?<p>I believe the source for &quot;more than fifty lawsuits&quot; is Marc Elias, an admittedly left-leaning lawyer who&#x27;s been keeping track. You might prefer to cast off his conclusion based on who he bats for. But you could also search for him and find his list.')
