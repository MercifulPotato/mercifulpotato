We cannot other peoples minds. When we think we&#x27;re don&#x27;t that we&#x27;re reading our own.<p>Since you&#x27;re doing this, I&#x27;m guessing that you have been a cynic before, and you can see it in others very clearly... and now that you&#x27;ve seen the light, you want others in the position you were in before, see the light too? That&#x27;s great. I may be misreading it, because, again, I can only read my own mind. So, you may want to correct me.<p>Anyways, here&#x27;s the thing. I&#x27;m not coming from the cynical position at all. I love how the PR industry works. It is fascinating to me that they are very meticulous and elaborate. I&#x27;m a fan of Edward Bernays, the father of PR. I have physical copies of all his books, even the ones that he didn&#x27;t finish writing and were posthumously published. He didn&#x27;t start it, but he formalized it as a discipline so anyone can use it and now everyone does.<p>I have also worked for a company which has their own PR department. The PR representatives wrote articles (sometimes on the behalf of the CEO or CTO and sometimes handed pre-written information to journalists which they could publish with minor modifications). The articles are published everywhere, from local newspapers to forbes, businessinsider, ft, nyt, cnn... you name it. It&#x27;s fascinating. The information is often times two or three steps removed from the product and reads like any informative news article or some strong opinions from experts or take on other products or reviews of related ones.<p>So, when I see these patterns, it makes sense that is exactly what is happening.<p>Also, obligatory link to Paul Graham article on the subject: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulgraham.com&#x2F;submarine.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulgraham.com&#x2F;submarine.html</a>')
