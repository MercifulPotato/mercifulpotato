Engagements, holiday snaps, birthdays, ect. Basically, I had Fomo.<p>The problem was that I was spending an hour a day scrolling through, mostly ads and low quality news on my feed. I think  my last actual post was over 5 years ago.<p>With Sundayy I know that if anything actually important happens I will find out about it on Sunday. The delayed gratification is refreshing, in a world where everything else is just a click away.<p>The other benefit is I now have an extra 7 hours a week that I didn&#x27;t spend mindlessly scrolling.')
