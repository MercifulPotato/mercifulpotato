As you know, there&#x27;s this invariant interval thing: ds2 = c2 dt2 - dx2 - dy2 - dz2. The trick was to add a small oscillation multiplier to ds2, so it would become ds2 exp(a cos wt) = ... Mixed with lorentz transforms, this yields the static SE and mixed with GR tensors stuff this yields the time dependent SE. I can&#x27;t judge if this trick is physically sound.')
