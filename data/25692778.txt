He has no effective authority at this point, and is essentially just trolling - and to deadly, if indirect, effect. I also agree with Twitter&#x27;s decision to keep his while he still wielded meaningful power as a President, despite repeatedly breaking codes of conduct. When he wielded actual power as President, letting the public see his words has value regardless of what those words contained. But now that he&#x27;s on his way out, they have no more redeeming value.<p>Critics of this decision often point out that this let Trump magnify his voice and spread harmful messages. I disagree. Trump would have tweeted through some other mechanism. We&#x27;ve already seen analogous applications pop up when social media bans big players - see thedonald.win as an example. Doing this would not accomplish anything in terms of limiting the reach of Trump&#x27;s messages, and would only serve to further reinforce many conservatives&#x27; perceptions of bias in social media.')
