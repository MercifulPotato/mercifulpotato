I don&#x27;t trust any VPN provider&#x27;s claims. Plus I wanted more control including ability to turn on&#x2F;off logs if needed. As an experiment I started with an AWS lightsail instance. It worked so well that I now I don&#x27;t feel I need anything with more resources (up to about 10 clients). That doesn&#x27;t mean I trust AWS entirely but for now I will live with it. I like using a CLI and AWS&#x27;s browser based CLI is pretty good (but be wary of copy-paste snafus).<p>b. The other reason I went with a cloud provider like AWS is that their static IP seems to be whitelisted fairly well especially with their own service - Amazon Prime. So I have had not problem watching videos while traveling. Also in the past macOS and iOS updates were problematic via VPN. But that seems to have gone away. Maybe because they bypass VPN? I don&#x27;t know for sure.<p>c. Many of my friends have been asking for help. I figured if I went with one of the big 3 cloud providers it would be easy for me to basically create an instance image preloaded with all the scripts and WG etc. that they can then run from their own accounts.<p>d. The big 3 cloud providers uptimes are far better than many of the VPN providers.')
