Don&#x27;t have an account with them and likely never will. Aside from some fairly obvious things (states generally shouldn&#x27;t advertise their lotteries for example), people should be able to do whatever they want with their money. And it&#x27;s probably pretty fruitless to try to stop them from doing so in general.')
