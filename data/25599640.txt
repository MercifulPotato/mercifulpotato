Item(by='paulmd', descendants=None, kids=[25599787], score=None, time=1609463817, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25597931, text='Yes, and the &quot;total compensation&quot; is no longer good either.  &quot;The pay sucks but you get great benefits&quot; meme is no longer true of most state&#x2F;federal government jobs, those benefits have been drastically shaved down over the last 30 years.<p>The other major recruiting problem is marijuana prohibition.  Government has a lot of problems retaining high-skill IT people because a huge number of computer-touchers smoke.  iirc FBI has commented on their inability to hire good technical staff because they can&#x27;t find anyone who doesn&#x27;t smoke.<p>And it&#x27;s not just a question of willingness to smoke or not going forward, for most public-trust positions you&#x27;re going to have to abstain for at least a year before even applying.<p>What are you willing to give up for a job offer that you might not even get?  For computer-touchers with lots of other options, that answer is &quot;not much&quot;.  And federal jobs are basically low-paying, highly-competitive, and high-bureaucracy, when you could be making bank and having a reasonably satisfying work experience in the private sector.<p>And thus you filter out a huge number of the exact people you&#x27;re trying to hire - young techies who are familiar with modern IT and development practices.')
