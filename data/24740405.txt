The H1-B jobs won&#x27;t be replaced with American workers. They will be replaced with remote workers that earn even less.<p>2. This wage deflation will eventually percolate to us &quot;low skilled&quot; engineers. (Low-skilled ~meaning a RoR pipe fitter).<p>3. The remote work cat is out of the bag, so we&#x27;ll finally see some traction in efforts to unionize software developers at Big Co. The unions will obviously restrict hiring foreign workers.<p>4. The effects of unionizing at BigCo on the startup ecosystem are REALLY hard to predict. It&#x27;s a fun thought experiment.<p>Overall, this will be a net loss for humanity as a whole, but could maybe be short-term good for SV&#x2F;american tech workers.')
