However, to get it into Safari, I need to create a (useless, and empty) Mac app with a specific configuration in Xcode that&#x27;ll allow it to appear in the &quot;extensions&quot; list in Safari. Then I need to deal with all the signing &amp; App Store distribution stuff if I actually want to distribute it.<p>Probably less annoying, but there&#x27;s still a time and effort cost to publishing on both Chrome and Firefox as well. They don&#x27;t have the same policies, the APIs have differences, they have their own bugs, and the submission&#x2F;review process is different for each. It&#x27;s a real drag, compared to pushing updates to a website.<p>Also, with the Chrome store right now, once you push an update for review, there&#x27;s no way to replace it with a newer update until the (up to 3 weeks) review process finishes so say goodbye to pushing quick fixes, automated deploys and fast iterations. It&#x27;s ridiculous.')
