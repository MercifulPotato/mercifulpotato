Made a lot of money selling them, though :D<p>And replacing the pump&#x2F;heater assembly on a Bosch&#x2F;Siemens is harder than on Indesit&#x2F;Beko&#x2F;Whirlpool. Have to fiddle with a screwdriver and a flashlight from the side.<p>On that note, the drainage needs cleaning often (or the sensor whines about it), and I liked the water flow sensor (which they use instead of a pressure switch) on Bosch&#x2F;Siemens.')
