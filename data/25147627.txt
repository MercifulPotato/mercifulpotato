This works well with the empirical fact that a 20% readout might in fact last longer than a 50% readout.<p>What I don&#x27;t understand is that most other people seem to treat the percentages as meaningful. They certainly aren&#x27;t based on &quot;time until a recharge is needed&quot;, which is what people want. What are we notionally seeing percentages of?')
