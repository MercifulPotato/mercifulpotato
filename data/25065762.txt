It&#x27;s essentially the same as Zen 3. On the other hand, it&#x27;s using 5nm rather than 7nm to get there, so 5nm Ryzen is likely to pull ahead in the not too distant future.<p>The more interesting thing is the power efficiency, which doesn&#x27;t have that much impact on single thread performance because higher power CPUs don&#x27;t actually use their entire power budget for a single thread. But that&#x27;s an impressive multi-threaded score for that TDP. It gets stomped by actual desktop CPUs for the obvious reason, but it has better multi-threaded performance than anything with the same TDP. Though that&#x27;s also partially because the low-TDP Zen 3 CPUs aren&#x27;t out yet.<p>What I&#x27;d really like to see is some benchmarks that aren&#x27;t geekbench.')
