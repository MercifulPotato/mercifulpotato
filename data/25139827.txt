Plenty of airlines kept ordering the DC-10 after its grounding was lifted.  If the aircraft is certificated it&#x27;s good to buy, in business terms.<p>Buying Boeing right now is an <i>excellent</i> idea for most airlines since discounts will be deep in order to get the order book filled.<p>I&#x27;ll bet Ryanair will announce a big top-up order soon.')
