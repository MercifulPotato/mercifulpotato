Pursuing 2nm lithography (which is something like 1-2 nodes from bleeding edge?) with 135 billion euro surely tells you something about their commitment.<p>I would also point out that many of these companies you mention are immensely scattered. Take anyone and you&#x27;ll find their resources spread across an evergrowing domain&#x2F;portfolio. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s bad that Apple is developing cars and Facebook VR headsets - I&#x27;m just saying it spreads them thinner. If the EU found it valuable enough to pursue e.g search within the next five years it&#x27;s not at all unfeasible or unreasonable to do so. It might even be better for the greater good of the internet frankly.')
