The system they used automatically applied a one month&#x27;s rent &quot;move in fee&quot; when they created our account, despite the fact that I&#x27;d lived there for three years. I told them to remove it, but it took them so long to do it that the system had automatically applied a late fee. Then the late fee started automatically compounding on some kind of schedule, so the management company was always like $25 behind trying to fix it. This went on for months. A total farce.<p>The gross thing is that I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re now selling a profile on me, which I cannot access, that makes it look like I&#x27;m a super delinquent renter with months of unpaid late fees.')
