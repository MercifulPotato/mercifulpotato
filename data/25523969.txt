Talking to them one and a time and all wearing a red pin seems like a HUGE task.<p>Also, only a tiny minority of employees are skilled. They&#x27;re well paid and looked after. They have large stock options (I think the only pay over 100k at amazon is given in the form of stock). I highly doubt they&#x27;ll strike for the rest. They&#x27;ve never met them. They don&#x27;t have anything in common with them. They much closer to management.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they have every right to try. I just don&#x27;t think anything even a tenth this size has been accomplished in the history of labour relations...')
