Except that when you refresh the token, it no longer returns and http-only cookie (it returns the access token in the response body) due to an issue with how the two aforementioned libs interoperate. So the dev has to patch that in manually with their own code, otherwise the full token cycle is not http-only. Isn&#x27;t that weird?<p>Other issues include wiring some routes (urls, as Django calls them) so that they properly triggered password reset emails.<p>I want to insist that none of this has been the end of the world, and extend my eternal gratitude to the authors of the libs, but I guess I was shocked to encounter this in a framework as mature as Django (I&#x27;ve moved to it in search of stability compared to the Node.js ecosystem, which I feel is the wild west in some respects and not as suitable for the types of web apps I develop)<p>The other (more time-consuming) issues have been with implementing the front-end bits like I mentioned. An axios interceptor for refresh tokens, state management with Redux, the views (ugh, I love writing React but I <i>really</i> don&#x27;t want to create another login form).<p>I&#x27;ll definitely take a look at your React code tomorrow, and I may be able to provide some additional feedback (and maybe steal some ideas too)<p>Also, I want to commend your effort in marketing &#x2F; comms - I&#x27;ve seen you both on Reddit and here, and this second impression on HN is what has prompted me to comment. Tbh first time I saw you on Reddit I thought this was more of a toy project but here on HN it&#x27;s definitely clicked that you guys are serious.<p>I&#x27;ve starred you on Github, I&#x27;m watching for new releases, and I&#x27;ll mention you to my friends, but I think you should definitely keep up your active communication efforts - it&#x27;s worked for me at least.<p>Again, best of luck, and greetings from Spain!')
