The launchers just show as little hatches in the deck. There&#x27;s usually a modest gun turret, the only visible weapon. There are some Close In Weapons System units, but they just look like machine guns.<p>The USSR built ships with much more visible armament on deck, facing outward. Partly because it looked fierce, and partly because they didn&#x27;t quite trust their missiles not to launch straight up and come back down on the ship.')
