Item(by='guitarbill', descendants=None, kids=[25564864], score=None, time=1609197409, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25563738, text='&gt; groff gets no love even though it can deliver nice output. The syntax is even more arcane<p>I think you&#x27;ve answered it yourself. Also damning is that groff doesn&#x27;t support UTF-8 directly.<p>Most groff guides only do very basic formatting. Complex math&#x2F;equation layout can be awful. Image files apparently need to be ps&#x2F;eps. I just keep running into issues.<p>There&#x27;s also no accessible ecosystem for groff. CTAN. Code highlighting (ideally, I want to use pygments - i guess i could write a backend if i was really invested). TikZ is great and something I&#x27;ve invested in a lot. Bibliography management. Also, not an issue for me, but an issue for adoption is Windows support.<p>As for competing with Word&#x27;s workflow, at least with some TeX variant I have a chance. Installer frameworks. Editors with previews. So a few GiB to not run into these limitations sounds worth it to me to be productive.<p>I&#x27;m not saying groff couldn&#x27;t be used for complex stuff, but I wouldn&#x27;t know where to begin, or want to work around all those limitations.')
