Their work is valuable but theyâ€™re entirely replaceable.<p>I think this is a very elitist mindset that unfortunately many people have.<p>To me engineering is primarily a learning process on how to build better tools. And you can probably always build a more suitable tool on top of existing tool.<p>So saying, this is &quot;boring work&quot;, that requires &quot;just minions&quot; is akin to saying that the existing tools cannot be improved, or people who use these tools cannot figure out a way to improve them themselves, they need to be told by somebody.')
