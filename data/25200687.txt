Item(by='dkersten', descendants=None, kids=[25204155], score=None, time=1606239031, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25200395, text='Printer ink then ;-)<p>On a more serious note, Rhodium fits the bill: super expensive, hard, durable, silvery and corrosion resistant.<p>Using the 7,700 lbs estimate elsewhere here, and a price of Rhodium I randomly found on the internet of $16,100 per troy oz, the material of this structure, if made from Rhodium, would cost about $1,749,005. Which is actually not bad, for a very rich person. I guess they&#x27;d have to build an even larger one. Or make it hollow and fill it with printer ink.')
