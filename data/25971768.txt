I&#x27;ve seen numbers showing that Gen X is getting tired of jumping through hoops to watch TV, so they&#x27;re going back to cable, or going * gasp * OTA.<p>The numbers also show that Gen Z seems to embrace &quot;owned&quot; physical media a lot more than Millennials, and that they&#x27;re also more likely to go full OTA just because they see little value in paying for multiple streams or a cable subscription.<p>It seems that Millennials love streams and subscriptions, and everyone else is rethinking whether that&#x27;s a good idea.')
