Paired with some of the other models they provide out of the box, it can be very easy to get up and going quickly. I used it to create a mustache detector and before running an image through my model I needed to detect if an image had a face (images of hot dogs, for eg, were leading to weird results).  I was delighted to find the ability to detect faces in a few lines of code right out of the box.<p>Now I just wish I could convert my model to Tensorflow! (or serve it over iCloud somehow?)')
