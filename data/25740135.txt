Yellow journalism had a huge impact in the US in the past, Rwanda&#x27;s problems were inflamed via Radio and now social media is hurting the US and the world.<p>Social media  is the genie that&#x27;s been let out of its cage. It&#x27;s not going to go back in. I suspect the fix is to treat social media in the same way radio and TV are managed.  They can&#x27;t and should not be completely stopped but they can be managed by federal law.<p>People will complain that it&#x27;s against freedom of speech but free speech does not mean reckless speech. Words have consequences and social media lets every one have a virtual loud speaker that amplifies ideas that are said without much thought behind them. You can&#x27;t even know whether the person is serious of just trying to be funny. It&#x27;s a problem.')
