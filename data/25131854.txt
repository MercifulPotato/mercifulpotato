If you have an actual BSL-3 lab, specializing particularly in SARS-like coronaviruses  in the city of origin of the pandemic (there is such a lab, three labs actually), if the country has a bad track of lab leaks (it does, SARS leaked twice from Chinese labs), history of cover-ups of such leaks (again, SARS leak of 2004), generally bad track with information suppression - it makes the hypothesis actually worth verifying. And that would be domain of criminal justice and forensics, not only of life science.')
