Getting 50k, is easy whether you have 5 years experience or 20 years.  Getting 60-70k isn&#x27;t impossible if you haggle and have a good niche, but gaining more as a sysadmin&#x2F;developer is hard short of going down the self-employed&#x2F;contractor route which is a headache of its own.<p>Of course you don&#x27;t need that much money to have excellent quality of life; paying â‚¬100&#x2F;month for full-time daycare, having 5ish weeks of paid leave, good transport, good libraries, good social services, and similar means that if I had more money I wouldn&#x27;t know what to do with it!')
