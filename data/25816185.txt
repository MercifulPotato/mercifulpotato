Some items are faulty, but are still hoarded for parts to help repair other items.<p>Overall this behaviour is probably very good for the planet - many items end up seeing far more use than they would otherwise.<p>It&#x27;s questionable if its good economic use of these people&#x27;s time though.  Is it worth them spending all day collecting and repairing a $150 TV, when they could have gone to work in a factory that can turn out a new TV every 30 seconds for far fewer dollars?')
