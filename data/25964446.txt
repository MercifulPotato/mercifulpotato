Mesopotamia <i>invented</i> usury, among other long standing contributions, including the Zodiac, and various mod 60 constructs. And that <i>amazing</i> civilization totally collapsed.<p>Btw, Debt cancellation (&quot;jubiliee&quot;) is the cause celebre of the economist I cited in my OP. If you are interested in the topic, Michael Hudson is your man.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;michael-hudson.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;and-forgive-them-their-debts&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;michael-hudson.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;and-forgive-them-their-de...</a><p>&gt; Practically, the anthropological origins of usury prohibitions have very little to do with non-usury markets. Even those groups which you listed practice usury - they simply put those who practice it into secondary (or lower) social groups.<p>This is a fair point and one never underestimates the hypocrisy of mankind. That said, the point remains that it is interesting that something in the collective memory of the region zeroed in on usury as a &quot;sin&quot;.<p>&gt; The reference to communism attempts isn&#x27;t a non-sequitor since depending on the particulars of their brand of communism they either want to limit usury to only a national&#x2F;popular entity or get rid of it entirely.<p>As CCP has demonstrated, Communism is apparently an extremely plastic concept. &#x2F;g My objection to your OP was and remains this: removing usury from the political-economy regime does not mean &quot;communism&quot;.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s worth noting the only surviving self-labeled communist country with a functioning economy is China, who allows usury!<p>I don&#x27;t know about you my fellow human, but I place very little value in the pronouncement of highly placed individuals, protected by their police states, regarding their ideals and aspirations.')
