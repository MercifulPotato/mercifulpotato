We also don&#x27;t know whether non-Apple service centers will be able to service them later, which might even be a more important question. (Once your device is out of warranty and AppleCare coverage, Apple&#x27;s repairs are going to be pretty pricey even if they&#x27;re still available.) But I don&#x27;t think saying &quot;well, they only support phones and computers for a few years after they stop making them&quot; is <i>necessarily</i> a guidepost here.<p>&gt; Also, why not make it so they can be used passively? What&#x27;s the downside?<p>My quasi-educated guess is part marketing, and part technology. The marketing part: Apple considers these AirPods Pros that cover your ears, and insist that they have all the AirPods Pro features. The technology part: from what I can tell, these headphones are DSP-ed up the wazoo, more like HomePods than AirPods, so there&#x27;s a good chance that passive mode will sound like crap.<p>I know a practical counter-argument is &quot;so what, there are other active noise-cancelling headphones that let you switch them to passive mood and <i>they</i> sound like crap when you do that and everybody&#x27;s just okay with it,&quot; but, that is not Apple.<p>(For the record, the AirPods Max are not on my shopping list.)')
