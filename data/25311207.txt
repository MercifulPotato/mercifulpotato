I haven&#x27;t prescribed what would happen to the money, simply that the rich need to take a haircut to make things more even. If you also pursue a more robust, less concentrated economy more generally, you could certainly invest the money in entrepreneurship, small farms, improved IT infrastructure, etc., etc. That would do more good for the economy than letting Jeff launch it into space. Again, we&#x27;ve done this kind of thing before, and the billionaires and their defenders ho-hummed the same tune, and all that happened was the emergence of the middle class and fairly broad economic prosperity. We&#x27;ve also see what happens when we let the concentration of wealth continue.<p>&gt; That seems more like a personal vendetta than an economic policy.<p>Won&#x27;t somebody please think of the poor billionaire! I&#x27;m using him as an example, because he&#x27;s first on the list, but feel free to substitute whatever name or array of names you want if it makes it more palatable for you. FWIW, there is historical precedent for passing a tax law targeting the single richest person in the country (John D. Rockerfeller at the time).')
