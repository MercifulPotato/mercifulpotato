Are you saying it&#x27;s bad that Tesla batteries are being reused instead of recycled?   Or are you claiming that Tesla is taking credit for the reuse and that&#x27;s bad?<p>Musk has stated publicly that they will recycle Tesla batteries once they become available in enough volume to make it viable.   He&#x27;d be stupid not to -- they will be a cheaper source of nickel and cobalt than digging it out of the ground.<p>But reuse is better than recycling, so recycling should remain in the future as long as possible.')
