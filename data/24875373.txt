Just as we need to buy computers right now for our computation needs, even if it would be cheaper to wait until 2050 to compute things, that doesn&#x27;t help us with decisions now.<p>The lifecycle of wind and solar is typically planned to be around 25 years. Most installs are lasting longer than expected. With wind, some farms are reporting with bigger turbines even before lifetimes are over as it is the economically advantageous choice for getting more energy out of a prime location for wind. This isn&#x27;t common with solar because new panels are cheaper, but so now generate much more power from the same land usage unlike wind.<p>Renewables are a proven option, solar has truly become a &quot;magic bullet,&quot; in that it is the cheapest energy source in history. But it will only be one tool among many that we will use.<p>I would like for nuclear to be a tool, but the current generation of tech is not constructable, and the lead times are too long for it to have an impact in the foreseeable future.')
