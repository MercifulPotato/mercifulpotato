It seems to cater only to folk who have doubled down so many times on never learning ALT+TAB that they&#x27;ve committed to probably never getting laid for 7 lifetimes.. one for each of those insane matroska doll screens, which I can only assume are about 100dpi each.<p>Also, one bump and it would obviously explode. Zero need for it in any application, and I don&#x27;t want to meet anyone it remotely appeals to. Sorry.<p>As for the dual screen case, there are much cheaper and far more practical options available that plug in via USB, if it really were the case you need those extra displays on the move. The primary need for this I imagine would be demo units. Certainly not trading from your local Starbucks, where you would rightly deserve every glare and smirk received for presenting this horror.')
