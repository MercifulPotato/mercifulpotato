Word&#x27;s &quot;Track Changes&quot;&#x2F;&quot;Accept Changes&quot; tools and the workflows they enable are by far the most common in a number of industries, but especially in edit workflows of most major publishers. That&#x27;s why the Word format specifically is often requested&#x2F;required, because people know and understand those tools and already have processes&#x2F;workflows built around them.<p>The closest equivalent tools for plain text are source control systems and text diff&#x2F;patch. Those tools <i>are</i> great (and arguably fit some definitions of &quot;superior&quot;, especially in capturing history earlier in the process and keeping history longer after the process). They are also nowhere as ubiquitously installed as Word, and nowhere near as easily taught (or already known&#x2F;understood) as Word in today&#x27;s world.<p>Those &quot;edit cycle&quot; needs maybe aren&#x27;t a huge reason to do the initial writing in Word, but they are certainly many steps above &quot;no value&quot;, and thus the noted restriction that no matter what tool you use for the initial writing, if it doesn&#x27;t have an <i>easy</i> Word export to get it started down the edit cycle path then it doesn&#x27;t have an easy fit in today&#x27;s publishing world.')
