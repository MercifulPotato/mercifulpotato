The code is 100% safe Rust and is dependency-free. Excluding shared code (just the brainfuck parser) each compiler is standalone and is between just 100-180 lines of Rust. To share my learning experiences I wrote an accompanying article called Learn Assembly by Writing Entirely Too Many Brainfuck Compilers in Rust which goes into detail of how I arrived at all my implementations: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pretzelhammer&#x2F;rust-blog&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;posts&#x2F;too-many-brainfuck-compilers.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pretzelhammer&#x2F;rust-blog&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;posts...</a><p>Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback.
