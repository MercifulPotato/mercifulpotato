In January 2009 he published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology an editorial (&quot;Equasy – An overlooked addiction with implications for the current debate on drug harms&quot;) in which the risks associated with horse riding (1 serious adverse event every ~350 exposures) were compared to those of taking ecstasy (1 serious adverse event every ~10,000 exposures).<p>&gt; In 2012, he explained to the UK Home Affairs Committee that he chose riding as the &quot;pseudo-drug&quot; in his comparison after being consulted by a patient with irreversible brain damage caused by a fall from a horse. He discovered that riding was &quot;considerably more dangerous than [he] had thought ... popular but dangerous&quot; and &quot;something ... that young people do&quot;.<p>Brain injuries in American football over the past decade probably show that to be an even more dangerous sport, but I haven’t run the numbers.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;David_Nutt#%22Equasy%22" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;David_Nutt#%22Equasy%22</a>')
