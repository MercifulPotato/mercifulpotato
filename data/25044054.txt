Generally more abstract or top-down approach. Old school approach was more bottom-up.<p>In my country I have been still learning from old schoobooks while classes below had new schoolbooks - thats why I remember that well.<p>Recently I have been helping 11 year old with classes (remote learning now). And my impression is that this top-down approach is still present but the schoolbook was full of practical life examples (money issues, understanding newspaper articles with pecentages and percent points etc.)')
