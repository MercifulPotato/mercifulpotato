It is great if you serve api but it kills the benefit of having each request isolated as you would have with nginx or apache. So you need to care about memory leaks, db connection pools etc. Also Swoole docs was not great few months ago.<p>Roadrunner is kind of between apache&#x2F;nginx and Swoole. It is a golang server that can execute php in workers. For each worker once php is loaded it will stay in memory and it is super fast. The only downside on this one is that Roadrunner is developed by mostly one guy and not much you can find on the internet. Also Roadrunner features set is IMO very narrowed into what the company behind it needs at the time. IMO there is no clear vision where this project is going.')
