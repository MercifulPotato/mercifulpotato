The aggressive zoning and relatively low tax situation mean that it&#x27;s impossible for people who get job in Silicon Valley to live there, causing crazy spill over to the rest of the SF Bay Area. Theoretically, forcing up taxes would force more efficient uses of land - allow the building of apartment high rises and so generally increase the affordability of housing.<p>But that&#x27;s theoretically. Whether you could actually impose this regime is a different matter. What the &quot;real&quot; value of land isn&#x27;t a clear thing thing imo. A town might that since it&#x27;s zoning prevents building much, it&#x27;s land isn&#x27;t worth much.')
