Because our releasable code is all the business cares about. We have another SIT environment that we sometimes use for feature branches.<p>My annoyance at the moment is that business side will often ask &quot;have we deployed the latest code to UAT?&quot;, to which I quickly open Jenkins, check when the latest job ran, and revert back to them. I have tried just linking the Jenkins URL back to them, as to say, &quot;look it up yourself&quot;. But I suspect business people just don&#x27;t want to touch Jenkins, because it&#x27;s a &quot;technical tool&quot;. So my idea has always to been build a simple chat bot, where they can ask when the latest deployment was, and where they&#x27;ll be able to trigger a new UAT deployment.<p>&gt; However if I worked where you worked and you wanted slack to deploy prod, I&#x27;d probably try to talk you out of it.<p>We have pretty strict deployment processes for prod, where other teams do the deployments, and it&#x27;s not even allowed to automate that.')
