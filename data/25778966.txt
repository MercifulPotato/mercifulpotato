I mean, was their standing orders to delete posts that advocate violence? Or were they just to ban people who criticize Donald Trump? My overall question is was there an actual effort to come into lines with Google&#x2F;Apple&#x2F;AWS TOS? Just because they had moderators doesn&#x27;t mean they were making an effort to remove the sorts of posts that got them banned.')
