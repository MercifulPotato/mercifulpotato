The first year had <i>just 3 subjects</i> out of 17 that had something to do with CS. The rest were wildly off the mark. Like engineering drawing, metal workshop, and what not. The second year was slightly better but just. It was crammed with electronics; and only from the 4th semester did things took a definitive turn towards CS topics. I&#x27;m sure the curriculum designers had a certain plan in mind but this was devised something like ~60 years ago, when engineering meant mostly civil engineering.<p>This was all 20 years ago, and I recently checked the syllabus out of curiosity, and no it&#x27;s not changed one bit. One precious year of learning period down the drain.')
