It&#x27;s great to see initial skepticism from YC about how this wasn&#x27;t working.  I feel like you see IPO write-ups like these and it&#x27;s always implied that everyone around them always knew they were going to make it.<p>That said, I searched the entire article for the words &quot;luck&quot; and &quot;lucky&quot; and see none.  No doubt the pandemic and WFH life helped them, and that&#x27;s something even YC couldn&#x27;t have predicted.')
