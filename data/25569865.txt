It took 10 minutes from start to finish. Across the two parts of the question, I spent approximately 2 minutes building the scripts, 1 minute determining an algorithm, and 7 minutes reading the prompt. I suspect similar breakdowns for the 7:11 you quote.<p>If Dan excludes the prompt reading and solution determination because he&#x27;s seen this sort of problem before, 1 minute using tools he&#x27;s comfortable with doesn&#x27;t seem unreasonable. Considering all it is is a list of hosts, a loop, a try&#x2F;except block, and a scp command, using much more than a couple of minutes writing would be surprising to me.')
