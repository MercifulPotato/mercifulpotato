(and no a VM is not a replacement)<p>Zero media report it but there is a BIG performance issue with the M1:<p>Compilers and JIT have had decades of optimization both for ARM and x86. \nBut actually no, code that targeted ARM historically only really was either C, C++, swift, js and Java.<p>All other mainstream languages such as C#, python, php, ruby, fortran, Perl, R, etc do have (I hope) ARM support but there have been almost zero human resources dedicated to optimizing the ARM codegen, and it will take years for a catch up. Where are such benchmarcks ??\nThis is a huge fundamental unaddressed topic! \nI even expect such languages to run faster on Rosetta than on ARM native, ironically!')
