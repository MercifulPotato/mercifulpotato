It was late last night and I forgot to not turn it on for everyone. Then I thought it would be fun to see what sort of discussion I&#x27;d wake up to.<p>Not sure whether to keep it. Advantage: it&#x27;s a concise way of displaying some surprisingly useful informationâ€”useful to mods, at least, but I think maybe also to readers.<p>Disadvantage: it&#x27;s obscure. The inconsistency will drive some people nuts. We&#x27;ll have &quot;Ask HN: Why do some timestamps on HN have a full stop at the end?&quot; threads for the rest of our lives. (No one reads the FAQ. The FAQ, you say? Why yes, at the bottom of every HN page: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsfaq.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsfaq.html</a>...)<p>It also leaks when a user posted something later and deleted it. We could fix that, but as so often in software, it would make the thing way more complicated. So I&#x27;ll probably just drop it.')
