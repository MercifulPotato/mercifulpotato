It allows me to compare candidates directly without introducing the additional variable of wondering whether one had a harder question, it allows me to gain &amp; retain experience at asking the question in how it is presented, and if the candidate does well, how we proceed to make it more difficult to suss out the candidate&#x27;s skill.<p>I do agree with the parent above though that this use of xor is trivia, and not a great interview question.')
