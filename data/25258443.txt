Item(by='timr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606767633, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25256761, text='<i>&quot;It looks like DeepMind invented a completely new method for this round that&#x27;s not just an extension of their previous work, showing how much you can gain if you don&#x27;t shoebox yourself into just trying to improve existing methods. That all the scientists were highly skeptical about the scope of ML (and these are computer scientists to begin with mind you) just shows how little they knew of what they did know of what a computer or a program can possibly do, which is a bit appalling to be honest.&quot;</i><p>My PhD (now over a decade ago...yikes) was in applying much simpler ML methods to these kinds of problems (I started in protein folding, finished in protein &#x2F; nucleic acid recognition, but my real interest was always protein design). Even back then, it was clear that ML methods had a lot more potential for structural biology (pun unintended) than for which they were being given credit. But it was hard to get interest from a research community that cared little about non-physical solutions. No matter how well you did, people would dismiss it as a &quot;black box solution&quot;, and that pretty much limited your impact.<p>Some of this is understandable: even today, it&#x27;s not at all clear that a custom-built ML model for protein folding is of much use to anyone -- particularly a model that doesn&#x27;t consider all of the atoms in the protein. The traditional justification for research in this area is that if you could develop a <i>sufficiently general</i> model of protein physics, it would also allow you to do all sorts of <i>other</i> stuff that is much more interesting: rational protein design, drug binding, etc.<p>The alphafold model is not really useful for any of this, so in a way, it&#x27;s kind of like the weinermobile of science: cool and impressive when done well (&quot;hey! a giant hot dog on wheels!&quot;), but not really useful outside of the niche for which it was designed. So it&#x27;s hard to blame researchers in this field -- who generally have to chase funding and justify their existence -- from pursuing the application of deep learning to this one, narrow problem domain.<p>Obviously there will now be a wave of follow-on research, and it&#x27;s impossible to know what methods this will spawn. Maybe this will revolutionize computational structural biology, maybe not. But I think it&#x27;s a <i>little</i> unfair to demonize the entire field. Protein folding just traditionally hasn&#x27;t been a very useful or interesting area, and like all &quot;pure science&quot;, it leads to a lot of small-stakes, tribal thinking amongst the few players who can afford to compete. This is right out of Thomas Kuhn: a newcomer sweeps into a field, glances at the work of the past, then bashes it over the head, dismissively.')
