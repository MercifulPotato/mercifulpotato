They need input from their patients - if you told your doctor that you have been actually dieting and actually exercising but aren&#x27;t losing weight and wonder if there is some other cause? And if he won&#x27;t look into it get another doctor. It&#x27;s not that hard.<p>&gt; Again this is what I mean about being dismissive about other health issues when someone is obese.<p>Doctors see the excuses all the time - in most cases it&#x27;s diet and exercise. You can be mad all you want that someone called you fat and a doctor misdiagnosed you but at the end of the day it&#x27;s your body and your life, he won&#x27;t be the one dying from complications due to obesity or your other health problems.')
