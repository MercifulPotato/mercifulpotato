Way too expensive for me :(<p>I applaud the developers efforts, but I personally would have preferred an open-source design, using through-hole components, that anyone could build.  The time-line of Amiga add-ons over the past 35 years is littered with the corpses of closed hardware that you can no longer buy, or are now so rare that their value pushes them out of most peoples reach.')
