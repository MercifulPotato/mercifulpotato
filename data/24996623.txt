Iron is kind of heavy. If you are doing the electrolysis on site that&#x27;s probably not a big factor. But if we&#x27;re talking about converting coal plants (which the article does), presumably the electrolysis would happen elsewhere; which means tons of iron needs to be moved back and forth.<p>Moving fuel around is also a problem with coal and oil. We&#x27;re basically burning fossil fuels to move fossil fuels around. In the case of oil, we than also have to run it through energy intensive processes to turn it into more palatable fuels than bunker oil, which is what is typically used for shipping things around.<p>A typical oil tanker consumes a couple of hundreds of tons of bunker fuel per day to move a couple of  thousands of tons of fuel around. So, that&#x27;s a sizable percentage of its load that is lost just to get the raw product from A to B. I&#x27;m sure the math is similar for producing and moving coal around.<p>It only makes sense if you get to pollute at will without financial consequences; which happens to be the case with shipping, which mostly takes place in international waters without any constraints or regulations on the amount of crap put in our atmosphere.<p>Ships actually switch to cleaner fuels when they get close to populated areas because otherwise they&#x27;d end up killing some of the locals with their fumes. Bunker fuel is nasty. Even more so than coal.<p>So, if we are debating efficiencies, we&#x27;d do well to apply the same scrutiny to existing solutions as well. The efficiency of coal should also include digging it up using diesel burning heavy duty equipment, moving it around, etc. I&#x27;d bet that knocks some percentage points of even the most efficient plants or ICE cars.')
