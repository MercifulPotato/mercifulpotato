Decentralization is coming and having neighbors connecting each other via underground Ethernet cables or Ubiquity bridge is becoming more and more common than you think. It might only be &quot;a few university students&quot;, but that&#x27;s also how the Web started.<p>* More and more applications will require real time processing. Examples: driving cars, drones, video games (lol@stadia), AR, VR and the fusion of scientific fields and tech from biology to military.<p>* There is an inherent collective  and potentially civilization ending risk in having only a few corporations having the means of producing tech, especially with a more and more uncertain world. Initiative like Open Risk initiative is a sign of that. It will not be surprising seeing open fabs project popping up like it did for the 3D printing, especially with patents from the 2000s expiring. Remember, a 2005 machine is more than enough for email and Facebook.<p>* There are whole industries with unmanageable technical debt which failed to exploit the processing power of modern electronics.<p>* There are whole industries who need to get rid of their Java &#x2F; Oracle stack.<p>* The performance gap only keeps on enlarging. A 2005 PC would struggle to run the Office suite, which is just a text editor with macros and UI.<p>* New solutions always provide new unintended problems to solve, that&#x27;s just a fact.')
