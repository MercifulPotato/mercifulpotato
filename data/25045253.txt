No doubt as a consequence of relentless lobbying (corruption?), to the point it has become pretty much a total farce.<p>One does not have to look far to find more examples of companies getting away with what should be punished as anti-trust behavior. HP is hardly an exception and don&#x27;t expect anything to change. If anything, it might just get worse. By now, pretty much the whole system is designed to resist any  change that isn&#x27;t in favor of those who &quot;invest&quot; (lobby) into it.<p>Pragmatically speaking, the only mitigation here is to avoid printing as much as possible. It won&#x27;t do much, and certainly won&#x27;t change a thing .. but at least this criminal enterprise will not get a penny of mine.')
