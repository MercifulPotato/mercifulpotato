Item(by='adrian_b', descendants=None, kids=[25757299], score=None, time=1610503947, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25756782, text='When emulating x86 Apple translates the x86 code into ARM code, so it is executed later at almost native speeds.<p>Only for programs that depend heavily on just-in-time compilation for Java, JavaScript etc. Apple must fall-back to interpretation of the x86 instructions, being then much slower.<p>Also the outperforming of AMD&#x2F;Intel has been somewhat exaggerated. Apple M1 is faster in single-thread than any old Intel or AMD, but it is slower than any new Zen 3 CPU and it will be slower than the top models of Intel Tiger Lake H and Intel Rocket Lake. In multi-thread M1 is easily beaten by many processors.<p>On Christmas I have upgraded the CPU in one of my computers with a Ryzen 9 5900X, so I could verify that in the single-thread benchmarks that I could run on my computer, the values matched those published elsewhere for Zen 3 and they also exceeded the highest of the values published for Apple M1, by e.g. from 3% to 4% in Geekbench 5, until 24% in gmpbench.')
