The code is run in a VM, which is run in a browser. So, the code is limited in doing things to the browser, which itself is limited in what it can do to your computer (files and whatnot). So it&#x27;s not at all like running untrusted code &quot;on your machine&quot;.<p>&gt; I say &quot;almost&quot; because Javascript code is virtualized and sandboxed.<p>It&#x27;s virtualized (in the browser) such that all the code will run almost the same on different browsers and chipsets. Again, the browser code is what keeps the computer safe from any code it runs, including CSS code or other VMs it may use, like Java or Flash. Also the OS keeps the computer safe from the browser (or at least it should).<p>So, no it&#x27;s not JavaScript that is the boogeyman here.')
