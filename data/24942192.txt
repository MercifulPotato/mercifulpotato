XPath 2.0 started the downwards trajectory and XPath 3 made it worse.<p>The things XPath 2.0 and later do improve on XPath 1.0 is the &quot;standard library&quot;, most of exslt got standardised in 2.0, and new useful functions got added in later revisions (e.g. contains-token from 3.1 is XPath finally adding the ~= operator from CSS).<p>Here&#x27;s the deal though: it should be possible to add most functions without updating the rest of the engine (indeed the majority were originally developed for 1.0). I think some of the functions are designed to work with and around types, which would not be useful in 1.0.')
