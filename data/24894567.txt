Granted not in single threaded performance (they are all old hat nowadays)<p>But I could run a bunch of containers, VMs if I wanted <i>and</i> run slack and chrome (although I use firefox mostly)<p>New work has given me a fancy macbook. Which is fine, but I miss the extra resolution of the 4k screen (which I suspect is perceived rather than actual. I have very small fonts)<p>I also miss linux as a local dev environment.')
