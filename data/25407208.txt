After robot tries to evade it with further programmed bullshit, say: &quot;GET LOST!&quot;. He will quickly respond &quot;It seems I am having problems here&quot; and connect you to a human.\nWorked perfect for me several times I had to contact their customer support with the identical problem of being locked out due to outdated phone number.<p>PS: I read somewhere that customers who swear on the line will be connected to agents quicker ;-) or generally receive better experience. Sigh. What a world.')
