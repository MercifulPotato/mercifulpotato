As other users in the thread have noted, the frustrations of non-tesla chargers range to every extreme: needing to set up an account, and connect a credit card; stuck waiting for that credit card to authorize; the charger not communicating properly with the vehicle; not having internet connectivity to get the charger to activate--the issues are endless.<p>I have never had an issue with a Tesla supercharger, ever, and that&#x27;s the bar I expect out of third party chargers.<p>All that said, I WHOLLY agree that it would be markedly more beneficial to all if the chargers were standardized, and you could charge (e.g.) non-Tesla vehicles on Tesla chargers. That would be maximally ideal--but I can&#x27;t fault Tesla for things like their plugs being different when they had to forge the way.')
