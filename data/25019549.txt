Democrats will get mad that there are Republicans on the ballot, so the rules will be changed to allow <i>two</i> Democrats on the ballot, a progressive one and a &quot;liberal&quot;&#x2F;moderate one (and no Republican). This allows progressive policies to continue, and the legislature ends up being a supermajority mix of progressive Democrats and liberal Democrats, with some useless Republicans from a few low-population counties.<p>There&#x27;s absolutely no reason the US won&#x27;t follow this same pattern: it works.<p>(You can also see the Democratic Party&#x27;s progressive&#x2F;liberal split today with the DSA. That&#x27;s just the CA dynamic going national.)')
