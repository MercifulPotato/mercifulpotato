For example if you can go on Woot and purchase an iPhone 8 for $399, while Apple didn&#x27;t make money off of that sale, they will certainly make money from app purchases and iCloud subscriptions. And at $399 there&#x27;s bound to be people willing to purchase an iPhone even if it&#x27;s older. With Apple&#x27;s iOS support reaching back several generations, it&#x27;s not always a bad deal.<p>So in a way, even though Apple isn&#x27;t making money directly off the sale of that old iPhone, they&#x27;re still able to feed this lower-end market and make money from apps and services, without directly lowering their prices and maintaining their perceived high-end status.<p>Edit: I gave an iPhone example but it certainly extends to the Mac lineup as well.')
