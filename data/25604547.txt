Naming becomes hard when your state abstraction isn’t clear, which in turn is probably due to how business semantics are modeled. One the most important things in implementing state machines is to draw it up and make sure every state and transition has clear meanings before actually implementing them. There usually will be multiple iterations of modeling before arriving at a good design.')
