The zip trick is awesome; especially letting the browser do the decompression is brilliant. My version has a couple features you might want: automatically opening the browser when launched and shutting down the server when the last tab is closed, and a debug mode where it serves directly from the filesystem to make editing easier. Man, I can think of so many cool features I&#x27;d want to add to this as well:<p>CGI support. Maybe also an option to embed node or deno, or even tcc for directly executing C source as CGI scripts.<p>Embedded writable SQLite DBs. Appending would clearly be tricky but probably doable.<p>PWA support, giving you native notifications, launcher icons, and top-level windows sans browser chrome just like a native GUI app.<p>Option to morph into various app formats (apk, appx, ipa) and instant install on a connected phone or upload to app stores. (Wait, actually all of these formats are based on zip! So maybe this wouldn&#x27;t even need that much morphing? Just some extra cruft in the zip file, some code signing BS, and maybe an embedded copy of adb.)<p>With all these features it might not be tiny anymore but it could make a pretty complete cross platform native app dev environment contained in a single file. Still way smaller than Electron.')
