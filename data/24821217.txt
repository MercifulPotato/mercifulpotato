It&#x27;s annoying at times but if it were not mandatory nobody would never write any test.<p>Stopping developers&#x2F;interns&#x2F;newcomers from adding thousands of lines of random untested code the very first minute they come in (code that would have to be maintained for the next decade by the next people) is a productivity gain for the company.<p>Besides, a good amount of (pet) projects have little or negative value, it&#x27;s better if they don&#x27;t exist in the first place.')
