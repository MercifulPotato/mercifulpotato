No idea about that).  E.g. Angular still has CSS (actually SASS) and HTML in separate dedicated files, and then a another separate file that contains the JavaScript (actually typescript) for the logic itself.<p>I do not see the benefit <i>at all</i> of putting all these things in one single file, apart from trivial tiny simple things (angular allows you to create single-file components for instance) or for making &quot;To-Do with React&quot; type tutorials look easy. Once you get more than 100-200 lines of code + html + CSS then it is time to separate the files.')
