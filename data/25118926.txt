I&#x27;m getting so sick of hearing this, &quot;but muh civil liberties&quot; line from the anti-lockdown crowd. You weren&#x27;t planning on going to any protests. You&#x27;re not pretty enough to consider &quot;showin&#x27; muh face in the grocery store&quot; to be protected speech. This is just childish feet kicking. It&#x27;s ex-post-facto rationalization to come up with some way of complaining about being asked to care about the other people in your community.')
