If we imposed a high enough tax on the original product, then it would be cost effective.  However we still have the trouble that we have to collect it, separate it out from other wastes in the waste stream, and so on.<p>So we could recycle styrofoam.  But we don&#x27;t because it is not cost effective to do so.  So it is viewed as unrecyclable.  And for that reason we have replaced it with things that are even less recyclable.')
