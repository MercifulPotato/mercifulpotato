I think the most common one I do every few months is tracking my diet for a few days to see what bad habits I&#x27;ve picked up and where I need to improve. The first time I did it I realized by protein intake was way too low and that&#x27;s why I wasn&#x27;t seeing improvements in working out. It also enlightens me into how sodium filled so much of the food I&#x27;m eating is and helps me plan around those.<p>Same goes with tracking time spent on &quot;human function&quot; as the author described it. While I intentionally try not to be super anal about how much time I spent on certain activities, I think it&#x27;s almost like a game to make the boring stuff as efficient as possible. As I&#x27;ve added more steps to my daily routines, I&#x27;ve also found ways to keep my time spent reasonable and make certain things asynchronous. Perfect simple example is doing the dishes during idle cooking time. My roommates don&#x27;t do this and it boggles me.<p>Also, making those boring moments more exciting is always a plus. Music or a podcast in the shower and kitchen goes a long way, at least for me.')
