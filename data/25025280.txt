So I wouldn&#x27;t rank him too highly on this area.<p>Let&#x27;s also not forget that he has unilaterally cancelled the USA&#x27;s nuclear disarmament deal with Russia, another extremely anti-peace move, one that will have far-reaching consequences.<p>The only truly decent external policy that he has shown is his handling of the North Korea crisis - that was a true diplomatic success by any measure, which I gladly admit.<p>And of course, we shouldn&#x27;t forget that all of his other horrible decisions pale in the face of his anti-climate moves, which have likely helped push the world over the brink.')
