Item(by='RonanTheGrey', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604827839, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25024277, text='100% yes it is piracy; but to remove the stigma from the word for a moment, I view this issue as an echo of something I&#x27;ve been thinking about recently:<p>Our society - civilization even - has fallen victim to the belief that there are certain kinds of control over human behavior that are possible and desirable, kinds of control that have never succeeded in human history, and attempting to lock music in a tiny little box to which very few people have the key, is one of those things that has never worked. To expect that to work now is.. so blindingly short sighted that I personally find it fantastically hilarious when it fails.<p>I don&#x27;t necessarily think this applies to all professions or all aspects of human behavior but music itself is older than any human civilization and attempting to lock that away is going to be a fight with human nature itself.<p>And yes, I realize that some people believe that attempting to change that is a good thing. I&#x27;m not one of them.')
