So at some schools, it&#x27;s closely tied to the math department while at others it&#x27;s associated with electrical engineering. Which unsurprisingly affects the curriculum in various ways.<p>(And, of course, there&#x27;s also the matter of how applied the curriculum is--i.e. software development vs. underlying theory.)')
