That isn&#x27;t the case.<p>Restaurants see the customer&#x27;s name and photo alongside their rating and review:<p>&gt; The Reviews page shows you all orders where customers left reviews for your location(s). We&#x27;ve included details like the customers&#x27; name and photo (if they have one) as well as whether they are a new customer or, if returning, their total number of orders. You will see their star rating, any tags related to compliments or areas for improvement, and a summary of whether they gave a thumbs up or down to any items in the order. Finally, you will see the order date and ticket size. There is also a &quot;Reply&quot; or &quot;View&quot; button which is covered below in Responding to Reviews.')
