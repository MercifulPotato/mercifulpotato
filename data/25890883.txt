Item(by='skissane', descendants=None, kids=[25892029], score=None, time=1611484031, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25884618, text='&gt; The prospect of using dd for imaging terrifies me to this day, primarily because you still hear horror stories of people trying to write a Linux installer to their flash drive to try out, and accidentally overwriting their main drive instead because they mangled &#x2F;dev&#x2F;sda instead of &#x2F;dev&#x2F;sdb.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t one (at least partial) solution here be, that the kernel should refuse to let you write directly to a block device in use by a mounted filesystem? (Maybe combined with some special ioctl&#x2F;whatever to bypass that restriction if you ever really need to.) Then, if you are running dd from an OS running on your main drive, the kernel will refuse to let dd overwrite the main drive, but will let it overwrite the flash drive (which presumably is not mounted, and anyway shouldn&#x27;t be if you are about to overwrite it)')
