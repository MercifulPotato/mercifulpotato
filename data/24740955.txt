It feels like it needs an extra column or two on the right hand side to have enough space for the symbols and special keys (arrows, home&#x2F;end&#x2F;pgup&#x2F;pgdown, etc). I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of different placements or multi layer layouts to try and make everything comfortable to reach but whatever I try I can&#x27;t quite get it right.<p>I&#x27;m going to try a separate numpad next I think so I can map some things on to that and have it just to the right to gain the extra key space.')
