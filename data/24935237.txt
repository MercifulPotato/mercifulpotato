I guess might be just totally different perspectives of thinking about it. I know whenever I write a troubleshooting question on reddit&#x2F;forums etc, I try to include multiple forms of the same keyword (writing ”hackernews”&#x2F;”hacker news”&#x2F;”HN”) that’s relevant to what I’m talking about, in my post, with the idea that maybe it’ll help more search engines parse it for a greater variety of similarly-related queries. I know whenever I search google I often try multiple successive searches using variations of the same word(s) to try &amp; catch any missed gems in the results.<p>So like, maybe <i>you</i> sound like the type trying to build a brand or something, and would benefit from more eyes on your content in a given time?
