I feel like many people (myself included) who eventually ended up with healthy eating patterns actually started out with something stupid.<p>I really do think some people can mentally handle an &quot;extreme&quot; diet more easily than a moderate adjustment. It&#x27;s just more exciting I guess. And the weirdness of it makes it feel like you&#x27;ve discovered some secret that nobody else knows. In the end, just realizing that you can in fact change your bodyweight is a huge mental win. And as long as you transition into something less stupid after a month or two, I think the net benefit can actually be very positive.<p>...but seriously; of the three macronutrients, carbs are the only one you <i>don&#x27;t</i> need to stay alive. It&#x27;s fine for a while, but I just don&#x27;t get why if you&#x27;re going to cut calories to below 1k per day you wouln&#x27;t instead eat some fats and protein. When you realize that a good part of your weight loss is muscle mass disappearing the whole thing gets a lot less exciting.')
