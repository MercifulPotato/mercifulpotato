I&#x27;m trying to recall what the policy change alert I got a few years ago. Something about you can buy shares with proceeds of unsettled sales, but if you sell the new shares before the previous sale is settled, your account can get flipped into some state where you have reduced trading abilities for a period of time. 30 days?<p>It was implied that &quot;the SEC made us do it&quot;. I think it was meant to put the kibosh on day trading.  You can still day trade, but your returns are cut dramatically by requiring a larger cash position.')
