Really hard. Broadcast.com did audio (barely), RealPlayer tried to do streaming video, etc.<p>The only applications I&#x27;m seeing right now that need more bandwidth are 4k video (but honestly, 1080p isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> bad) and upstream for VC. Looking around, I don&#x27;t see anything where a 5x bandwidth jump would make something suddenly viable.')
