Sitting in one next to a luxury or near-luxury car is night and day difference in both style and comfort. The Model S is better, but it&#x27;s still blown away by other cars at the same price point.<p>I understand that style is subjective, but the majority of people I have talked with about it agree that the interior is a disappointment given the status of the brand.')
