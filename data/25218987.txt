Aspects that are damaging and immoral in that they cause far more harm than they prevent.<p>Even drugs like heroin should be fully legalised. Subject to prescription, maybe. But the harm from a clean, consistent heroin supply is <i>vastly lower</i> than the harm caused by the manufacture and smuggling alone, and decriminalisation of possession does not address that. Decriminalisation also does not address the cost issue which is a major problem with many drugs. A medical grade supply for a typical heroin user costs in the $10-$20 range (we know because e.g. the UK NHS buys heroin for hospital use; if you&#x27;re given diamorphine for post-op pain, that&#x27;s heroin).<p>But the biggest problem with the &quot;drugs are evil&quot; narrative is that it has damages serious discourse about which drugs are lower or higher risk.<p>LSD and psilocybin for example are certainly vastly lower risk than e.g. heroin and cocaine.<p>In fact, there&#x27;s a famous case of a group of patients checking in after having snorted what they <i>thought</i> was cocaine, but which turned out to be LSD. Their blood levels suggest they would have ingested hundreds to thousands of normal recreational doses. They all walked out of there with no lasting harm.<p>In terms of other drugs, some drugs exists largely for time-limited circumvention of drug laws or because they&#x27;re easier to create or smuggle, and would see their demands crash if less dangerous alternatives were legalised.')
