This is a competitor pretending to be neutral (and doing a laughably bad job at it; the &quot;referee&quot; is their evangelist).<p>So they basically make a untrustworthy video that (surprise, surprise) comes to the conclusion that their product is better, provoke Palo Alto into a hamfisted knee-jerk response, and now try to drum up cheap publicity by posing as the victim.<p>I have always regarded Palo Alto&#x27;s products as snake oil, so this is not a fan defending their team.<p>That said: This behavior of Orca is reprehensible and you should not reward them with your attention.')
