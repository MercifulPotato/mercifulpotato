The figure cited in that article includes not just unfunded pension liabilities, but all state and local debt.  We&#x27;re talking about California&#x27;s State finances here, so the figure you&#x27;re citing is absurd on its face.<p>I don&#x27;t want to sugar coat the unfunded pension liabilities, but they are much smaller than you suggest.  The official figure for the unfunded liability for CalPERS is about $140 billion and about $100 billion for CalSTRS.<p>Importantly, this is over a 30 year horizon.  And the more we pay now, the less we pay later.  Newsom&#x27;s 2019 budget included $11 billion in pension liability payments.  Even if you assume CalPERS and CalSTRS investments return worse than the 7% (or 6.1%) that they calculate, that&#x27;s still in the ballpark of what is needed to pay the liability.<p>While this is a big deal, the funding levels in the 2019 budget are sufficient to pay the entire liability.')
