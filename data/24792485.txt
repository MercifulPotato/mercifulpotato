Or repeating and answering questions. Plus the whole lecture format doesn&#x27;t work for everyone. Remote school probably cuts down on these things.<p>Furthermore, for self-directed kids, there&#x27;s always the possibility of simply going mostly asynchronous, watching lectures and reading textbook at their own pace (which might be faster than regular class now that most distractions are removed!).')
