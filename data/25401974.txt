My current specialty is design systems, and I&#x27;m getting to know then pretty well, but I&#x27;m not sure how translate that skillset into charging more than a React developer without a specialty might.</i><p>So, this crossover between design and development is something I have some experience with. My question is whether you just mean UI and similar on-screen design systems (and whether you actually do the design yourself), or if you&#x27;ve extended this to things like signage and wayfinding, packaging, organizational identity, and so on.<p>Second, when you identify as an Individual Contributor, do you mean as part of a team (and if so, what sort of team), or are you more interested in working alone on projects you can complete yourself?<p>A bit of a digression, but I think this may help:<p>Design work tends to go to individuals and teams that specialize in the type of clients they work with, whether that is determined by size, sector, industry, geographic location, or business model, rather than (or in addition to) the type of work that is required. This is because clients typically aren&#x27;t just looking for skill and expertise (which they may not be able to evaluate), but for emapthy with and understanding of their challenges needs and even fears and aspirations.<p>Deep and heavy stuff, huh?<p>Not to worry (much, anyway), a shortcut to this achievement is the specialization in type of clients, mentioned above; by signaling that you have done (or seek to do) work for other clients JUST LIKE THEM, you&#x27;re giving them what they need in terms of reassurance. It is also helpful, though not essential, if you yourself match the client along one or more of the dimensions you&#x27;re targeting, even if they aren&#x27;t necessarily relevant to the work.<p>Of course, this same reassuring information will turn away clients that don&#x27;t match your target profile, so deciding on a particular type of client almost certainly means sacrificing other opportunities (though these days setting up several business facades targeting different types of clients isn&#x27;t too difficult).<p>And so, offering a range of services can be attractive to clients, which makes it rather important to be able to handle project management at least, even if you don&#x27;t want to start an agency or studio and be a manager per-se.<p>Anyway, enough of the squishy handwavy stuff. A specific resource that I found very helpful back when I was billing myself as a web designer&#x2F;developer is the book &quot;The Business Side of Creativity&quot; by Cameron Foote. Many of the pre-SaaS small business mechanics described (such as around accounting) are now outdated, but the sections on how to specialize and seek out the clients that need what you&#x27;re selling are probably what you&#x27;re looking for. They are just as applicable to software consulting as they are to design work.<p>Another is &quot;Selling the Invisible&quot; by Harry Beckwith, which is all about marketing <i>services</i> (which are usually intangible) rather than products.')
