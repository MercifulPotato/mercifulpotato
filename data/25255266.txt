And it actually works quite well for a web app: the user experience was better than the native OSMAnd app, last time I checked.<p>It will obviously know what you search for and click on, but it&#x27;ll only know your location if you explicitly give it out, and without the Services Google won&#x27;t be able to reach its fingers into the rest of your system. So it can be a reasonable compromise.<p>That said: Apple Maps was probably the thing I appreciated the most when I finally relented and just got an iPhone :P')
