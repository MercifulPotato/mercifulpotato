Very expensive.<p>In normal times a lot of the workforce of many large companies is traveling a lot anyway. For 2019 and a few years earlier, I was traveling about a third of the time and I also mostly use my own devices. So supporting employees not in the office using gear that isn&#x27;t supplied and directly secured by the company isn&#x27;t some new concept.')
