Pursuing your strategy would likely harm the fund&#x27;s reputation and their ability to return LP capital in the future.<p>Also - a point of nuance. VCs are not in the habit of writing off everything, that would be a false takeaway from this article. If the amount invested was bigger or the exit was more like 2x or 3x for the VCs, your points of criticism would be more valid.')
