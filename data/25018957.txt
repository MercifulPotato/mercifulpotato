Our incoherent polarization is a result of the traditional authorities having been routed around (and then leaning into their own demise). We&#x27;ve apparently got an awfully long road ahead of us to get to a world where everyone is actually thinking for themselves, as demonstrated by how readily blatant lies spread when they&#x27;re politically and personally comforting.')
