Mr. Den Hollander described himself as an anti-feminist and had made a career out of filing lawsuits, some of them frivolous, alleging discrimination against men. He also published blog posts in 2006 arguing women were inferior to men and advocating physical violence against them. In one post, he said women should be strapped to missiles and dropped in the Middle East.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;25&#x2F;nyregion&#x2F;roy-den-hollander-esther-salas-list.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;25&#x2F;nyregion&#x2F;roy-den-hollande...</a>')
