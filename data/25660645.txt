We treat native applications differently than web browsers because it is useful to assume a default level of trust when we browse the internet.  This applies not only to users, but to institutions, OEMs, system integrators, etc.<p>&gt; You&#x27;re not going to get browsers behind the idea of burning the ground they walk on.<p>Maybe not Google, but Mozilla and Apple seem to consider privacy before they implement new potential holes into their browsers.<p>&gt; Many of the features that end up used for tracking are things people very much like having. Threading, webgl, webrtc, etc.<p>The cat is already out of the bag with these already-implemented features.  My point is that we 1) shouldn&#x27;t make it worse, and 2) should work to replace these with better options.  Users don&#x27;t care whether their chat app uses webrtc or not -- they just want their application to work.  The bad technologies we use don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to be the way they are.  Once upon a time the internet relied on ActiveX controls, Java Applets, and Flash, but we&#x27;ve all since moved past those bad technologies as well.<p>&gt; No doubt some sites will create barrages of opt in notifications - don&#x27;t use these sites.<p>Honestly, this is not a solution.  We shouldn&#x27;t ignore momentum, because when designing global standards, the problem is more than just about <i>you or me</i>, it&#x27;s about the architecture and expectations that are being created.  To use my ActiveX example above -- in some places, for a period of time, it was impossible to do online banking without using IE because every bank used ActiveX controls.')
