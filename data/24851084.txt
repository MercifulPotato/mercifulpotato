Running a bunch of stateful services with potentially large storage requirements in my own infrastructure is not zero-maintenance even if the control plain is managed.  And proxying the UI for end users introduces back security and usability issues.<p>The best experience and lowest friction sale is to deliver a fully managed experience and earn the trust of customers. Confluent, Snowflake, Mongo Atlas, Rockset, CockroachDB, Elastic, Splunk, New Relic, etc all prove this is a great model for both customers and vendors.  For the largest security conscious customers you can offer a fully VPC&#x2F;on-prem solution with exactly the same form factor if you want.  Hybrid can have its place, but I&#x27;d always try hard to offer a managed solution if you can justify it.')
