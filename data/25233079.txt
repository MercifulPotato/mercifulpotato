The kvm binary on Linux is equivalent to running qemu-system-* with -enable-kvm. Newer versions of QEMU also support the &#x27;-accel kvm&#x27; argument but also adds other acceleration backends, such as &#x27;-accel tcg&#x27; (slower), &#x27;-accel haxm&#x27; (Intel&#x2F;Windows), and finally &#x27;-accel hvf&#x27; for Apple&#x27;s Hypervisor.Framework. This work here is extending that existing support from only Intel VT-x to also cover ARM Silicon, factoring out common code and API differences made by Apple.')
