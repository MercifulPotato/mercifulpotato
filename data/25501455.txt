As unpopular as the opinion appears to be here, I don&#x27;t like the idea of having to dodge humans randomly entering the road. Should we also take down the  signals and barriers that prevent cars from crossing train tracks, since they have the similar goal of preventing a high speed object, with orders of magnitude more weight, from colliding with something relatively squishy?<p>edit: No need to immediately downvote. I would enjoy some discussion.')
