Hence, if you can write coroutines that fill the caches more intelligently than that the hardware prefetcher can do (because you know more about what your application is trying to achieve), you can outperform the hardware prefetcher. You write a whole lot of coroutines that fill caches, suspend them while they do it, and once they are resumed, you can assume that the caches are now filled with your data and have just achieved better efficiency.<p>Hope this was a clear enough explanation, and someone correct me if I’m wrong.')
