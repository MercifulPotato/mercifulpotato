Also a never-user, but I&#x27;ve always thought that criminalizing the manufacture and distribution of drugs was the lazy way to combat the problem: fewer people to catch, bigger effect on the problem per arrest. It misses the mark of who&#x27;s doing something really wrong though. I like to refer to dealers as &quot;legitimate businessmen&quot; for fun, because it&#x27;s largely true. Of course dealers enforcing territory via violence are real criminals, but those problems would evaporate if the trade were no longer illegal.<p>How do we combat the real toll of drugs on people&#x27;s personal well-being then? A lot of them lead to broken lives. You could ban use, but that&#x27;s hard to enforce and infringes on liberty. Instead, I would like to see a policy where your access to social safety nets is taken away when you&#x27;re a user. You want to risk it all to get high? Go for it but don&#x27;t leave us with the bill and having to wring our hands that you ended up homeless.')
