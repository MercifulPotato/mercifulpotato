They&#x27;re not &quot;nearly a $1,000&quot;, and the fact that they&#x27;re only doing it on some models shows what an artificial giveaway this is. There is no reason for it other than economics: they think they can get an extra few bucks out of these models, but they don&#x27;t think they can raise the price even higher on the Pro models.')
