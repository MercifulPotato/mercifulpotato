In particular it mentions RST_STREAM which went away by the end of 2018 in favour of RESET_STREAM.<p>In fact it&#x27;s possible it isn&#x27;t even talking about the proposed IETF protocol QUIC at all, but instead Google&#x27;s QUIC (&quot;gQUIC&quot; in modern parlance) in which case this might as well be a paper saying the iPhone is vulnerable to an attack but it turns out it means a 1980s device named &quot;iPhone&quot; not the Apple product.<p>It certainly references a bunch of gQUIC papers, which could mean that&#x27;s blind references from a hasty Google search by researchers who don&#x27;t read their own references - but equally could mean they really did do this work on gQUIC.')
