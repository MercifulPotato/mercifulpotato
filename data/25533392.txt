I think we’ll see a lot more interesting applications (particularly around tooling) in the next few years.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@karpathy&#x2F;software-2-0-a64152b37c35" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@karpathy&#x2F;software-2-0-a64152b37c35</a><p>Outside of the consumer space, there are also things that hint at more generalizable intelligence.<p>Check out GPT-3’s performance on arithmetic tasks in the original paper (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2005.14165" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2005.14165</a>)<p>Pages: 21-23, 63<p>Which shows some generality, the best way to accurately predict an arithmetic answer is to deduce how the mathematical rules work. That paper shows some evidence of that and that’s just from a relatively dumb predict what comes next model.<p>It’s hard to predict timelines for this kind of thing, and people are notoriously bad at it. Nobody would have predicted the results we’re seeing today in 2010. What would you expect to see in the years leading up to AGI? Does what we’re seeing look like failure?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepmind.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;article&#x2F;muzero-mastering-go-chess-shogi-and-atari-without-rules" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepmind.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;article&#x2F;muzero-mastering-go-chess-...</a>')
