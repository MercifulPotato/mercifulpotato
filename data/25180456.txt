Officially the answer is “no”, but what if someone with AIDS contracts COVID-19 and dies? Does that person count toward both statistics? How many statistics can one death count towards?<p>Now try “diabetes and hypertension”, or “lung cancer”, or “temporary immunodeficiency” and you can start to see how dishonest it is to represent the death toll of this disease as a single number, based on an interpretation that generates the largest possible number, and an interpretation not used with <i>any other respiratory disease</i>.')
