Either way, while it&#x27;ll suck, maybe a lot, if there are <i>businesses</i> still selling&#x2F;offering flash-based products, they need to change, immediately.<p>I&#x27;m sympathetic to people who want to keep flash around to play games or experience the &quot;old web&quot;, but education and enterprise still requiring flash for &lt;x&gt; is beyond absurd at this point, as long as it&#x27;s been deprecated and Adobe has been ringing the death bell.<p>Maybe this isn&#x27;t a fair sentiment either, but I feel like both teachers and students would benefit from upgrading to a product that doesn&#x27;t require flash. I know it&#x27;s more complicated than that, but geeze.')
