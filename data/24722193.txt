The intel spec sheet for i3-9350KF doesn&#x27;t show QuickSync, but i3-9350K does. The difference between the two is that the F series doesn&#x27;t have a GPU (or it&#x27;s disabled). Also unavailable on server class Xeons without GPUs.<p>I agree, it&#x27;s convenient to have a GPU on most CPUs, but AMD puts less priority on that market, so we just have to wait.')
