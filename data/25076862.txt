My understanding is that they&#x27;ve been pretty transparent about using Bing and Yandex as sources for its product, have done quite a bit of work to tailor the results they spit back, and maintain their own knowledge graph for features like instant answers. They seem to function more as a metasearch engine.<p>From ehat I&#x27;ve seen, search engines like Ecosia and Qwant aren&#x27;t very clear about what they bring to the table, beyond serving as a proxy for Bing that doesn&#x27;t store as much data on you.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything explicitly wrong with that. But I don&#x27;t think they really merit anybody&#x27;s attention either. Especially since they don&#x27;t explicitly advertise what they are.')
