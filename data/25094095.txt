They are a lot of noise, but more importantly, they force us to keep all our domain logic in a single massive  reducer, with no encapsulation between different sections.<p>This can be improved by using coarse-grained actions like say `UpdatePerson(person)`. And this new `person` value can be obtained by the event handler itself when the user changes the name. However, the actual logic can sit inside a Person module, allowing us to do something like: `onChange=dispatch(UpdatePerson(Person.setFirstName(newName, currentPerson))`<p>This approach lets us keep the behaviour close to the view while encapsulating the actual implementation inside a rich domain model.')
