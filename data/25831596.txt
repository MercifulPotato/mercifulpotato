But outlets like the ARD, and a lesser extent ZDF (there are some legal differences between the two, including independance) are way more neutral regarding the ruling, or major, parties like, say, Fox News and the GOP. And they have been, regardless of government coalition. They still are as far as their pure news formats are concerned, much mre &quot;just the facts&quot; then anything else I ever saw in the US. Their more &quot;opinion&quot; heavy pieces are different, but still are far cry from opinion pieces in the US, e.g. Hannity or O&#x27;Donnel. And that by itself is a good thing.<p>Austrians public broadcasters, the ORF, are way better than that even. They mutineed against the attempt to install pulitical operatives at the head of the organisation. They even end interviews with gvernment secretaries if they don&#x27;t get strsaight answers.')
