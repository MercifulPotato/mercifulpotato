I&#x27;m used to Perl and CPAN, and it&#x27;s pretty similar to that, except for the option to use dir&#x2F;mod.rs, which honestly seems like it&#x27;s kinda nice for keeping a module contained nicely for those that want to do it that way.<p>Now I&#x27;m more interested in what the complaints about it are, and specifically what they&#x27;re in comparison to.  Either they&#x27;re not used to using so many modules in a method such as this, or they&#x27;re honestly expecting some better system for their use case that I&#x27;m unaware of, or a little of both, so my curiosity is piqued.')
