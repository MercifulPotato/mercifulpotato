Especially since Github somehow seems to have been losing developer goodwill lately.<p>This is not a dig -- few companies can afford to take a legal risk that Microsoft can (even on a strong case, most companies couldn&#x27;t afford the legal bills of standing up to RIAA), and it&#x27;s GREAT that they are choosing to, setting a standard.<p>It will in fact be really hard for gitlab to do similar though, they can not afford a lawsuit from the RIAA like MS can. (And the RIAA is really unlikely to sue MS unless they really think they have to, cause they know they&#x27;re outgunned_.')
