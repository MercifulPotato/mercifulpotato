Just off the top of my head:<p>- The UI is an ugly light gray with too much text. I&#x27;d make the design far more minimal.<p>- Too much of a focus on text. Video, audio and GIFs should be more integrated into cards, especially for stuff like foreign languages.<p>- Way too many options: note types, sort fields, tags, on and on. I&#x27;ve been using Anki for years and I don&#x27;t even know what half of these things do.<p>- The entire process of adding cards is confusing and not immediately obvious. There&#x27;s not even a tutorial.<p>- Premade decks have zero quality control and you have to go looking for them online.<p>- Above all, Anki just looks and feels like a chore. When I show it to people (like OP), the overwhelming reaction is always, &quot;Meh.&quot; There&#x27;s nothing exciting, beautiful or futuristic about it.')
