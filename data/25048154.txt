It&#x27;s that the 800k isn&#x27;t worth the legal fees and the possible PR damage (Bessemer doesn&#x27;t want to be known as non-founder friendly because they made a fuss over 800k).<p>It&#x27;s been repeated a couple times in this thread, but VC make money by 10x-100x their original investment. They invested 800k expecting to make back 8M-80M. Anything less than that isn&#x27;t worth the additional time, especially for a seed stage investment where they might have 50-60 of these per year.<p>I think, for anyone trying to start a company and take VC funding to understand how the VC business model works. A VC incentives are much different than a founder&#x27;s much of the time. In this case, the best case for  the VC is for the founder to continue working on the company.')
