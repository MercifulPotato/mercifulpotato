As such, it seems to have evolved into a much more deadly strain at that point.<p>Reproducing more efficiently is a win for natural selection and will normally result in a dominant strain: whether that strain is more deadly or not is going to be random.<p>We might optimistically anticipate some regression to the mean fatality rate (where the mean is close to 0).')
