I would be unhappy if I got home and this were the only image I had of this scene. For any given image, you&#x27;ll be able to find someone who likes it or thinks it looks good enough. If that&#x27;s your standard, then this camera might be great for you. But if you have a higher standard, then you might not be satisfied.<p>I&#x27;d also ask what kind of screen you&#x27;re looking at the image on. This image looks fine on my phone, but its screen is barely as large as a 3x5, which is essentially the lowest common denominator for printing -- the McDonald&#x27;s hamburger of photo rendition. The image looks bad on my monitor, and would look awful if printed on 8x10.')
