But all they have are photos of these purported documents. Not the documents themselves, assuming they ever actually existed.<p>Also, there&#x27;s a lot of stuff about the hard drive that doesn&#x27;t add up. Hunter Biden lives in California but supposedly dropped off the laptop in Wilmington...on a weekend while he was seen attending parties in Los Angeles...with his (then) fiance. And the laptop was given to a legally blind tech shop owner who can&#x27;t actually say who it was that dropped off the laptop. The tech shop owner then made a copy of the hard drive, and then gave it (the copy) to Guiliani rather than the FBI, and Guiliani kept it...rather than giving it to the Senate committee investigating the matter at the time. The FBI didn&#x27;t purportedly get the hard drive until sometime earlier this year...after the Senate investigation had concluded without finding anything. If there actually had been something on the hard drive earlier this year, why didn&#x27;t either of them turn it over to the FBI or the Senate committee earlier? None of this makes any sense, and a lot of it sounds made up.<p><i>If I were going to hold a covert meeting with foreign nationals that falls afoul of anti-corruption laws, I wouldn&#x27;t be putting it on my official schedule either. This is not a defense to the accusation made.</i><p>And yet, that is precisely what two of the <i>sitting President&#x27;s</i> children have actually done, as well as at least two of their spouses...<p>But on that note, at the time of the purported meetings (2014 and 2015), Hunter Biden was the son of the sitting vice president and would have been under Secret Service observation. And yet, the Secret Service doesn&#x27;t have any records of such meetings, or even of Hunter Biden traveling to the cities where they meetings would have taken place.<p>I want evidence that <i>any</i> of the purported evidence is authentic. If this were any other administration, that wouldn&#x27;t be an issue. But the Trump administration, and Giuliani especially, have such a long history of fraud that you simply can&#x27;t trust anything they provide.')
