I still think volatility and transaction latency&#x2F;costs are an issue, but assuming we fix those (and stipulating they can be fixed) it doesn&#x27;t seem unwise for smaller countries to use cryptocurrencies. It would more or less be gold standard monetary policy in a box, and while that system has drawbacks, a nice thing about it is it&#x27;s pretty hard to corrupt. It would be harder (not impossible, but meaningfully harder) to manipulate currency and politically choose winners and losers via monetary policy, which is a big deal especially for growing or newly stable countries.<p>But for those countries, it really seems like choosing Diem is the worst of both worlds. You&#x27;re still pinned to the Dollar, you&#x27;re still at the whim of unaccountable controlling stakeholders, and you have all the downsides of cryptocurrency on top of it. I struggle to think of a group outside of Facebook that Diem is at all good for, honestly.')
