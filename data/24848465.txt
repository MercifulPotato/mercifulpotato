The mailing list has over 14,000 entries by 380 people. Anyone can post. Anyone can contribute. There are no women postings.

But Caitlin&#x27;s book seems to speak to one of the potential issues. On the other hand, my high school peer group studied physics, chemistry, and chess. Things anyone can do. But no women joined.
