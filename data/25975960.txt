Google Chrome and vscode show up in the output of xlsclients, which I am told means that they are talking to XWayland (and there are web pages promising that in a few months those 2 apps will be adapted to talk directly to wayland), and those 2 apps are blurry whereas Gnome Terminal and Evince (my PDF reader) do not show up in the output of xlsclients and those 2 apps are not blurry, but their default text size and the size of their UI elements are consistent with everything being scaled by 1.5.')
