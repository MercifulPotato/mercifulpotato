Years later, I got serious about it and took out my own loans to get a degree and a job.  The first time around I had no plans and no idea what I was doing, but the second time I had a plan and a goal, and I achieved it.  And I paid off my debt myself.<p>The initial money wasn&#x27;t <i>entirely</i> wasted, but most of those credits didn&#x27;t transfer towards my degree.<p>That was just a CC, but imagine if it was a 6 yr degree at a University instead.  It&#x27;d be vastly more costly.')
