In fact, before you pointed out that it&#x27;s mostly a stupidity concentrator (nice term btw), I didn&#x27;t even notice that. When I read the front page of reddit I don&#x27;t deduce the average intelligence of the participants by the most popular (mostly negative) posts of the day, I&#x27;m banking on the most upvoted posts being somewhat entertaining to me, nothing more.<p>What has convinced me the world is stupid is that as a whole we cannot get our shit together to deal with a global pandemic. You signal your intelligence when you show blatant disregard for the rules&#x2F;law when you don&#x27;t wear a mask when required. There are so many reasons why people do this (not knowing any better&#x2F;not believing they work comes from lack of education), but it all stems from lack of intelligence (in my opinion). The fact that some parts of the world have effectively contained\nwhile others are miserably failing, causing so many needless deaths, knowing what needs to happen to create this outcome, you can only conclude that as a whole, we are morons.<p>So yeah, I&#x27;m sure social media is definitely doing some damage, acting as a conduit for false information, spreading theories on 5G towers spreading the virus etc, but taking 5 watching some dumbass total his car via &#x2F;r&#x2F;idiotsincars because it was upvoted into &#x2F;r&#x2F;all does not make me feel hopeless, what makes me feel hopeless is getting on a tram, making a quick scan and concluding that I have to move into the next section because in the current one there are too many people not wearing a mask.<p>Your post has made me reconsider browsing &#x2F;r&#x2F;all though.. it is all pretty bland these days and &#x2F;r&#x2F;WCGW isn&#x27;t entertaining as it was when I first found it')
