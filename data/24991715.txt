The authors often pay attention to details like on which page certain tables and figures end up, that equations appear where they should etc. I&#x27;ve seen many attempts at rendering HTML from e.g. Arxiv papers and the layout is almost always broken. Paper authors often employ a lot of Latex wizardry to get precisely the layout that they want, and these conversion tools mostly choke on that.')
