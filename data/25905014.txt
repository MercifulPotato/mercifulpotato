Some of the spouts kinda stop ocasionally, but not for long.<p>There is a sinkhole, but it&#x27;s not big enough, so it keeps filling.<p>When it fills up, you and everyone you love included, along with all of humanity, will have to drink from that pool forever as their sole form of sustenance, possibly dying of it. It&#x27;s taking the plants and kelp with it, too, so eventually there will be nothing we can recognize as good.<p>The only way out is to make the sinkhole bigger or close every spout and try to make it _very_ clear what happened so future generations don&#x27;t mess with it. Every other path leads to everyone and everything dying a horrible death.')
