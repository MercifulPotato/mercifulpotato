I&#x27;m not arguing about fairness, I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s not a concern for AWS either, but if you have a basic product with solid margins, doesn&#x27;t it make sense to account something you build on top of that product as marketing or documentation, rather then as a distinct product that has to pay for itself?')
