He&#x27;s taking money, nobody owes him. If you have to care about hosting details anyway, it&#x27;s probably less of a hassle to self-host.<p>How much do you think the 1GB and processing actually cost? 1GB is surely less than a dollar, and the processing could either be special-cased or would not be more than $5&#x2F;month for the duration until they get proper large-file support.<p>Meanwhile, the client&#x27;s first comment on &quot;surely 1.1gb&quot; reads to me as saying &quot;why are you wasting my time?&quot;, and Drew&#x27;s response seemed to say &quot;this is not an isolated incident, this is just how I operate&quot;, to which the &quot;I&#x27;ve canceled my account because this is bullshit&quot; is IMO entirely appropriate.')
