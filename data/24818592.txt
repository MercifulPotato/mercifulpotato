For example:<p>CVE-2019-3462 Incorrect sanitation of the 302 redirect field in HTTP transport method of apt versions 1.4.8 and earlier can lead to content injection by a MITM attacker, potentially leading to remote code execution on the target machine.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cvedetails.com&#x2F;vulnerability-list&#x2F;vendor_id-23&#x2F;product_id-17236&#x2F;Debian-APT.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cvedetails.com&#x2F;vulnerability-list&#x2F;vendor_id-23&#x2F;p...</a><p>Edit: many of the CVEs for apt-get are in the &quot;bad pki&quot; class, all of them are &quot;severe&quot; as they allow malicious code execution:<p>CVE-2009-1358 apt-get does not check for the correct error code from gpgv<p>CVE-2011-1829 APT does not properly validate inline GPG signatures<p>CVE-2011-3634 APt accepts connections when the certificate host name fails validation<p>CVE-2014-0478 APT does not properly validate source packages, allow installation of Trojan horse packages by removing the Release signature.<p>etc etc.<p>Facts of life: all software contain an uncountable number of severe vulnerabilities. It is unfair to single-out openwrt IMHO.')
