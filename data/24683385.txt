Do you miss these conversations? Back to the in-office time, when do you usually have a spontaneous chat that is interesting and also meaningful to your work? (eg. After a conference)<p>Yes usually when I&#x27;ve learned something or am working on something that excites me, if i see a coworker i respect or am friends with, i usually strike up a conversation about that topic.<p>2.

Is it working well?<p>Hard to do, don&#x27;t really have any real cues as to what frame of mind the other person on the other side is. Are they busy with something that is pressing?
