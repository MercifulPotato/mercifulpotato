The issue with SSRIs are them being reuptake inhibitors - they actually change how the brain functions vs. MDMA is simply causing serotonin to be released.<p>I also happen to be taking a dopamine agonist to treat a benign brain tumour I have (prolactinoma) - first line of treatment is adding a dopamine agonist to the system, and not using an SSRI&#x2F;SNRI&#x2F;etc that changes the actual function was fine as well for ceremony; a caveat to research or understand&#x2F;have caution with is that I had done 30+ Ayahuasca ceremonies prior to taking a dopamine agonist - and so my mind&#x2F;brain was generally already &quot;opened&quot; how it will be. Care&#x2F;caution may be necessary if a person has never &quot;opened&quot; up their mind&#x2F;brain yet (after X ceremonies&#x2F;experiences) and if they are taking dopamine for whatever reason, as maybe once the pathways that get opened from Ayahuasca et al then the impact of the dopamine would shift as well - perhaps then overcompensating for blocks that get cleared by the Aya etc - and the person may then experience undesired levels of effects from the dopamine.<p>MDMA isn&#x27;t directly changing the actual function, they&#x27;re not causing inhibition; the action of how is important, the nuance is important to understand - though like from your comment - there isn&#x27;t this general understanding that there is a difference, and I imagine most doctors&#x2F;professionals will jump to the same conclusion without thinking about it - misattributing the different actions instead of critical thinking from foundational principles. It&#x27;s not the neurotransmitter(s) that are a problem, at least not serotonin and dopamine, it&#x27;s if the function change of how they&#x27;re allowed to flow changes that&#x27;s the problem.<p>Interview&#x2F;chat between Dr. K (Healthygamer_gg) and Rick Doblin - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1e2h-awLC-s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1e2h-awLC-s</a> - where he mentions taking half-therapeutic dose; more of a casual conversation where you can also hear a bit of Rick&#x27;s origin story.<p>I did fairly deep research on this beforehand, looking into actual pharmacological aspect of interactions with things like dopamine, etc - a few people over the last 20 years have been keeping track of all related research. I don&#x27;t have the link for the most succinct, detailed writeup I read handy.')
