I know that people don&#x27;t think much of the people where I live, and that comes from the lack of good educational opportunities afforded them out here in flyover country. But these people get to vote too. They get to participate in society as well. I guess I mean that they count. You can&#x27;t say there is no one who claims social media is credible, when it is obvious there are millions who are swayed by social media precisely because it is credible in their view.<p>In fact, if a story is only on social media, it&#x27;s <i>proof</i> of the story&#x27;s validity in their eyes. If the mainstream media won&#x27;t run a story they found on social media, then it must be part of a conspiracy to keep the &quot;truth&quot; from getting out. I hear this narrative everyday in my area of the midwest.')
