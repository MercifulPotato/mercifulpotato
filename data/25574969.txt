Morbidly fat teenagers were basically nonexistent then. Now you meet them all the time.<p>IMHO the worst offenders are soft drinks, which have zero satiating effect and consist of a mass of liquid sugar. Coca-cola used to be expensive here in the 1990s (compared to a median wage), now it is cheaper than beer, our typical lower class drink.')
