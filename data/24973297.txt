Do something weird or uncommon with google adsense, loose your google drive too.<p>Personally, I haven&#x27;t experienced this kind of bs yet. But at this point, I don&#x27;t want to take chances with using another google service that could suddenly shutoff with no explanation and no hope to resolve the issue and taking out who knows what else at the same time.')
