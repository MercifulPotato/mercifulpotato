It would be more optimal if you could pickle your memories, clone yourself and then (at some appropriate time later in life) &quot;re-implant&quot; the memories into your clone. I think that&#x27;s what people like Larry King are really hoping for.<p>But then there&#x27;s all sorts of problems with this (e.g., your loved ones will presumably be gone, so who&#x27;s going to give a shit about your memories? etc. etc.).<p>The prospect of death is frightening to most of us.')
