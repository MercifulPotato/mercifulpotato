Hopefully this year the embedding story will become clearer,  and progress can be made on top.<p>Some notes here about interactive shell ideas: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oilshell&#x2F;oil&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Interactive-Shell" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oilshell&#x2F;oil&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Interactive-Shell</a><p>Some people might think Oil is sort of a text-only or retro project ... but it really isn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s a SPEED project.  I use shell because it&#x27;s the fastest to get certain things done.<p>But other things are faster when done with GUIs.  Actually I wrote the last 5 or 6 blog posts in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackedit.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackedit.io</a> because copying and pasting huge swaths of text and links and images is faster with the mouse!<p>I am a die-hard Vim person for code, but I realized that &quot;thinking and writing&quot; is aided by the mouse and by rich GUIs (but not slow ones, which is hard!).  Previewing hyperlinks is also very important.')
