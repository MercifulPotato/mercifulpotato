If you open the accident report (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ntsb.gov&#x2F;investigations&#x2F;AccidentReports&#x2F;Reports&#x2F;AAR9901.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ntsb.gov&#x2F;investigations&#x2F;AccidentReports&#x2F;Reports&#x2F;...</a>) and ctrl-F &quot;rudder&quot;, you get 2,112 matches. So &quot;reading for hours&quot; is a distinct possibility in this case...<p>(Oh, by the way, I didn&#x27;t mean to imply you were mistaken, or anything like that. I was just so shocked that a plane&#x27;s controls could invert themselves <i>in any conceivable circumstance</i>. Currently digging through the accident report to try to figure out what happened.)<p>&quot;the probable cause of\nthe USAir flight 427 accident was a loss of control of the airplane resulting from the\nmovement of the rudder surface to its blowdown limit. The rudder surface most likely\ndeflected in a direction opposite to that commanded by the pilots as a result of a jam of the\nmain rudder power control unit servo valve secondary slide to the servo valve housing\noffset from its neutral position and overtravel of the primary slide&quot;<p>Unfortunately I don&#x27;t know what most of these terms mean. It <i>sounds</i> like it might be saying &quot;they moved the rudder to its limit, and then it jammed at the limit; so when they tried to command the rudder to go the other way, the rudder was pointed in the opposite direction of the control inputs.&quot; But I&#x27;m really not sure.')
