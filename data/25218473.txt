It&#x27;s a disassociative.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen a study comparing this in the way you describe, but from piecing together other papers I recall seeing I would say probably psiloc(yb)in, possibly DMT (&quot;ayahuasca&quot;), with LSD and mescaline (peyote&#x2F;san pedro) being qualitatively similar. All of these are primarily serotonergic.<p>I&#x27;d be surprised if Salvia does jack shit in that domain, regardless of how trippy the experience can be. It acts very differently.')
