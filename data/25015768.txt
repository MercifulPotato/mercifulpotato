It&#x27;s not people shooting the breeze. Low value comments are actively discouraged.<p>HN is not very transparent in some respects. It may not be obvious if someone is new here that a lot of people here have significant expertise in various domains.<p>So coming here is not like wandering into a coffee shop where random people are shooting the breeze and doing that &quot;armchair politician&quot; thing, though it may seem like it is. It&#x27;s more like wandering into some academic club at some major university and joining the discussion without having to be enrolled in the university because they have some extreme inclusive policy.<p>You have more or less told everyone here &quot;Doctors and scientists are all dumb! And furthermore I know better than them!&quot; and then asked &quot;What does N=1 mean?&quot; You are basically attacking and insulting a lot of the people you are addressing and then asking them to explain their field to you after having just dismissed them.<p>It&#x27;s always okay to ask what something means, but a best practice is to google the question first, especially for something simple&#x2F;basic. (Granted, googling doesn&#x27;t always turn up a good explanation -- some things are surprisingly hard to google.)<p>However, sometimes all that does is signal that you don&#x27;t really know what you are talking about and can&#x27;t back up your strongly stated position. And that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on here in terms of social dynamics.')
