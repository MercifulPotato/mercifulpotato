I agree that once you have useful things that reproduce, it&#x27;s easy to keep it going. Similarly, if I have a running copy of Linux, I can use the tools (and source code) to produce another copy of Linux.<p>But how do we get the first copy, the &quot;original reproducing molecule&quot; as you put it?<p>The usual explanation is that the &quot;first copy&quot; arose <i>randomly</i>, and then kept going. Do you believe that? I suspect notâ€”but most people do.<p>We know that it can&#x27;t have been random (which is the argument I gave, and I suspect you agree with). We should tell people &quot;it wasn&#x27;t random, something about the fundamental nature of these molecules caused better and more complex molecules to emerge.&quot; But we have no mechanism for that, just a (valid) belief that it has to be true.<p>I think we should find those mechanisms, and simultaneously, stop telling people that random chance + vast universe + long timespan is sufficient.')
