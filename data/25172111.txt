This is how you end up with applications that are slow due to a thousand small cuts.<p>If you don&#x27;t think about these things, then I can only assume that it&#x27;s because you don&#x27;t notice them when they come up.<p>To be clear, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with choosing the slower implementation because its simpler. What&#x27;s important is that you thought about the trade-off, and often the O(n) loop is not more complicated than the O(n^2) one.')
