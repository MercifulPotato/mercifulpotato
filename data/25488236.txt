The burden of proof in criminal matters is &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;. I&#x27;m somewhat doubtful that prosecutors, faced with an onslaught of defense counsel and sympathetic jurors, will meet that burden in white collar crimes. The answer isn&#x27;t jail but rather developing the will to overcome regulatory capture and to enforce existing legislation which is more than sufficient to counter monopolies.')
