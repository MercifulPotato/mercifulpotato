Glass doesn&#x27;t decompose in a landfill and has limits on how often it can be re-used as well.<p>The detergents, water and heat needed for cleaning alone have a higher environmental impact than the few drops of oil needed to make a plastic bottle.<p>Plastic waste is a big problem for sure, but switching to glass is not the solution.')
