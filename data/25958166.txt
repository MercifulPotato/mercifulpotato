That was why the Industrial Revolution and Computer Revolution were so huge; both produced things that did 1 and 2. And because time was saved and not things became possible, those things started to get done, growing the economy.<p>And all of that included companies growing big, but in the presence of 1 and 2, the growth of companies isn&#x27;t necessary to grow the economy.')
