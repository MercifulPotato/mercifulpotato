Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25397765], score=None, time=1607717485, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25386671, text='&gt; I don’t think there’s an easy fix for this, and that makes me sad.<p>I mean, there is, which is to reintroduce mixed use zoning. You essentially allow people to operate small businesses out of their homes.<p>This changes the dynamic very quickly because the change can happen before the new construction. As soon as it&#x27;s allowed, someone buys a house on your street, or one of your existing neighbors does this, and it becomes a bistro from the hours of 6PM to 10PM. The neighbors gather there on a regular basis and get to know each other.<p>Then the house across the street converts a room to a convenience store, and now you can walk to a convenience store instead of having to drive to Walmart.<p>What makes these things viable is that the proprietor still lives in the house, which reduces their operating costs and allows them to compete with the big guys. But it&#x27;s currently prohibited by zoning.<p>Really what might do something great is to have a new class of zoning designated for owner-occupied small businesses, i.e. you can operate a business there but only if someone who owns at least 30% of the business also lives there. Then rezone the majority of residential properties as that.')
