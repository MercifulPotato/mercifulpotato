It assumes a level of rationality that has been proven to be unreasonable to assume. The problem isn&#x27;t that &quot;better&quot; arguments aren&#x27;t reaching people. Rather, we have watched people exercise an incredible ability to discard overwhelming evidence and embrace narratives that have literally zero evidence to support them (or, in fact, have been repeatedly disproven and debunked).<p>In that kind of environment, &quot;counter bad arguments with better arguments&quot; is hopelessly naive.')
