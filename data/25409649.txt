(And maybe other Google products that I don&#x27;t know?)<p>It seems to me that it would be entirely worth it to Google if 99.99% of 20% projects don&#x27;t go anywhere, but every now and then, you get a big hit like Gmail whose newfound revenue completely eclipses the lost 20% experimental time from the 9999 other employees.<p>And even for those 9999 other employees, even if their 20% projects don&#x27;t go anywhere, they are likely still hugely educational in ways that would make them more productive in the other 80%.')
