Item(by='alpaca128', descendants=None, kids=[25952435], score=None, time=1611848518, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25941389, text='&gt; Or even better, if both is the same.<p>That makes it just less transparent. You still have to be\ncareful and know the difference or one day you unintentionally\ncreate a shallow copy of an object and now you&#x27;ve got a bug the\nruntime won&#x27;t warn about. Yes, Rust is more complicated and\nharder to get into in those areas, but in return it&#x27;s not as\nambiguous. I know that calling `clone()` will always do just that,\nno edge cases, and even if I were wrong the compiler would\nimmediately tell me because of a type mismatch.<p>Realistically I don&#x27;t think any of the two approaches is\nsignificantly faster. But I know what I find more consistent and\nless frustrating to debug.')
