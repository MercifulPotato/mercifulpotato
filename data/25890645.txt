Item(by='bowlich', descendants=None, kids=[25891649, 25891568, 25890712], score=None, time=1611480861, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25890569, text='Pockets of commerce is the thing that is totally gone from suburbia.<p>I went back to the Cleveland suburbs for a grandparent&#x27;s funeral several years back and I could definitely see how in the 1950s the structure of the suburb would&#x27;ve been great for the large Catholic families that lived there.<p>It was centred around the VFW, several parks, and a school. Children could play in the streets. Parents could socialize at the VFW and walk home. Each corner had a shopping complex with a grocery, gas station, barber etc. It was never more than 1&#x2F;2 mile to all your commercial needs -- and a safe sidewalk walk if you sent kids to go get milk or eggs. If you were working downtown there was public transit to take you from the suburb to the city center and back again. I could see how this would be a very nice set up for where my parents grew up.<p>Today this doesn&#x27;t exist. The corner shopping complexes are entirely vacant. Grocery is now only available at bigger box-stores requiring an hour of commuting in traffic on roads that don&#x27;t have sidewalks. The school closed. The VFW is no longer culturally relevant.')
