Hah.<p>I&#x27;ve been reflecting on the ethical considerations of being part of such an industry. On one end, I&#x27;m enamored with the huge and interesting problem space that defense entails, and I do believe that the industry is pretty necessary. I see it as meaningful work, something that can be pretty fulfilling in the long run. But squaring up with the possibility that the projects involved on can harm other human beings with great efficiency bothers me somewhat.')
