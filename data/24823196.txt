A forest is not a large collection of trees. It is an ecosystem. I know that not all climate-change related programs make this mistake, but overall, the rush to do good things to combat climate change is coming at the expense of people forgetting that if we fail to prevent extinctions today due to natural habitat loss, then no amount of reduced climate change due to non-native species reforestation projects in the future will ever bring them back.<p>The greatest threat facing the natural world is not climate change, it is habitat loss.')
