I have a GSuites domain and I don&#x27;t want my users to be able to sign up via Google. No resolution. I suggest you all complain too<p>I semi worked around it by adding accounts.google.com to my ublock origin block list but about once a month I have to turn it off to allow me to log into Google.<p>Note: I&#x27;m not against google. I am against this auto-popup. The logical conclusion is you&#x27;ll go to a page and get 6 of those popups or more. One to sign up with Google, one to sign up with Apple. One to sign up with Facebook. One to sign up with Linkedin, etc...<p>The design of that system by google is not a good design based on the idea that if everyone did it it would be bad. Google should top it. If I click &quot;sign up&quot; on the sight then let the site offer me &quot;login with X&quot; and don&#x27;t contect X until I click &quot;login with X&quot;')
