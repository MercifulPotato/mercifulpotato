Your argument shows a lack of statistical understanding - conditional on this data, the Bayesian approach would be to update the prior (whether A is better, or they’re equally as good) with the data collected. With such a small dataset, you might end up with a belief that there’s a 60% probability that B is better than A, but that’s not significant enough to conclude that B is in fact better than A, as you still have a lot of uncertainty.<p>With a prior that A is superior, you may still end up believing that A &gt; B after updating, because there’s just so little data.')
