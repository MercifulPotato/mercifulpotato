I think I listened to more thanks to the lack of a commute. I didn&#x27;t feel bad about leaving the house at 4:30pm (end of workday for me) and finding my way back home at 5:30pm or 6pm, especially since I knocked out a lot of household chores&#x2F;tasks during the workday in quick 1-5 minute bursts so I was more helpful around the house than when I was in the office.')
