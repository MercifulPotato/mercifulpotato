Item(by='bayindirh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606138430, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25186287, text='&gt; The M1 mac isn&#x27;t the first ARM based PC, and it&#x27;s not the first popular one...<p>However, it&#x27;s the first popular and heavily backed ARM CPU which can compete with high end x86.<p>&gt; Most distros and OSS have dealt with the issues on arm already.<p>I also use a lot of ARM based SBCs for a long time but, running a scientific application fast is not the same thing as booting Linux or making it reasonably performant&#x2F;stable.<p>My day job and personal research is involved with supercomputers a lot. So I live in parallel applications &#x2F; architectures. There are certain scientific applications which run considerably faster in previous generation hardware when compared to current-gen ones, because they&#x27;re heavily tuned for that generation&#x27;s memory subsystem latencies and IPC characteristics (fetch, retire capacities and pipeline latencies to be exact). This sometimes implies that the code contains proper hints or hand-tuned asm for speed-critical sections. Eigen is a very good example of this optimization. It optimizes itself during compilation by compiling the architecture optimized paths with hints in the code and help of the compiler.<p>So, having an ARM CPU which can surpass x86 will make these communities to take note of it. I&#x27;m not sure how Eigen performs on M1 for example (will see soon enough), or other software packages which are optimized for x86 extensively.<p>These software packages will start to get optimizations for M1 or Apple silicon since it&#x27;s pretty popular amongst scientists due to its POSIX nature and hardware quality.<p>At the end of the day; yes, it&#x27;s a glorified Raspberry Pi, but with looks and performance of a supercar, so it&#x27;ll attract a different kind of user base and development effort.')
