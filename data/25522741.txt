Some people (mostly also those who have zero ways of even starting to debug it) seem to have a lot of trouble with it, also on dummy OSes like Apple&#x27;s, while for me it simply works on a heavily customized Android where a ton of stuff breaks and indeed a lot of other messengers have trouble with it (ranging from Keybase which shows nothing at all ever to Matrix which pops up a notification every 5 seconds for 0.2 seconds &quot;checking for messages&quot; in order to make it work).<p>It seems not to be a Telegram-specific problem, and I haven&#x27;t heard from anyone who actually had the issue and even attempted to find what&#x27;s wrong.')
