Sometimes such professed  <i>&#x27;issues&#x27;</i> are just flourishes of pedagogical knives, which seem dangerous to the naive student, but the resolution is just to shoot the prophet of doom. For example, the many varied implementations of Fibonacci series can explain the differences between iterative&#x2F;(tail-)recursive&#x2F;functional&#x2F;memo-ized implementations, while hiding the facts that:<p>(1) nobody really needs Fibonacci numbers, unless you are unlucky enough to be modelling the number of immortal rabbits, in a world without foxes, but with an infinite series of cabbages;<p>(2) the inside secret is that there&#x27;s a closed-form expression called the Binet Formula (1843):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fibonacci_number#Closed-form_expression" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fibonacci_number#Closed-form_e...</a><p>The mystical prophets never tell their students about this, even though the facts have been well-known for 40-180 years, because it would hurt the business of prophet-ing.')
