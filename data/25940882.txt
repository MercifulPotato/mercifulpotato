I grew up with a wetland in my back yard, and got bitten enough during my wilderness survival merit badge course that I no longer swell or itch when I get bitten.<p>However, my understanding is that there are no species that feed exclusively or even mostly on human-biting mosquitoes.  I&#x27;ve been told the environmental impact of human-biting mosquitoes going extinct would be minor, though, dramatically reducing human morbidity and mortality in some poorer countries would have indirect environmental impact.')
