Each year the &quot;big news&quot; from intel was their their Celeron&#x2F;Pentium&#x2F;iX&#x2F;whatever was now up to 100MHz faster than last year&#x27;s (during limited situations where temperatures allow blah blah blah). Or they add some new strange trademarked exotic-sounding technology brand name each year like &quot;The new Intel Celeron&#x2F;Pentium&#x2F;iX with...&quot; &quot;Intel MaxT&quot;&#x2F;&quot;Intel TruEvo&#x2F;&quot;Intel Cartara&quot;&#x2F;&quot;Intel Artuga Plus&quot;&#x2F;&quot;Intel Versuvia&quot;&#x2F;&quot;Intel Centurior Max&quot;&#x2F;&quot;Intel T-Xe&quot; that no one really understands but is basically some sort of mundane enterprise feature no one actually cares about that does something for remote wifi management<p>Quick - rush to the store to get a new laptop!!! I totally need an extra 100MHz single-core  maximum boost on a 4-core 2Ghz CPU (i.e. 5% max...) with Intel TruStep MagrittePro (TM) technology that does something to the colour gamut of my monitor in certain content creation scenarios.&lt;&#x2F;sarcasm&gt;<p>It strikes me that Intel have been caught napping and resting on their laurels. AMD appear to have come out with a great competitive product and Intel don&#x27;t seem to have anything to compete with it with because they&#x27;ve been milking the market for the past 5+ years with tiny incremental clock increases and nothing actually &quot;new&quot;.<p>They&#x27;ve allowed AMD to eat their lunch.<p>Maybe they&#x27;ve got a &quot;real&quot; new product they&#x27;ve been keeping in reserve that they&#x27;ll bring to market now and surprise everyone with. Maybe they&#x27;ll bring out something amazing next year.  Who knows. Maybe.  Maybe not. Seems like they&#x27;ve blown their lead for now regardless.')
