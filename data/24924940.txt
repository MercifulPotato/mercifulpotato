Item(by='kortilla', descendants=None, kids=[24925228], score=None, time=1603924542, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24924444, text='&gt; Society collapses and we become a failed state - but states fail all the time, universal suffrage appears to minimize the number of states that need to fail.<p>Curious claim. Has there been any research that shows states are less likely to fail with universal suffrage?<p>&gt; When it comes to voting for president, my vote as a Vermonter is objectively worth 2.63 times as much as my friend from Washington<p>See, that’s the confusion. You’re not voting for president directly. You’re voting for who you want your electoral college to vote for. In most states if you’re on the losing side of the vote in your state, your presidential vote literally means nothing.<p>Your individual vote in Vermont is not “worth more” than your friend’s vote in Washington because your both just voting in state level decisions about who the college should vote for.<p>The legitimate claim is about the number of delegates and (arguably much more important) the number of house representatives each state is getting.<p>Reiterated, there isn’t a lack of 1 person 1 vote equivalence in any elections I know of in the US (e.g. landowners don’t get extra votes). There are just elections people think are direct democracy when they are far from it.')
