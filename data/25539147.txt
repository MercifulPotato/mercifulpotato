Item(by='Alt-ThrowAway', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608931529, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25533178, text='I figured out a way to do this in Lightroom using the stacking feature. It&#x27;s not quite automatic as you need to run a command. Basically, there&#x27;s a stack-by-time-taken option in a drop down menu and you set a time difference that fits your bursts (which it will save as default for next run).<p>I use this to auto-stack iOS motion photos with the still version so I just see one item. I set it to auto-stack all media that has a capture time within two seconds of each other. This works for what I need. Sorry, I don&#x27;t recall the name of the specific menu item. Hopefully, my description is enough to get you in the ballpark (if you use LR).')
