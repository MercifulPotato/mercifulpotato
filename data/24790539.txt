Item(by='nxc18', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602779779, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24790364, text='I&#x27;m running Windows now after trying to switch my primary device to Ubuntu periodically for the last 5 years... I&#x27;ve been experimenting with Ubuntu since 2007 and none of my devices have been able to run it well. If you&#x27;ve got a basic setup or don&#x27;t want a graphical environment, things are fine, but I think I tend to push the limit a bit too much<p>In my case I also need KVM etc. On Windows I just use Hyper-V when I need a VM (many years ago I&#x27;d use Virtual PC). Hyper-V has never rendered my device unusable, even when pushing the limits with things like GPU pass through. I think my 2018 attempt failed when trying to update Ubuntu kernel after setting up KVM for a Windows VM; I had restarted between getting KVM set up and doing the Ubuntu update.<p>I haven&#x27;t documented anything - I wanted to but I never really found the solutions I was looking for. I&#x27;m not making this up; I&#x27;d really love to be typing this from Ubuntu right now.<p>edit: I reviewed and made changes for a more constructive tone.')
