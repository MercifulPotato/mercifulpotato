My idea, that I dubbed &quot;The Mesh&quot; basically has each person&#x27;s profile data as a blob &quot;somewhere&quot; on the internet.  The person&#x27;s profile would have different tiers for the type of data - personal, professional, etc.  Inviting someone to communicate or collaborate with would be a transfer of keys that would allow you to access a particular tier.  The user would then use a web browser client or native app to access&#x2F;update their own profile data, communicate with other profiles they have keys for, upload their own profile data, etc...<p>Clearly, though, taking control over their own data, and not allowing a FB or similar to own it would require an investment on that person&#x27;s part.  Either hosting their own data or finding an online host they could use would require $$$.')
