The pupils refused to believe what he told them and would go to the teashop to find out for themselves.<p>Whenever the woman saw them coming she could tell at once whether they had come for tea or to look into her grasp of Zen. In the former case, she would server them graciously. In the latter, she would beckon to the pupils to come behind her screen. The instant they obeyed, she would strike them with a fire-poker.<p>Nine out of ten of them could not escape her beating.&quot;<p>If a big part of the nominations is obviously politically motivated, should the others get the tea or the poker?')
