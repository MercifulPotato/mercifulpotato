If you&#x27;ve got a lot of data, and you&#x27;re doing transforms, you usually don&#x27;t need to branch, so being able to crunch everything through in parallel is a massive benefit.<p>Also agree that additional hard logic or peripherals will be a game-changer for FPGAs, though they would make each design more domain-specific. Alternatively, we may see a shift in how the interconnects are done, which allows for flexible use of these &#x27;modules&#x27;. It&#x27;s also possible that we&#x27;ll see continual increases in LE counts which make more specialized hardware unnecessary. I don&#x27;t know which way things will go.')
