Those things cost well over $10,000 apiece, and over $4 per round to fire. No expert, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s how you take on an army.<p>I wish the article had focused more on the overall arms trafficking problem (which is about lots of cheap guns, not a few expensive ones) and the overall government instability problem, and (what the hell) the war on drugs that fuels it. Instead, it has a bunch of pictures of scary looking guns, and feels sensationalized and focused on the wrong thing entirely.')
