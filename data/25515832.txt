But the elevation profile of a track is important of course. Many applications do include elevation data in route analysis.<p>For tracks with steepness up to 30Â°, the straight line distance will be off by max 15%. If it&#x27;s steeper then that, the actual terrain is the thing that determines how fast you can move.')
