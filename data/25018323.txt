The image seen by the viewer has to be constructed by the microscope; is the artwork truly the sculpture?<p>Also, maybe someone can tell me: does the electron microscope bombarding its subject degrade its materials or deform them in any way? Does looking at these sculptures contribute to unmaking them?')
