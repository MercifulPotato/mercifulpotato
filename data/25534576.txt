All it does it make it so central governments can more easily censor their controlled tld. If DNSSEC had been rolled out in Libya back in 2010 I doubt the Libyan Revolution would&#x27;ve happened.<p>TLA cert authorities are bad enough. MTA-STS is would make running your own mailsever harder and leash you to one of a dozen cert authorities. If you don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a problem then remember what happened to dot org, and think what <i>will</i> happen to these cert authorities given enough money and time.<p>I&#x27;ve run my own mailserver for a decade now and I am strongly against everything you suggest. But it doesn&#x27;t matter what I care about. If everyone uses only one of a handful of email providers then they&#x27;ll just slowly close off their walled gardens anyway. It&#x27;s already happening no matter how many superfluous cargo-cult standards independent mailserver operators implement.')
