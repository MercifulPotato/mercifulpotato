Farming of honey bees has put other wild bee species into decline, and they make up a significant portion of pollinators of flowers bees don&#x27;t go for. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a huge deal and i&#x27;d rather more of them than no bees at all, but it&#x27;s worth looking into because ecological diversity and natural ecosystems are very important.')
