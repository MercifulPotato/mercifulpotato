Some reporter is surprised that mining produces waste and writes about it like one small lake is poisoning the planet.  Yes it could probably be done better with better environmental standards but waste is waste and setting aside small areas of the planet for it isn’t equivalent to some global catastrophe.<p>So many people seem to be living in this bubble where the only thing they experience is the clean interfaces to civilization and then they talk about the messy bits like the slightest blemish is doom.<p>A dispassionate analysis of the site might have painted a more convincing argument for something being wrong, but as it is, it reads like a melodramatic fainting after seeing some trash.<p>There are plenty of very real environmental issues, but if you sensationalize everything that isn’t pristine natural beauty, it doesn’t matter because your motivations have moved from reason to superstition.')
