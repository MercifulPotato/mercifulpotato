Lock down for a month or two, give everyone more than enough money to cover rent&#x2F;food&#x2F;utilities and some entertainment (to keep from going insane), and greatly reduce the spread of this virus. But here we are in the US with a paltry $600 coming after the entire duration of this stupid, stupid pandemic.<p>As to &quot;defunding police&quot;, I like to rephrase it as &quot;fund people, not police&quot; - use those budgets to give people help <i>before</i> they get to the point where the police get involved, rather than having next to no safety net and a bunch of cops itching to use all the military hardware they&#x27;ve got.<p>There you go, some coherence. Have a nice day.')
