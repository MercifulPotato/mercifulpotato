I said before that it&#x27;s motte and bailey with this guy, and that&#x27;s reflected in his defenders.<p>Motte: is just historical accuracy how can you object to that? That&#x27;s a good, positive thing<p>Bailey: GRRM is causing harm with his lying, demeaning, historical inaccuracy<p>Let&#x27;s just have the historical accuracy alone, shall we?<p><i>Or</i> a demonstration that GRRM is causing harm.
