Not sure if they&#x27;re going to be available for civilian use, or if there&#x27;s going to be an all wheel drive option, though.<p>IMO there are very few situations where a van isn&#x27;t superior to a pickup truck, and I don&#x27;t understand the continued popularity of trucks versus vans in the US. About the only advantages of pickups are for bulk materials (e.g. soil&#x2F;gravel), messy materials (e.g. straw bales) and really tall things that need to stay upright (e.g. refrigerators), and of course towing certain extremely large trailers.')
