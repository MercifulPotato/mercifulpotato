Perhaps I&#x27;m reading too much into this, but as a  major holder of the company it seems it would be in my interest to encourage my management in doing what ever they deem necessary to come on top, even if it means breaking the law, as the &quot;spoils&quot; in the end will justify the fine. This reminded me of the VW case where management involved in illegal activates surrounding emission test fraud, prepared funds to pay the fine in advance.')
