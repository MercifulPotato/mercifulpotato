They would then delete the emails that were sent and the account owner was none the wiser.<p>I am not 100% certain as to how the initial compromise happened, but it was an O365 environment and MFA was on. O365 did pick it up and send an alert, but  due to a configuration error it did not disable the account.<p>Anyways, it worked out and we transitioned to M365 as well.')
