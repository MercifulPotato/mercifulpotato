Wealth disparity gap is one of the widest compared to other demographics.<p>Basing your model on stereotypes and statistics is exactly why we have the issues I spoke about earlier.<p>&gt; If you’re confused about any of this, your model is broken. All you need to know is that East Asians are high IQ (within 0.3stddev of anglo or Germanic whites). This predicts everything else, including economic outcomes.<p>wait wait wait. So you think IQ and race are correlated. So Africans are poor because they have low IQ is what you are saying.<p>&gt; Slurs against Asians are less offensive because the connotation of being Asian is bad.<p>wow. I can&#x27;t believe I just read this on HN. &quot;Its okay to be a little racist to Asians because nobody thinks its offensive&quot;. Who are you?<p>Sounds like you have a really skewed view of Asians (who are we even talking about? East Asians? South Asians? South East Asians?<p>&gt; Slurs like “kraut” or “nip” don’t really have any weight because they’re basically complements.<p>WTF??? Who are you to gatekeep what is offensive and what isnt&#x27;?<p>I just read you trying to justify racism against Asians. HN has truly fallen far from grace.')
