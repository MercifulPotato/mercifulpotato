Anthropomorphic language is such a useful and normal way of thinking and expressing ourselves.<p>If you say &quot;the classifier thinks this roadsign is a truck&quot; everyone knows you mean &quot;the classifier has labeled this roadsign as a probably a truck with a high confidence&quot;. No-one seriously would take you to mean the classifier <i>thinks</i> in the same way a person thinks any more than if you say &quot;The toaster wants to pop up but it&#x27;s jammed,&quot; they would take you to mean the toaster has a yearning like unrequited love.<p>If we remove our ability to use language in this way we give up on a mental model that is incredibly useful for simplifying lots of explanations and reduce ourselves to a very clumsy literalism instead. As long as we understand the limitations of this model and are clear that it&#x27;s not literally what is going on it&#x27;s very useful.')
