I literally think a pedestrian is entitled to the road whenever they damn well please. (Within reason, to genuinely cross it reasonably quickly, don&#x27;t step out without giving cars at a reasonable speed enough time to stop, excluding purpose-built major roads.)<p>Look at it from the other angle.<p>Why should cars be entitled to the road whenever they damn well please?<p>Why should the pedestrian stop for the car, instead of the car stopping for the pedestrian?<p>Why is your default mental model that the car owns the road?')
