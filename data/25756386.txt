Since i3 is based on wmii, Sway might be your best bet.<p>Regarding programmability, I&#x27;m not sure exactly how similar Sway is to i3, but you can get quite far in scripting configuration using the included i3-msg[2] executable. i3 keeps a socket open where you can send it commands or query its state. So, you can use it to &quot;program&quot;&#x2F;&quot;extend&quot; i3 from any language by calling i3-msg.[3] This doesn&#x27;t go as far as what you can achieve with a live programming environment like the Lisp WMs you mentioned, but it&#x27;s something.<p>The manpage says you can also subscribe to events to listen to them, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to mention what events these are.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swaywm.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swaywm.org&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mankier.com&#x2F;1&#x2F;i3-msg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mankier.com&#x2F;1&#x2F;i3-msg</a><p>[3] As an example, a little configuration I&#x27;ve done is adding a command (called via keybinding) that moves back and forth the floating windows of the current workspace to a new workspace that&#x27;s named based on the current workspace. In other words, it&#x27;s a keybinding that shows or hides the floating windows of a given workspace without mixing the floating windows between the different workspaces. I use i3-msg to query the name of the current workspace, to check if there are floating windows in the workspace, and to send the command to send these windows to or from the alternate workspace corresponding to the current one.')
