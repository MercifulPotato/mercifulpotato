Developing for the web is, therefore, necessarily complex, because you&#x27;re trying to hammer a square peg into a round hole.<p>All I really want from the web is to READ documentation, look at cats and Youtube and do a bit of banking. HTML already caters for the first two categories. Why do we need stylesheets? HTML is a Markup Language. Just let the browser render the markup.<p>Why does my browser need to download fonts? I already have fonts. Just use those!<p>Computer folks can&#x27;t leave well enough alone. We stuffed our web pages full of punch-a-monkeys (remember that egregious piece of garbage?) and Javascript. We put too much Javascript in, so now we&#x27;re looking to &quot;assemble&quot; it.<p>Just get rid of it. Maybe a sprinkling - a SPRINKLING - of JS might help on some - SOME - sites.
