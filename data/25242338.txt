Additionally no matter how well I do when coding at home or at work I have never passed a code interview. I knew it was going to be a problem with my interview for amazon, the truth is I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, I was fully expecting to fail. I did so spectacularly. I don&#x27;t understand why its necessary to do these stupid test, I have some serious accomplishments under my belt and I know I&#x27;m a real solid developer but these coding tests are fucking stupid, menial, and don&#x27;t accurately depict my abilities. For example the position I was looking for was with the Identity product. I thought I would be a shew in. I have written OIDC and SAML providers from scratch by only observing how existing ones work via http calls. I thought that&#x27;s got to be a unique skillset, I bet they&#x27;ll give a test that fits in my wheel house. But the fucking question was about 3d geometry. What the fuck do I know about 3d geometry? I imploded, I couldn&#x27;t think, I panicked, I failed. Fuck em.')
