An auto mechanic has specialized skills, in that a general person on the street can&#x27;t do that job. Auto mechanics aren&#x27;t rare.<p>Also, the proportion of the total population that&#x27;s capable of getting a job at FB is quite small. <i>Within</i> FB the people are largely interchangeable, precisely because of that high hiring bar. Everyone who&#x27;s hired is smart, so they can all do everything (in theory).')
