Hell, my grandfather was an Auschwitz survivor, and his entire immediate family was murdered by Nazis.<p>I think Trump is a terrible, terrible President, causing a tonne of damage to America, but he’s not exactly Hitler, more of a poor man’s Putin. I’m all for having political conversations, even reasonably frequent ones, but barring a legitimate Hitler situation, I don’t want it to be the ONLY thing I talk about. There’s a lot more to life. Some members of my friends&#x2F;family can talk about nothing else anymore, it’s nonstop outrage, and they completely ignore all social queues from people who want to change the subject.
