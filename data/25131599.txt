The US spends more on its military per capita than just about any other country, save for Israel. The F-35 has been one of the US military&#x27;s more noteworthy embarrassments, chronically behind schedule and over budget.<p>The US Military runs the VA, and that&#x27;s also been a noteworthy embarrassment -&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;05&#x2F;28&#x2F;va-veterans-affairs-history-setbacks-missteps.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;05&#x2F;28&#x2F;va-veterans-affairs-history-...</a><p>Outside of raw warfare, the military runs almost entirely on cost-plus, which results in over-spending of contract money for boondoggles that just entrench the military industrial complex.<p>Outside of the US military, you have systematic inefficiencies like this across most major agencies.<p>NASA&#x27;s planned SLS moon mission is a bit of a disaster — way over budget and way behind schedule. Because the boosters aren&#x27;t reusable, each launch is expected to cost $1B (with a B) dollars — EACH launch! Meanwhile SpaceX&#x27;s target cost-per-launch is $50M.<p>In healthcare, Medicare has actually been running a fairly interesting A&#x2F;B test. When you turn 65, you have the option to enroll either in &quot;Original Medicare&quot;, which is what we usually think of when we talk about &quot;single payer healthcare in America&quot;, or you can enroll in Medicare Advantage (aka Medicare &quot;Part C&quot;), where the premiums that would go to the CMS instead go to private insurers like Humana, United, Oscar Health, Clover, etc. These plans replace Original Medicare, also cover Part D prescription drug benefits, and often include supplemental benefits that Original Medicare doesn&#x27;t already cover. The outcomes are fairly interesting:<p>- 36% of Medicare beneficiaries are on private Medicare Advantage plans instead of the public &quot;Original Medicare&quot;. Because everyone is entitled to &quot;Original Medicare&quot;, this is purely voluntary. This number has been growing so rapidly, that we expect by 2025, more seniors to be on a private plan than the public one. There&#x27;s also great variance by State. In Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Alabama, Hawaii, and Connecticut — over 40% of beneficiaries are on Medicare Advantage. By 2022, we expect more seniors in those States to be on a private plan than a public one. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kff.org&#x2F;medicare&#x2F;issue-brief&#x2F;a-dozen-facts-about-medicare-advantage-in-2020&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kff.org&#x2F;medicare&#x2F;issue-brief&#x2F;a-dozen-facts-about...</a><p>- For most beneficiaries, Medicare Advantage costs about 39% less than Original Medicare. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;healthpayerintelligence.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;medicare-advantage-costs-40-less-than-fee-for-service-medicare" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;healthpayerintelligence.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;medicare-advantage-...</a><p>- Medicare Advantage plans are, on average, of higher quality than the public &quot;Original Medicare&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;healthpayerintelligence.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;medicare-advantage-enrollment-quality-continue-upward-trend" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;healthpayerintelligence.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;medicare-advantage-...</a><p>- In Urban areas, Medicare Advantage costs less per capita to administer than Medicare — and that&#x27;s not including the extra Medicare Part D insurance that you would have to buy if you&#x27;re on the Original Medicare plan. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.commonwealthfund.org&#x2F;publications&#x2F;issue-briefs&#x2F;2016&#x2F;jan&#x2F;does-medicare-advantage-cost-less-traditional-medicare" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.commonwealthfund.org&#x2F;publications&#x2F;issue-briefs&#x2F;2...</a> From this same research, public &quot;Original Medicare&quot; is still cheaper in rural areas, but not by a whole lot.<p>So yeah, while the governments of a lot of countries are fairly robust and efficient, I think that suspicion is warranted, especially in the US.')
