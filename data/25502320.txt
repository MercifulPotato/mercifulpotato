Apple is a merchant of “good will”[1]. It does this by creating then selling long term trust. In the words of Steve Jobs and Tim Cook, “we build products because we love them” and “we build products we would recommend to our friends and family”.<p>Today Apple has the luxury to be exclusive. When they didn’t, they released iTunes and Safari on Windows. Today they are even becoming a “health company”. Don’t be surprised when Apple starts to create implants and prosthetics.<p>All this to say, Apple will do whatever they want as long as it has product market fit and they can be proud of having built it.<p>[1] good will - as it is defined by capitalism and consumerism, not in an ethical sense. Including pretending&#x2F;trying to be ethical when it aligns with capitalistic “good will”.')
