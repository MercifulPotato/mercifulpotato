People are supposed to elect national leaders on the basis of sound-bytes, controlled scenarios, ridiculous &#x27;gotcha debates&#x27;?<p>I really don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find a longer format out there for anyone. It literally takes time to get to know people and the open, conversational format, particularly the length is really helpful. On cable news you get 1 minute if you&#x27;re lucky, a longer, hurried interview if you&#x27;re famous.<p>Many of the &#x27;issues du jour&#x27; require some explanation - every unfortunate interaction between police and some assailant that&#x27;s on the national news has nuance, certainly many of the more theoretical issues have nuance. And public figures, speakers are very often misinterpreted, misquoted.<p>Not only is there enough time on the format, people are tuning in.<p>Though you&#x27;re right to point out Joe is not doing regular journalism by asking the tough questions - he is doing something else, which asking &#x27;un PC&#x27; questions which would never get asked in highly politicized or sensitive information systems.<p>If there is &#x27;editorial bias&#x27; on the part of Joe, it&#x27;s easily circumvented by the guests who have <i>time to answer the questions</i>. Contrast this with most broadcast outlets who design the questions, don&#x27;t give time to respond, heavily edit the question&#x2F;response, and shave it down to tiny digestible formats.<p>Joe Rogan&#x27;s mere existence is really counter intuitive - if major press outlets were doing their jobs well I don&#x27;t think he would exist. He&#x27;s found a credible, if not perfect niche.')
