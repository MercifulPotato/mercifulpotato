In my experience (10 years), it&#x27;s almost never the case.<p>1. Bloated and useless functionalities. More functionalities will make any software more complex. If these functionalities are not well thought or lack logic, it&#x27;s more difficult to implement.<p>2. Believes versus empiric proof. The big difference we have with other engineering field: we deal with believes. The building of a plane rely heavily on the laws of physics, we rely on the law of SOLID. The first is a scientific discipline, the second is a guy talking on a stage.<p>3. Ego-centered field. We all think we know better. We all think we have the truth (&quot;Microservices are better!&quot;, &quot;OOP is the best!&quot;) even if we have no idea about it.<p>This article is full of believes without any study to back it up, with a cool looking curve which doesn&#x27;t  measure anything. The hero expert programmer who will save us all is a myth. We all struggle, we all make mistake, and we build things together. The group synergy is more important (see rework from Google).')
