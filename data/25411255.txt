To be safe at night or in rain or in Italian backstreets or Mumbai rush hour seems behind reach.<p>So we can use infrastructure to reduce the need for better AI.  But that gets expensive.  We can probably avoid building a second road network -  but we need compromises.<p>Separated bike lanes will help this - those great wide Dutch streets with pedestrian bike car and the  tram lanes come to mind - main roads where the central lanes are for automated use only.<p>The cost will be enormous (and blows most business models out the water) but we may win elsewhere - reclaiming some of the streets back as living areas, migrating deliveries off trucks and into smaller slower delivery vehicles designed to trundle down thinner streets.<p>Either way i look forward to a future of slower vehicles a d bike paths')
