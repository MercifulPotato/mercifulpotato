The vast majority of people using computers has shifted to phones and tablets. I have a friend who&#x27;s a millenial who barely knows how to use his desktop PC (It&#x27;s a Mac) but is fluent on his iPad&#x2F;iPhone.<p>Most people are not content creators, they are consumers. The people who are still building their own PC&#x27;s are mostly enthusiasts. There&#x27;s no profit in building custom PC&#x27;s anymore, so local computer shops aren&#x27;t selling them (And if they are, it&#x27;s at a hefty premium).<p>The author of the article calls the 1980&#x27;s the &quot;Golden era&quot; of personal computing. I disagree. Networked computing is an amazing thing, but it&#x27;s also been monetized and now the consumers are the product being sold. And happily so. The outliers are those who buy pre-2012 computers so they can skip UEFI and are happy to live under their rocks to do it. That&#x27;s okay with me.<p>Personally I need a faster computer than that, so I&#x27;m stuck with UEFI and because W10 is the right OS for my needs, I&#x27;m stuck with it phoning home. This doesn&#x27;t mean the golden age was in the 80&#x27;s or 90&#x27;s. It means that by the time we figured out how to make computing awesome, we also figured out how to make computing itself profitable, not just the computers. The golden age the could have been, never was.')
