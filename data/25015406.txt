If you do GraphQL the right way you&#x27;ll always use persisted Queries.<p>But that&#x27;s not using GraphQL &quot;the right way&quot;, is it?<p>I mean, GraphQL&#x27;s value proposition is quite literally letting front-end developers run all sorts of ad-hoc queries without having to bother about indexes, and only care about the data you wish to extract.<p>If all you want is to run fixed queries then you&#x27;re already better off putting up a REST API.')
