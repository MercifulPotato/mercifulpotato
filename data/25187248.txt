It is absurd that a business is allowed to pay less than minimum wage because they &quot;make it up in tips&quot;. Also annoys me because I am never clear who I am punishing&#x2F;rewarding with my tips.<p>I can&#x27;t think of a good way to undo tipping culture though. Best thought I have had is to have something like a 60% tax rate on tips. So you can tip, but you should know that 3&#x2F;5 of it is just going to the Feds. Might disincentivize tipping to the point that it dies out. Other obvious thing is to remove the ability for anyone to be paying less than minimum wage; that is absurd.')
