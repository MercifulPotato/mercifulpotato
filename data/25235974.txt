I don’t mean this derogatorily, but rather that said people do not think about the nature of their reality any broader or deeper than the framework of thought imprinted on them by their culture, their religion, and their parents.<p>I am with you on this approach, fully. I’ve thought about it a lot over the last decade in particular. I find it odd that someone would insinuate it somehow lessens our humanity. Is it more humane to keep animals (like pigs) with provable consciousness, intelligence and feelings within the horrible meat farms we do today? Apparently that’s “humane” because it’s a necessity. How narrow minded is that?<p>I’m continuing to slowly introduce this idea to people via different angles — ethical meat is a great one. Thanks for sharing and giving me hope by showing there are more out there with a broader mindset.')
