Item(by='nobody9999', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602469676, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24750157, text='I completely agree.<p>In fact, it&#x27;s useful to consider that many, if not most people do the job that they do not because they enjoy it or find it fulfilling, but because if they don&#x27;t, they and&#x2F;or their family will starve in the street.<p>If you have a job&#x2F;career that&#x27;s intellectually stimulating and personally satisfying, you <i>already</i> have it <i>much</i> better than a whole lot of other people.<p>And if that&#x27;s the case for you, celebrate that!<p>While it may seem like if you aren&#x27;t spending every waking moment focused on being able to write the most beautiful or performant code, or trying to found the next unicorn, that you&#x27;re wasting your life.<p>And depending on who you are, that may be enough.<p>But I guarantee you, that when you&#x27;re lying on your deathbed, you won&#x27;t be thinking about how many patches you submitted to open source projects, how optimized your code is, or how numerous and helpful your StackExchange posts were.<p>It might surprise you to know that a very large number of people&#x27;s primary interests&#x2F;focus have absolutely nothing to do with how they support themselves.<p>In fact, there&#x27;s a whole big world out there that has absolutely nothing to do with technology.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to tell anyone what they should or shouldn&#x27;t do, but as someone whose identity was strongly tied to my career for <i>decades</i>, while it was certainly worth it in many respects, my world could have been much richer and fuller if I&#x27;d taken the time to metaphorically stop and smell the roses.<p>So if you feel like you need to be &quot;always on&quot; and permanently focused on the next professional challenge&#x2F;opportunity, maybe you could step back <i>once in a while</i> and consider not just what&#x27;s good for you professionally, or will make you more competitive in the marketplace, but what gives you joy as a person.<p>For a lot of us, that&#x27;s building technology.  And that&#x27;s a <i>good</i> thing.<p>But technology isn&#x27;t the entire universe, and if you limit your focus and interests really narrowly, you&#x27;re going to miss out on the beauty and the worthy challenges in the wider world.<p>Even more, having those non-work related interests&#x2F;experiences can, give one a broader perspective on your professional life that makes you better and more useful&#x2F;productive&#x2F;engaged in your professional life.<p>I suggest taking Bill Shatner&#x27;s advice[0] as a metaphor.  Or don&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s your life and that&#x27;s (as it&#x27;s always been) up to you.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dailymotion.com&#x2F;video&#x2F;xmagzq" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dailymotion.com&#x2F;video&#x2F;xmagzq</a>')
