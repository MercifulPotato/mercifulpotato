They have better airflow, and are much quieter.  They also exhaust upwards, which I guessed might be less likely to disrupt a whole lot of dust-at-rest at once.<p>A problem now is not so much that the consumable filter cartridges are expensive, which I could live with if they are motivated to be high-quality, but that counterfeits are inevitable.  A related problem is that I don&#x27;t have a great way to measure filter effectiveness, whether I&#x27;m buying high-quality genuine, third-party, counterfeit, or genuine facing pressure from counterfeits and seeing less value in remaining high-quality.')
