You can&#x27;t post like this to HN, regardless of how wrong someone else is or you feel they are. Being right doesn&#x27;t make it ok to take this community further into hellflames.<p>Moreover, we&#x27;ve had to warn you about this before: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21162256" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21162256</a>. I&#x27;m currently banning so many accounts that have built up track records of abusing HN that it would be easiest to just add one more.<p>However, I looked at your commenting history and it&#x27;s mostly quite good, so instead I&#x27;m going to put this down as an episode of going on tilt under pressure (it happens to all of us) and just ask you to please review <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a> and not sink to this kind of the thing in the future.')
