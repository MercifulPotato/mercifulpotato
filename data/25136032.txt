To me it comes across as selfish, he only wants people to use acronyms that he personally knows, even when they&#x27;re not talking to him.<p>I&#x27;m curious what makes you attribute that selfish motivation to him?  I thought he was pretty clear in saying that it&#x27;s particularly tough for new employees:<p>&quot;Individually, a few acronyms here and there may not seem so bad, but if a thousand people are making these up, over time the result will be a huge glossary that we have to issue to new employees. No one can actually remember all these acronyms and people don&#x27;t want to seem dumb in a meeting, so they just sit there in ignorance. This is particularly tough on new employees.&quot;')
