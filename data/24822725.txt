This year I came across a funny British show called &quot;Escape to the Chateau&quot; [1]. The couple there paid &lt;400K GBP for a 45 room chateau. At one point they&#x27;re not sure if they need a new roof. If they do? That&#x27;d cost ~250K GBP.<p>But one interesting thing they mentioned was that in France, heritage of old buildings like these is opt-in. If you choose to opt-in the French government will pay you but you then need to abide by all sorts of standards.<p>This is in stark contrast with, say, English Heritage where they can decide at some point that your building is now listed, you get paid nothing and any alternations or renovations need to be approved (for maintaining the character).<p>If that&#x27;s true about France, I prefer the sound of that system. There are literally thousands of castle&#x2F;chateuas in France. Is it really justifiable to preserve all of them? Especially given that many are falling into disrepair and many of these buildings are already falling into disrepair through lack of demand for buyers.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Escape_to_the_Chateau" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Escape_to_the_Chateau</a>')
