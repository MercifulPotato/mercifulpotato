People usually say that fiduciary duty creates and even enforces thoughtless short-term greed, and argue that is bad for society and also the company in the long run.  Regardless of what fiduciary actually is in reality, how is then LVT any different from creating the same short-term enforced greed?<p>The rest of your text can be summarized as “whoever has money deserves to have it, and should be trusted to make decisions which override any community which, in aggregate, have less money”.  I believe this to be a somewhat controversial stance.')
