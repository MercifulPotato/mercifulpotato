And my identity became tightly coupled to my work and each little win felt good for a day or two, then felt empty pretty quickly after that.  When I let all that go and found a stronger sense of self worth, I found much more career success than I ever had before without really trying so hard for it. It came more naturally. Therapy helped me with this journey.')
