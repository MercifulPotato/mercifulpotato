Your suggestions included rubber boot or keeping one hand behind your back, which are what a grandpa would tell you as precautions when working on a potential live circuit. And my suggestion to double check whether a circuit is really dead before working under such a &quot;deadly&quot; assumption is arguably more important.<p>&gt; <i>Personally, I take a radically different approach to household wiring: hire folks who know better than gramps.</i><p>I never suggested otherwise. In a qualified household wiring, all switches are correctly wired, thus turning off a light switch and touching an exposed wire is as safe as turning off the breaker. And there won&#x27;t be hidden junctions in the walls waiting to be burned up. And a single earth leakage doesn&#x27;t kill the power of an entire home... - these properties are what you definitely want.<p>My point is not to assume anything while working on an existing system. I test live voltage even before I replace a lightbulb - you don&#x27;t have to mess up the entire wiring of your house, a single miswired light socket can be just as dangerous. Fortunately, so far I&#x27;ve never encountered a single case where the light socket is live after opening the light switch, nor a single case where the metal thread of the light socket is live, which gives me confidence that the wiring at my home was probably in compliance. I simply don&#x27;t assume.')
