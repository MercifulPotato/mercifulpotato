Ubuntu (or any Debian-based distro) destroy my battery in 40 minutes and there&#x27;s no solution or optimization for that.<p>I know this is not a solution, but the Librem laptops from Purism hold up for hours straight. I also used to run Windows on laptops for the same reason, but the obvious solution to this is to buy a laptop built with Linux in mind from the ground up, and now we have options available.')
