The French police is less dangerous than the US one, but they&#x27;re still dangerous, even for those that committed no crime, and and not only for minorities. A (white) delivery driver was recently strangled to death by police officers in Paris in broad daylight, despite repeatedly telling them he could not breath. No administrative penalty was applied, though an inquiry has started due to the large popular outcry.<p>In a broader perspective, the worst terrorist attack in French history was in Paris in autumn... not 2015 but 1961. The French police wanted to terrify the Algerian people (which had French citizenship at that time). Police killed 150-200 unarmed people in a single night. The man in charge (M. Papon), like many other members of the police, had played an important role in the deportation of Jews during WWII.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paris_massacre_of_1961" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paris_massacre_of_1961</a><p>There was a recent commotion when French policemen could be heard joking about this event, especially about &quot;drowning the Algerians&quot;. Some sociological studies prove that the racist terms dating from the Algeria war are still pervasive in the French police more than 60 years after the war.')
