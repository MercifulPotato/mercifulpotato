Considering the amounts I drank, I assume the caffeine content was not much different to the one of an average coffee person.<p>On 1st September 2020 I stopped entirely. The only issue I still face is that my focus is not where it should be. I hope that still changes but it may also be related to the fact that I haven&#x27;t socialized for almost a year.')
