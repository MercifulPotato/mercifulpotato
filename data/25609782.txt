I think that all of the hard problems with computers will continue to be hard problems until some groundbreaking new computing is discovered (quantum?). All of these technologies are mere transformations with the same hard problems with computing still present underneath.<p>A lot of these are also fads that will pass. Are there any problems today that were unsolvable in 1980 given enough time?<p>Wow, smaller transistors, more clock cycles, big whoop. We have more now but it&#x27;s not fundamentally different is it?<p>&gt;If an engineer in 1996 fell into a coma and woke up today, they&#x27;d be greeted with an entirely different world.<p>I&#x27;d also be disappointed. Oh we are on DDR4, Windows 10, multiple cores, cpp 20? Ok. So we basically just extended the trendline 25 years. Boring.')
