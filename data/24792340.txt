It&#x27;s just a much better bookmarking app than what&#x27;s come before.<p>It really comes down to UX. The browser integration is fantastic, and there&#x27;s a really smooth native-feel Electron app that has an integrated browser.<p>One of my favourite uses is creating a temporary &quot;project-oriented&quot; collection. For example, let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m researching places to travel. I can create a collection about this, bookmark things (destinations, discussion threads, Wikipedia entries, etc.) as I go along, and then use the built-in browser to go back and forth between each bookmark as I make notes or whatever. Normally you&#x27;d use browser tabs for this, except the Raindrop way means I&#x27;m not consuming lots of browser resources, and the collection stays persistent even if I close it.<p>The same workflow works for tech projects I work on (where I may want some documentation, papers, etc. &quot;scrapbooked&quot; in a temporary place), and many other things.<p>Safari is the only browser (that I know) that has a similar kind of bookmark-oriented browsing functionality, and it&#x27;s just not very good.<p>Overall it&#x27;s much nicer than the older services such as Delicious and Pinboard, not to mention the atrocious built-in bookmarking features in modern browsers, which have been ossifying since around 1998.')
