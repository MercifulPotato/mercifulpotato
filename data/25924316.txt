So, try flipping each bit, and see if any <i>one</i> of them results in a very large improvement. If there are no matches, try every combination of exactly two bits, then every combination of three, and so on.<p>Would that result in blurring? Perhaps the example shown in the article (where each individual bit flip resulted in major, obviously abnormal changes) was atypical?')
