Just look at conventional media: A small group judges something or someone newsworthy, and then the other outlets repeat it. Or, look at the old email chains that were popular before social media.<p>But, more importantly, people like to spread what they want to believe, even if it&#x27;s not true. Trump really played into that: He started by promoting the birther theory, which people who didn&#x27;t like Obama chose to believe. Finally, he promoted the theory that there was widespread election fraud, even though it was thoroughly disproven. Again, people chose to believe Trump&#x27;s lie even though it was thoroughly disproven.<p>IMO, we need to strengthen our slander laws, and have a higher &quot;burden of truth&quot; on our media companies. Specifically, if a media company covers provenly false information in a way that implies it is, or could be, true, that media company needs to be prosecuted for slander, or worse.<p>But, more importantly, we need to prosecute elected officials who contradict fact; and ban candidates who brazenly contradict established fact.')
