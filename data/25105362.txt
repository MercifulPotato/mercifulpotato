Tesla gets a reasonable range due to squeezing everything to the limit. Getting the same range out of a minivan-sized vehicle without tripling the cost of batteries would be rather tricky.<p>Also when you travel with kids, you make longer breaks when the kids need them. In that case, picking a random gas station nearby filling the gas while my wife runs everybody through the toilet and distributes snacks, makes things easier. Doing it exactly on schedule with a forced 30-minute wait in a fixed location would be much trickier.')
