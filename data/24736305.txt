Apple takes a 30% cut<p>You have described a different objection, which is not &quot;bigger&quot;. It&#x27;s a different problem people have.<p>&gt;  they are forcing you not to inform the customer about alternatives<p>That is part of what&#x27;s going on but you&#x27;re missing the main issues. They are forcing an app owner to add a purchase that gives Apple revenue <i>if Apple can find ANY other way that the owner is offering to be paid for app features</i>. There was no advertisement or inform within the app at all. Also, you cannot inform the use about WHY the alternative exists (apple gets part of it).<p>That&#x27;s how it&#x27;s worse than even you think.<p>If Apple thinks people are paying for something, they force you to add something that is <i>preferred</i> that pays them. It&#x27;s extortion (via a protection racket, &quot;i heard you got an inheritance, be a real same if something happened to your app&quot;) or racketeering, depending on how broadly you want to define things.')
