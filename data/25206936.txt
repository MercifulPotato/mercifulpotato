Item(by='bloak', descendants=None, kids=[25220565], score=None, time=1606291484, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25206770, text='That&#x27;s a difficult question, but if a language changes rapidly then not everyone will keep up with the changes to the same extent and communication between those people will be compromised.<p>This also affects written communication. Most modern English speakers can&#x27;t understand Shakespeare properly. They could, if they put in hundreds of hours of study, but in practice they don&#x27;t. English hasn&#x27;t changed very much over the last 100 years, I&#x27;d claim, compared with many other languages, but it&#x27;s hard to measure that objectively. To start off with, what do I really mean by &quot;English&quot;? I suppose I mean the standard written language rather than colloquial forms...<p>One could perhaps also argue that a language that has changed a lot recently can&#x27;t have built up the vocabulary, connotations, and all the rest of the stuff that is required for high-quality, nuanced communication and is therefore likely to be a less precise means of communication even between people who are tracking the changes. But that&#x27;s speculative and I don&#x27;t know how you could measure it.<p>So, to conclude this waffle, I suspect it does make sense to talk about a language &quot;degenerating&quot;, but it&#x27;s very hard to be scientific about it.')
