In my experience this isn&#x27;t always the case and companies aren&#x27;t always willing to do so just to hire a remote talent. I personally know someone who was hired for a US based company in Berlin, and when he was laid off, he had to spend few thousand â‚¬s from his own pocket to take care of the legal stuff for closing the company.<p>I understand remote work is the future, but we can&#x27;t brush stuff under the carpet and say everything is hunky-dory.')
