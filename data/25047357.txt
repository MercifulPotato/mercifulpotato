Lot of hand waving and &quot;the engines are different so it must be dynamically unstable&quot; but no actual evidence, which is obvious because no independent engineer&#x2F;pilot is going to be able to effectively assess the upset aerodynamics of an airliner and come to a different conclusion than both the FAA and EASA about whether or not the aircraft is dynamically unstable.<p>He&#x27;s somewhat right on other details, but that doesn&#x27;t make his assessment of the aerodynamic issues correct.')
