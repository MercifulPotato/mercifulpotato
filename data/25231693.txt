Since the degree will be no different from one earned on campus it’s general not discernible from the degree alone. That being said, there’s still a level of stigma attached to online schooling vs on-campus from some people. When I asked around about people’s opinion on this sort of thing a while back I got mixed responses. I also imagine it depends on your field.
