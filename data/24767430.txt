Item(by='qsort', descendants=None, kids=[24769088], score=None, time=1602608366, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24767175, text='&gt; Your response on definitions actually supports my point on the matter<p>I&#x27;m afraid I failed to understand your point, then. I don&#x27;t have a problem with what you said there.<p>&gt; using the word &quot;intelligence&quot; is misleading. I do not, however, think this misuse has any serious consequences<p>This is where I fundamentally differ. Its misuse implies a connection between a formal model (algorithm expressed in a computational model) and a philosophical concept (intelligence) that&#x27;s dubious at best. On a conceptual level, this makes it harder to reason clearly about those fundamentally mathematical and abstract concepts, and on a concrete level, it misleads the public at large, implying that certain goals have been reached when that&#x27;s plainly untrue. That&#x27;s pretty &quot;serious&quot; in my book.<p>&gt; Then that is an unfortunate choice of proxy, unless, perhaps, you intended to imply that it is a priori impossible for intelligence to be created by running x86 machine code.<p>Again, I&#x27;m afraid I don&#x27;t understand your objection. It&#x27;s widely accepted that all reasonable computational models are equivalent. Citing x86 was colorful language, it has clearly no bearing on the point at large. Machine Learning algorithms are clearly computable, which means they are expressible as Turing machines, terms of a classical untyped lambda calculus, Python scripts, C++ template metaprograms, or anything else. They are <i>literally</i> just programs.<p>&gt; At least since Newton, mathematical models have proved very useful in discerning &quot;truths about the world.&quot; Are we to just assume they will not work for the biological phenomena of intelligence and consciousness?<p>I certainly believe mathematical models to be useful, you would be hard pressed to say otherwise.\nThe ontological status of scientific theories is however at the very least a debatable topic. One needs not believe Newtonian mechanics is ontologically true, it&#x27;s a tenable position to claim it&#x27;s just a model, and we accept that model because it&#x27;s useful.<p>Specifically, one could easily argue that Newtonian mechanics is <i>false</i>, because, for example, it fails to accurately predict Mercury&#x27;s orbit.<p>Similarly, one needs not believe ML is anything more than relatively simple math to find it useful.')
