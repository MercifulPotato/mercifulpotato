(Actually 2 chat bots)<p>The formula is this: 1) The 2 bots have a scripted conversation. 2) When a human tries to participate (read: interrupts) they have a conversation like &quot;Bot1: who is this guy? Do you know him? Bot2: NO&quot;. Then they happily continue their chat completely ignoring the human unless he types their username. Then it goes &quot;What do you want?&quot; and &quot;Could you please stop highlighting me&quot; etc')
