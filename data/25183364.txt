Now it seems like something more along the lines of issues that have some sort of “moral clarity.” Apart from moving the goalposts, politics is a process for getting different stakeholders to agree through debate and compromise. If there is no room for debate and compromise, you’re not talking about a political issue, but a moral crusade. And moral crusades are great, but they’re different from “politics.”<p>Also, what is the scope of what people can “reasonably disagree” about? You mention same-sex marriage, but that’s illegal in most countries, including Switzerland. Are people in Switzerland, and India, and every single Muslim country in the world, for the most part not “reasonable?” And even in countries where it is legal, laws on related issues like surrogacy or religious exemptions vary. I’m talking about very socially liberal countries like France and Germany, where surrogacy is banned.')
