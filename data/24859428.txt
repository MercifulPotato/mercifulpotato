To have a throughput of better than M&#x2F;T you need more time or more&#x2F;better processors (i.e., for large enough inputs the runtime isn&#x27;t actually O(1) ).<p>What I was pointing out is that digital implementations have this exact same property -- if the input is bounded in the sense that there are a maximum number of bits being fed into your digital computer then the maximum runtime is a constant equal to the maximum runtime for any of those finite inputs -- i.e., the runtime is O(1) for the inputs you&#x27;re actually able to provide (the exact same inputs you could provide to the photonic processor to achieve a constant-time Fourier transform). To scale up beyond that threshold you still need more time or more&#x2F;better processors.')
