Take a look at the front page of Reddit (logged out, default subs): Half of the content highlights stupidity of others: &#x2F;r&#x2F;IdiotsInCars shows the worst drivers from around the world, &#x2F;r&#x2F;insanepeoplefacebook shows the most bizarre clips from social media, &#x2F;r&#x2F;choosingbeggars highlights the dumbest negotiation attempts, &#x2F;r&#x2F;trashy and &#x2F;r&#x2F;iamatotalpieceofshit are selected stories of bad behavior, &#x2F;r&#x2F;whatcouldgowrong and &#x2F;r&#x2F;instantkarma are videos of people making bad decisions and suffering the consequences, &#x2F;r&#x2F;publicfreakout is videos of people fighting. Contributors hunt for the most egregious examples to post to Reddit in the hopes of getting upvotes.<p>Twitter isn&#x27;t much better: Topics spread on Twitter when they promote outrage or allow the reader to feel smugly superior to someone.<p>If you spend your days online consuming this content day in and day out, you&#x27;re going to become convinced that the world is &quot;stupid&quot; and getting stupider. In reality, you&#x27;re simply tapping into stupidity concentrators, getting bite-sized views of stupidity so you can react in astonishment and feel superior to stupid people doing stupid things.<p>I think COVID quarantine has worsened this, as people are getting even more of their worldview through social media feeds instead of actually interacting with people in the real world. If 90% of your insight into social interactions comes from clickbait social media sites selecting the most egregious stories and videos from around the world, of course you&#x27;re going to think &quot;stupidity is expanding&quot;. In reality, it&#x27;s a sign that you need to revaluate your sources of information and move to platforms and networks where people are talking about something other than other people&#x27;s stupidity.')
