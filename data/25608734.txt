It&#x27;s hard to get funding to study something where there isn&#x27;t a theoretically plausible mechanism for damage, and where the few experiments to &quot;double check&quot; found nothing, as expected.<p>Millimeter waves aren&#x27;t &quot;new&quot; either. The &quot;new&quot; part is using mm waves for <i>data</i>. For decades now there have been tons of applications for mm wave radiation, and often at <i>much</i> higher power levels. All sorts of satellite communications, radar, etc...<p>This isn&#x27;t a situation where some scientist discovers an entirely new mechanism as says &quot;wow, this funny radiation that makes things glow in the dark might have some practical application&quot;. Instead, it&#x27;s just a matter of VLSI digital radio circuitry finally reaching the point where we can utilise a very familiar part of the spectrum for high bandwidth data.<p>Most of the anti-5G commentary is by uneducated Facebook moms &quot;just asking questions&quot; and &quot;worried about their kids&quot;.<p>If you want to reduce your personal risk from mobile phones, don&#x27;t text and drive.')
