My big concern with OpenID was that, beyond it&#x27;s technical security, it was training users to enter very valuable credentials (like their Google account that they probably use for bank emails, etc.) all over the place for other services (like some random app that lets you use your Google account), where they don&#x27;t really know how to confirm that the credentials are going straight to Google.
