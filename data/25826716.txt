Arguably many of them shouldn&#x27;t even be patentable.<p>That means that yes, proprietary apps can look at your software and say, &quot;that&#x27;s cool, we should do that too.&quot; But it also means that people can write Open Source software that takes lessons from proprietary apps. We want software devs working on productivity tools and practical software to copy each other, we don&#x27;t want everyone to reinvent the wheel all the time.<p>I mean, heck, can you imagine if Finale came out with a new feature and that was just it, no other competitors or Open Source apps like MuseScore were allowed to offer that feature? Can you imagine trying to build a piece of software like Blender in that world, where Autodesk had a monopoly on &quot;things that a 3D editor can do?&quot;<p>Second, 9 years to clone a feature in the world of software is a really long time. If you can launch a piece of software and you have 9 years before other people start building similar things... I mean, what else do you even want at that point? If it takes 9 years for a dev to capitalize on a unique feature in their app, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the eventual imitators that are the problem.')
