Don&#x27;t forget that a lot of the killing was actually performed by policemen and fascist groups&#x2F;individuals AGAINST the protesters.<p>The attacked federal courthouse is also a nice contrast - despite weeks of trying, the protesters never made it inside the courthouse. The fascists trying fruiessly to overthrow the election last night however made it inside Congress while it was in session.<p>The Russia conspiracy theory was a massive red herring, but it also didn&#x27;t succeed in motivating people to try to overturn the election. Hillary Clinton conceded her election immediately following the result estimates, and Obama immediately started the transition process with Trump&#x27;s people. There were no lawsuits seeking to disenfranchise 5 million voters for vague reasons.<p>The democratic quibbling about Trump&#x27;s legitimacy was just that - quibbling. To compare this to what Trump and his cronies have been doing since the election is laughable.')
