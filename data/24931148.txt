I&#x27;ve kept in touch with a few folks from previous jobs via LinkedIn or whatnot, but as a network, I&#x27;d describe it as &quot;thin and weakly connected.&quot; Part of that is due to being an introvert and generally terrible at maintaining long term human connections. And part of it is a certain indifference I&#x27;ve had in the past to actively managing my career, which in an of itself is a result of how generally easy it&#x27;s been to find work. Curious if I&#x27;m alone in this?')
