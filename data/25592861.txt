Environment is easier to manage (Pkg.add), the language &quot;looks like Python and walks like C&quot;, math-friendly style possible, just-ahead-of-time compilation resulting in high performance (enough to not need native code implementations), interactive development (Jupyter was named for Julia-Python-R after all), @memoize may be enough for you and Pluto gives you reactive notebooks.<p>Bonus - tools are also emerging to make stand alone distributables.<p>Disclaimer: I neither work for nor am I affiliated with Julialang. I just use it.')
