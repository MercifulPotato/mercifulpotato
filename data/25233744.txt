Men without anything to lose and no potential to improve their lives legally are very dangerous, whether you give them weapons or whether you don&#x27;t. The high status men only channel this force and use it for their own gains.<p>But you are right, I should have mentioned that high status men contribute to wars as well.<p>Re incels, it depends on the definition of the term whether they can be regarded as such. I think that the term is most commonly used to refer to a specific group of men in western society which by and large is still monogamic, so it&#x27;s not very comparable to a mostly polygamic society and the effects it has. I think most men or women who identify as incel can find someone if they really want to, they might just not live up to their standards. I mean, here in the west there is no effect which removes far more women from the dating pool than men :).')
