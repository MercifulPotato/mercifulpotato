Then you just need a stronger magnet (like those passive stud finders) to pop the whole thing off and run more wires.<p>Of course the next problem is you have a narrow, concealed raceway full of plastic insulation, which is something that rodents like to chew on...<p>If I try to look for crown molding, I&#x27;m seeing a lot of accent light solutions built into plastic molding (you leave a gap for the light to come out from behind the molding). It&#x27;s... okay. I&#x27;d rather have 10g ethernet in my house though.')
