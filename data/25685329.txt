Is it not obvious that in both cases people should go to freaking jail? We do not need to agree on which is the worst crime.  Are we so blinded by irrational partisanship that we allow criminals a pass if they are in anyway adjacent to whatever political tribe we belong to? God damn it. This sort of stupidity, of blind, intellectually dishonest allegiance to parties that could not care less for America is what is destroying the country. We are well on our way to at best paralysis and at worst civil war if we cannot step out of our bubbles and condemn bad behavior on its merits. What a pathetic ending for the greatest country of the last 100 years.')
