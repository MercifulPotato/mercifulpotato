You don&#x27;t have to interact much, and just being by someone you like holding hands can be enough when you&#x27;re 16 years old.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t make a movie my go-to first or third date in my 20&#x27;s though, as it&#x27;s not really accomplishing the goal of getting to know someone and finding a mate.<p>Now that I&#x27;m married?  Dinner and a movie sounds pretty awesome...')
