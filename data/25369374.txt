It&#x27;s trying to constantly munge state to be back where you originally wanted it, rather than forcing it to remain one way and never deviate. All greenfield projects should be designed with version-controlled immutability in mind.<p>One example of how technology today is still kind of backwards is SQL databases. They have a crap operational model. Their schemas can mutate in odd, unversioned ways, and the data is pretty much a free-for-all, and both are lumped together in one weird mass. You can hack around it with flyway migrations, but this is a hack plain and simple. If it weren&#x27;t for the convenience of the query language on simple datasets I&#x27;d never use them.<p>Similarly, trying to constantly &quot;fix&quot; the configuration of a system with a CM tool is like having a tea party at a mosh pit. Rather than having a tool designed to constantly correct a mutable system, you can instead build versioned, immutable artifacts, continuously deploy them, and roll them back immediately when tests fail. Even for entire OSes. Even on bare metal! But I guess because we don&#x27;t have a lot of books on it yet, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be the norm.<p>The industry hasn&#x27;t really woken up to modern best practices. Take WordPress for example. Most WordPress installs are still these collections of manually curated random software and data in one big pot. There&#x27;s no version control, there&#x27;s no rollbacks, there&#x27;s no testing... just back up everything all at once and restore it all if you break anything. And because of that, nobody updates anything, so security vulns abound. DevOps-oriented WordPress management has actually been around for at least 8 years, but almost nobody actually <i>does it</i>, because it&#x27;s not immediately clear how, because the industry is stuck in two-decade-old paradigms.')
