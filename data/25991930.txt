My (web) site is running on shared hosting where keeping (or not) software up to date, keeping up with the latest and greatest way Gmail breaks email and any other admin-level stuff i handled by someone else (and also it is cheaper) - i just upload a bunch of static HTML files and anything else i need to share and leave it at that.<p>If Gemini used http 1.0 (like others mentioned) it&#x27;d work out of the box - not just for me, but for everybody else. But the custom protocol pretty much requires a VPS and that opens a can of worms i&#x27;m not interested in opening again.<p>FWIW i used to have my own &quot;gopherhole&quot; but since that one also needs a custom server, i dropped it after i switched from VPS to shared hosting. I still have the client i wrote though[0] and considered making a Gemini one at some point but the fact that i can&#x27;t make my own site does hamper things a bit (and TBH i haven&#x27;t updated the Gopher client for years either).<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;runtimeterror.com&#x2F;tools&#x2F;gopher&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;runtimeterror.com&#x2F;tools&#x2F;gopher&#x2F;</a>')
