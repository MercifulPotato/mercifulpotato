They all provide the ability to invest, but new investors don&#x27;t know where to start. So people invest in BTC and lose money and cryptos rep goes down the drain.So after talking with a bunch of retail investors I decided to build a smart crypto wallet called Ordcoin (ordinary-coin - making crypto ordinary. Ordcoin tracks your investing habits and provides personalized insights about risks and beneficial strategies for future investments. The wallet incorporates RL to classify your trading habits and run volatility analysis and forecasting. This wallet will almost act like an investment advisor in an app, but instead of only opinions, any &#x27;advice&#x27; is backed by real quantifiable metrics. Beyond investing the app also allows you to send crypto to contacts easier and is reinforced with Blockchain and AES technology.
