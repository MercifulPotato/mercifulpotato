I always think it’s funny when people complain about the verbosity of Java, because most of it is self-imposed. Even more funny is that the same Java programmers will migrate to something like Groovy and then reproduce all of the same verbosity there (e.g., “Don’t use implicit ‘it’ variables! Name it theImportantThingFromTheImportantThingArray!”)')
