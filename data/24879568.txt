Like if you were using it in a college chemistry course you’d have numerous facts in Anki, but still doing labs and other homework and things to exercise the knowledge. Anki itself is meant to help you remember better, but other things are needed to fully exercise that knowledge in appropriate contexts.<p>I use it with Spanish, but without conversations with my wife and others or trying to read Spanish language content it would be a useless exercise on its own.')
