Item(by='uniqueid', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612195308, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25987032, text='That&#x27;s a fair question, but I don&#x27;t want to answer it. It&#x27;s a little like asking &#x27;what&#x27;s your use-case for scissors?&#x27; in that it would take a couple days of prolonged reflection to answer comprehensively. Whatever I come up with in twenty minutes won&#x27;t be the half of it. The effect of appending use-cases later, even if they are important ones, will be to make them sound as though they aren&#x27;t (ie: &#x27;if that&#x27;s important why didn&#x27;t they think of it immediately?&#x27;).')
