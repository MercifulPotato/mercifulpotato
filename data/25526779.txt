I found it useful for benchmarking C code over lots of different combinations of compilers and compiler options. The initial Make solution I came up with was unwieldy and bug-prone.<p>It was very easy to update code, add new compilers and compiler options without rerunning benchmarks for everything. Only for what was changed.<p>Check it out: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackage.haskell.org&#x2F;package&#x2F;shake" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackage.haskell.org&#x2F;package&#x2F;shake</a>')
