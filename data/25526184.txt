I&#x27;m talking about everyday films - not futuristic fantasy. Often when someone writes an email in a film the UI is some kind of Frankenstein interface that isn&#x27;t recognisable as say Gmail or Outlook. Am I just imagining this? Is there a company that specializes in writing fake UIs for films and TV?')
