Item(by='pbhjpbhj', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603505281, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24875447, text='iTunes was designed [in part, probably a principal part of the original design] for CD ripping, I gather (I haven&#x27;t personally used it more than twice, many years ago).<p>Format shifting was at the time not allowed in UK copyright law, and again is not allowed as of a couple of years ago (it was only allowed for about a year).<p>iTunes was designed for copyright violation. I&#x27;m sure the manual will show that.<p>Just for comparison.<p>It&#x27;s my understanding that any media _can_ fall under Fair Use in the USA, meaning that there would have to be specification as to who was using the software and their circumstances within the unit tests in order to make it infringing use. You might fir example be archiving, or preparing educational materials, or compiling a review, or doing subtitling.<p>It&#x27;s not sufficient to prove someone downloaded, you have to show it was infringing activity. How do you do that with a unit test? Software to perform legitimate, legal downloads would still have to do that same test.<p>In short you&#x27;ve found a smoking gun, now prove its principle purpose is murder.<p><i>This comment is provided solely for entertainment and in no way relates to my employment.</i>')
