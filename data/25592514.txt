Strongly suspected cases based on thoracic scanners are up to mid November [3].<p>In Italy people were contaminated even earlier than that, apparently [4].<p>These are not wholly surprising because, again it is likely that the virus had been circulating for some time in humans before it exploded and was detected. It is quite contagious but many people do not experience any symptoms or only mild, common symptoms, which IMO makes it relatively easy to go undetected until it goes out out of hands, as it did in Wuhan first.<p>It&#x27;s good to ask for proof but then you should ask for proof of all claims, not only the ones you do not like.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-europe-52526554" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-europe-52526554</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencemediacentre.org&#x2F;expert-reaction-to-report-of-a-covid-19-case-in-france-in-december-2019&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencemediacentre.org&#x2F;expert-reaction-to-report...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;new-evidence-race-find-france-s-covid-19-patient-zero-n1207871" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;new-evidence-race-find-fr...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-health-coronavirus-italy-timing-idUSKBN27V0KF" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-health-coronavirus-italy-...</a>')
