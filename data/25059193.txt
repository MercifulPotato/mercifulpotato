Problem is, I am native speaker...\nI presume it was written by the Dutchman. Well, there are reasons why we keep ó and u and treat it separately. The reason is, it&#x27;s a different phoneme. ó is open, said with round lips, while u is posterior syllable. Totally different sound.\nThe same goes with other phonemes that are simply not represented in Cyrillic, such as ch (posterior version of h).\nPolitical reasons apart (Russians actually tried to impose there spelling here and it didn&#x27;t go well; see metrical books written in Cyrillic - incorrect spelling, translating first names, etc.), there are reasons why we keep our specific spellings.<p>Personally, I can&#x27;t see why we keep using cz instead of č or sz instead of š. But I know that historically speaking we did. It came from Czech. There are few remains, for instance ł (which does not sound like l, it sounds more like wh in which, what, why ;) ). The funny thing Czech people dropped it :)\nBut this is another story; it probably has something to do with national pride. To some extent Cyrillic might have something to do with pride and independence, but the fact is Polish is very far from Russian (it&#x27;s Western Slavonic language after all) and there are many sounds that there is no way to properly describe in it. Problem is, these sound might be hard to distinguish for people that does not use Polish as their mother tongue... Tough luck :)')
