But one thing I noticed sometimes when I do that is I see the account (for example) was created FIVE YEARS AGO with two or three comments made five years ago, and a recent 2021 comment with long durations of time between each comment.<p>I imagine the accounts are lurker accounts where the person is signed in, refraining from commenting and then bringing some life into the account on a whim.<p>I&#x27;m not mentioning any accounts since I respect the privacy of those types of accounts, but with some digging you can spot them all over HN.<p>Also I&#x27;ve seen some accounts with no comments, with the account created 6&#x2F;7 years ago and then suddenly a comment appears. Why do people do that? It&#x27;s weird. Anyone else know this situation but haven&#x27;t actually expressed it yet on HN?')
