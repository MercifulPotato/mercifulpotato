The Mercedes guys pushing one another in 2019, or the Red Bull guys crashing into each other in 2018, were both pretty memorable. Lots of low-speed tangles there in general, and it&#x27;s also a pretty challenging track for drivers trying to get their fastest lap in practice or qualifying. (there&#x27;s always more time to be had, but there are also a number of walls arguing against pushing too hard)<p>It&#x27;s probably rare for a street course to offer so many options for how to set the car up, too, thanks to the long straight. There&#x27;s a lot to be said for a slower, high downforce setup with all those right angle turns, but on the straight, Bottas went 235MPH there (!!!) in a practice when he driving for Williams.')
