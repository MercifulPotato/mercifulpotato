Item(by='mrandish', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607379138, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25332391, text='Personally, I don&#x27;t generally choose Apple products for my own use because I tend to prioritize customization, flexibility, cost and a wider range of choices over simplicity, ubiquity, consistency and aesthetics. However, I concede that Apple makes some outstanding hardware and is generally an innovative, well-run company and the world is better for having the company in it. There are many users and use cases for which Apple&#x27;s offerings are an excellent fit (including my own mother).<p>Most of my personal usage concerns are around the software and content areas where the user types and use cases Apple tends to prioritize aren&#x27;t a good fit for my needs. For example, the focus in iOS on content consumption and app-snacking vs flexible content authoring and application depth (speaking-broadly here, as there are certainly notable counter-examples).<p>From a meta-perspective, as a long-time software-centric serial entrepreneur, I feel the long-term, net impacts on the market of Apple&#x27;s app and content business models is, at-best, mixed for third-party developers. It can be excellent for very large developers with established brands and&#x2F;or customer bases as well as the single-digit percentage of app developers that score a mega-hit. It can also be a good deal for small part-time devs that just want to get started quickly and don&#x27;t necessarily need to count on consistent long-term revenue to make a house payment or employee payroll.<p>The app store model introduced a different set of trade-offs for developers because Apple retains certain significant value components for themselves such as the direct customer relationship, finely-grained control of distribution, some promotion avenues, margins and available business models. They  also force certain requirements on developers. I agree that some of these requirements are also net benefits for users (eg privacy, compatibility, etc). However, they are also differentiators for Apple&#x27;s offerings and enablers of Apple&#x27;s extraordinary business model success.<p>Unlike some others, I don&#x27;t believe Apple is guilty of being a monopoly (as defined by regulatory agencies) and don&#x27;t see Apple&#x27;s strategy as even especially predatory or deceptive. Sure, it&#x27;s boldly aggressive and perhaps lopsided in Apple&#x27;s favor, at least as compared to the Wintel proposition before it. But it&#x27;s not fundamentally immoral, unethical or illegal. Certainly, the net effects and trade-offs of the app store value proposition to developers (and users) should be well-understood by now. If it&#x27;s not a good fit, developers (or customers) should evaluate alternatives and respond appropriately depending on their preferences, context, requirements and priorities.<p>Finally, I think the difference between my viewpoint and that of Apple&#x27;s biggest fans or harshest critics is more a matter of subjective value-judgements and perspective than objective right vs wrong. For example, I&#x27;m probably influenced by personally benefiting from valuation increases based on having durable customer relationships and diverse distribution channels.')
