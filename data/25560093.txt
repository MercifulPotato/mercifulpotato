There is more to it than that.  You cannot &#x27;curate&#x27; these samples on Earth because they don&#x27;t exist on earth.<p>Value - I&#x27;m using this term in the sense of &#x27;what would someone pay for these&#x27;?  I&#x27;m using it much the same way that art is valued or classic cars are valued for auction, not the internal mysteries of motivation or the commoditized value of a good like cold rolled steel or corn.  In this case, like art, the provenance, authenticity and care of the instance is generally considered essential and therefore why the &#x27;curation&#x27; does actually have a meaningful role in the value (at least by virtue of not destroying it along the way).')
