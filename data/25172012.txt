So they&#x27;re not looking for top engineers, they&#x27;re filtering out bad ones and then basically choosing at random.<p>Unfortunately, if there are many more potential employees then you&#x27;re going to be a beggar no matter what. If you&#x27;re applying to companies who only get a few applicants per position, then you have leverage <i>and</i> the companies actually have to look for quality.')
