I&#x27;m not going to argue that YouTube doesn&#x27;t have a legal right to do what they&#x27;re doing, but assuming that they&#x27;re specially knowledgeable about truth and falsity strikes me as an incredible act of hubris.<p>All of that said, I recognize that disinformation and misinformation is a serious and tricky problem. I think the American right partially has themselves to blame for throwing so much mud at the wall. I understand YouTube not wanting to be hijacked and used as a political vehicle. But at the end of the day they function as a commons, and I think society is worse off when they censor content like this.')
