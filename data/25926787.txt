I think manufacturers should be required to display clearly how long they think product will last and suddenly ownership turns into a subscription (divide the price by how many months product will last). I think that also should be clearly marked that you won&#x27;t really own the product. Manufacturers should be required to attach bill of materials and a schematic to the product and it should be illegal to ask chip manufacturer to withdraw sales to consumers willing to repair on their own.\nWe need to nip these shady practices in the bud!')
