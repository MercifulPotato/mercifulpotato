Sure if only things like child porn, threatening to murder someone etc. are illegal, then, I assume, this would work. But for example what about hate speech or holocaust denial? Neither is illegal in the US. Would Twitter be legally required to host content inciting racial hatred on their site even if they don&#x27;t want to? Would it be illegal for Twitter to show any posts made by users in the United States to users who are in the UK or Germany (if the content is ambiguous I don&#x27;t see how they could determine whether it&#x27;s illegal in the target court without requesting it&#x27;s courts to review it)?<p>I&#x27;m not even sure how this could work in countries where &quot;hate speech&quot; is illegal either. If the content is not explicit and open to interpretation can Twitter just declare that it&#x27;s illegal and remove it? If so, then how is this any different from what they are doing currently? Or would they have to wait until the user is convicted by a court before removing it?')
