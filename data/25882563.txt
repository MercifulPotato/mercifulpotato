There is a reason why not a single SV executive will let their kids anywhere close to social medias. These things destroy people&#x27;s brains, and especially the brains of kids which are still developing and are extremely malleable to this type of conditioning. tiktok&#x2F;snapchat&#x2F;instragram &amp;co bring absolutely nothing good to a kid&#x27;s life, they&#x27;re pure distraction devices<p>&gt; parents can identify their children&#x27;s contacts quickly and they can observe the black sheep closely and in the worst case try to prevent any further contact<p>Unless you monitor your kids 24&#x2F;7: no, and again, these tools, even when used &quot;safely&quot; are still engineered to artificially trigger and reinforce the most basic reward pathways of your brain and this won&#x27;t bring anything good to your kid&#x27;s life<p>You can very well make the analogy with weed or alcohol. What might be fine for an healthy adult (able to set his own boundaries and conscious of the potential risks) would destroy a 10 years old kid very quickly')
