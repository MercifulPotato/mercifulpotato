For what its worth, I have yet to get an email about the increase and HN is the first I&#x27;ve heard of it.<p>I should have known something was up when Stripe sent out the email survey two days ago about subscription pricing. Very strange that you only sat on those results for a day before pulling the trigger on this. Interestingly, some of the survey answers included concepts of a free tier.<p>To me, the percentage makes little sense. You could be running 1,000,000 $10&#x2F;mo subs, or 1,000 $1,000&#x2F;mo subs and the cost is the same. This pricing model hits high value subscription companies significantly harder, even though Stripe&#x27;s costs are lower.')
