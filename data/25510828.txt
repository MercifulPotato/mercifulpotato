Hiring in the US (I&#x27;m assuming this is the US, because there was a $100k investor) is at-will, most especially so in companies documented carefully enough to have 4&#x2F;1 vesting. There is likely no such thing as a &quot;bad faith&quot; termination; there is only termination authorized by contracts establishing who manages the company, and termination that isn&#x27;t.<p>Again, by all means, pay a small amount of money to get a competent lawyer to verify that&#x27;s the case. Everybody on this thread will likely say &quot;go ahead and fight&quot; if it turns out this person can&#x27;t be fired, so you can just stick a pin in that thought and we can continue to discuss the more realistic scenario.<p>Threatening to sue: also often a bad idea! If it&#x27;s not credible, and everyone knows you don&#x27;t have the resources to litigate, and that even if you did it would be economically irrational to do so, then the threat does the opposite of gain you leverage; meanwhile, threats can trigger other legal problems for you. Advice I&#x27;m pretty confident in giving: don&#x27;t trust a message board post that tells you to threaten legal action.')
