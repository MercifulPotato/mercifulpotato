I&#x27;m doubtful about a UI that would &quot;encourage&quot; it.\nThe last time I wrote on a GitHub issue, I started my message with a warm thankful line to the maintainer for his fabulous work. I meant it, and I didn&#x27;t need any &quot;reminder&quot; to say so. It felt natural and important to me. I also put relevant informations to show my interest and the time I spent thinking about it. In the end, I believe it&#x27;s more about the person posting, rather than the interface encouraging it, but I may be wrong.')
