You can blame the people but we install law makers to produce good laws not bad ones (I wouldn&#x27;t blame the users for not using my app the way I envisaged because <i>they&#x27;re ignorant</i>, I&#x27;d hope I&#x27;d improve the app).<p>But what should replace it? Perhaps something that does make the distinction between what is a platform and a publisher. That could be difficult.<p>I&#x27;d most likely go for something tapered, so that smaller sites had more protections &#x2F; less responsibilities and larger sites less protection&#x2F;more responsibility, in order to promote competition because I think lack of competition is the main problem. So if small sites retained section 230 protection and larger sites didn&#x27;t, perhaps that would produce better outcomes. Thus, I&#x27;m completely against stamping down on Parler and Gab, and any other upstart in the space. The more competitors the better, in my view.')
