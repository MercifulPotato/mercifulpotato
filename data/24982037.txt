I&#x27;ve worked in many places that ABSOLUTELY had the desire, willingness, money, time, and ability to do something, and were still unable to make that thing happen, for reasons that can&#x27;t be spoken about.<p>While it is true that if an entire organization wants something done that it will happen, it is <i>not</i> true that inaction by an organization always signifies unwillingness or inability to act.<p>It&#x27;s easy to sit on the sidelines and throw tomatoes at the parties involved.  It is another matter entirely when you are hamstrung by internal process or a specific power-tripping and ignorant person in management.')
