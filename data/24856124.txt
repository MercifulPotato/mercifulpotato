Shoot for 2.5 to 3.5 liters a day maximum. If you do this for any prolonged period of time, or multiple weeks in a row, you&#x27;re going to have issues.<p>&gt; This is why the fasting once per week doesn&#x27;t work for me. I think it is just repetitive torture every week with minimal fat burning and quite a disruption to normal socializing.<p>Yeah, that&#x27;s because you&#x27;re doing it wrong. I&#x27;m on week 4 of 5&#x2F;2 (fasting&#x2F;eating) and it&#x27;s sustainable. So long as I don&#x27;t eat pure junk on my 2 days, it&#x27;s not even that bad for the first 24 hours. I have one friend who maintained this schedule for a year and a half, and another who&#x27;s been at 96+ hour fasts for over a year now.<p>&gt; Cooking whilst mid-fast is torture<p>I didn&#x27;t find that to be the case. I cooked for my girlfriend plenty on my 60 day fast. Wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal. Didn&#x27;t start until after the 2nd week though, so that may have something to do with it. I guess I can see it on shorter fasts if you&#x27;re not adapted though.<p>&gt; &quot;Threw some salt in my water, feel a fair bit better after that might do this once a day.&quot;<p>Yeah... this individual and I need to have a talk about that. This guy says he&#x27;s 75kg, drinking 4 to 7kg of water a day, for 3 to 5 days, without _ANY_ salt to speak of. The average human is 55 to 60% water by weight. Do you have any idea how hard that is on your kidneys? Or what it does to your salinity levels?')
