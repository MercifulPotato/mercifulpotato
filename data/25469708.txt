Then you need to start passing options and configuration into your helper method... and before long your helper method is extremely difficult to reason about, because it’s actually handling a dozen cases that are superficially similar but full of important differences in the details.<p>I encourage my devs to follow a rule of thumb: don’t extract repetitive code right away, try and build the feature you’re working on with the duplication in place first. Let the code go through a few evolutions and waves of change. Then one of two things are likely to happen:<p>(1) you find that the code doesn’t look so repetitive anymore,<p>or, (2) you hit a bug where you needed to make the same change to the boilerplate in six places and you missed one.<p>In scenario 1, you can sigh and say “yeah it turned out to be incidental duplication, it’s not bothering me anymore.” In scenario 2, it’s probably time for a careful refactoring to pull out the bits that have proven to be identical (and, importantly, must be identical across all of the instances of the code).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;reply?id=22022603&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D22022466%2322022603" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;reply?id=22022603&amp;goto=item%3Fi...</a>')
