Even today you can find many yogis in the frigid Himalayas sitting almost naked in meditation pose. These yogis have gained supreme control over their Prﾄ］a. Prﾄ］a is roughly the same as breath, but really there is no English equivalent to the word.<p>The tragedy is that many Hindus &#x2F; Indians themselves ridicule this ancient science in Ayurveda, Yoga etc, but when the same is circulated back in English or foreign context, they accept it &amp; in many cases without asking for any evidence whatsoever. It shows a very low esteem on the part of some Indians. Why, it is not very clear.')
