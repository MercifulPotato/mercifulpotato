It&#x27;s one of the few discs I plan to actually buy.<p>I don&#x27;t understand the business model of small films that withdraw from streaming completely, especially documentaries.  Surely that can&#x27;t be more profitable?  I think about this question a lot while going through the dreck on Netflix and Amazon Prime.
