First, my employer doesn&#x27;t buy me gas so I don&#x27;t see why they&#x27;d charge my EV. Expecting this to be the norm may have unintended side effects. Second, power outlets in parking lots are reasonably common in colder cities so that people can plug in their bloc heaters. You don&#x27;t need a fancy fast charger if you&#x27;re going to be at work all day.')
