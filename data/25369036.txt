While there is not an exact date for removing support for Manifest V2 extensions, developers can expect the migration period to last at least a year from when Manifest V3 lands in the stable channel.<p>This means that we&#x27;ll have at least a year where Manifest V2 extensions will still work. Hopefully by the end of that period there will be a good selection of Manifest v3 compatible ad blockers.')
