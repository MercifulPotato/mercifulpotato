The picture in this article illustrates everything I would expect the suite&#x2F;bundle to cover eventually.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sdxcentral.com&#x2F;security&#x2F;sase&#x2F;definitions&#x2F;what-is-sase-secure-access-service-edge&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sdxcentral.com&#x2F;security&#x2F;sase&#x2F;definitions&#x2F;what-is...</a><p>It&#x27;s a bit of a messy space for a couple reasons.  Every vendor who made any one of these products is quickly racing to become a kitchen sink through development and&#x2F;or acquisition.  At the same time, they are splitting up what was once bundled into components you can buy separately to piece into a larger puzzle.  Because most companies already have relationships with multiple vendors providing these services, they are fighting each other to both create walled gardens AND SIMULTANEOUSLY interoperable compatible components for larger multi vendor buildouts.  (Palo Alto buying CloudGenix SD-WAN, while at the same time being the leading supplier of on Edge firewall VM&#x27;s for Velocloud devices.  Velocloud will both tell you you can run Palo Alto, ZScaler, or Checkpoint, but also that they have in house Carbon Black.  What risk are you taking by integrating two vendors that are both trying to crush each other, despite the best in breed solution being part of each of their products.)  &quot;We have Cisco for this, so maybe Duo makes sense, but then that overlaps Okta, and that overlaps what we already get from Microsoft, which overlaps what we get from VMWare, which is starting to overlap what we have from Palo Alto.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sdxcentral.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;news&#x2F;sase-acquisitions-drive-sd-wan-competition-gartner-states&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sdxcentral.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;news&#x2F;sase-acquisitions-d...</a><p>Anyone in the &quot;Zero Trust&quot; space is likely rebranding bundles as SASE.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;telegra.ph&#x2F;ZeroTrust-Vendors-04-23" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;telegra.ph&#x2F;ZeroTrust-Vendors-04-23</a><p>On the topic of Cloudflare.  They have a leg up over EVERYBODY because they are building on top of Wireguard, and everybody else is stuck with legacy IPSEC that they cant leave anytime soon.  From a future proofing perspective, if you don&#x27;t already have commitments elsewhere, this is likely a VERY ATTRACTIVE bundle.  One of the killer products buried in this is Cloudflare for Teams Access.  No more need for AnyConnect.  And like I said, most&#x2F;all the other ZeroTrust Access gateways either a) only come in a bundle with other products 2) are a me-too product offered by a vendor that specializes in something else 3) are ipsec.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cloudflare.com&#x2F;teams&#x2F;access&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cloudflare.com&#x2F;teams&#x2F;access&#x2F;</a>')
