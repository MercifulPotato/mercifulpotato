Historically Intel had by far the highest capacity for leading edge fabrication processes - just for their own CPU production. It didn&#x27;t make sense for companies like TSMC to invest in additional fabs as long as Intel had the lead. AMD taking the lead and moving ~25% of x86 CPU production to TSMC is a huge shift.')
