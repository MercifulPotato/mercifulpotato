Extremists exist on both sides, the Guardian seems to forget this regularly and publishes its big tech opinion on a lopsided argument.  Right wing extremists exist, but I also have a &quot;black power&quot; fist spray painted on a wall outside visible from my window.  Its not a nazi sign, its not a white power fist...its a black power fist.  Normalizing one side and making an example of extremism from the other is a bit ridiculous.  Condemn it all.')
