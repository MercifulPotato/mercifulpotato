Self driving cars need to get to airline level safety where crashes are a rare thing and most people don’t think twice about giving up control to the pilots&#x2F;auto pilot. If that takes expensive Lidar thats what we should use. I can’t imagine ever feeling good about trusting my life to a computer vision algorithm.')
