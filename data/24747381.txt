Item(by='a1369209993', descendants=None, kids=[24748531], score=None, time=1602436719, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24744146, text='&gt; Yeah I didn&#x27;t explain that very well.<p>Not at all well, I&#x27;m afraid, but I think I understand:<p><pre><code>  f(){ false &amp;&amp; true; } ; set -e ; f ; echo hi\n  # this works correctly (f returns false and errexit triggers)\n  \n  set -e; false &amp;&amp; true ; echo hi\n  # despite `false &amp;&amp; true` failing, this doesn&#x27;t trigger errexit\n</code></pre>\nI was confused by the implication that the function version was what was wrong (rather than &quot;false &amp;&amp; true is broken, and you&#x27;d expect the function to work the same way&quot;). Probably partly because I was confusing it with `command || true`, which is a idiomatic way to suppress errexit-like mechanisms by making the exit status always 0.')
