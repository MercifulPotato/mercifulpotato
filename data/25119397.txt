The Hotel industry lobbies to keep the rules in their favour - and none of us are winners really.<p>Accommodation rules should probably be opened up somewhat, AirBnB has provided overwhelming evidence of a supply&#x2F;demand mismatch. The taxi industry is considerably more difficult to redress because the cities have already sold medallions.')
