Teach the brightest and the ones with genuine interest in the subject (I don&#x27;t use the word &quot;passion&quot; because after adoption by corporations it no longer seems to mean anything). The rest will be fine with a high school&#x2F;secondary school education. Most people retain only a fraction of that knowledge anyway.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s time to stop treating (higher) education like an assembly line?')
