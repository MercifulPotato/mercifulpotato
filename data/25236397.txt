We use it to do record, parametrize, playback to simulate multi user workflows. Cant see any such support here. One of the problems with Soasta is it requires lot of servers to trigger load. Looking for moving away from it. k6 seems interesting, but couldn&#x27;t find any record&#x2F;playback functionality. Any addon&#x2F;extension which can be used to achieve similar purpose with K6?')
