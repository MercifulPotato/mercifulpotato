Some problems that I&#x27;ve had to solve in recent years:<p>- Urgently deploying a fix in one part of the system without having to deploy the _whole_ system.\n- Updating the framework or the language (my favourite: updating from Java 8 to Java 11, which broke a lot of things and which we would have hated to have to do all in one go, if we&#x27;d had a monolith).\n- Scaling different parts of the system independently (both in terms of running different services on different numbers of nodes and in terms of using different hardware for application nodes and DBs).\n- Load testing different parts of the system independently.\n- Trialling a new language or framework in a small part of the system without affecting the rest of the system.<p>I personally wasn&#x27;t aware of how much of a big deal some of these problems would have been until our system grew to the size that it is now, with a dozen or so development teams working on at least as many services. I personally have no idea how you could solve these problems on a system this size without splitting it into independently deployable services, without incurring a massive cost.')
