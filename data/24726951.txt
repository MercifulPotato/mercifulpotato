This leaves it prone to many kinds of loss (and fraud). An analyst suggests 1500 coins are lost per day, and so less than 14MM will ever be in circulation [1]. Currently, only (144 * 6.25 = 900) coins are mined per day, and 1500 are lost. Ergo, it&#x27;s deflationary and will become more so over time as the block reward drops.<p>I also disagree that 3.4% is a &quot;better&quot; inflation than many national currencies. It&#x27;s lower, sure, but I am reluctant to draw a value judgement as inflation has a specific and important role in the economy. I don&#x27;t know enough to tell you authoritatively that 3.4% is &quot;too high&quot; and &quot;worse&quot; than the classical 2% US target.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.bitcoin.com&#x2F;analyst-1500-bitcoins-lost-every-day-less-than-14-million-coins-will-ever-circulate&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.bitcoin.com&#x2F;analyst-1500-bitcoins-lost-every-da...</a>')
