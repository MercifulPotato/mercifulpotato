Item(by='ithkuil', descendants=None, kids=[25941496], score=None, time=1611833184, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25939746, text='I think you&#x27;re right, society is not homogeneous and language does evolve differently in different niches. Usually this can be observed in smaller groups, which have a strong pressure to &quot;code switch&quot; the dominant language of the society where they live. Minority group members do this all the time, all over the world; often there is a continuum of language&#x2F;dialect&#x2F;register that speakers navigate throughout their daily lives.<p>What&#x27;s peculiar here is that american society has become polarized, on a rough 50&#x2F;50% split,  along certain cultural norms that affect a small part of language.<p>Members of group A will not easily concede &quot;code switching&quot; to the vocabulary that is ok for group B because group be is not clearly the majority dominant group.<p>In this case it&#x27;s easy, since the word has alternatives, so a member of group A doesn&#x27;t have to code switch to group-B-speak and say &quot;retard&quot; instead of &quot;idiot&quot;.<p>Furthermore some vocal members of group A will demand that members of group B refrain from using that word on the same ground (there is an easy alternative).<p>You may be rightfully annoyed that group A is dictating something to you, dear group B member. A meager consolation is that there many minorities in the world that know how you feel (although some may not identify you as a minority since you&#x27;re not; but that&#x27;s beside the point, that&#x27;s how it feels to be one).<p>Culture is complicated.<p>Where I live there is a big chunk of local culture that uses blasphemy as casual filler words. Other areas of the country, and a sizeable chunk of the same region, find that utterly repugnant and it cannot be used in polite speech (e.g. people are fired for saying &quot;porco Dio&quot; on television). Locals here just know it when it&#x27;s ok to use it and when it&#x27;s not a good idea. Some insist they should be free to stay whatever they want, and &quot;porco Dio&quot; they may well be right! A famous local nobel prize winner (Margherita Hack), when asked &quot;do you use blasphemy in casual speech?&quot; answered &quot;sure, I&#x27;m from Tuscany!&quot;. I myself fit well in the that local culture.<p>That said, do I still talk like that when my 4yo child is around? No! I don&#x27;t want him to talk like that until he can control himself and read the room! Is fixing this bug in the society (the rule against insulting the christian God) a hill I want to die on? Why should I? It&#x27;s just a word, a fun habit, would it be rational for me to yell at people that I&#x27;m free to insult their gods because if freedom of speech or whatever? I&#x27;d be looked at as a crazy man because that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d be.<p>To me people who cling their freedom to utter words that a significant portion of their fellow compatriots find offensive, look exactly like that. Picking a silly battle, and entrenching themselves.')
