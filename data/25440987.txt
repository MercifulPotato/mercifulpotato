In those cases, the game studios are getting economic incentives from the console company to focus on next-gen, even if the market share is smaller. In other cases the studios themselves are controlled by the same company that sells the consoles. See Gears of War, Halo etc.<p>If the mission is simply &quot;sell as many copies as possible&quot;, it will always make sense to not ignore the largest market share. This is why CP2077 is not having proper next-gen features, but is rather running the same (poorly optimized) last-gen build on both systems. Ironic as it sounds, it seems like the focus was to provide a serviceable experience for last-gen gamers first and foremost.<p>They clearly failed on that front. So now they have a poorly running game on last-gen, and a gimped one on next-gen.<p>Sorry, I&#x27;m rambling.')
