Item(by='tomhoward', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603022757, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24813234, text=' &gt; I have yet to see any reasonable argument as to why this matters<p>The major factor that accelerates spread is the frequency&#x2F;duration of interactions between different people.<p>So a country such as NZ, that has:<p>- a much smaller population<p>- a much less dense&#x2F;more spread out population<p>- geographic isolation from the rest of the world<p>- its population split across two islands<p>- a small fraction of the international and domestic passenger movements that the US, Europe and Asia have<p>- a very small number of infection cases in the country when the world suddenly woke up to the scale of the problem in mid-late March<p>- a centrally managed national health system (and government)<p>- a cohesive and compliant society<p>... will have a vastly easier (like, exponentially easier) time controlling the virus.<p>NZ deserves credit for handling it well before it got out of control and they&#x27;re deservedly enjoying the benefits now.<p>But the conditions that made it even possible for NZ to achieve this apply in very few other places.<p>I can&#x27;t actually fathom a way the US could have contained the virus the way NZ did, no matter who was in power federally (&quot;just be like China&quot; obviously can&#x27;t happen).<p>(FYI I&#x27;m an Australian living in Melbourne, which has partially similar conditions to NZ but has spent the past 4 months battling a &quot;second wave&quot; and enduring a brutal lockdown which is just starting to ease now. That was after we&#x27;d seemed to have beaten it in May, and the rest of the country has stayed on top of it. So I know what it looks like to win and lose against this virus. Though even then, our case numbers and fatalities are far lower than the US and many European countries.)')
