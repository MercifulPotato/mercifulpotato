I&#x27;ve been watching StarTrek The Original Series lately and oh boy, have we changed. There is a Netflix Explained episode on Political Correctness, fascinating stuff.<p>To be clear, in my opinion we definitely changed for the better, the position of women at the end of the 60&#x27;s (which seems so close) is almost mind boggling to me now. It&#x27;s just 2 generations away from me, but back then my grandmother&#x27;s mother told my grandmother: &quot;You want to work? What? I&#x27;ll teach you how to work, in the kitchen, and around the house.&quot; I think this caused my grandmother to be very liberal with her kids and as a result my mother was with me and my brothers. As a result I never understood how one can not see men and women as equal. TOS gives some &quot;nice&quot; insights into the matter though...')
