The extra round trip times and potential connection resets they might encounter do have an impact that can sometimes be measured in whole seconds of loading. The same might also be true for those forced to use satellite connections for internet access, where latencies of half a second are common even with good reception and clear weather. Burst speeds are fine, as long as the data comes in over existing connections, for which HTTP&#x2F;2 provides are real benefit.<p>Most websites still push half a megabyte of JS down your throat on slow connections, so there&#x27;s not as much of an improvement as advertised, but that&#x27;s not the protocol&#x27;s problem. Of course there are no improvements on cable internet or faster, but there are plenty of people for whom protocols like HTTP&#x2F;2 make a difference.<p>As for Kubernetes, it&#x27;s a decent tool that solves a real problem. Automated replication and load balancing isn&#x27;t trivial and for companies that need it, k8s, even on bare metal, can save huge amounts of development effort. It wasn&#x27;t the first product in its class, it just became the most popular. There are plenty of alternatives available online if you just look for them. That said, most &quot;cool&quot; companies that use kubernetes because it&#x27;s the &quot;standard&quot; or whatever should really pick something else because you waste loads of resources for nothing if your problem doesn&#x27;t need a solution as complex as K8s.')
