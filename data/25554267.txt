Double the power per unit area, halve the installation and land requirement.<p>Other overhead costs like design and regulatory approval can be reduced with standardization.<p>Costs can&#x27;t continue going down indefinitely, but I agree that we are not near a floor. I&#x27;d expect another 20 years of gradually tapering reductions. As you say, not good for any kind of thermal generation, with its attendant high operation and maintenance costs. It also makes fusion power generation research pointless.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;BYD_Company" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;BYD_Company</a>')
