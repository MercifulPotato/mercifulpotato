There is already a 240 km hydrogen pipeline network in Germany (and probably in other countries as well) [1]. It connects chemical plants in the rhein-ruhr region. So there is already a huge market for hydrogen. These chemical plants will need hydrogen in the future.  If we want to get away from using oil and gas and become CO2 neutral, we need a solution for those industries.<p>2.) I don&#x27;t see air travel happening with batteries (except really short distances or really small planes). Weight is just too much of a factor in air travel and the energy density is just too far off with batteries. Hydrogen would maybe be a solution or some fuel that is synthesised from hydrogen.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;industrie.airliquide.de&#x2F;wasserstoffanlagen" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;industrie.airliquide.de&#x2F;wasserstoffanlagen</a>')
