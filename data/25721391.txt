Item(by='Jtsummers', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610320502, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25721131, text='-duino typically means that it&#x27;s physically drop in compatible with Arduino devices, so you can (physically) connect it to anything you&#x27;d connect to an Arduino without needing to make any (physical) modifications.<p>Of course, you still have to make the FGPA do something. An advantage of an FPGA over an STM32 would be if you&#x27;re willing to invest some time in hardware description languages (HDLs) like VHDL or Verilog to design your own system, or want to drop in novel cores (like RISC-V) that aren&#x27;t physically available yet or are still in a state of flux. RISC-V isn&#x27;t fully specified yet so a &quot;soft&quot; core version on an FPGA offers you the ability to upgrade your device without needing to actually purchase a new one, and remove and replace the old one.<p>In theory, an Arduino compatible FPGA-based device could be used to develop applications totally sans software (that is, all the logic is encoded in the HDL) as well, which can be advantageous in prototyping, and <i>maybe</i> in performance depending on the FPGA in question.')
