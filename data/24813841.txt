We had:<p>1. a hard initial lockdown lasting a few weeks, while the virus was exploding throughout Europe. masks <i>everywhere</i>. basically everything closed. borders closed.<p>2. a subsequent easing of many rules - masks almost everywhere; public transport, shops, offices, and restaurants&#x2F;bars. international travel possible with quarantine from selected countries.<p>3. an almost total relaxation of all of the rules<p>I think the &quot;Czech strategy&quot; you&#x27;re referring to is #1. I am saying that #2 was an acceptable compromise that caused some grumbles but kept a lid on things while permitting a relatively normal life for most people. #3 is IMO completely responsible for the current state of affairs. If 18 months is a realistic estimate for a vaccine then I genuinely think we could have managed with strategy #2 for that period. If a vaccine is not forthcoming then ... fine we would have given it a shot and without <i>completely</i> tanking our economy by becoming a little hermit republic, and without overwhelming our healthcare system in the meantime.<p>I mean you can&#x27;t have your cake and eat it, I know that. But I really believe the balance we struck was sustainable.<p>edit: btw I hope this doesn&#x27;t seem like I&#x27;m angry at you or anyone here in this thread. This is just a discussion and an interesting one. My tone is just probably influenced by my current cranky mood which is caused by other things unrelated to HN, and re-reading my words I can&#x27;t tell how it&#x27;s coming across :-)')
