It&#x27;s just that over the years you see many such &quot;added benefit&quot; services added on top of MaxMind, most of them promising to eventually build their own database. And most of them disappear again after some time. It seems to be a tough market. We&#x27;ve looked into this ourselves actually in a project, and it is far from trivial to get to the &quot;accuracy&quot; of MaxMind, with everything they do to enrich and improve their data.<p>Timezones, currency, etc, might be an added value, and there might be a market for the convenience you add. Your timing might be better than others, who knows.<p>I also understand you must have put in considerable effort in what I would still call a &quot;frontend&quot;. I wish you best of luck!')
