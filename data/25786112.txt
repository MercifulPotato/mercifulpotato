If you had relatives being deported or being shot by the police, it’s likely that you wouldn’t just tell your friends&#x2F;family « sorry, i have no control over this »<p>I know it’s extreme but it’s the reality. For someone who is impacting by politics (say lost their jobs due to COVID), you can’t just stay on the sideline and ignore it.<p>You just have the great privilege of letting other people take care of that dirty work.<p>Is taking a news diet good? Absolutely. Lots of crap out there and a mental break is needed once in a while. But ignoring the suffering of people around you is just bad.')
