If you rerun the experiment 10,000 times, he will show you a goat 100% of the time, either through peaking, premonition, or consistent luck.<p>The problem gets trickier because people start applying domain knowledge of stats, and treating it as a simulation with random events.  The goat being chosen is not random, it is an event that occurs 100% of the time in the premise of the thought experiment.  Thinking about the random chance of him choosing the car is outside the bounds of the axiom&#x2F;postulate we start with.<p>tldr: it doesnt matter how he opened a goat door, all that matters is that he did.')
