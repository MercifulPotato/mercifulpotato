Google has substantial engineering presence in several european countries. Just a few cities&#x2F;countries off the top of my head in no specific order: Munich, ZÃ¼rich, London, Dublin, Warsaw. There&#x27;s others, IIRC a bit on Stockholm for example, but I think those I named after among the larger presences. Anyway. Not just Germany.<p>There&#x27;s also SRE, which has a slightly different twang on how we spend our time and then interview makeup.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m not a computer science grad at all and I&#x27;m doing just fine at Google. Got hired as a senior manager, though, so YMMV.<p>Not trying to convince you of anything, just trying to be helpful. :)')
