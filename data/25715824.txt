You must concede one of only two possibilities.<p>1) The capitol building has all along been an easy soft target that could have been infiltrated by a small contingent of terrorist.<p>2) The police purposefully stood down and allowed this to happen while doing the minimum to make it seem like they tried.<p>Neither option is a good look for our country.<p>Now compound that with using this event as a popular excuse to restrict free speech, when the correct reaction should be to improve security at the capitol for any enemy.<p>If you think this goes away becuse big tech takes even moderate voices down, you don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s going on.')
