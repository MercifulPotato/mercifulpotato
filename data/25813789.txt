Item(by='cratermoon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610910406, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25807913, text='What&#x27;s the difference between saying, &quot;To do anything you have to know everything&quot;, as Eckel wrote, and &quot; the learning curve of Gradle is higher than with other build tools (say, Maven for example). I always said that the learning curve of Gradle is difficult, but once you get it, the benefit is just amazing&quot; as the author here writes?  The claim of the benefit being amazing has to be taken contextually. Maybe all that learning curve <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> bring enough of a benefit to me, my team, my project, or my company, to be worth it.<p>The rest of the article seems to be a long, roundabout, way of saying that if it seems hard then you don&#x27;t understand it correctly and you&#x27;re doing it wrong.  Great, blame the user. Say that if the user would just <i>understand</i> correctly and <i>do it the right way</i> is a classic geek response.  The one area I see the author briefly acknowledge but then move on is the documentation. He says 1. it&#x27;s huge, 2. can be better for beginners, 3. outdated in places, 4. hard to navigate (&quot;I’m quite mad about this, is that our docs layout is terrible&quot;), and 5. not use-case centered.<p>Finally, the author repeatedly states that developers shouldn&#x27;t write build logic, they should write plugins. But then he notes elsewhere that &quot;some plugin authors just don’t realize that the way they configure builds, reach to other projects or perform cross-configuration has a significant impact on build performance, and therefore user experience&quot; and again, points the finger at users.<p>I&#x27;ll repeat here what I said in another comment: trying to learn Gradle by reading the documentation is like trying to learn to drive by reading a car&#x27;s owners manual. But learning what all the knobs, buttons, levers, pedals, and handles do is <i>not</i> the same as being able to safely and efficiently travel from point A to point B.')
