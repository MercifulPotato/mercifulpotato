We&#x27;re saying don&#x27;t shoot us like you didn&#x27;t shoot them.<p>The issue is with the double standard, and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s at the root of the BLM movement. Honestly I&#x27;m surprised that some people still haven&#x27;t managed to understand what&#x27;s at the root of BLM after like all the demonstrations that happened around it.<p>Even the name of the movement: &quot;Black Lives Matters&quot; aka &quot;Blacks are not a lower class to be treated more arshly and with less humanity&quot;<p>Which is why when someone says BLM nah ALM, it&#x27;s absolutely missing the point of the movement. Cause how do you reframe that: &quot;All people are of equal class&quot;... Ok but black people aren&#x27;t treated equally so like that&#x27;s not true? That&#x27;s why there are million of black people protesting. It&#x27;s okay to maybe wonder... Wait is it true that black people are treated differently? Is it because they are black? Or is it more that poor people (happen to often be black) and are treated differently? Yes sure that&#x27;s a question one can wonder, but you don&#x27;t have to go very far at least to suspect that whatever it is, in effect, black people do get treated differently (be it because they are black or because they are poor, or because they&#x27;re less educated, etc.) The why doesn&#x27;t matter, the different treatment does, no matter what, nobody should be treated differently.<p>Sorry for the rant, but it&#x27;s tiring having to explain these basics. Of course left and right can&#x27;t even have a proper conversation around the issue when half the table doesn&#x27;t understand what is the issue to discuss.<p>And I like to remind people, this isn&#x27;t just the root of the BLM movement, this is literally the root of the United States itself. The declaration of independence:<p>&gt; We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes;')
