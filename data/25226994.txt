People try to explain why it does or doesn&#x27;t do things, often falling into &quot;just-so stories&quot; as a result, and fail to grasp just how inhuman the process is.<p>Also:<p>&gt; ie., evolution is starting with a bike and turning it into a car<p>&gt; it is not &quot;starting with raw materials&quot; and shaping them<p>I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;re drawing a distinction between evolution and abiogenesis here. You&#x27;re right, in that technically evolution doesn&#x27;t come into play until you have self-replicators of some form, but in colloquial terminology &quot;evolution&quot; is used to encompass the entire process all the way back to whatever nonliving organic chemicals formed the basis for the first life.')
