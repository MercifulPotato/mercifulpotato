Merging the pools gives an incentive for people to come to work while ill.  For example, suppose somebody has 3 PTO days remaining for the year, and they are all earmarked for Christmas vacation with family.  If that person catches the flu in early December, their options are (a) cancel Christmas plans with family or (b) go to the office anyways.<p>The two pools must be kept separate as a public health measure.  To do anything else gives a massive incentive to be a vector for illness.')
