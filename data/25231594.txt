Item(by='MinusGix', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606503527, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25228727, text='&gt; A lot of people enjoy watching a new marvel movie once or twice a year while the movies themselves are more or less reiterations of the previous ones. People seem to enjoy the repetition.<p>Honestly, I would argue against this. While they tend to do simplistic plotlines that are similar to the previous, they&#x27;re very visibly different and so do not trigger any of the usual &quot;I already watched this.&quot; that I get from watching sitcoms.<p>Though, I do agree that people at times read essays because they reiterate your thoughts back to you, but as you say I&#x27;d agree that its more comfort&#x2F;shared-experiences than the content that they&#x27;ve already seen (ex: reaction videos). At times, I&#x27;ve done this because I know an article will be able to provide an alternative view on the topic to further fuel my own reasoning, or simply helping to ground my reasoning more into words.<p>But, I do think an essay that is obviously what I already know <i>would</i> be boring. If I had to read an article about basic programming techniques, I&#x27;d be likely bored, due to having seen it all before.')
