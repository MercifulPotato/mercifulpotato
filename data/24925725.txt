It&#x27;s okay when it works â€” filtering logs with queries is the primary use case, and it&#x27;s decent at it when it&#x27;s not returning 503s. But it&#x27;s also based on Elasticsearch, inheriting all its warts. I really wish someone would build a better competitor. Loki&#x2F;Grafana isn&#x27;t anywhere close yet.<p>One of my pet peeves with ELK is how the indexer assumes all log entries have the same schema. So if one app has the &quot;error&quot; field as a string, and other logs it as an object, then ELK will reject the second one. It boggles my mind that someone thought this was a good technical design. It could <i>easily</i> suffix internal field names with its schema (type, analyzer, etc.) and then unify the fields at the UI level. But no, instead it discards log data.<p>Sluggish performance (ELK requires enormous machine researches for no particular reason, though the JVM is a major driver) and lack of support for tailing are two other pet peeves. (I have many more.)')
