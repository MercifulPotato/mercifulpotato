Like maybe you can call your fork &quot;SuperWidgetâ„¢ compatible&quot;, for a fee.<p>Dual licensing seems obvious. But maybe we need some new revenue sharing licenses better suited for cloud providers and SAAS. (A life time ago, I used libraries in my shrink-wrap. So negotiating price feels familiar to me.)<p>Libraries kinda &quot;feel&quot; like music sampling. So I&#x27;ve been skim reading how that world handles royalties. I like that they have boilerplate for all the most common scenarios.<p>I&#x27;m also alert to case studies and financial reports about existing efforts, successful, failed, or otherwise. This solution to funding might just be as simple as mimicking success.')
