I tried adding it to my original post, but it only diluted my point, so I kept it about convenience.<p>You won&#x27;t ever get rid of piracy, but you can reduce it to negligible levels by offering what people want: a reasonable price &amp; a good user experience. Music offers this currently, and piracy is pretty much a solved problem for them: only 2.9% of piracy is music [1]. I&#x27;d argue most people prefer having access to all the music they want on the device they want just a click away, for 10-15$ per month, than tracking down &amp; downloading a good-quality torrent that won&#x27;t give you a virus. Ad-sponsored versions are also an option here, and broadcast TV &amp; radio&#x27;s rich histories would indicate that&#x27;s a pretty good business model. Just don&#x27;t get greedy &amp; do both (looking at you, Cable TV).<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brandongaille.com&#x2F;21-shocking-music-piracy-statistics&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brandongaille.com&#x2F;21-shocking-music-piracy-statistic...</a>')
