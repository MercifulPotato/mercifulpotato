Benefits from company partners, wellness incentives, etc. all read something like this and you never really know who the company gave permission to contact you until the message comes. A few anecdotal email subjects, all to my work address, from a 15,000 head company on the S&amp;P 500:<p>1. &quot;Claim your check now! $1.50 is waiting for you&quot; Apparently a legitimate email refunding me for one time the vending machine failed to read my card properly (but had my work ID scanned).<p>2. &quot;You could be earning an additional $1000 per weekâ€“ find out before it&#x27;s too late&quot; Something about our 401k but included a link to some survey that HR required we fill out.<p>3. &quot;Reminder: Claim your wellness check now&quot; I expected this to contain a link to the health survey we&#x27;re supposed to complete which gives me a $5&#x2F;week discount on the health insurance I get through the company. Turns out this was actually related to some other company wellness incentive which gave us gift cards for participating in various events (bike to work month, etc.).<p>I could probably dig out more but I passed all of those along to the corporate email check to make sure and each was verified as legitimate. I&#x27;m sure plenty of other companies have made attempts to increase &quot;social engagement&quot; without realizing the consequences it has for security.')
