OK, that makes some sense.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that &quot;below&quot; is quite correct - when Social Security was started, retirement was 65 and average life expectancy was 67 or 68.  I&#x27;m pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t below 65.  But still, it was close - not 80 but keeping retirement at 65.<p>So, yes, that would work.  It would make Social Security solvent very well.  The second-order effect would probably be to increase unemployment, though, at least if you required it for people who are already retired.<p>They have moved up the retirement age, but less than the life expectancy has moved.')
