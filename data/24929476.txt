Many of those lines are closing brackets or whitespace. But moreover, optimizing for characters or LOC is absurd. Optimize for maintainability or readability, at which point Go is at least as good as Python (I would argue better). Optimize for tooling, especially package management and build tooling--Go is many times better than Python here. Optimize for performance--Go is literally hundreds or thousands of times better here. Optimize for breadth and quality of ecosystem. Optimize for deployment story (single small artifact vs hundreds of megabytes of dependencies). These are the things that matter, not lines of code.')
