Item(by='dragontamer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602965083, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24812292, text='&gt; No variable-length instructions<p>AESE &#x2F; AESMC (AES Encode, AES Mix-columns) are an instruction pair in modern ARM chips in which the pair runs as a singular fused macro-op.<p>That is to say, a modern ARM chip will see &quot;AESE &#x2F; AESMC&quot;, and  then fuse the two instructions and execute them simultaneously for performance reasons. Almost every &quot;AESE&quot; encode instruction must be followed up with AESMC (mix columns), so this leads to a significant performance increase for ARM AES instructions.')
