Because you are more likely to pay to have more access, get boosts, etc. They have optimized the site to make money, so the longer you are single the better.<p>While you might find someone on the site, I find real life is better, granted with COVID things are a bit rough now.<p>Nevermind that many people now have overinflated egos and feel they have tons of option. In the case of women I think they forget most of the thristy guys are just looking to hit it and quit it and take it as their value and worth is higher than it really is.')
