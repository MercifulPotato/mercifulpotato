They&#x27;ve censored Senator Hawley&#x27;s book.  They censored other government officials from even uttering the name &quot;Eric Ciaramella&quot;, even though he was certainly not a whistleblower and even if so, not legally entitled to such a level of privacy.<p>But to be more accurate, they&#x27;re censoring non-liberals. This is evidenced by the fact that actual dictatorial regimes with many many violent deaths on their hands are allowed access to those avenues of communication without a fraction of the editorial control than was the President of the USA.<p>Other politicians, who have the &quot;D&quot; by their name (the government equivalent of a blue checkmark apparently) are allowed to spread hoaxes and lies for years and call for harassment and violence towards their political enemies, and big tech allows it to stand.  Because they agree with it.<p>One only need to see the Googlers crying in the hallways after Hillary&#x27;s defeat in 2016 to know why.   They got their feelings hurt and vowed to never let it happen again, by any means necessary.  And they are people with significant means to control what you may or may not say in the digital public square, if they don&#x27;t simply decide to unperson you entirely.')
