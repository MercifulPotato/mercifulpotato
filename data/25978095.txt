Item(by='MaxBarraclough', descendants=None, kids=[25978372], score=None, time=1612093257, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25968760, text='&gt; The predictable consequence of this sort of statement is that someone starts going off about hospitals and terrorists and organs and moral philosophy and consent and rights and so on.<p>Except this doesn&#x27;t follow from consequentialism, although it&#x27;s not uncommon for someone to assume it does. No-one would want to live in a world where that was the norm, and it could not be kept secret, so even the most full-bore consequentialist should oppose it. A consequentialist might hold that human rights are a good idea as a means, even if they aren&#x27;t sold on the idea that they should be an end in themselves.<p>&gt; no one is literally &quot;chanting slogans&quot;. There may even be some original phrasings involved. But the conversation has been derailed.<p>This seems like a rather shallow take on what it means to be creative and original. Reciting a famous philosophical quote, say, doesn&#x27;t mean you aren&#x27;t thinking. There&#x27;s little point rephrasing it if it&#x27;s well known and succinct. The originality is in how you apply it, not in expressing it in your own words, which is really just not-invented-here in action.<p>Those are just nitpicks though. As to the core idea, it&#x27;s not terribly clear to me what <i>philosophical landmine</i> means. I think it&#x27;s meant to mean an ambiguous word or phrase that people are likely to feel strongly about, in a way that is likely to derail a conversation.<p>&gt; Avoiding landmines is your job. If it is a predictable consequence that something you could say will put people in mindless slogan-playback-mode, don&#x27;t say it.<p>Isn&#x27;t this just a way of saying you should write clearly?<p>I&#x27;m reminded of an online conversation where someone said something like:<p>&gt; <i>Humans are different from machines in that they have free will.</i><p>Quite the philosophical rabbit-hole, but it turned out they meant<p>&gt; <i>Humans are different from machines in that they are able to set their own goals.</i><p>which is much more clear and precise. I suppose <i>free will</i> is the landmine there, as it&#x27;s unclear what it really means, and just about everyone has a strong opinion about it, even people who have never read any philosophy and know nothing about the subject.')
