Gold is only worth something if other believe it is worth something. It&#x27;s use in electronics and industry only makes up around 7% of total supply [0].<p>Yet, gold isn&#x27;t a fiat asset because its value is anchored to its physical properties. It is finite and cannot be freely created. It doesn&#x27;t oxidize, is resistant to most acids and other corrosives, and has the highest specific gravity of any naturally occurring element. It is a naturally good store of value because of these properties.<p>Bitcoin also has underlying properties, but instead they are guaranteed by mathematics and game theory instead of physics. Take that as you will, but both assets are much more solid than Fed Coin (USD) which is effectively backed by the government&#x27;s commitment to enforce the federal reserve act while trying their best--and failing--to resist printing more and more money to perpetuate an unsustainable system.<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;299609&#x2F;gold-demand-by-industry-sector-share&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;299609&#x2F;gold-demand-by-in...</a>')
