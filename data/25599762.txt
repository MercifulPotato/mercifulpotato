It&#x27;s effectively a measure of how much work could not be done. From this perspective hyperinflation is just the result of the government demanding exceedingly far more work than the country as a whole can do. Prices adjust upwards until the existing money supply is exactly enough to pay for all the work that can be done.<p>If you have a lot of unemployment and inflation is low that basically means there is very little work for your people. This is the reason why 2% inflation is a policy goal. You always want there to be just a tiny little bit more work than there are workers. If there is a way to do more work thanks to technology that is increasing productivity it will be done.')
