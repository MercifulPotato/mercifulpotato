Are there any libraries you do use?<p>Do you use anything to render your view or do you construct the nodes and insert them into the DOM directly?<p>Is your centrally available object an instance of a class or is it a plain JavaScript object?<p>Does it manage the state for all your UI or is it segmented in some way?<p>How do you drive changes to your UI? Is there an imperative process that renders the UI when you know the data model has changed or is your state object an observable or something that your views subscribe to?')
