I used to periodically volunteer at a food bank regularly where we&#x27;d measure out quantities of dry products like beans or rice into individual bags. I was fine doing the work, but didn&#x27;t feel like it provided much value.<p>I started thinking about ways of using my skills (IT, tinkering, etc) and wound up regularly volunteering for an organization called Repair Cafe, where I was able to repair various things that kept said items out of landfill. Three wins: I helped people. I helped the environment by keeping electronics out of landfills and enjoyed fixeing things that other couldn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ll be volunteering there as long as they exist.')
