The lengths of corruption involved in even pursuing this story by trump and Giuliani has already caused Trump to be impeached a short while back.<p>It&#x27;s not just &#x27;pot calling kettle black&#x27;..both sides are bad logic here. Let assume the biden scandal is true: Complaining about Biden&#x27;s son getting a lucrative contract because of his last name, is like complaining about the splash from a puddle during a tsunami, ie, It&#x27;s small potatoes of the worst sort, and the willingness of the right wing to use it as a counter scandal does not bode well for Greenwald&#x27;s points when he is used a pawn for right wing interests (Tucker Carlson really..)<p><pre><code>  A more nuanced consideration of Greenwald&#x27;s actions and willingness to speak against Biden in context of Trump can be found here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.counterpunch.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;19&#x2F;lesser-of-two-evils-chomsky-vs-greenwald-and-the-ignored-factor&#x2F;  Greenwald is an Idealist and more power to him, But Is idealism better than a pragmatism in 2020 of all years? We are in the middle of a raging pandemic and society torn apart by ethnic strife. In this case between Trump   a racist, ignorant failed casino owner, and overt con man (trump u) who directly caused the deaths of thousands of people because he ignored basic scientific truths, or Biden, a lukewarm status quo (and somewhat corrupt career politician) the answer is clear for survival: Biden.</code></pre>')
