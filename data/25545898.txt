This person doesn&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about.<p>The point of FIPS is to provide a set of approved algorithms (and other standards) that are considered to be secure due to thorough analysis. Curve25519 has become widely implemented, and hasn&#x27;t been broken, and has some advantages over the other NIST-approved curves, so NIST will likely approve it.<p>Password hashing has been rapidly changing over the last few years. PBKDF2 isn&#x27;t memory-hard, but can be instantiated with only a FIPS-approved cryptographic hash. Bcrypt is OK, Scrypt has different tradeoffs, Argon2 has different tradeoffs (and even more tweakability with multiple variants), Pufferfish2 is cache-hard instead of just memory hard (so potentially better than any of the only-memory-hard systems), etc. NIST probably don&#x27;t see any reason to update the standard for a marginal improvement when they can wait for the cryptographic research in the area to stabilize.<p>There&#x27;s also a lot of research into ways to avoid having to send passwords to servers in the first place with strong asymmetric password-authenticated key exchange (sAPAKE) algorithms. So NIST might end up standardizing a password-based key derivation function separately from a PAKE system.<p>Personally I think standards should be updated a bit more frequently than they are, but I can understand NIST&#x27;s conservative stance here.')
