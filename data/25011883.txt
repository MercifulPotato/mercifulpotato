However, it has so many weird bugs that never get addressed that it&#x27;s just not worth the grief.<p>Why can&#x27;t the wired ping the wireless but the wireless can ping the wired?  Why can I connect every device except my Samsung phone?  Why is my throughput so much worse than the manufacturer firmware?  Why are the LED&#x27;s doing weird things that correspond to nothing useful?<p>I&#x27;ve never even tried IPv6 on a &lt;Foo&gt;WRT because it&#x27;s handling of basic IPv4 stuff is so dreadful.<p>(Please don&#x27;t read this is as dig on the &lt;Foo&gt;WRT developers--they&#x27;re doing their best.  However, the sheer variety of platforms, the lack of documentation, and the small number of developers simply creates an impossible situation.)')
