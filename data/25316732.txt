Item(by='dirtyid', descendants=None, kids=[25317528], score=None, time=1607191652, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25314853, text='China gets more propaganda, but average Chinese knows they&#x27;re being fed propaganda, whereas free citizens with their free 5th estate are rarely aware of when their consent is being manufactured. More highinfo&#x2F;curious Chinese are informed about the world simply because there&#x27;s a fuckload of bilingual Chinese with English fluency able to share news from across the wall. You can&#x27;t say the same about anglosphere and Chinese information literacy. The amount of absolutely ignorant western commentary on China is staggering, where as Chinese net actually has western perspectives that somewhat comport with reality.<p>At the end of the day, media that doesn&#x27;t turn society into idiots that undermine national interests has its virtues and maybe preferrable. That was once the case with tame free media before much of it turned into divisive reality TV. Similarly you can have dangerous state media that whip up nationalist frenzy, cause sectarian violence etc, or you could have boring ass state media and manage civic engagement for political serenity. All media are manipulated, all narratives shaped, blatantly manipulating media for serenity to a knowing population self-fulfilling properties. People stop giving a shit about politics, and politicians end up government instead of campaigning. Prerequisite is having a good system for selecting competent leadership in the first place.<p>This is not unambiguously endorsing state media as good, but decline of free media in many places is simply that bad. Some countries still have passable public broadcasting, but for how long, and whether commercial pivot for ads + anxiety is terminal transition.<p>For Uyghurs: under the most delusional estimates, Chinese Uyghurs still have less lifetime chance of being in a indoctrination camp than US blacks in US prison industrial complex. For much  shorter sentences. After they&#x27;ll be coerced to work in vocational program for more pay, even adjusted for exchange rate. Not US prison labour moving covid bodies tier coerced labour, but actual useful jobs designed to transition into society instead of recidivate back into for profit prisons. China actually wants to integrate minorities instead of exclude, even at extreme costs. So I suppose the answer is, it&#x27;s better to be a Chinese Uyghur in a few generations after they&#x27;ve been sinicized and integrated than a Black American in 20 years who will still be getting executed on the street and fighting equal treatment.')
