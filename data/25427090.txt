Without lymphatics, fluid would build up in body tissues, and there would be no way to alert the adaptive immune system to invading pathogens.</i><p>Something medical texts tend to not spell out:<p><i>Lymph</i> is more or less blood, minus certain blood parts (like red blood cells). And when it gets into the tissues it gets called <i>interstitial fluid</i>.<p>This is all the same fluid circulating through the body, with different elements added or removed in different contexts. It&#x27;s really quite elegant and you can think of it sort of like the water cycle. (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;water.usgs.gov&#x2F;edu&#x2F;watercycle-kids-adv.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;water.usgs.gov&#x2F;edu&#x2F;watercycle-kids-adv.html</a>)<p>Interstitial fluid would be sort of like groundwater. And like groundwater, it gets into the tissues via seepage.<p>The circulatory system would be kind of like rivers and streams.<p>So part of this fluid cycle is controlled by the pump action of the heart. When it is in your blood vessels (and I think also when it is in the lymphatic system), the heart pumps it, driving the circulation.<p>When it is out in the tissues, it is beyond the reach of the heart. And this is where things get really fascinating.<p>It is driven back to the circulatory system via two different methods, depending on where it is. The brain has a separate system from the rest of the body.<p>In the brain, the glymphatic system flushes fluids from the tissues <i>while you sleep.</i> This is a primary function of sleep and flushing these fluids out is how the body &quot;takes out the trash,&quot; which is likely why sleep deprivation is increasingly shown as associated with both the build-up of certain proteins in the brain and, ultimately, certain brain disorders.<p>In other tissues, muscle action drives the fluid back to the circulatory system. (Remember, the heart is just a big muscle. So this makes perfect sense.) So exercise dramatically increases the rate at which interstitial fluid gets returned to the circulatory system.<p>This means that one of the functions of exercise is &quot;taking out the trash.&quot; And this is likely a huge and overlooked factor in why exercise is so beneficial to your health.<p>Different sources cite different rates, but exercise may increase the outflow by as much as eight times the normal speed of outflow via seepage. It&#x27;s really a big difference.<p>If you have any health issues, understanding this human internal &quot;water cycle&quot; is something I highly recommend as enormously helpful. I sometimes take a walk to help myself feel better and I know that at least part of why that sometimes helps is it clears waste products from my tissues by pumping up the volume -- literally -- on the body taking out the trash.<p>I think that&#x27;s everything I wanted to say.')
