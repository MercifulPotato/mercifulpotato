Item(by='andrewjl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606432709, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25221831, text='Look back on your past projects and try to see common patterns where you&#x27;ve either succeeded or enjoyed the experience irrespective of outcome. They don&#x27;t necessarily need to be technical and they don&#x27;t need to be specialties. What you&#x27;re looking for is common traits of situations you&#x27;ve been effective in. Then think about what you&#x27;d enjoy doing in the future. Try to chart a path to begin getting experience in that latter area via your existing experience or knowledge.<p>There may be multiple paths and sometimes finding the best one is a process of trial and error. Your intended destination can even change midway because of what you learn in the process. It also helps to develop a unique perspective on what you&#x27;re doing, as that can help you bring you value to a project without necessarily being pigeonholed into a specialty.')
