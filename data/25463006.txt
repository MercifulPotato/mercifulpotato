But if you are mutating index variables, you have a hard case, and it probably will be easier to express with a manual loop than trying to shoehorn it into awkward functional constructs.<p>An example is the &quot;discard elements by a predicate&quot; function, aka Vec::retain in Rust, std::remove in C++. Rust implements this using a for loop. Maybe it can be done with functional constructs, but it would be harder to write and to understand.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.rust-lang.org&#x2F;src&#x2F;alloc&#x2F;vec.rs.html#1105" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.rust-lang.org&#x2F;src&#x2F;alloc&#x2F;vec.rs.html#1105</a>')
