Let me explain.<p>For example I tangentally consider meetup groups to be social media, but the entire point is that you actually meet people in real life. That led to me meeting one of my partners in 2019<p>I also do keep a Facebook around so when I meet people traveling I can just add them easily, I almost never ever use anything aside from Facebook messenger, and to maybe view a few events that my friends are organizing.<p>I think the key way to think about Facebook is that it&#x27;s original purpose, keep talking to your college friends, wasn&#x27;t bad.
