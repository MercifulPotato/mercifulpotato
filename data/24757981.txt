All companies are there to make a profit, some might have a business model that is in line with your personal moral benchmarks, but just that it’s a business model.<p>Both public and private companies can have business models that are driven by the morality of their founders and key employees but it’s still a business model.<p>Cygnus wasn’t more moral than say Oracle, they just had developed a business model around FOSS services that was unique, since they didn’t held any IP they didn’t had the tools that some people may consider immoral such as protecting their patents through law suits or worse rent seeking based on IP they hold.<p>Same goes for other companies today that primarily rely on FOSS software I don’t consider Ubuntu, Red Hat (even before the acquisition) or even Purism to be “moral” companies just because they can’t or don’t hammer someone with law suits or rake in royalties.<p>I also don’t consider opposition to companies that do to be a simple moral issue. I can and do have my own opinions about companies that I feel practice more rent seeking than actual innovation or any sort of productive activity but I don’t see it to be a particularly moral stance to want them to go into financial trouble because in the end the losers will be their employees and shareholders.<p>I much rather see companies like Oracle for example be successful based on true productivity than go into financial trouble.')
