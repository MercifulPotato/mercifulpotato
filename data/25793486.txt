Do you ever not do something because the system would get to slow for the other tasks?  These are the questions to ask<p>When asking what ALL you are doing, all is important. If the answer is one thing, then you want better single core performance.<p>If the answer is one thing in the foreground you care about, with several background things, then can you lower the priority of the background things?  If so single threaded is better.  However if the background things are important as well, then you want enough cores so that each background thing gets enough cores.   You say devops is what you do, so odds are you are someplace here.<p>As a java developer, how complex is the project when you normally build?  That is, is your normal development cycle make a change and build the one file, or make one change and rebuild a lot.  The latter is helped by more cores. Java is typically a one change means one file to build, but if you often merge changes from a large upstream project it could be the other way. (C++ is almost always build a lot of things)')
