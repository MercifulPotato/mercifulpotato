They own their whole ecosystem and that&#x27;s perfectly fine with me. At the same time people have the right to protest to put pressure on Apple not to ban it. In the end Apple should be able to do whatever they please, and if people dislike it enough they&#x27;ll switch to other ecosystems. It&#x27;s absurd for regulators to try to run Apple &quot;better&quot; than Apple itself.')
