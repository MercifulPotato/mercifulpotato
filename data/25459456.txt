Yeah they have a lot of money to throw at the problem but eventually you have to put the best, most knowledgeable people in front of those computers and do work. They can&#x27;t hire the best and brightest though, and are otherwise unwilling to make the policy changes necessary to be able to. When security professionals can make 2-3x in the private sector and smoke as much weed as they want (in this case the stereotype has some truth to it; a lot of devs&#x2F;engineers use marijuana) what incentive is there to work for one of these alphabet-soup government agencies?<p>Even if the positions paid more and had more modern drug testing policies, I have never, NOT ONCE, met someone who works in software at a government agency or at a company doing government contract work who wasn&#x27;t a massive fuddy-duddy-boomer.<p>These breaches will continue to happen until the Gov takes a more pragmatic approach to it&#x27;s technology and brings it&#x27;s culture more in line with the private sector.')
