Consumer inflation is a proxy for worker income because most of the goods or services that are indexed are the product of labor. If the stimulus arrives in the hands of workers first it will mean that worker salaries will grow ahead of inflation.<p>&gt;If anything, stuff like global currencies ($, â‚¬) bail out their respective owners because they&#x27;re world reserve currencies. Some of the smaller Eurozone countries would have definitely defaulted, had hyperinflation, etc, without the Euro. Now they&#x27;re in recession instead, which sucks a lot but still less than the alternative.<p>They are in recession because of a lack of demand for domestic workers which is basically the problem that moderate inflation would solve.<p>Just look at these charts:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;225698&#x2F;monthly-inflation-rate-in-eu-countries&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;225698&#x2F;monthly-inflation...</a><p>Inflation is high in Poland and Hungary. Does this mean they suffer from problems? Actually no it&#x27;s the opposite.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;268830&#x2F;unemployment-rate-in-eu-countries&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;268830&#x2F;unemployment-rate...</a><p>Poland has the second lowest unemployment rate and Hungary is still well below the EU average. Please bear in mind that this chart only shows the inflation rate in August. I chose this chart because it is a easy to read bar chart. Some numbers may be outliers but the general trend will be the same no matter what chart you look at.')
