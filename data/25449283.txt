Item(by='colonelanguz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608155562, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25449106, text='Standing and merits are both terms of art. Merits essentially means whether one side wins or not. Standing OTOH is a preliminary matter like jurisdiction. If the court lacks jurisdiction over the defendant or the subject matter of the dispute, they kick the case on jurisdiction without reaching the merits. If the plaintiff doesn&#x27;t have standing, they kick the case on standing without reaching the merits.<p>Your confusion is 100% reasonable because there is _conceptual_ overlap between standing and &quot;who wins.&quot; For example, one aspect of standing is &quot;injury-in-fact.&quot; That means &quot;you suffered a harm recognized by the legal system.&quot; If the court says no standing because no injury-in-fact, to a layperson that&#x27;s similar to saying &quot;stop crying, go home.&quot; Which sounds a lot like saying &quot;you lose the case.&quot;')
