Item(by='filoleg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604365607, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24973960, text='&gt;What does a journalist know about verifying video data?<p>I don&#x27;t think the parent comment was using journalists as a specific group of people who should be the ones in charge of verifying video data. I took it more as &quot;we need a dedicated group of people for verifying video data, similarly to how we had journalists verifying all other sorts of data for their articles since the dawn of journalism&quot;.<p>Goes without saying, but, also, the parent comment was clearly alluding to the &quot;verification by journalists&quot; in a traditional sense of proper investigative journalism, not &quot;journalism&quot; that is based on pulling random tweets without context from random no-names.')
