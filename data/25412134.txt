I’ve experienced far more danger, riding in downtown Seattle, using or circumventing the dedicated lanes that have been installed. And the presence of those lanes has led drivers to completely forget the law (that bicycles are allowed in traffic), leading to numerous terrifying interactions where drivers are angered at my mere presence even if I’m in no way impeding their travel.<p>With sharrows, drivers and cyclists have a shared understanding and expectation of what the appropriate traffic flow is supposed to be. With separate lanes, I have drivers trying to blindly turn through me and very consciously try to run me off the road. No contest.<p>I’m not saying this should be every cyclist’s preference, just sharing my experience (which honestly can be pretty terrifying in a situation designed for my safety).')
