Type 1 diabetes is _a lot_ harder to manage than simply taking long acting insulin and you can go about your day regularly. Almost anything you ingest has the ability to raise your glucose levels and a single dose of insulin is not enough.<p>Having long lasting insulin can be potentially deadly if not administered properly as it can tank your glucose levels and make you hypoglycemic. You need to be aware of your glucose levels and eat something to increase it if it starts going down below healthy levels. For example, if you take too much of the long acting insulin late at night, it&#x27;s possible your insulin levels drop during the night and you&#x27;re not awake to do anything about it (this is one of the reasons people use sensors, it&#x27;ll ring an alarm if your glucose levels are too low&#x2F;high).<p>Some people also use a combination of a 1 or 2 long-lasting insulin doses as a base and use short-lived insulin for small adjustments throughout the day.')
