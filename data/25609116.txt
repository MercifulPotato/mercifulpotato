Whether itâ€™s OK to go to that thing or not<p>This part really resonated.  What a weird year it&#x27;s been.  Finding the right balance between having a social life and being safe + conscientious has proven to be exhausting and depressing.<p>My wife and I have chosen to be super safe and turn down almost all social engagements, even ones with close family who promised to wear masks and social distance.  If it wasn&#x27;t a life or death thing, we felt the &quot;right&quot; thing to do was to host the even on Zoom, or not at all.<p>That decision never came lightly though and missing events with friends and family always weighed on us heavily.  We&#x27;d never know if we were doing the right thing or if we were being too cautious.  Especially when, on Facebook or Instagram, we would see close friends without masks hanging out and partying, while we sequestered ourselves from the rest of the world.<p>It&#x27;s hard not to have emotions in a situation like that.  At times I have felt frustrated, angry, tired, etc.  Everyone has a different perspective on this whole thing, a different feeling of risk, and a difference decision about how to behave during it all.  I long for the day when we can be human again without having to pass every social decision through some matrix of risk calculation.')
