Item(by='TheBobinator', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604316688, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24964646, text='This article hasn&#x27;t been grammer checked, uses a lot of recent, sensationalist words, doesn&#x27;t ask questions directly except at the end, provides no new or interesting information on Mileva, her accomplishments or her day to day, her kids and family, background, or their accomplishments.  I conclude with no picture of what her life was like.<p>It&#x27;s substance consists fully of vague diatribes about why Mileva didn&#x27;t get credit for general relativity, asking vague, emotional questions that can easily be construed as accusations without providing new information or answers.<p>It is, by definition, trite and spin and poisons the news feed of HN.  If it&#x27;s a slow news day, it&#x27;s a slow news day.<p>This reminds me of slashdot back in the early 2010&#x27;s after Cowboy McNeal sold it off to I think it was Dice.  Every day there was minimum 1-2 SJW Agenda pieces; initially they were recieved warmly but as the material got more and more radical over time, the community realized what was going on and turned extremely vitriolic.  Then they drew an unbelievable amount of automated bot spam and even people with old accounts became hostile and left.  Towards the end, they got sneakier and sneakier about the agenda pieces; you&#x27;d see one about an obvious feminist topic draw ire and a tremendous amount of vitriol, then another about &quot;How do I help my daughter learn STEM\\Electronics&quot;.  Articles like the ladder became more common and people began ignoring them.  Eventually the community left and all you had were a bunch of hateful people left.  BizX stopped posting those pieces after buying the site a few years backl; They have a different agenda mostly inline with their financial portfolio.<p>I remember when the site had minimum 300-400 responses per article, many of which were tremendously useful, with some articles hitting 1000-2000 and it did that on every article.  Today they&#x27;re lucky to hit 100 and most of that, these days, looks like astroturf.')
