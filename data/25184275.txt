They get paid for increasing profit<p>This is not a law of nature. Different cultural norms yields different business priorities.\nThe fact of the matter is that money is only a surrogate for value, it is not the actual thing. Current business teaching has ideologically put the money hoarders in charge where increasing their profits is the only appropriate moral behavior. This yields a legitimacy and incentive for shortermist thinking.<p>Equating money with value builds a distorted view of what humans actually value. Money is not ideal in representing the value of stability, fairness or compassion. these are very basic human values which are shared by most of us, yet money cannot encode these faithfully.<p>We shouldn&#x27;t accept the side effects of our choice to use money as surrogate for value as some form of natural law.')
