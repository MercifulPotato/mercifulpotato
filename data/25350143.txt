It works out very well. The idea of our poor Kafka cluster having to field queries in addition to the load of acting as a transport layer is frightening. The &#x27;superpower&#x27; Kafka gives you is the ability to turn back time if something goes wrong and the ability to orchestrate really big pipeline. You have to build or buy a fair bit of tooling to make it work though.')
