We&#x27;re talking about a simple statistical mapping between two boolean properties: skin tone and citizenship. You stipulated already that, for a given light-skinned person, the algorithm (machine or human) will return &quot;non-citizen&quot; with 99% confidence, and that that confidence interval is correct.<p>As far as I can tell, we can conclude from those facts that there is no bias (maybe I&#x27;m wrong, but I consider bias to be an errant belief); however, there are still potential issues:<p>* For what applications is 99% confidence acceptable? Can we do better by avoiding a statistical analysis altogether, e.g., by using citizenship records?<p>* Do we really believe&#x2F;trust that humans are capable of 99% confidence (calling into question the fact that you established in your original post)?<p>* Are users of this algorithm rounding 99% up to 100%, thus disenfranchising one group 1% of the time (as opposed to distributing the error proportionately between the two groups)?')
