I think there are more important things in life than meeting the arbitrary expectations of society. And I think a better lesson to take away from childhood is that hard work is valuable and important.<p>I think that for me (and I suspect for you as well though I wouldn&#x27;t presume to say for sure), while my outcomes have been good without having internalized a high value for hard work, it could have only been better if I had. It&#x27;s true that I can get quite far on the power of privilege and intellect alone, but I&#x27;m convinced I would get much farther still with a better work ethic. And that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d prefer for my children.')
