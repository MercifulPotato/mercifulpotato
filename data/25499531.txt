I&#x27;m building an exploratory game project in Rust to test the waters for switching to it from C++ for a professional project. Initially I was hesitant because I didn&#x27;t really care about memory safety, so I didn&#x27;t want to pay some mental overhead for something I didn&#x27;t care about. But after using Rust for a while, I&#x27;d hands-down choose it over C++, even for projects where I feel like I don&#x27;t care about either memory safety or even maintainability like single player games. The ergonomics are just so much better, the package manager exists (and is good), and the constraints placed on the architecture really just result in the program being easier to grow.<p>So while safety and maintainability are what Rust gets marketed for, the ergonimics and just overall productivity of the language is enough to sell me on it for game dev. Languages like Zig and Jai also seem interesting in this space, but they&#x27;re far from being ready to do anything in production with. The Rust ecosystem is actually ready for production now, and the language is a pleasure to work with.')
