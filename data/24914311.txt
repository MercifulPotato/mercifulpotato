Or you might have something caused by your living habits which also makes low vitamin D levels more likely.<p>I.e. as far as I know studies could only find statistic relevance for correlation (in some cases) but no statistic relevance for causation.<p>Idk, but it might literally be as simple as unhealthy older people being more likely to have vitamin D deficit and also being more likely to have worse COVID syntoms.')
