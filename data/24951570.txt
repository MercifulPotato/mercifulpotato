I mean it is going to be MY HOUSE, something I plan to live in for many years (in my case I like to wait longer, build a house exactly the way I want it, and live for the rest of life in it). I want to buy project and &quot;own&quot; the project in a sense to be able to open it and modify.<p>I also want to be able to simulate the heck out of MY future home before it&#x27;s build. Using fast computers we have today I can try different sizes, shapes and properties of windows, walls and doors, adjust heating, cooling, plumbing, airflow, home automations and countless other things. I can see how the sun would enter the home (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;floyd.lbl.gov&#x2F;radiance&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;floyd.lbl.gov&#x2F;radiance&#x2F;</a>) before foundations are laid. Sure, most people don&#x27;t want to do that and that&#x27;s okay. Most people also don&#x27;t want to look at the source of programs they are using. I do and even when I don&#x27;t, I love to have this possibility open.<p>I understand, that so far Autodesk dominated the architecture software, but since they are moving&#x2F;moved to subscription-based plans I hope that more and more architects will move away from subscription-based software. For their own good. I wouldn&#x27;t gamble tools of my trade on something that can be taken away from me any moment and hope they also wouldn&#x27;t.<p>FreeCAD BIM &amp; company work to make it possible and for that I am very grateful. It would be great if in next decades we would have something like open source catalogue of great solutions in home building.')
