From <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamanetwork.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;jamacardiology&#x2F;fullarticle&#x2F;10.1001&#x2F;jamacardio.2020.3557" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamanetwork.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;jamacardiology&#x2F;fullarticle&#x2F;...</a> :<p>&gt; In this study of a cohort of German patients recently recovered from COVID-19 infection, CMR revealed cardiac involvement in 78 patients (78%) and ongoing myocardial inflammation in 60 patients (60%), independent of preexisting conditions, severity and overall course of the acute illness, and time from the original diagnosis. These findings indicate the need for ongoing investigation of the long-term cardiovascular consequences of COVID-19.<p>Note that this study includes a group of COVID survivors who have recently recovered, and 2 control groups: healthy, age-matched participants, and a group of risk-factor matched control patients.  It is published in JAMA Cardiology.<p>Obviously, this study doesn&#x27;t say anything about <i>truly</i> long-term consequences of COVID, but that, IMO, is more because we haven&#x27;t had time to reach &quot;long-term&quot; status yet.  I would give it at least another 6 months to a year before making up my mind about the incidence of long-term consequences.')
