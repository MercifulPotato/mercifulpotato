Why would they do it? Votes?<p>The &#x27;carriage&#x27; fee, ie the fee used to transport the electricity will grow quite a lot as the entity in charge of that finds reason to charge that much more and gov. will find reasons to tax.<p>There&#x27;s the cost of electricity - but also distributors and government in that equation.<p>If the cost of making parts for the Google Phone were $1, and there were only 1 type of phone in the US and everyone had to have one ... would Google drop the price of the phone? Probably not. They would capture more surpluses.<p>This will be the same everywhere.<p>If electricity were purchased at &#x27;independent stations&#x27; etc it would be another story entirely. As energy got cheaper, power usage would increase, and efficiency of households would go down.')
