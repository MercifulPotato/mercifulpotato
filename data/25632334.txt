Who&#x27;s right? Probably we&#x27;ll never know, but just for having the other numbers out there, here they are:<p>- Lancet survey (March 2003 – July 2006): 654,965 (95% CI: 392,979–942,636)<p>- Opinion Research Business (March 2003 – August 2007): 1,033,000 (95% CI: 946,258–1,120,000)<p>- Iraq Family Health Survey (March 2003 – July 2006): 151,000 (95% CI: 104,000–223,000)<p>- PLOS Medicine Study (March 2003 – June 2011): 405,000 (95% CI: 48,000–751,000)<p>Only Opinion Research Business[1] seems to put the upper bound above 1 million.<p>Rather than going for the &quot;Lancet Surveys&quot; page on Wikipedia, you&#x27;ll probably get a better view when reading through the general page of &quot;Casualties of the Iraq War&quot; - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Casualties_of_the_Iraq_War" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Casualties_of_the_Iraq_War</a><p>Also, hestefisk (which you&#x27;re replying to) are talking about Middle East, not just Iraq. US sure has killed a lot more people in Middle East than just the ones that died in Iraq.<p>&gt; being caught in the middle of a civil war is challenging<p>Not sure we&#x27;re talking about the same war here. As far as I know, the US invaded both Afghanistan and Iraq in recent times (so no civil war), pretty sure we&#x27;re referring to those events (post 9&#x2F;11), not the civil wars that were happening there before that.')
