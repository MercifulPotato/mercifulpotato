It did not mention the pandemic.<p>Most people who already considered these were a waste of resources probably didn&#x27;t bother talking about it much. Now they are, because they have a clear rallying point to shout about.<p>I&#x27;m very pro-space exploration, and I think highlighting those priorities right now is absurd. Imagine being someone who already thought they were a distraction from more immediate needs seeing this tweet.<p>EDIT: I should clarify, their first reply to that tweet went on to mentioning a vaccine, but most people just saw the first tweet.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;gop&#x2F;status&#x2F;1319715289328766980" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;gop&#x2F;status&#x2F;1319715289328766980</a>')
