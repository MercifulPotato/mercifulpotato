My uncle was put in prison for over a decade for robbing banks in the UK.  He slept with a shotgun under his pillow (the police found it there when they arrested him).<p>Believe it or not criminals do have guns in the UK (police confiscate guns all the time), as well as as other weapons which are illegal (swords, machetes, nun-jucks). Recently police raided a warehouse (near where I live) where they were making firearms.<p>Also I am pretty sure guns were illegal in Northern Ireland as well and plenty of terrorists and criminals had them at the time.<p>It really annoys me when people try to claim the opposite (or gaslight me) by saying &quot;well they banned all the guns that means that there isn&#x27;t any&quot; because I know it isn&#x27;t true.')
