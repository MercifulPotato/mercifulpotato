They are constantly increasing prices by improving the speed of each plan for free (until they set the prices the next year). This speed increase eliminated some of the lower priced tiers, like 25Mb. The next step up for me is I think 40Mb at $80.<p>These no competition here since providers are forced to pay a franchise fee to the local government. With lower population towns, it&#x27;s just uneconomical for a second provider to come in. Seems like the law is anticompetitive.')
