A giant hurdle (but not the only one) is NATO and being able to counter Russia.  While NATO and the EU are separate, many countries are members of both.  If the EU took a hard stance and said that they value trade with China more than the US&#x27;s security complaints, the US could very well use that as an excuse to pull troops out of Europe.  And if anyone thinks that doesn&#x27;t matter, just know that a Russian invasion (or more likely erosion of borders) is something that terrifies EU leaders far more than missing out on sales to China.')
