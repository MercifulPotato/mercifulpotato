The increased crime has been <i>induced</i> for the following reasons:<p>1. Drug addicted vagrants are ubiquitous because the city doesn&#x27;t enforce laws and instead enables this lifestyle by looking the other way. These addicts very often steal things like food that are easy to fence and barter for drugs.<p>2. Our city and county prosecutors don&#x27;t actually bring charges&#x2F;accountability against criminals.<p>3. The police department has far fewer officers per capita than comparable cities, and simply cannot spend time on investigating and catching suspects.<p>The revolving door of people committing low-level crimes is so bad that Seattle businesses have released reports on this problem (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.documentcloud.org&#x2F;documents&#x2F;5752913-SYSTEM-FAILURE-Prolific-Offender-Report-February.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.documentcloud.org&#x2F;documents&#x2F;5752913-SYSTEM-FAILU...</a>) and written letters to politicians asking for help (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.documentcloud.org&#x2F;documents&#x2F;5752914-Prolific-Offenders-Report-Transmittal-Letter-2.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.documentcloud.org&#x2F;documents&#x2F;5752914-Prolific-Off...</a>) only to be ignored. Unfortunately the growing problem of low-level crimes with no consequence for criminals has also jaded residents to the point that they don&#x27;t even bother reporting most property crimes - after all, if criminals don&#x27;t face consequences and insurance requires a deductible, there is simply no benefit to spending time on reporting things.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt that some number of people who are shoplifting food are trying to be productive members of society, displaying personal responsibility, and just need some support to get back on their feet. For them, I hope we can improve programs like SNAP (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fns.usda.gov&#x2F;snap&#x2F;supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fns.usda.gov&#x2F;snap&#x2F;supplemental-nutrition-assista...</a>) to provide more benefits (higher spending limits for healthier food) with less red tape (less stringent eligibility requirements).<p>But around me and in other West coast cities I&#x27;ve been to, those committing these crimes are very often not deserving of sympathy and are willfully not being good citizens. To bring the constituency on board, we need to address both sides of this equation. We need to start enforcing laws and holding criminals accountable, while helping those who are deserving and in need. Otherwise, the rest of us are not going to be onboard with simply allowing criminals to commit crime.')
