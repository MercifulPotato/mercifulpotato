Amazon did that with a lot of competitors.<p>Amazon did that by offering superior prices, customer service, product range, delivery, etc. That&#x27;s only a problem <i>if</i> Amazon raises prices or cuts quality after it&#x27;s competitors are vanquished. What we&#x27;ve observed is just the opposite. Amazon continue to relentlessly push lower prices, better customer experience and faster delivery.<p>Competition is not a goal in and of itself. It&#x27;s merely a means to the end of improving consumer welfare. Antitrust law is careful about this distinction. It&#x27;s not illegal to be a monopoly because you delight you consistently delight your customers much than your competitors. In fact just the opposite, restraining a superior product from growing its marketshare would be actively harmful to consumer welfare.')
