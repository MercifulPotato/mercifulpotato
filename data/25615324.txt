The way MacOS handles resolution (that’s not perfect 1x or 2x scaling) is by rendering at twice the resolution you selected in settings and then downscaling to the true resolution of the monitor. So if you want to render at 1440p you render at 5k then downscale to 4K. What I believe the parent was trying to get across is that 5k downscaled to 4K looks better than true 1440p. Although it does tax the GPU more, many people would agree it’s worth it over 1440p.')
