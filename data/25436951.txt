You also need opt in from both the client and server.<p>I wish there was a client side library that implemented GraphQL as an abstraction over REST, GraphQL or other backend APIs.  It would be nice to use some of the GraphQLs query&#x2F;join features across several backend services without those services having to change.  Imagine being able to merge a vendor API that can provide a tracking number with FedEx&#x27;s API, for example.')
