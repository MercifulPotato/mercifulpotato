This  means  that  all  security  logs  for  the  day  after  the  election,  on election day, and prior to election day are gone. Security logs are very important to  an  audit  trail,  forensics,  and  for  detecting  advanced  persistent  threats  and outside  attacks,  especially  on  systems  with  outdated  system  files.  These  logs would  contain  domain  controls,  authentication  failures,  error  codes,  times  users logged  on  and  off,  network  connections  to  file  servers  between  file  accesses, internet   connections,   times,   and   data   transfers. Other   server   logs   before November 4, 2020 are present; therefore, there is no reasonable explanation for the security logs to be missing. &quot;')
