But here is an attempt to answer it:<p>A complex enough app will require modifications to the auth flow. Most services achieve that via webhooks or by forcing devs to write code in their &quot;dashboard&quot;. This code would then live outside the main codebase which is annoying. So we thought that if someone was making their own auth, they would want to have all their code in their backend API itself. The best way to allow that was to hide the auth server behind their API server (which is a proxy to the auth server for certain APIs like sign up &#x2F; sign in etc..)')
