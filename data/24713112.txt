Put modeled fake units in a physics simulation engine (like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.unity3d.com&#x2F;Manual&#x2F;PhysicsSection.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.unity3d.com&#x2F;Manual&#x2F;PhysicsSection.html</a>) and stochastically seed millions of virtual units with minor differences and virtually test to failure.<p>This would result in a much stronger measure of &#x27;best&#x27; durable, that then, the crowd-sourced reviews would, hopefully, reiterate.')
