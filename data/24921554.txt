Item(by='samwillis', descendants=None, kids=[24922509, 24921627], score=None, time=1603905963, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24920043, text='What is the license for the finished pcb design if you use this service?<p>I believe most Sparkfun designs are &quot;Creative Commons Share-Alike&quot; [0], but they are a little confusing as to their interpretation of that license [1]. My reading of that license is that if I base my commercial product (consumer, not for the hobbyist market) on one of their designs but make changes to the pcb design (such as additions and the shape) I would have to release my design to the public (which I would not want to do)?<p>But here [1] they seem to contradict that and suggest all you have to do is attribute some of the design to them?<p>I ask because this seems to be a really good way to get to a mk1+n prototype but obviously before going to mass production you are likely going to want to make changes, potentially large ones. If your final (very different) design has a lineage back to a CCSA licensed design then technically your final design would have to be shared for free.<p>Obviously the CCSA license is important for them to protect their core business, the hobbyist market, and ensure competitors don&#x27;t just steel their designs.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;creativecommons.org&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;by-sa&#x2F;4.0&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;creativecommons.org&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;by-sa&#x2F;4.0&#x2F;</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sparkfun.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;1852" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sparkfun.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;1852</a>')
