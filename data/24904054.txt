Underdone for holidays and accessing through private land sure, but they get a lot else right and (as an Australian) I&#x27;m quite envious of how broad the outdoor appreciation is across all age categories, especially at college age.<p>The national parks are epic. State parks and national forests have great access opportunities given the NPs are often busy. In the west especially, there is a lot of BLM land to use and get away from everyone.
