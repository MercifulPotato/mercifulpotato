But even when this is not possible, common CPU architectures include instructions that can apply the offset at no extra cost, see  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;28032685&#x2F;is-there-a-performance-penalty-for-one-based-array-indexing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;28032685&#x2F;is-there-a-perf...</a> , so 1-based indexing is just as fast.')
