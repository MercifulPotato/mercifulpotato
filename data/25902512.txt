Item(by='creata', descendants=None, kids=[25903745], score=None, time=1611578745, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25902145, text='Right, the homepage definitely isn&#x27;t built for regular people right now. The process for getting started seems to be:<p><pre><code>    go to matrix.org &gt; click &quot;Try Now&quot; &gt; get redirected to element.io &gt; click &quot;Open in your browser&quot; &gt; allow it to use IndexedDB &gt; create an account &gt; start messaging\n</code></pre>\nI have tiny grievances with every step of this process: matrix.org is filled with too much jargon; &quot;try now&quot; sounds like some kind of trial; redirections to totally different websites are scary; the relationship between Matrix and Element isn&#x27;t clear; the stock photo-ish background on app.element.io is a bit tacky; asking for browser permissions on page load is rude; the account creation page makes the &quot;edit homeserver&quot; button fairly prominent but doesn&#x27;t tell us what it does in plain language; I should have been told that you can invite people by email <i>before</i> I clicked &quot;send a direct message&quot;; adding an email to invite <i>asynchronously</i> pulls up a &quot;terms of service&quot; dialog.<p>There&#x27;s a lot to love about Matrix, so I hope it becomes easier for people to get started with it.')
