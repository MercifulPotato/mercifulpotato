Is there a side-by-side comparison of radar and visible wavelength somewhere? Or maybe a version of the geometric diagrams with example objects and the imagery they’d produce?<p>EDIT: Ok, after Googling this a little I think I get it. The skyscrapers are upside-down. (I think?) The radar is measuring slant-range distance, and due to the viewing angle, the tops of the skyscrapers are closer to the radar than the bases. So the tops of the buildings are closer to the bottom of the image.<p>Since the skyscrapers are in the “wrong” place in the image, they get blended with ground features that are in the “right” place.<p>Is that right?')
