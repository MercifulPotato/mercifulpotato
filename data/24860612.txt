This is not always the case. And the argument is that torture can and does work not that it always works. In the context of a password that I know you know and we can type in right now to make it stop, this will be effective.If you don&#x27;t think the torture will ever stop and just want a &#x27;fuck you&#x27; then you may keep quite. When your kids&#x2F;family are brought in the &#x27;fuck you&#x27; mentality goes out the window. Torture works, but it&#x27;s like war. You have to go all in. This isn&#x27;t a pro torture argument necessarily. But saying torture never works is dishonest and tanamount to saying I would keep all my secrets while being tutored to death, which I know I wouldn&#x27;t.')
