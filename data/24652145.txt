Do you also feel that eyeglasses, hearing aids, and other personal assistance devices are &#x27;useless&#x27; just because you personally don&#x27;t need them?<p>Someone who is capable of using autocode - who has the technical capability to <i>write code</i> - may not need something like Zapier.<p>On the other hand, it took me 5 minutes with Zapier to set up a fully automated system that takes a line from a spreadsheet and populates a calendar, sends a calendar invite, and sends some follow up emails for a charity thing I run. It saves me tons of time, and I never have to think about it, nor did I have to write a single line of code against an API that will change shortly for I forget how all of my code works.')
