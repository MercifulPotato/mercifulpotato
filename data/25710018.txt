Item(by='beerandt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610252838, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25709050, text='1) &gt;As far as I&#x27;m aware, there is no credible research to demonstrate Chinese conducts large influence operations<p>I didn&#x27;t mean to imply that they currently do. (Or don&#x27;t. Idk.) Just that it&#x27;s an area of major concern, where we&#x27;ll be vulnerable as a country and lack parity.<p>But as you say, interesting possibilities.<p>2) &gt;IMO The ballpoint anecdote has been severely misinterpreted...<p>I&#x27;m aware, but it&#x27;s still a very relevant case-study. I&#x27;m not making fun of them- Manufacturing is hard.<p>You&#x27;re correct, in that it was a lack of high precision, high quality manufacturing, and yes,  they are catching up quickly...<p>But there&#x27;s still a gap (for now) in this area, especially when 1) there is institutional knowledge required to make something correctly, and 2) said knowledge is non-public, a trade-secret, or similarly-restricted, and 3) no one has opened a factory to willingly transfer such knowledge to Chinese factory workers.<p>I believe one example is in industrial tooling, but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s still true.<p>More abstractly:<p>When so much industrial knowledge in a country has come from external sources... Find out what they haven&#x27;t had to learn on their own.<p>What capabilities will be missing or disadvantaged within their war-machine? Exploit them.<p>-Obviously China has its own ability to research and invent things (on its own), and I&#x27;m not implying that can&#x27;t. But we&#x27;re taking about competitive advantage and looking for weaknesses here.')
