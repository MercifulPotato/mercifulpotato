Are the trade-offs those types of solutions make still valid for this type of hardware?<p>RocksDB, and LSM algorithms in general, seem to be designed with the assumption that random block I&#x2F;O is slow. It appears that, for modern hardware, that assumption no longer holds, and the software only slows things down [0].<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BLepers&#x2F;KVell&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;sosp19-final40.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BLepers&#x2F;KVell&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;sosp19-final40....</a>')
