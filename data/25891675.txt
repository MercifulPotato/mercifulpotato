It&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t nice and, in fact, lead me to try working from an office again.<p>And what can I say. While yes, when I moved back in the office I loved socializing more, I soon became miserable again.<p>See, suddenly I couldn&#x27;t lie down on my couch anymore for a quick rest. I couldn&#x27;t &quot;let my self go&quot;. Meditate. I had much more fast food and started to feel stressed and sick.<p>So I went back to home office.\nAnd indeed it&#x27;s true what another commentor said here: WFH during covid is much different from WFH in normal times as me and other WFH friends made it a habbit of working together. You can visit cafe, work from park benches or convert your parent&#x27;s place into your mega office while they&#x27;re on vacation.<p>Ultimately, I ended up renting a room for myself. Now, you say it&#x27;s an office. I say it&#x27;s a cosy room that&#x27;s 10min bike ride away from my home... I wouldn&#x27;t call it office, but also not home.<p>PS:<p>Maybe it&#x27;s what some people call an Attelier.')
