You own a license which can be very restrictive, and you own a physical medium (i.e. the disk itself)<p>You cannot copy that disk, you can&#x27;t play it in front of large audiences, you can&#x27;t modify it and redistribute it etc. You don&#x27;t own it, and the license can be revoked and changed at any point. It&#x27;s not practical to always enforce this, but you agreed to the license when you purchased it, it&#x27;s the same with online media, it&#x27;s just easier to enforce, hence you see more application of licenses with online mediums.')
