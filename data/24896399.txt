It&#x27;s definitely not usable for everything you normally use domain names for (like showing people the menu at a restaurant.)<p>I will point out that you don&#x27;t need to do any extra work to access web servers on TOR at least. I think cloudfront (and I know others) run a proxy that lets you access them with just a normal URL via a web browser. Most OSes need no extra configuration for .local.')
