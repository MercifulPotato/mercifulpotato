Only with naked shorting can there be more shares traded than float, as in the parent&#x27;s example. Interestingly, in both cases the short interest can be greater than 100%.<p>My understanding is that naked shorting can be used to artificially lower the stock price by increasing the supply with the ultimate goal of driving the company into bankruptcy.<p>So on one side you have illegal(?) market manipulation benefiting sophisticated traders and on the other you have companies that are presumably creating jobs and generating something of value being destroyed as a result of financial engineering.<p>You can decide if that&#x27;s upsetting or not.')
