Even though it’s just as misleading in C++. This:<p><pre><code>    int a = 0;\n    int&amp; x = a, y = a;\n</code></pre>\ndeclares x to be a reference, but y an independent variable. Similarly, a template parametrised by a variadic pack of function pointers is declared thus:<p><pre><code>    template &lt;void (*...x)(void)&gt;\n</code></pre>\nIt’s a good thing I don’t work in C++ too often, because my forehead would have probably sustained noticeable injury from all the facepalming each time I see ‘int&amp; x’ instead of ‘int &amp;x’ and ‘typename... T’ instead of ‘typename ...T’.')
