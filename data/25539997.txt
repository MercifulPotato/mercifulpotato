Cut off the UK from the rest of the world and the rest of the world can&#x27;t benefit from it.<p>Also, it&#x27;s almost certain that the UK strain is in the US already, and the US is shit at dealing with pandemics once they&#x27;re on our soil.  Border closures only work if your test&#x2F;trace&#x2F;isolate institutions and compliance with social distancing is good enough to eradicate the virus from within your borders; they prevent reinfection in that case.  The US has shown we&#x27;re completely incapable of that, so it really doesn&#x27;t matter.')
