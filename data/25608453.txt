Item(by='oh_sigh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609543724, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25607397, text='I&#x27;ve worked at a FANG for a decade and it&#x27;s basically my dream job. I&#x27;m not trying to level up, so I don&#x27;t work that much, and it provides my family and I with more than enough money to do whatever we want. For example last year I took 4 months leave without any complaints from management, or concerns of budgeting, and traveled around western and northern europe. What&#x27;s not to like? Maybe my difference from the author is I don&#x27;t look for emotional or intellectual fulfillment from my job - it&#x27;s something I do so I can have the freedom to pursue those goals outside of work.')
