A vast majority of the projects never leave the beta phase and only a select few are relatively stable and regularly updated. That aside, the community aspect is even more vital in my experience. Unless you&#x27;re an expert and understand the inner workings of the project, you&#x27;re going to have to rely on documentation and community tutorials and starter projects.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t for example know if something is even possible to achieve with a project unless someone had a repository showcasing how it is done, which has made me wary of betting on anything too immature. I just don&#x27;t have the skills to bridge the gap myself.<p>Personally, I&#x27;ve stuck with Jekyll up to last year for these reasons, but right when COVID hit I started to delve into 11ty. I can say that it has been nothing short of a delight and the community is pretty stellar as well. I&#x27;m currently experiencing build times measured in milliseconds instead of minutes or so. I&#x27;ve been impressed and the project is developed actively and each update brings very concrete upgrades every time. Currently, I have the honor of sitting on top of the  performance leaderboard for 11ty. Over half of the 400 sites there scores full marks in Google Lighthouse scores which should tell you something.')
