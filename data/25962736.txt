There is no context, but it&#x27;s just not directly applicable.<p>Yes, if Robinhood is letting people trade on margin, then Robinhood needs to have the cash to support that margin. That is one thing. And they have largely, as far as I know, disabled that already.<p>The other part is that they are required to have reserves and collateral for trades that are &quot;cash&quot; until they settle, as all brokerages are. I am not an expert here, but my understanding is that this requirement increases as volatility goes up, as as correlation of trades goes up (ie, if all of the volume is in a couple stocks, it&#x27;s highly correlated, and thus the reserve requirement is higher). This must be, by regulation, <i>Robinhood&#x27;s money</i> (ie, not customer funds), and Robinhood just didn&#x27;t have the money to keep opening new positions.<p>As for the underlying <i>why</i> of the requirement, I don&#x27;t know. I assume it has something to do with preventing brokerages from accepting increasingly risk trades during high volatility events (which, ya, is what&#x27;s happening right now). But either way, it&#x27;s the current rule, and as a brokerage, they have to follow it.')
