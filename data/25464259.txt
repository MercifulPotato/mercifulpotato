It is not a container because it&#x27;s just files with no specification for its runtime. Unlike JAR, it is language agnostic. These bundles could be compiled and compressed on your local machine then scp&#x27;d to a server that knows how to execute this bundle. If I recall correctly, it was some open source project from a big company.<p>I&#x27;ve spent hours trying to find it again and am wondering if I might be remembering something from a dream.')
