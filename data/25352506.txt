They are the best for working out at the gym, so I went for them, after trying some alternatives.<p>The phone I used them with first was the Pixel 2. They worked perfectly fine. The only heartburn I had was once I had paired them with my Macbook, the bluetooth connection would prefer the Macbook over the phone, which was sometimes annoying.<p>Others might be upset at the lack of support for the Google Assistant, but for actually using the headphones, there was nothing better, even on Android.')
