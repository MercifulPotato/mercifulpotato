There were tens of thousands of protestors streaming through my neighborhood for months. I 100% support their cause and there is absolutely zero damage to any local business. Every morning a cleanup crew was there picking up dropped masks or other litter from the park. There was no visible rioting anywhere. Looting was taking place 30 blocks away by opportunists who knew the police were busy attacking innocent people elsewhere. And it only lasted a few days before being shut down. The protestors were mostly normal folks. Families, old and young, all colors and genders. The absolute only goal of the protests was to get some amount of accountability for police violence. For our leaders to affirm that black lives matter. Trump simply couldn&#x27;t do it. He made up the story line that this was a dangerous antifa revolution and right-wing media amplified it. It was pure disinformation. MSM coverage that the protests were mostly peaceful was accurate. MSM reporting that right-wing radicals were causing more violence was true and supported by the DHS. Fear-mongering against antifa is right-wind disinformation that you have apparently fallen for. Your belief that these stories lack of coverage represents bias is actually just your own bias. They don&#x27;t deserve coverage on their merits because they aren&#x27;t true.')
