Because the compiler was often able to prove and inline what actually gets called -- making the code logical (and relatively easy to follow) whereas the source code was abstract nonsense.<p>&quot;spaghetti hierarchy&quot;, common in C++ and even more so in Java, is in my opinion and experience, much worse than &quot;spaghetti code&quot; of the old Basic&#x2F;Fortran and very-early-C days -- the old &quot;goto&quot; spaghetti was hard to follow, but at least every goto named a concrete target. In a spaghetti hierarchy, execution jumps every 2 lines (with actual actions sparsely sprinkled among those lines), but to determine where it goes - you have to keep track of which class&#x2F;subclass every object was actually instantiated in, and what methods that class&#x2F;subclass overrides.')
