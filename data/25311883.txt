I would probably agree there&#x27;s limits that should be imposed so that anyone can&#x27;t just push around whatever law they want but at the same time, how else would you suggest these things work?<p>&gt;Economic prosperity, a broad middle class — <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;New_Deal" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;New_Deal</a>.<p>Since we&#x27;re talking about taxes...

Since that was an extraordinary high income in the 1930s, the highest tax rate actually covered just one individual—John D. Rockefeller. The bill was expected to raise only about $250 million in additional funds, so revenue was not the primary goal. Morgenthau called it &quot;more or less a campaign document&quot;. In a private conversation with Raymond Moley, Roosevelt admitted that the purpose of the bill was &quot;stealing Huey Long&#x27;s thunder&quot; by making Long&#x27;s supporters of his own. At the same time, it raised the bitterness of the rich who called Roosevelt &quot;a traitor to his class&quot; and the wealth tax act a &quot;soak the rich tax&quot;.</i><p>The only other thing is:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Undistributed_profits_tax" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Undistributed_profits_tax</a><p>Which essentially only lasted 3 years...\nIf you&#x27;re not talking about these things, then I would ask you don&#x27;t just send a wikipedia link with over 100 subsections lol.<p>&gt;We&#x27;ve also seen some really gruesome examples of what happens when concentrated wealth is allowed to run amok for too long<p>How do you reason all these things are &quot;caused by concentrated wealth&quot;?<p>&gt;Keep nitpicking individual policies, you are missing the bigger picture.<p>The big picture is made up of individual policies... that is actually my entire point.  I gave you clear example of what happens when one fails to remember the big picture.\nYou gave me links to wikipedia pages covering topics as broad as WWI and left it at that...')
