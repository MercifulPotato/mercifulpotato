I&#x27;m currently doing the live with roommates bit, but it&#x27;s a hard tradeoff to make.<p>Also I saw where you work in your HN bio - do you partner with VRAD (or maybe are considering starting your own)? I&#x27;ve always though leveraging ML imaging software as part of a nighthawk radiology service would be really interesting. Basically hire radiologists to be part of the company (give them some equity) and leverage their readings to train the model. In a bit of a Tesla style self-driving play where you&#x27;re providing the current capabilities via humans, but the ultimate goal is leveraging that to train and improve the software. My dad does neurorad so seemed like a natural fit for deep learning image recognition to me. If you&#x27;re writing the reading software then you can tailor it for training too.<p>Unrelated to that, if you&#x27;re looking for more options in DC the company I work for has a major office there (feel free to connect, my email is in my profile).')
