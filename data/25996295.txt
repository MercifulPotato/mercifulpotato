The 11.2 source moved those to the KDK (this is what the article is talking about), so they are no longer APSL, and further censored the source in the actual XNU open source release.<p>It is quite evident at this stage that this is somehow related to ARM. They must not like Apple adding nonstandard extensions to the ISA, and they want them to hide them all.<p>The good news is we don&#x27;t have to care, and the (accidentally or not) &quot;APSL&quot; blob release gives everyone license to reverse engineer them, since it&#x27;s not under an EULA.')
