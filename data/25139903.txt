It&#x27;s easy to scroll IG and get travel envy. Some people are nomads living in neat places. Some people are jet setters (ie. they escape their normal lives often). It&#x27;d be cool to be those people. But most people in the real world take modest and infrequent travel.<p>Travel in the way that makes you happy, talk about your friends travels, compare notes, get ideas for where to travel, and where you have no interest in traveling. When you meet someone that is well traveled, don&#x27;t feel inferior. You&#x27;re on your own journey, it&#x27;s a path you picked. There&#x27;s many reasons you chose this path and many ways you could change your path.<p>In short, don&#x27;t compare yourself to others. Be confident with what you know and learn what you want with the level of depth that interests you.')
