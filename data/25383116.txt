People can argue that micro-ops are RISC like, but micro-code is an implementation detail very close to hardware.<p>One of the key ideas of RISC was to push a lot of heavy lifting over to the compiler. That is still the case. Micro-ops cannot be re-arranged by the compiler for optimal execution.<p>Time is more critical when running micro-ops than when compiling. It is an obvious advantage in making it possible for advance compiler to rearrange code rather than relying on precious silicon to do it.<p>While RISC processors have gotten more specialized instructions over the years, e.g. for vector processing. They still lack the complexity of memory access modes that many CISC instructions have.')
