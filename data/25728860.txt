However, if you can keep them at 80-85% state of charge, and rarely if ever discharge them below 30%, they should have lifespans 5-6x longer than the lead acid solution.<p>in either solution you can&#x27;t really consider the full volts * Ah capacity of the battery to be usable. If you were to ever use all of the watt-hours in a 12V 200Ah battery you&#x27;d kill it, you never want to go below 20% state of charge...  so to be conservative the actual capacity of a single battery is something like:<p>12 * 200 = 2400 Wh, then (2400 * 0.70) = 1680Wh.')
