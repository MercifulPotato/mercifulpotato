Does someone have a successful tale to share?<p>And just to pre-empt the suggestions that Docker, Cloudtron, Sandstorm, command-line scripts are possible options: none of these are easy or simple for non-technical users. Even one-click app marketplaces (Linode, Digital Ocean etc) have their complications.<p>If you&#x27;re a developer who doesn&#x27;t want to provide a SaaS service (or wants to provide a self-hosting solution in addition to a SaaS one), a simple installation process for your customers should be a big win. But the complicated process of server install makes this difficult to impossible.<p>It&#x27;s a bit depressing that we still don&#x27;t have a simple, easy way to install web apps on a server. Without easy deployment for non-technical users, self-hosting will never be a viable option for most people, only for a tiny minority of technical users. Agree or disagree?')
