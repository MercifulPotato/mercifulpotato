If you do the following, you are fine:<p>* Switch to a shell runner<p>* Put the CI dockerfile into your repo<p>* Provide an entry script for CI that builds the container on-demand (and manages caching&#x2F;cleanup) and then runs the tests&#x2F;whatever inside that container<p>The point here is that docker&#x2F;podman provide you with everything you need as long as you have full control. By using gitlab&#x27;s default CI, you relinquish this control.')
