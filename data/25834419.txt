But then again the mobile i7 in my current MBP isn’t the same as the Xeon processors my code runs on in production. This isn’t about serious optimization, but rather the ability for a developer to reasonably estimate how well their code will work in prod (e.g. “will it deadlock”). The closer your laptop gets to prod, the narrower the error bars get, but they’ll never go to zero.<p>And keep in mind this is about reducing the incentive to switch to a chip that’s cheaper per compute unit in the cloud. If Graviton 2 was more expensive or just equal in price to x86, I doubt that M1 laptops alone would be enough to incentivize a switch.')
