I acknowledge that for you its minor but for me its major inconvenience.<p>I did, because your concern is something that should be dismissed.  The hypothetical drunk driver I mentioned earlier almost certainly has similar rationalizations for his irresponsible behavior, too.  But no one is swayed by his insistence that not driving drunk would have caused &quot;major inconvenience&quot; to him.<p>Refusing to wear a mask in this environment is like deciding to drive drunk.  Don&#x27;t be like a drunk driver, be a <i>responsible</i> person.')
