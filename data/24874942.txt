Similarly, rather than starting from a single source you want to spread the weapon from a large number of points.  By comparison to 7mg&#x2F;m3 a 1 metric ton weapon could ideally cover a square kilometer to a thickness of 30m and concentration of 30mg&#x2F;m3.<p>Notably, exposure time plays a major role in lethality so covering a wider area makes it much harder to escape from.')
