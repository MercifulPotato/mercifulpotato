I know you will think that I&#x27;m being outrageous not to trust the data from those organisations, but I don&#x27;t.  I see all - ALL - the organisations as acting in interests that are not mine.  I do not want to get into an anarchy conversation, but I think it is self-evident that governmental structures are about control.<p>What is requested in posting this &#x27;scientific&#x27; data, is that I deny the evidence of my own senses.<p>What I would really like anecdotal evidence, preferably supported by photos.  Personally, all the beaches I went to in my youth have water at the same level.  I appreciate there is erosion, as there is also the depositing of new material elsewhere.<p>What can you give personal testimony on?<p>PS Do you see and accept that when you take the science data on trust, your are actually taking a religious position?  The position is that the science is right, even if it doesn&#x27;t cohere with your own senses.  That is faith!')
