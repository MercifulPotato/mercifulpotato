This is part 4 of my Python behind the scenes series. The goal of this post is to understand how the CPython VM executes Python bytecode. You&#x27;ll learn:<p><pre><code>  - what is the evaluation loop and how it&#x27;s implemented\n  - when and how a thread may stop executing the bytecode to \n    release the GIL\n  - how CPython computes things\n  - how CPython handles exceptions and implements statements \n    like try-except, try-finally and with\n</code></pre>\nI appreciate your feedback! Thanks!')
