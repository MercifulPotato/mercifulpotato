Thanks for the reference.<p>There are some interesting methods to solve these kinds of &quot;recursion&quot; equations, especially when the integral operator, M in this paper, has the given properties (e.g., spectral radius &lt; 1).<p>For example, if M = A + P, where A and P are two other operators whose inverse, for example, is fast to evaluate, there are a certain number of iterative splitting methods which work extremely well and can exploit this structure for very fast convergence. I&#x27;m sure people have looked at this and similar ideas, but I have not seen many references as far as I know.')
