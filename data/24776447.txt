In my case I&#x27;d be holding my breath for 3 minutes (while completely breathing out beforehand, without the WHM, I could only hold my breath for 20 seconds).<p>They measured that while doing the WHM your adrenaline level is on average higher than your peak adrenaline level while you&#x27;re bungee jumping.<p>&gt; Epinephrine levels in trained individuals were even higher than those reported in a recent study in which acute stress elicited by a bungee jump was found to suppress cytokine production by leukocytes ex vivo stimulated with LPS (13).<p>It might be in the article, but my suspicion is that this is because of prolonged oxygen deprivation. See also Fig 3A for how high the adrenaline levels got.<p>So to me it&#x27;s clear that the WHM gives you <i>a lot of adrenaline</i>. What does adrenaline do? Well, it makes you numb, it acts as a painkiller in the sense that it makes you feel less (again not a doctor, but based on my limited knowledge this is a fact). So that&#x27;s one reason why it&#x27;s easier to jump into really cold water.<p>Moreover, it yields some evidence to some &quot;mind over body&quot; claims. It isn&#x27;t really mind over body, it&#x27;s adrenaline that can be conjured consciously at will. I&#x27;m speaking also from personal experience [1].<p>[1] I&#x27;ve done this at many Dutch dance festivals (e.g. Liquicity, Mysteryland). Instead of taking drugs, I&#x27;d do the WHM to spike my adrenaline levels as high as possible and had a great time.')
