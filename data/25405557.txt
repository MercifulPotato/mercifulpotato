The real power of semantic data (which hasn&#x27;t been realized yet) is in letting computer intelligences communicate in an understandable fashion. Linking databases and data sources globally has been the wet dream of distributed systems advocates for decades, but we&#x27;ve had neither the power nor the use cases for such things. However, once big data AI gets hungry enough, you can bet that everyone will jump headlong into the new data mining frenzy that&#x27;s coming once someone writes the first successful &quot;data connector &amp; broker&quot; service (much like what Lycos and Altavista did for web search).')
