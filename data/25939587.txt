Along with insurance companies, every single relevant government action that requires estimations of life value, tacitly or explicitly agrees that later years are indeed less valuable than the younger ones and likely, always will. NICE - the UK medical board that decides which medicines can be used in the NHS, constantly makes calculations on quality of life for all ages. This is inevitable if public funds are involved.\nIn the private sphere, itâ€™s a completely different matter. This seemingly &#x27;uncaring&#x27; stance only applies where public decisions are involved. No reason for this evaluation to necessarily work at a personal level if the state (taxpayer) does not pay for it.')
