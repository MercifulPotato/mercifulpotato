Item(by='avmich', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604441096, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24984498, text='&gt; and I print a lot<p>Exactly. Try to print every other month, and very different tasks - scanned images of cashier&#x27;s receipts, color pictures a toddler drew in MS Paint, pages 87-112 from SICP, Bing Maps directions, an ASCII text from from a flash drive and the likes.<p>Sometimes you have to reset printer (with a button). Sometimes to cycle power off-on. Sometimes to download whatever&#x27;s needed from a browser in a form of a PDF. Sometimes nothing works, and only by pure luck you can do something - not always - when completely misremembering steps which led to the printing.<p>And that&#x27;s without ink problems.')
