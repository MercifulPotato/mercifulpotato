I mean, I&#x27;m <i>very</i> much in that direction - I believe <i>all</i> drugs should be legal and accessible, the only restriction I&#x27;d put on the &quot;freely&quot; part of &quot;freely accessible&quot; (e.g. new&#x2F;experimental drugs only if you&#x27;re dying, hard drugs like heroin only if you go through 6 months of classes &amp; psychiatric evaluation, etc.) - but even that&#x27;s clearly still a &quot;regulated market&quot; (e.g. disallows misleading advertising).')
