The Verity paper that calculated this had access to a bigger and better dataset, the Diamond Princess cruise ship which they acknowledged they had looked at, and which yielded a lower IFR, but they didn&#x27;t use it:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nicholaslewis.org&#x2F;covid-19-updated-data-implies-that-uk-modelling-hugely-overestimates-the-expected-death-rates-from-infection&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nicholaslewis.org&#x2F;covid-19-updated-data-implies-...</a><p><i>&quot;The Verity et al.

It also claims the paper used values for k (over-dispersion) from February, when there were hardly any cases on which to calculate that: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lockdownsceptics.org&#x2F;schools-paper&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lockdownsceptics.org&#x2F;schools-paper&#x2F;</a><p>Here&#x27;s another paper that used an IFR of 1% in May:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nicholaslewis.org&#x2F;did-lockdowns-really-save-3-million-covid-19-deaths-as-flaxman-et-al-claim&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nicholaslewis.org&#x2F;did-lockdowns-really-save-3-mi...</a><p>And another paper that assumed a 1% IFR in June:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ptti&#x2F;ptti&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;docs&#x2F;PTTI-Covid-19-UK.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ptti&#x2F;ptti&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;docs&#x2F;PTTI-Covid-19-...</a><p>Analysis: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lockdownsceptics.org&#x2F;new-ucl-paper-on-contact-tracing-gulls-credulous-journalist&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lockdownsceptics.org&#x2F;new-ucl-paper-on-contact-tracin...</a><p>That one didn&#x27;t even bother to give a citation for its source, just assumed a value that was 4x too high.<p>Here are some current, reasonably up to date and sourced IFR estimating papers: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swprs.org&#x2F;studies-on-covid-19-lethality&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swprs.org&#x2F;studies-on-covid-19-lethality&#x2F;</a><p>Epidemiologists <i>know</i> IFR rates fall over time because they always do. Yet they continued to use the earliest calculated value they could find, based on a tiny dataset that wasn&#x27;t even the best available, because it gives the highest value and that lets them make the most dramatic results. This is a systematically untrustworthy field, they literally do not care about their own reliability at all.')
