It would only go down to about 5-7C at night. I was freezing. Actually, I got sores on my toes because the tile floors were so cold in the apartment and I needed to start wearing my sandals in the house.<p>It was a small one bedroom apartment. During the day it was fine, I had the windows open. At night, I&#x27;d run the two wall heaters, I&#x27;d wear a hoodie, and I&#x27;d be cold unless I was under the heater. To warm up the bedroom before going to bed I&#x27;d close the bedroom door, turn the heater on high, and leave it for at least 30 minutes. If I then went in the room and turned the heater off, within 20 minutes it would be cold again.<p>In Canada it can be -10C outside and I&#x27;ve always been perfectly cozy indoors. In my Canadian apartment now, I don&#x27;t even run the heat at night and it&#x27;s fine, and I only partly cover myself with the duvet. In Cyprus I was using multiple blankets and was uncomfortably cold in bed, even with the heat running.<p>I can only imagine people in Cyprus and other countries with poorly insulated homes hearing about the weather and Canada and fearing for their life. Meanwhile, it&#x27;s December in Canada and I&#x27;m literally wearing shorts in my house now.')
