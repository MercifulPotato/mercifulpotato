It was only a couple of weeks ago that a Google employee published a diatribe in Wired demanding that Timnit Gebru be rehired, promoted, and an indoctrination program be forced on employees. Google&#x27;s response? Nothing. Zilch. What was the fallout? Nothing, Zilch. Has anyone responded to, or even really cared about what Google&#x27;s &quot;union&quot; is saying? I haven&#x27;t even seen as much as a &quot;we acknowledge your statement&quot; from Google&#x27;s execs.<p>Typing things doesn&#x27;t matter anymore! You have to be willing to act. Both Pichai and Nadella know that no one is really going to walk away from their plum, very-well-paid positions over a political issue...and they&#x27;re basically right.<p>These employee &quot;backlashes&quot; are shaping up to be nothing more than Scream Therapy and are being tuned out.<p>BETTER DO WHAT WE SAY OR WE&#x27;LL GO BACK TO OUR DESKS AND WORK QUIETLY!')
