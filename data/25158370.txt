The knock is reliability, but BTRFS has been rock solid every time I&#x27;ve used it, so from personal experience, it&#x27;s a no-brainer.<p>Plus, I love snapper and the way subvolumes and snapshots are handled.<p>EDIT: I will add that I don&#x27;t use any RAID. I use BTRFS for snapshots, cow and data integrity on my single drive desktops. I think that&#x27;s where it ready shines. I don&#x27;t think anyone should be using EXT4 anymore.')
