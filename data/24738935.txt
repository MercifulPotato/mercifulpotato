Item(by='u801e', descendants=None, kids=[24738988], score=None, time=1602337268, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24738242, text='&gt; You have to check for replies aggressively or you canâ€™t have a conversation<p>I&#x27;ve found the easiest way to do that is to click on your username on the front page, and then click on the comments link.  Any replies to your comments will show up there.  It&#x27;s easier to check if you don&#x27;t make a lot of new comments in different comment threads.<p>What would be nice is if sites like HN and Reddit would offer a preview pane of the overall comment thread structure with all comments collapsed and had a visual indicator about which subthread contains new comments since the last time you checked.  Then it would be much easier to find newer comments and join the conversation.<p>That&#x27;s part of the reason why threads on usenet would be active for months, but threads on Reddit and Hackernews aren&#x27;t active for more than a few days.')
