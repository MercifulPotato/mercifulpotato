They can&#x27;t keep attention on what they&#x27;re watching and think that silly tv series are a new thing.<p>Alternative take: Emily in Paris is a tv series where you shouldn&#x27;t expect a lot of thinking, you&#x27;ll find a new character introduced once in a while when you need new content, everything is obvious and striped to the core of the conveyed idea, and there are love stories and nice shots of France. That&#x27;s it - you may enjoy it or not. If you get distracted with Instagram in the meantime, maybe you&#x27;re just not that interested. The core is really not that different from Friends, for example. Or any of the 10+ season series. (I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as the classic soaps - those had their own specific fake-dramatic style)<p>I get that the author may just not like the format. They&#x27;d be bored by Jiro, they&#x27;d sleep during Helvetica, and they&#x27;d probably die watching Herzog movies. But they should acknowledge their biases rather than pretend they stumbled upon some shift in tv.<p>(Ftr, I enjoyed Emily in Paris as silly entertainment, but I also find slow burn movies really fun. Jim Jarmusch makes me more engaged than most action movies)<p>Added: for the entertainment value, I&#x27;d pay to read their review of Twin Peaks...')
