But if AlphaProof managed to prove the Riemann hypothesis, I bet it wouldn&#x27;t be long before human mathematicians had managed to decipher the proof and explain it in a way that other mathematicians found useful. It&#x27;s just a lot easier to re-explain something that other people have already proved, rather than proving it yourself.')
