It also happened to be the same time a nearby church starts ringing it&#x27;s bells and my room happened to be very close to it. It also didn&#x27;t happen on days the church didn&#x27;t use the bells.<p>Still don&#x27;t know what exactly caused this and I don&#x27;t live there anymore but because I was the only one in my family with these problems, and only my room was facing the church, I want to believe the bells rang at a frequency that messed with my old routers Wi-Fi.<p>If someone could tell me if this Is possible, I could finally get some closure on this.')
