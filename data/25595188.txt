Two things come to mind.<p>1. Turkey wants a fight. I keep up on reading the western commentary and analysis about the region (Not the mainstream crap), and it&#x27;s apparent to me that deeply-entrenched forces in Turkey want a fight. Our strategy so far is to do the best we can to ignore&#x2F;placate them. I&#x27;m not sure how long that continues to work.<p>2. From time-to-time, we talk on HN about the internet becoming more and more walled off, with commercial ventures preventing competition and nationalistic devices like the Great Firewall of China preventing movement of information. There&#x27;s not going to be one dramatic moment when we wake up and the net is gone. It&#x27;s probably mostly gone now, and every day a bit more slips away unnoticed. We talk about and react to stories like this, but there are plenty of similar actions that nobody responds to. It&#x27;s like Google customer support: the only way to make anything at all happen is to make a big stink, and in the long-run even doing that doesn&#x27;t matter much to the average net user.<p>I am deeply unhappy and concerned about Turkey&#x27;s future. I wish there was something I could to to help, but any response at all from the west will be used as political fodder. They&#x27;re not in a good spot right now.')
