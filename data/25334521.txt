The deinstitutionalization movement was a left-wing one that started in the 60s. It was also not entirely without merit. The abuse that still happens in these types of institutions is obscene. Even elderly care homes, where the patients are not confined to the facility against their will, are rife with abuse.<p>The alternative to that abuse we now see is much worse, with thousands upon thousands of the drug-using homeless dead from overdoses.<p>But I think we can do better than abusive institutions, and the current activist-spawned free-for-all, where the mentally ill have no boundaries imposed on them.')
