Women are more sensitive and also not very good with initiating changes so you get stuck with two problems.<p>The only solution is to bring more men into those UI&#x2F;UX roles if they want any change to happen but even that might not help because Google is just too big now and it is hard to do those changes in such a big organisation.<p>The usual way big companies deal with those issues is to let a startup do this job, startups are not confined by big company politics and diversity requirements so they can just employ mainly men and do the job. But that is good for a whole product, not sure how  they can apply it for a design change.')
