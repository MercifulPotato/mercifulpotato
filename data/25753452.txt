Newspapers and books were both things when the US Constitution was written and, in all the years since, we haven&#x27;t seen any amendments that would force a newspaper to print articles or letters that might cost them customers. Publishers are not forced to publish books that they feel might tarnish or otherwise harm their brands.<p>Indeed, it&#x27;s my position that such laws would in fact be infringing on the free speech of those private companies. In addition they might cost those companies money, making these hypothetical laws also anti-free market.')
