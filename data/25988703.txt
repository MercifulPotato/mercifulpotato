The only thing which is not better with RTX is direct, non-ambient shadows (surprisingly), but the overall image is much better with RTX on (I really wish I could say there is no difference because it would let me save 20-30 FPS, but image quality is more important than FPS).<p>Maybe a comparison of still images is not the best tool for “measuring” RTX impact.')
