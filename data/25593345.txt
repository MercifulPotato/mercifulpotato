A real time system has bounded latency and can make guarantees about how long something will take. See stream reservation [1] as an example.<p>The Uber system is not real time. It&#x27;s entirely possible that every switch and router between you and the Uber server has it&#x27;s buffers full. Round trip time is entirely unbounded over the internet. You could say their system is &quot;fast&quot; or &quot;responsive&quot;, but &quot;real time&quot; is not a marketing buzz word, it has technical meaning.<p>IDK why OP chose to link to that weird article to try and illuminate this point.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Stream_Reservation_Protocol" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Stream_Reservation_Protocol</a>')
