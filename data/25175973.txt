I&#x27;m building a crowd-sourced computing platform, users can share their computer&#x27;s processing power in return for work completed on their PC. Meanwhile, their processing power will be used for 3D rendering or HPC applications. Basically, Folding@Home &#x2F; SheepIt but paid version. As more people supply, the more powerful it is.<p>I&#x27;ve already built it for Blender3D but struggled to get users. I&#x27;m curious as to what you guys think of an idea like that. Just another &quot;plausible sounding idea&quot; or actually possible idea?<p>Cheers,\nDaryl')
