I know many non-scienctists and even some scientists get pissed when you say this but it is the absolute truth and true to the scientific method.<p>This idea that the &quot;consensus&quot; has ruled out all other theories for a substance that we cannot even detect is an appeal to authority logical fallacies and a bias towards a known flawed paradigm.  Authorities who have never detected Dark Matter say it cannot possibly be anything other then Dark Matter.<p>Thomas Kuhns The Structure of Scientific Revolutions details this mentality that leads to these sort of errors in thinking, which can be summarized as follows (taken from an outline of his book found here:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uky.edu&#x2F;~eushe2&#x2F;Pajares&#x2F;Kuhn.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uky.edu&#x2F;~eushe2&#x2F;Pajares&#x2F;Kuhn.html</a>) :<p>--Students study these paradigms in order to become members of the particular scientific community in which they will later practice.\n----Because the student largely learns from and is mentored by researchers &quot;who learned the bases of their field from the same concrete models&quot;, there is seldom disagreement over fundamentals.\n----Men whose research is based on shared paradigms are committed to the same rules and standards for scientific practice.\n----A shared commitment to a paradigm ensures that its practitioners engage in the paradigmatic observations that its own paradigm can do most to explain, i.e., investigate the kinds of research questions to which their own theories can most easily provide answers.<p>Even the author of this paper is an LCDM (AKA dark matter exists) advocate who had to admit that his preference does not fit the data observed:<p>&quot;I have been working under the hypothesis that dark matter exists, so this result really surprised me,” Chae said. “Initially, I was reluctant to interpret our own results in favor of MOND. But now I cannot deny the fact that the results as they stand clearly support MOND rather than the dark matter hypothesis.”<p>The keyword there is &quot;reluctance&quot;.  This sort of mentality ripe with internal bias towards the existing paradigm is the number one thing that I think holds back scientific progress.  The breakthroughs that push things forward rarely come from the consensus holders and those simply doing research that refines the current paradigm.  Dark matter &#x2F; Dark energy has never been detected &#x2F; sourced - and the by the way the Standard Model of physics IS DEFINITELY WRONG and does not explain all observations.  It simply our best approximation just like Newtonian Mechanics was, but we need to look beyond it rather then be scared to defy it.')
