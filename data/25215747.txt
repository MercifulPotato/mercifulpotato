It has a hard transaction limit of 7 transactions per second. In contrast, the VISA network alone can process at least 47,000 tps. The entire Bitcoin system would be hard pressed to serve the retail transaction needs of a large shopping mall, much less a city, country, or the world.<p>The hard cap on the number of Bitcoins also makes Bitcoin a deflationary asset&#x2F;currency. Deflationary currencies have been known to be actively harmful since at least the great depression.<p>Overall, Bitcoin is a technological curiosity that is only attractive to people who don&#x27;t know much of anything about monetary economics and have no desire to learn.')
