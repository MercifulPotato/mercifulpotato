Therefore, he has a 2&#x2F;3 probability of winning if he switches.<p>Player #2 also had a 1&#x2F;3 prob of having picked the right door. Therefore, she has a 2&#x2F;3 prob of winning if she switches.<p>In summary, both should switch. This is independent of whether they chose the same door between themselves. In other words, in a game where you&#x27;re not forced by the other player&#x27;s choices, your probability of winning is independent of the other player&#x27;s. Your strategy should always be to switch (you can verify this empirically!).')
