The last few timse I looked at Chats, it couldn&#x27;t connect with my other @gmail users. Now it does. That&#x27;s nice.<p>But rooms doesn&#x27;t work yet (someone else said it&#x27;s coming to Gmail), and I can&#x27;t see how to make Chats show up in Gmail yet, so I can&#x27;t turn off Hangouts yet, and is it even possible to?<p>Will chat show up in the right sidebar of Gmail, or below the labels in the left bar?')
