Or are you perhaps smart in one area and think you can just wing an opinion on this topic?<p>I live with someone with clinical depression. One of the most maddening things for her is the astounding number of people who have absolutely no idea what they are talking about offering &quot;helpful&quot; opinions. No, they aren&#x27;t helpful, they are hurtful.<p>When someone trivializes the problem such as you have, it adds the body of disinformation on the topic that seeps into mainstream opinion: that depressives have done something to deserve what they are suffering, or that there is some simple solution that they just too stupid or unwilling to do that will fix things, or that they have some perverse desire to remain depressed, or they lack the character to &quot;buck up&quot; and put their depression behind them.')
