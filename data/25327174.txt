It&#x27;s about &quot;common ground&quot; between programmers. If you&#x27;ve seen and used the second pattern many times before, it becomes part of your vocabulary. You&#x27;re then able to express yourself more succinctly. It is then obviously a better solution to you.<p>If you see another programmer use the same pattern, it is common ground between you, and you like it. As long as every or most programmers on the team share the same common ground, you are more effective for using it. If you don&#x27;t share it, you&#x27;re less effective.<p>Everyone here commenting that they like the first solution better probably doesn&#x27;t share the necessary common ground with Linus.<p>The big question is: what common grounds should you expect when writing your code?')
