The color vision link had a nice chart outlining the infrared to ultraviolet chart with sensitivity ratings.<p>Curious though, how serious of an impact would time of day have on this curve? If someone took the test in the early morning, would yellow be more striking&#x2F;harsh than if they viewed it at night? Would blue be more striking after a day of saturated sunlight?<p>Edit: Blue and yellow are similarly placed on the chart, apparently accounting for the morning&#x2F;night sensitivity')
