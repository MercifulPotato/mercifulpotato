All the shifting weight and jostling in the truck simply weakens things too much. It&#x27;s also not meant to be <i>dis</i>assembled, and the particle board easily gets really banged up because it&#x27;s so soft. And all this is even when trying to protect it with covering pads. (And sadly, none of your tips are going to help either -- fasteners simply pull themselves out of the soft particle board, because the board itself is weaker than the fastener&#x2F;glue.)<p>A Billy bookshelf or Kallax shelving unit will hopefully survive a single move, especially if you can tighten&#x2F;glue things further after it&#x27;s been moved. But once you&#x27;re talking 2-3 moves, forget it.<p>For that reason, for young professionals who move apartments every couple years in their 20&#x27;s, it often makes more sense to just leave&#x2F;toss their IKEA shelves&#x2F;cubbies&#x2F;units, and buy new pieces for the new place. It <i>isn&#x27;t</i> durable across moves.<p>(Obviously I&#x27;m talking about &quot;classic&quot; IKEA particle board flat-pack stuff. If you&#x27;re buying a solid wood table or metal lamp from IKEA then it&#x27;ll be fine, but that&#x27;s not what most people are thinking about when they think of IKEA furniture.)')
