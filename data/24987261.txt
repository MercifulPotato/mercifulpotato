If the result is of genuine interest then read the abstract, and then go through the figures carefully. Otherwise for the most part the reminder of the paper is left alone. This only applies for papers where I already know the field and am only trying to gauge the incremental addition to the knowledge the paper makes. The style will be different for a paper in an unknown field, there it&#x27;s best to just read it as prose from top to bottom with a marker at hand.<p>To add more - not reading any text in the paper makes you laser focussed on trying to  figure out what the data means without the authors trying to sugar coat anything with their perspective&#x2F;agenda.')
