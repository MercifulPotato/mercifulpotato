This post marks the end of an era, and a real-life humanscale era, not a computer-time one: 30+ years!<p>I&#x27;ll miss it.<p>EDIT: It&#x27;s possible that via bputil(1) run from the Recovery partition that the signed system volume checks might be disabled in M1 macOS 11.  This means I could remove the plists for certain intrusive&#x2F;telemetry system services and still boot.  I&#x27;ve updated the post, and will write more about it once I have the equipment in hand.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keith.github.io&#x2F;xcode-man-pages&#x2F;bputil.1.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keith.github.io&#x2F;xcode-man-pages&#x2F;bputil.1.html</a>')
