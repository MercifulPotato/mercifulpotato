Standard ceramic decoupling cap-- very likely 0.1uF-- right next to it.  1&#x2F;2 C V^2 at 3.3V is 0.5 microjoules.  If the entire energy in the capacitor can go to effectively power the microphone (it can&#x27;t), and the typical power consumption of a MEMS microphone is about 1 milliwatt, it might keep working for about 500 microseconds.')
