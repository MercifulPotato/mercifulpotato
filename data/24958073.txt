Especially when you have multiple internet feeds into your router, but no assigned IPv6 block. Eg Router has fibre from one carrier, and LTE from another carrier, and you either want to actively use both in a load balancing fashion, or use them in a HA&#x2F;failover fashion without paying through the teeth to the ISPs for the privilege.<p>Fibre with LTE HA is an extremely common scenario in the physical retail world. And retail is notorious for tight margins. With IPv4 this is dead simple for a router to do using NAT. With IPv6 it’s a nightmare because everyone is against NAT in IPv6. It took ages to get some form of NAT, and it’s poorly supported.')
