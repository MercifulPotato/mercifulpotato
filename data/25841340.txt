Apple tells suppliers what they expect, and then when they audit the supplier they report the findings and work with supplier to clean up their act.<p>In this case the the supplier violated child labor policies in what looks like 2 successive audits 3 months apart.<p>The Information is taking the position that Apple should have immediately dropped the supplier instead of continuing with them. It is written in a way that sounds like the supplier was out of compliance for three years, but we are not told. It should be in the transparency reports.')
