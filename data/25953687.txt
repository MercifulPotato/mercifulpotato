They could date that person, or rent that date privilege out day by day. Note - all these dates are innocent, I am using it as an example only.\nSo this guy is happy. the rent he gets lets him live well and not work at all. Then a sorority&#x2F;fraternity house is built, and now there are 20 new people to date - his rent drops by 90% - what is he to do?\nHe calls the housing inspector, the bylaw inspector, the health inspector and bribes them to enact new laws - the house is torn down and no new houses can be built.\nThis is  the Bay area.')
