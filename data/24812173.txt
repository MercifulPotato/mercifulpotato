My mortgages have always ended up with a known retail bank and can be paid through their normal websites. Is your mortgage held by some fly-by-night bank?&quot;<p>I think you misunderstand.  Your parent is saying that after logging into his normal bank, he is taken through two or three third party <i>banking providers</i> that have their own domain names and web user interfaces - just to perform some core action related to paying his mortgage.<p>I have seen this and can give you a few concrete examples:<p>- Log onto unionbank.com.  Mortgage payment is done through &quot;my mortgage portal&quot; which jumps you to unionbank.customercarenet.com.<p>- Log onto tiaabank.com.  You are quickly redirected through the first third party domain which goes by too fast to copy&#x2F;paste then you are redirected to cibng.ibanking-services.com, where you do your TIAA banking online (!)<p>USBank bounces you around weirdo domains as well.  FWIW, I have never seen wells fargo do this.<p>This is a phishing nightmare and it is right at the crux of high-consequence interactions (<i>your mortgage, your banking</i>) and barely technically literate users.<p>It is unbelievable that they do this.')
