You can count the parade of famous names in this article (or any of his articles), as well as the pronouns &quot;I&quot;, &quot;We&quot;, &quot;Me&quot;. Maybe he thinks he will win personal points by osmosis. In this article he fashions himself as some kind of hero left activist by listing a parade of platitudes, but he barely registers as a leftist in his country (in Greece the left has a special historical significance due to its role in the Greek resistance and the ensuing civil war -- his father was one of them). He also fashions himself as a minister of finance, but he had literally nothing to show for his short 6-month tenure (apart from a whole night of arguing with the eurogroup). That whole show he puts on, it kind of works with the media, as he obviously gets invited a lot, but in his talks and writings one can barely understand &quot;what the hell he s on about&quot;.<p>This obviously  sounds like an ad hominem, but it&#x27;s really hard to distinguish the writing from the writer when it comes to his articles (which are everywhere, apparently). In fact this is common in his writings, and his articles consistently attract this kind of criticism.')
