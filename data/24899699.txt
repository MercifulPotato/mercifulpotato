Some changes to format are necessary for the new architecture.  But you can always just run the older version (that&#x27;s what I do).  And swapping to the new one isn&#x27;t terribly painful if your just using vanilla (for Caddy 1 extensions, which weren&#x27;t created by the developer himself most of the time, I&#x27;m sure Caddy 2 versions will pop up over time).')
