Item(by='dane-pgp', descendants=None, kids=[25096771], score=None, time=1605394277, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25092345, text='&gt; Then it becomes a race to the bottom indeed.<p>The article used that wording, &quot;a classic risk of a race to the bottom&quot;, but it doesn&#x27;t feel entirely accurate to me.<p>A classic example of a race to the bottom is when jurisdictions compete to attract businesses by lowering their corporation tax rates and regulations.  The end result would be zero taxes and zero regulations (unless a country offered a negative tax rate or other incentives).<p>For censorship, though, I don&#x27;t see there being a &quot;race&quot; between countries.  Just because Austria bans defamation doesn&#x27;t mean that all other countries will try to out-compete Austria by banning something even less objectionable.  What would &quot;the bottom&quot; even be in this &quot;race&quot;?  Banning all speech from the internet?  Internet companies would simply avoid having any assets or presence in any country that tried that.<p>Perhaps a better analogy would be &quot;opening the flood gates&quot; or &quot;a chain is only as strong as its weakest link&quot;, suggesting that the strictest set of rules would be the one that ended up being implemented.')
