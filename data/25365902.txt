I&#x27;m not arguing that there is zero fraud. I didn&#x27;t even say in my post that there was no conspiracy (though I&#x27;ll say here that there wasn&#x27;t). I only said the conspiratorialists aren&#x27;t arguing constructively. I&#x27;m probably pretty aligned with you--I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if there were a handful of fraudulent ballots on either side, but there&#x27;s certainly no evidence for a conspiracy.')
