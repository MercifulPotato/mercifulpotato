Item(by='yawz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603654676, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24889157, text='Varroa is and has been my #1 problem for a while. I hate it. But I can&#x27;t agree with this statement:<p><i>&quot;If these hornets become a serious problem for honeybees, we will find a solution to keep bees safe.&quot;</i><p>It can easy be too late. Look at what&#x27;s happening in Europe. They simply can&#x27;t stop the hornets.<p>Of course it&#x27;s more dramatic to show these huge insects. They are impressive and scary. Mites are small and look insignificant. They are not dramatic. They won&#x27;t generate hype. I understand the frustration as a beekeeper, but don&#x27;t let yet another problem become too big to reverse the tide on. It is obviously cheaper to deal with the hornets right now, hype or no hype.')
