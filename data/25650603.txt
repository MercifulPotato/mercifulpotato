Item(by='helmholtz', descendants=None, kids=[25652218], score=None, time=1609878604, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25648996, text='The comments on this thread are scary.<p>I work in the very conservative world of engineering, where there are standards and regulations up the wazoo. Welding standards, CE markings, standards for how high on the car your headlamps have to be, pressure ratings, instrumentation accuracy classifications. My colleagues in civil and nuclear engineering have even more stringent regulations to contend with. Compliance with those standards costs labour and money. It&#x27;s tedious, painstaking, careful work. These regulations have been hard fought, and have taken millions of man-hours to perfect. But this is why we are able to have the degree of safety that we enjoy in this world.<p>This zeitgeist on HN that goes against regulation, fueled perhaps by SV culture, is a recipe for disaster. Self regulation is NOT a thing. I can write this down for you and promise ALL of my potential life savings. This is NOT a <i>great</i> article. It&#x27;s a rambling overreach of a disaster that starts out fairly nice, but descends through seven circles of Paul-Graham-Know-It-All-ness.<p>It&#x27;s a way better choice to be in a future where we are arguing about the <i>extent</i> and <i>content</i> of the regulation rather than the presence of it in the first place. A deregulated world is scary to me.')
