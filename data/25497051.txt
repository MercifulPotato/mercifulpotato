In a sense, I have this equity. This is how the value is defined:<p>Value = Percent_Of_Shares *(Current_Price_Of_Company - Price_of_Company_At_Time_Of_Issuance)<p>Note that, on the day these issued to me, the value here is equal to zero, because the current price of company is equal to the price of company at time they are issued. Thus, I have received something which has no value, and thus have no tax burden. Technically I&#x27;m now a partner in the LLC.<p>This has tax implications: when the company is making money, I owe tax money on that. However, they&#x27;re in growth mode, and losing money, which means I get to carry a tax writeoff. Further, it&#x27;s written into the company&#x27;s bylaws that if they make money, they&#x27;re obligated to give employees a distribution equal to the tax burden that the employee will incur, i.e. when there is a tax burden outside of a liquidation event, they are obligated to give me enough money to cover it. Also, if they sell the company, my shares are vested immediately. I don&#x27;t know what happens to them covering the taxes if I leave; maybe I become liable for it, and there&#x27;s a downside there.<p>The shares are non transferrable, which is lame but apparently quite standard.')
