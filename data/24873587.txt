If a court can read the data, then any &quot;encryption&quot; is privacy theater: either the key has been leaked and stored on government-controlled servers (which means an adversary who got access to the government-controlled servers could read your data without your knowledge too), or the e2e encryption is entirely fake and there&#x27;s a plaintext copy stored somewhere that, similarly, adversaries could access. If the government can read all of your data, a hacker can too â€” which in today&#x27;s age, also includes foreign (or even domestic!) government surveillance programs.<p>Backdoored encryption isn&#x27;t real encryption. It&#x27;s theater.')
