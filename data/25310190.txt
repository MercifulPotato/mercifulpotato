It&#x27;s the last I will ever make. Not hard, but you need the proper tools. And not just a sewing machine. You need stabilizer for the t-shirts since they stretch.<p>If you want one made, there are companies and quilters everywhere that make them.<p>As for cost, the idea that they are expensive depends on how you view the work. I love quilting but understand that what I sell them for keeps me in fabric. I&#x27;m not earning a living from it.')
