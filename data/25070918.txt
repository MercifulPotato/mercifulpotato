And remember the quota is the general Google Account quota, not separate to photos. I already have 8GB of other data in Drive.<p>Most of Googles products are also geared towards encouraging people to develop a habit of not deleting things, which creates a very different situation.<p>So while this may not be a big problem <i>at the moment</i>, we&#x27;ll see. I see Photos suggest that at my current rate it&#x27;ll last ~4 years before I&#x27;ll need to start paying, which isn&#x27;t awful, but it&#x27;s a question of when not if, and image &#x2F; video sizes still keep creeping up.<p>That&#x27;s with my photo-taking being at a far lower rate than it used to be when my son was younger. I&#x27;m not a very social person and don&#x27;t travel much at the moment - a <i>lot</i> of people will hit those limits far faster.')
