I&#x27;m not claiming that the app in the article uses the same techniques.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=VHjmlQdzpW4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=VHjmlQdzpW4</a><p>I admit that the source of this article (newscientist.com) has a better track record of reliability than the source of the other video (youtube.com) and of the original claims (indiegogo.com), so we&#x27;re likely not even in the same ballpark, but some of the analysis done by thunderf00t on why EM radiation alone will be of limited use was interesting to me.<p>(There&#x27;s also a <i>responds</i> video, but I&#x27;ve not seen it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wdv_tWDqNEA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wdv_tWDqNEA</a>)')
