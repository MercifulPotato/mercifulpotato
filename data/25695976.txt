The shootings simply happened while protests were occurring elsewhere.<p>Objectively false - you didn&#x27;t read the article again. It says &quot;In Louisville, Kentucky, early Monday, a man was shot dead during a protest against the death of Breonna Taylor.&quot; right in the middle.<p>Other HN commenters who are acting in good faith: I invite you to click the article and C-f for that text. Yes, not all of the deaths were at the protests - my apologies for not reading carefully - but the claim that <i>none</i> of them are is factually incorrect.<p>&gt; puppet<p>You&#x27;ve been continually resorting to ad-hominems and content-less fallacies, labels, and accusations. This is anti-intellectual.')
