There are only 40 comments here so far, and there is already more than enough rich irony for a followup article, particularly considering that most people on HN are on the higher end of the intelligence spectrum.<p>This way, the article then kind of has a cool ARG (Alternate Reality Game) aspect to it - write about a topic, seed it into an ecosystem of the very thing you are talking about, and then write about how the ecosystem responds to it.  And then to make it even more fun, <i>let everyone in on the joke</i>!  So then not only are you playing an ARG, but everyone is playing it together - we (humanity itself, and each of us as individuals [1]) <i>are the very joke that we&#x27;re laughing at</i>!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knowyourmeme.com&#x2F;memes&#x2F;breaking-the-fourth-wall" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knowyourmeme.com&#x2F;memes&#x2F;breaking-the-fourth-wall</a><p>I have a theory that some interesting consequences could come out of this sort of thing, but it requires a fair amount of work to set up properly.<p>[1] For example, the &quot;people&quot; who downvote this post - it is &quot;you&quot; whom I am speaking about!  Does your mind (as opposed to &quot;you&quot;) find this idea&#x2F;situation pleasing?')
