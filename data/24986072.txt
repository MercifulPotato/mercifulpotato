Unfortunately, I can similarly describe Amazon&#x27;s book shipping practices.<p>Some of the things Amazon&#x27;s done to the books I&#x27;ve ordered:<p>- shipped in a huge box without padding, so books bounce around inside the box, crushing their sides and corners<p>- shipped in mailing envelope, arriving bent<p>- shipped out of the warehouse with large rips in the cover and inner pages<p>Apparently way back when, Amazon was shipping books shrinkwrapped between two pieces of cardboard, which protects them. They certainly aren&#x27;t taking that level of care now.<p>If there&#x27;s a bookstore (marketplace) with decent inventory that actually takes care of the books they ship, I&#x27;d pay a premium.')
