Yes, you can choose to define zero to be exempt.  But you can look at the patterns of numbers that are &quot;obviously even&quot; and observe that adding 2 to an even number results in an even number.  So it&#x27;s reasonable that subtracting 2 from an even number should result in an even number.<p>That&#x27;s not a definition, but it&#x27;s a pattern to observe, and leads one to think that maybe defining zero to be even makes sense, and fits with existing patterns.<p>You can define it how you like, but some definitions are more useful than others.  That&#x27;s why 1 is no longer considered to be prime, -1 is considered by some to be prime, and why even-ness is defined in such a way as to include zero.  It creates fewer exceptions to general properties.<p>It&#x27;s more convenient, more useful, and simpler, than any of the alternatives.  Patterns provide a reason to create the definition we use.')
