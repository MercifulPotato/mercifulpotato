As is usual with the vocal atheist crowd, unfortunately. None of what you said or linked to is the mainstream or even acceptable fringe of Christian thought. As I said above, your understanding of these issues is very lacking.<p>Even if one were to assume your ignorant argument is true, it’s also not really relevant. The fact that God is a “King” doesn’t somehow confer the same properties onto human kings or governments. Again, basic theology 101 here.<p>These are quite interesting topics but the level of discussion (exemplified by your remarks here) is often at such a low level, it’s kind of embarrassing, honestly.')
