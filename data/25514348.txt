Most students lived on campus, but many (including locals like me) lived off campus.<p>But even those who lived on campus, the furthest dorms were where I&#x27;d have had to park on those mentioned days. I did that sometimes, but it really was a 20- to 30-minute walk depending on where I was going on campus because they decided a mile long parking lot made more sense than a parking deck (later built, after I graduated).<p>Also it had a bus service, but it really only covered connecting the business school, psychology school, and main campus. The massive parking lot was <i>not</i> covered by the bus service, which didn&#x27;t make sense.')
