It had typical for google usability drawbacks, for sure (impossible to check on mobile page and mobile app who signed up for a meeting, things like that).<p>But in general it handled both small and big communities quite well - it could be public, you could create a new account with fake data espacially for this purpose (there was a moment when they wanted to ban this, but later rolled back that). It was quite clean.<p>Facebook doesn&#x27;t let me separate different sides of my life. I hate using facebook and would love to have separate accounts just for large communities and maybe marketplace but that is apparently against ToS.')
