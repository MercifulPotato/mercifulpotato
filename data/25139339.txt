I would not be surprised if 95%+ of those Gaming Developers does not fall into Sub $1M Annual Revenue. What is left are Apps which many falls into this category. Even if half of the remaining 20% of App Store revenue fall into Sub $1M AR, Apple is only looking at a maximum of 10% hit from its Total App Store revenue.<p>This is even better than my idea of splitting Game into a separate Game Store and retain its 30%, while letting App Store with 15%. This new system gives all the incentives to low revenue developers which really needed the help, without sacrificing more revenue than needed.<p>Although I really wish they had done this earlier, and now it is looking more like damage control than anything. And it still doesn&#x27;t fix their App Store review process becoming increasingly hostile. Along with many other complains.<p>Edit: I am reading into it, it seems like once you cross the $1M this year your next year will remain on the 30% bracket. And only if your next year revenue drop below 1M will you be move back to 15% the year <i>after</i>.')
