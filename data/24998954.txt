The average person can follow directions well enough to copy&#x2F;paste something in the terminal without understanding what it means or what they risk by doing so. Platforms like Apple&#x27;s rely on the vectors for compromise being minimized to the average user.<p>That being said, NPM is obviously aimed at developers so that&#x27;s less of an issue. I support this type of thing for developer tools because there&#x27;s a barrier of entry. I don&#x27;t support it for things like App Stores because I&#x27;ve dealt with people enough to know that they will do things without understanding the repercussions and I have a hard time blaming them for not completely understanding such a complex issue&#x2F;topic.')
