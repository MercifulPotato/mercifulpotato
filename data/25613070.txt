Item(by='ygra', descendants=None, kids=[25615741], score=None, time=1609598232, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25612202, text='Force-directed layout has no guarantees that a planar graph will be drawn planar. It often comes out that way, given how the algorithm works, but not always. Especially nodes that are &quot;trapped&quot; between others may have trouble &quot;escaping&quot; to the other side of an edge at times, due to the forces involved.<p>It may help increasing the dimensions for Graphviz (I think its force-directed layout can work in up to 10 dimensions), but there&#x27;s still a step involved that projects everything to 2D in the end, so it might still happen.')
