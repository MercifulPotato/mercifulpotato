I should be able to walk up to a wall, sit at a desk, stand in the street, and summon up a display for me to work with, laid out appropriately according to what I am trying to do: listen to messages, paint a landscape, design a car. It should offer the same applications and data wherever I happen to be. Form factor and OS should become something invisible to 99.99% of users.<p>Until then, we can fully expect that 2021 will be the year of the linux desktop ;-)')
