Think of y = x + 1 vs y = x; y += 1. I would expect that the former is slightly faster. But actually I&#x27;m not really sure.<p>Actually, I implemented most of my native ops exactly in this way, i.e. I implemented the inplace version, and the non-inplace version would just additionally copy it and then call the inplace version.')
