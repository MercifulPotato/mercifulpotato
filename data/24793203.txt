The place I was interviewing was a short walk and bus ride from an air field, and Pueblo is about 20-40% the cost of a similar commutable home in Denver, the flight (which I have done a dozen times in MSFS) is only 55 minutes. So round trip with commuting to and from the airports&#x2F;fields, doing preflight, and parking, was only 3 hours which is about the time it takes one way by car assuming normal traffic.')
