Population growth is still a thing. Many people are buying furniture for the first time. If you start using hardwood for all furniture it could easily be devastating to the worlds forests.<p>&gt; And then it it all ends it can became firewood, which ikea furniture can&#x27;t.<p>Of course it can. You wouldn&#x27;t burn it in a fireplace, but then fireplace is very inefficent way to burn things anyway. If you burn it in a trash burning facilities like they have in Sweden, you get the most energy out of it, you can heat local homes with waste heat in winter, and it creates less pollution (fire places are being banned in dense urban areas where I&#x27;m from). It&#x27;s a fairly good solution for the seasonal energy demand in northern areas.<p>I personally think IKEAs approach is <i>realistically</i> the <i>most</i> sustainable, but they could improve it by improving the recycling&#x2F;reuse of the wood fibers in their products.<p>I&#x27;ve used and refurbished old solid wood furniture myself. It&#x27;s a luxury IMO. There&#x27;s not that much of it to go around. It doesn&#x27;t scale. It&#x27;s not a solution to the worlds problem.<p>I also think the quality issues of IKEA furniture is exaggerated. I have a cheap TV table I bought as a student 15 years ago. It has been moved around several times. Seen a lot of abuse. I didn&#x27;t really have a use for it in our new home so I&#x27;ve used it as a tool table while renovating. It still looks fine. A tiny bit bent, but still good. Can probably give it to another student to use.<p>If you want to say that buying long-lasting furniture is significantly better, I think you need to point to a study showing how many resources each approach uses, and the average life-span in the real-world. It&#x27;s far from obvious that solid furniture is better.')
