In fact, I would suggest&#x2F;prefer experimenting with an interface where:<p>1) every entry has the exact same amount of vertical space (two lines total), which includes the topic title, link to content, date, and username. Include username and date on the same lines as the other content (not their own line) and truncate long titles to make it work.<p>2) the links to external content are just the domain name (like HN--you don&#x27;t currently include enough extra characters for it to be useful to see those extra characters)<p>This gives the interface more consistency which might help clean up the &quot;messiness&quot; of the look and be more inviting in that way, rather than in a way that cuts down on information density. (Make it a power tool, not a toy.) And as referenced above, playing around with weight and color for all that bolded black would might be helpful.<p>Overall, I dig the concept!')
