Item(by='ncallaway', descendants=None, kids=[25908775, 25905581], score=None, time=1611593107, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25905121, text='The good news is election security researchers mostly agree with you.<p>The prevailing opinion of election security professionals is that State election systems should be designed assuming the machines are insecure and the process should be tolerant to that fault.<p>That&#x27;s why many states that use electronic voting or tabulation produce a voter verifiable paper trail. That means, when you&#x27;re done voting the machine gives the voter a piece of paper that has their votes on it. The voter can check the paper to ensure it matches their votes, then deposits the paper record like a ballot.<p>State&#x27;s can then use Risk Limiting Audits to verify a necessary amount of randomly sampled ballots to ensure that the electronic count matches the voter verifiable paper ballots.<p>So, if your concern is that the GA election was overturned by electronic tampering you would need to explain why the voter verifiable paper trail <i>extremely closely</i> matched the electronic tabulation.<p>This is a long-winded way of saying I agree with you. There are some states that use electronic voting or tabulation without a voter-verifiable paper trail and risk limiting audits. Fortunately, none of those states were &quot;disputed&quot; in this election. But those states should absolutely switch to these kinds of systems.')
