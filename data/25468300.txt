I got it in 2004 and I picked up a lot of stuff I don&#x27;t think I would have learned on my own. I also went to a small state University in the middle of nowhere that&#x27; wasn&#x27;t very expensive, and I didn&#x27;t rack up any debt (a little in grad school, but still not more that I couldn&#x27;t pay off in ~2 years).<p>But you get out of your education what you put into it. I worked with people who went to 2-year associate programs who didn&#x27;t understand BigO notation, and people who didn&#x27;t go to college at all, but who knew their algorithms inside and out (one who even got in at Google in the early days).<p>I&#x27;m glad I got my degree, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the cost some people are paying now. I shared my concerns with my nephew and he ended up getting his CS degree at a smaller&#x2F;cheaper state university. I&#x27;d say if you can&#x27;t get a degree without going into excessive debt, it&#x27;s really not worth it today.<p>I know I&#x27;m just guessing, but the writer of this article seems crazy driven. Maybe, this is the type of person who could start their own small business out of nowhere, or survive long hours at SpaceX for the pure thrill of successful rocket launches? If you have the drive to run through something like this, there really aren&#x27;t any limits to what you can do. I&#x27;ve done pretty well at all my jobs and have learned a lot of cool stuff, worked in three countries ... but on a scale of Wally (from Dilbert) to Elon, I&#x27;m certainly more towards the Wally side.<p>Going back to games; I wonder if this type of education and training would be more accessibl if it was gameified. McDonalds Japan briefly tried to turn their training program into a Nintendo DS game (failed terrible and the game is very rare). That might be a model for new typed of education going forward.')
