Windows 10 is my daily driver, but not used for everything. Today, even though I am at two machines running Windows, both have a Linux OS running in a VM that I am using predominantly for today and probably the next several weeks whilst I rebuild firmware images and create&#x2F;update Linux device drivers for an embedded system.<p>Hardware wise: You can never have too much. I have a Windows workstation, a Surface Book 2 and a Macbook Pro, lots of monitors, keyboards, mice, tablets. A Linux server running Docker containers for various services, e.g. adguard, firewall, proxy server, gitlabs and mercurial, backup, and so forth. These are all optional, I could probably get away with just a powerful laptop if pressed.<p>Software:<p>VMWare Workstation Pro or VMWare Fusion, that permits access to Windows, Linux &amp; macOS.<p>Visual Studio Pro on Windows<p>VSCode on Linux &amp; macOS<p>SublimeText3<p>The full Jetbrains suite on all three platforms<p>Android Studio<p>XCode (macOS)<p>The various terminal tools, as mentioned by someone else.<p>OneNote for notes, installed on every computer in the house, and every tablet and my phone too.<p>A physical sketchbook&#x2F;ruled notebook (half sketch paper, half is ruled pages) with two mechanical pencils, and a straight edge. I cannot emphasize a physical notebook strongly enough, even though I am dyslexic and disgraphic and have lousy handwriting and it makes my hands cramp, a physical notebook is invaluable.<p>Microsoft Office Lens for scanning physical notes and whiteboard sessions in to OneNote<p>OpalCalc on Windows, Soulver on macOS, Speedcrunch on Linux<p>Bitwarden with self-hosted server installed on all \nWindows Subsystem Linux on Windows<p>ConEmu for Windows<p>DirectoryOpus for Windows, PathFinder for macOS<p>WinMerge on Windows, Kaleidoscope on macOS. Though I also like Araxis Merge and Beyond Compare.<p>Tower (old version) because fuck you and your subscription model.<p>Synology Drive for file sync between devices<p>Synology Backup for backing up the machines<p>IDA and Binary Ninja for reverse engineering and diving in to binaries<p>I am sure there are things I am missing that I use almost daily but have slipped my mind. These tools make up my workbench and let me tackle a lot of different work, much like how my workshop contains many different tools for different aspects of woodworking, metalworking and other fabrication and maker-type tasks.<p>edit: blank lines because I forgot HN doesn&#x27;t separate lines without it.')
