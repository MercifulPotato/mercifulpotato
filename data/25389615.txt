None of the other factors are relevant to the claim that the US death toll will exceed 9&#x2F;11’s each day. If the headline said “Death toll of young, well-educated, working people in the urban U.S. will exceed the 9&#x2F;11 death toll every day for months”, then you’d have a point.<p>&gt; Compared to Europe you’d expect about that number<p>Europe is hovering around 5,000 (oscillating above and below) out of ~747M per day; the US at the same per capita rate would be around 2,200 per day. So a <i>floor</i> of around 3,000 per day is significantly higher.')
