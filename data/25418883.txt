Item(by='wincy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607961048, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25415770, text='My city (Overland Park, Kansas) definitely has some sort of restrictions on billboards [0]. I looked it up, if you&#x27;re super interested on page 230 it  indicates that there&#x27;s a density restriction (1200 feet from already existing billboards) and a zoning restriction against residential (400 feet). They also can&#x27;t be on top of a building, or over 30 feet tall.<p>I can&#x27;t really think of any billboards nearby, so I think this effectively restricts the billboards to maybe very busy interstates and nowhere else. Going across state lines into Missouri is very noticeable because there&#x27;s billboards everywhere.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;online.encodeplus.com&#x2F;regs&#x2F;overlandpark-ks&#x2F;export2doc.aspx?pdf=1&amp;tocid=018" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;online.encodeplus.com&#x2F;regs&#x2F;overlandpark-ks&#x2F;export2doc...</a>')
