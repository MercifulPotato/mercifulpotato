I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ve made much affordance for the progress &amp; success &amp; accomplishment, and I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ve recognized any of the good points of diversity, of value at stake here. this isn&#x27;t at all an unreasonable contemporary stance towards the situation, but it&#x27;s also considering only the real &amp; not the possible, not the fruits that open source &amp; cross-platform has been working towards.<p>&gt; In any event it is important for people to be informed by the pitfalls.<p>agreed that this is a value. but I don&#x27;t think people should have to take such thesis (Linux gaming good getting better) and antithesis (Linux gaming bad will not do waste of time) &amp; smash together their own synthesis. I&#x27;d like to see some recognition that you do think there are worthy &amp; compelling reasons for Linux gaming and&#x2F;or tech like proton. I have tried, amid my &quot;platitudes&quot; to accept some dings, but I have not seen any places where you acknowledge or realize that there maybe something good for humanity at stake here. is there anything you could offer that shows that your realism also has a sense of the possible &amp; virtuous here?')
