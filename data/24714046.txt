(I don&#x27;t understand the subtleties of those last two where they cross over...)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Greek_words_for_love" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Greek_words_for_love</a><p>It seems the ancient Greeks did not have a work for &quot;job love&quot;, which is interesting to me in terms of the upthread discussion.<p>I wonder if the paucity of English language around different types of \n&quot;love&quot; is a cause of the kind of misuse of the concept to apply to things like &quot;I love my job&quot;, or if it&#x27;s a symptom of it - with language shaping and forcing our understanding and deep deep thought structures?<p>Are there any Greek speakers reading here who could tell me if those multiple differing words for love still exists in modern Greek, and if so how the concept of &quot;I love my job&quot; would be expressed in Greek, and what the word and definition&#x2F;connotations of the version of &quot;love&quot; that&#x27;d be used in that context are?')
