Also, my use-case is for low overhead, low latency work - so I want to be able to have a VM ready to go in the time it usually takes linux to modify page tables!<p>So, it&#x27;s a bit of a weird project in that way. Not your usual emulator. Ultimately it&#x27;s a hobby project, though.<p>I actually tried to implement the tiniest KVM machine I could, and it wouldn&#x27;t start in less than 1ms, which is an eternity for me. I also seem to remember that you need 2 file descriptors at minimum: 1 for the vCPU and the other for the VM itself.')
