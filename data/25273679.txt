I have some video and photos from the observatory. Was pretty awesome place to visit. One of a kind in the wold.

Large projects like this need ongoing government funding. So I&#x27;m surprised more was not done to prevent this.<p>Similar things happened during collapse of the USSR. Major scientific projects just got left behind to rust.<p>I know that China built a new larger radio telescope, but this one could send out messages.<p>The observatory helped us map planets, find pulsars, track asteroids, and send messages to aliens.<p>Arecibo message\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Arecibo_message#Numbers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Arecibo_message#Numbers</a>')
