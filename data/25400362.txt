I&#x27;m pretty comfortable with the basics (I&#x27;d say my level is &quot;try to use macros sometimes and find them too clunky&quot;), but in these days of remote work I don&#x27;t get to look over my co-workers shoulders too often, so I don&#x27;t feel like I have a good idea for what I&#x27;m missing. Less &quot;here is the way to do this thing&quot; and more &quot;watch this wizard at work and get inspired, maybe with a bit of commentary.&quot;')
