A counterargument would be that traditional text doesn&#x27;t do this, so a text file format ought not to unless it is aiming at being something more than what text does.<p>But add too many features, the project becomes something else, is maybe less useful &amp; doesn&#x27;t gain traction. A Gemini project that is too bloated and thus gains no traction helps no-one, disabled or otherwise.')
