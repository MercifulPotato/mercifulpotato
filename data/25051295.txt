An iPad Pro 12.9 inches weighs 1.4lbs. The 13.3 inch MacBook Air M1 is 2.8lbs. I&#x27;m sure there are reasons but there are companies, LG for instance, that make 2 lbs 13.3 inch notebooks and 3 lbs 16 inch notebooks. No I don&#x27;t want an LG but I was hopeful for a 16&quot; Arm Macbook Pro that weight 3 lbs. Now I&#x27;m pretty confident it will be the same as an Intel Macbook Pro 16&quot; at 4.4lbs (heavy enough my messenger bag leaves marks on my shoulder and gives me muscle pains if I have to lug it around all day) Somehow, getting it down to under 3.lbs removes that pain. Maybe because it includes the power supply which is also bigger.<p>To put another way. They could have taken an iPad Pro, expanded the screen to 13.3 inches, added a keyboard and put MacOS on it instead of iOS and it would be probably 1.8lbs. I don&#x27;t know what the tradeoffs would be but I was excited by that possibility. It didn&#x27;t happen though.')
