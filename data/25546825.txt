In this case, supporting all those forms would be very do-able.  The best way to support them would be to find some old BSD parsing code and port it, then you can be sure every corner case is handled the exact same way.  Handling corner cases differently is a great way to introduce security vulnerabilities and crash&#x2F;DoS bugs that <i>every</i> user of your library will have to be aware of.<p>Maintaining such code isn&#x27;t really a good excuse here either - the code is only going to be a few thousand lines, is self contained with no dependencies, is easy to test, not going to change much with time, etc.<p>Basically, there is no benefit to removing this feature, so don&#x27;t break what isn&#x27;t broken.')
