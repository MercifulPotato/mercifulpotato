Also, the way it&#x27;s treated by adults.<p>Teachers always just said to ignore them and they&#x27;ll stop. That never worked for me. They also said you had to tell them if someone was being a bully. I did, they didn&#x27;t really believe me and took no action. When it got too bad my parents reported the assault to the police. The police warned that kind of case was not a priority and then dropped it.<p>Eventually the bully was called to the principal and given a stern talking to. He was told next time there would be consequences. A few weeks later he punched another classmate in the eye so he temporarily lost eyesight on that eye. The bully was given a stern talking to and told that next time there <i>really would be consequences</i>.')
