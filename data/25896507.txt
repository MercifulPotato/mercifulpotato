Mine has a very annoying coil whine that&#x27;s present more or less all the time (it&#x27;s louder under activity). Same issue with the power supply.<p>Another very annoying thing is the fan, which is quite loud, and also on most of the time. I cannot even have a single tab open in a web browser, or watch a movie, without spinning up the fan.<p>Battery life is also nothing special, it&#x27;s definitely worse than on comparable MBPs.')
