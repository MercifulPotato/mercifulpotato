As it turns out, deep learning also relies on such features, namely the\ngradients of a predefined function, and uses them for prediction via dot products in feature\nspace, like other kernel machines.&quot;<p>Huh. So the implication here is that a deep network can never generalize results to inputs classes that were not explicit in the training set? And would this result apply for networks trained with something other than gradient based methods?')
