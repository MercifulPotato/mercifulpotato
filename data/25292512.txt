What kind of &quot;privileged and confidential document to HR&quot; would be relevant to retracting a research paper? She has some very legitimate frustrations with the process here, but she doesn&#x27;t seem to be disputing that the document was relevant. In a more normal context, my default assumption is that &quot;privileged and confidential document to HR&quot; means &quot;someone&#x27;s raised a serious issue and we&#x27;ll be sued if we don&#x27;t fix this&quot;, but I don&#x27;t see how that fits here.')
