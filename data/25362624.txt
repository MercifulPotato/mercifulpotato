There&#x27;s something wrong with trusting that principled thinking will always hold because it held before, in what might have been a different context.<p>He&#x27;s not debunking the validity of the chain of truth statements, but &quot;first principles <i>thinking</i>&quot;...letting this logic guide one down a path that doesn&#x27;t comport with reality (which might have context one is unaware of).<p>I think it matches up with incompleteness quite well.<p><i>Any</i> set of axioms can never tell you for sure if you&#x27;re in a context that has other missing and more valid axioms.<p>You can modify your axioms with experience, but then you&#x27;re back in the position of not knowing if this is the final set of axioms that will always comply with reality.')
