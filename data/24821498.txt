For me to stay still with respect to you, if you&#x27;re in a frame that is accelerating away from me, I need some proper acceleration to catch up and counteract the fact that our frames are diverging. But if spacetime is curved, your frame <i>probably is</i> accelerating relative to mine - c.f. the example on the Earth&#x27;s surface, where our frames inexorably accelerate towards each other as we move parallel to each other. So for me to stay still with respect to you, I need to have some proper acceleration to balance out the coordinate acceleration derived from the fact that our frames are moving in a curved space.')
