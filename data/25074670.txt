When we signed up long time ago we were not aware that the basic functionality of subscriptions was offered for free only temporarily. \nWe use the stripe backend only to create and cancel subscriptions, that&#x27;s it. Now we have to pay a couple of grand a year to do this or hire a developer.<p>I think a much better move would have been to add a new billing plan for the few new features that have been added, but leave people with the basic functionality that they grew used to.<p>And c&#x27;mon, narrow margins my ass. We are not talking about a small startup here, we are talking about Stripe, a billion dollar company! They should be able to afford having a developer or two working on those long neglected features and not compare themselves with chargebee. It&#x27;s just sad.')
