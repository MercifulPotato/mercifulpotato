I&#x27;m no expert but VAT <i>has</i> to be paid somewhere and now the process (especially given changes being introduced separately of brexit for e-commerce) is confusing and unexpected for small businesses. The way to deal with this is to set up a company (probably in Ireland) to make accounting easier and obviously avoid tax issues at the border.<p>That&#x27;s only part of the problem for goods but seems to be what the article is mostly referring to.')
