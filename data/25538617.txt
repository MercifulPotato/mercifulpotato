Solar PV overall efficiency is probably 15-20% of the incoming solar power. While, a solar thermal hot water system can reach 50% or higher efficiency, even accounting for storing the hot water for several hours.<p>Solar thermal also just requires fairly cheap mirror like surfaces, while solar PV requires semiconductor chips.')
