Instead we&#x27;re always buying a service.<p>This is certainly what Amazon etc write in their terms and would like the legal system to enforce, but I think it&#x27;s clear that most normal humans don&#x27;t really think of it like this.<p>The strongest argument that they don&#x27;t is that the prices for films that you buy on google play and the books that you buy on amazon cost the same as they did before.<p>Quite clearly, ownership rights are not worth nothing, so if the public are prepared to pay the same rates, the most likely explanation is that they are confused about what they are getting.  There&#x27;s been no real effort to disabuse them either - the amazon ebook site says &#x27;<i>Buy</i> now&#x27;, google play says &#x27;buy&#x27;.  What we&#x27;re seeing is large tech companies trying (and so far succeeding) to redefine what it means to buy and to own things.<p>People probably don&#x27;t even think about the fact that if the company went bust or decided to stop offering their service, potentially thousands of dollars worth of things they thought they owned would go up in a puff of electrons.<p>20 years ago, people would have CD, DVD or book collections that would be insured for significant amounts of money.  Is it possible to insure access to a digital media collection?')
