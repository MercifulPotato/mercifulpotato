There is rarely an intervention that is life changing - be it exercise, good eating habits or otherwise. One has to observe dopamine fasting to an extent everyday - no phones 2 hours before sleep, only 30 mins on SM, etc. to extensive retreats every on a monthly, quarterly to get benefits.<p>IMHO, dopamine fasting extends beyond digital detox. Digital detox is one application of Dopamine fasting. In an intensive meditation retreat where all communication and gadgets are banned and foods are simple, the senses are enhanced to the point that post retreat simple stimuli like a cup of coffee give intense joy.<p>You seem to be well aware of the benefits of it, the author is just putting it into a formal framework. Camping is a great way to do Dopaine Fasting especially if one avoids talk. A lot of what modern secular science discovers was known to the ancients - I guess in the old days it would be called a prayer retreat :)')
