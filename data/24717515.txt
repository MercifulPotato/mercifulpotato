Do those numbers justify draconian shutdowns and bankrupting half of humanity? I&#x27;m not so sure. In the early days, we believed that Covid was 10-20 times deadlier than the flu, and that&#x27;s what was used to justify the draconian measures.<p>Note also these numbers are for the UK, one of the top worst countries hit in terms of deaths per million in the world.<p>Also, Covid does not seem to have the same seasonality that the flu has, which peaks in cold winter months. It may therefore not be altogether accurate to merely compare Jan-Aug. We may need the whole year&#x27;s data to better compare.')
