If I cut out the jump and am careful to not flare my elbows, it might work.  I&#x27;ll give it a try after my wife wakes up.<p>I like burpees, but the ceiling is barely taller than a standard door frame.  Also, I think it would be very careful to come down and not flare my elbows wider than 2 feet.  The bathroom is so small that they use a mini square sink, maybe 10 inch diagonal.  Maybe I could kick my feet out of the shower and next to the toilet, but that still wouldn&#x27;t solve the ceiling height issue, and I&#x27;d probably eventually injure myself by accidentally kicking the toilet.<p>On a side note, I have a buddy who was using burpees for Tabata training in his kitchen.  His wife complained about the sweat on the floor, so he did them on a towel.  He stopped doing Tabata when his towel slipped and he hit his chin hard on the tile.')
