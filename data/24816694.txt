Solutions are either averaging out peaks and dips temporally (by storing energy e.g. in pumped hydro plants, in batteries, ...) or geographically by moving power where it is needed and from where it is currently being produced. You do not even lose gigantic fractions of the power in the process: high-voltage direct current power lines have losses of around 3%&#x2F;1000km. China, for example, has power lines that move a dozen gigawatt over a distance of over 3000km. It can be done.')
