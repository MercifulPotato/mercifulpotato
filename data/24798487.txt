This could allow us to actually have an algorithm that solves all NP problems in P time, but ZFC can&#x27;t prove it works for all inputs.<p>Edit: So in that case, what would it mean to add an axiom that P=NP? See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mathoverflow.net&#x2F;questions&#x2F;50023&#x2F;independence-of-p-np" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mathoverflow.net&#x2F;questions&#x2F;50023&#x2F;independence-of-p-n...</a> especially the answer by Andreas Blass. Basically, you could add axioms that change the meaning of &#x27;Turing machine&#x27; (ie &#x27;computation&#x27;) by changing the meaning of &#x27;natural number&#x27; resulting in an algorithm witnessing P=NP that maybe can&#x27;t be run on physical computers.<p>Way off topic...')
