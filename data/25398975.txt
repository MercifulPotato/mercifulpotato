The right way to do the above would be something like saying &quot;Thanks for vouching for us!  If you message me your username @XYZ, I&#x27;ll add some extra bandwidth credits to your account.  :)&quot;; that turns the interaction&#x2F;demasking into something voluntary on the user&#x27;s behalf, rather than you creepily stalking them through your user DB.')
