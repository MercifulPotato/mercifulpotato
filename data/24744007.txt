What happens to the schools and workplaces where they normally serve?<p>Exactly. This is something I&#x27;ve pondered in thinking through some of these proposals - if one wanted to pursue these policies and actually protect high risk folks, that alone would likely have significant impacts.<p>E.g. KFF estimated that a quarter of workers are at high risk of severe illness with Covid - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kff.org&#x2F;coronavirus-covid-19&#x2F;issue-brief&#x2F;almost-one-in-four-adult-workers-is-vulnerable-to-severe-illness-from-covid-19&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kff.org&#x2F;coronavirus-covid-19&#x2F;issue-brief&#x2F;almost-...</a> - of course, some of these folks will be in jobs amenable to work from home. But, for the rest of them? That&#x27;s a lot of the workforce either a) temporarily leaving the workforce (oh hello, economic consequences) or b) staying in, and accepting the increased risk from community spread (oh hello, more death).<p>&gt; That is a rather coy statement. They don&#x27;t even give us a clue how that could actually work.<p>Yep, lots of hand waving in that one. It&#x27;s hard to take this declaration with any seriousness given the lack of substance.')
