It also only has one external lock, on the driver&#x27;s door.<p>I ended up having to wedge the door and open it from the inside with a coat hanger.<p>Apparently the only other way to open the car when the battery has completely failed (as opposed to having charge, but not enough to turn the starter) is to connect jumper cables to the positive lead on the starter motor and the chassis. Of course my jack was in the boot, which I couldn&#x27;t open since the battery was dead!<p>I&#x27;ve now attached a wire to the bonnet latch, so if this happens again I can just pull the wire to open it.')
