Even at $100M, it probably doesn’t matter to a fund. VCs expect over half of their investments to outright fail.<p>What’s much more important to the VCs is the good will they just built with that founder. Most founders will give back door reference checks to other founders about investors. Josh is likely to say good things about BVP and GC now. Also, they got that mention in his blog post too. It’s likely they knew Josh would write a post like this and chose to just write it off for the “we’re founder friendly” story vs. looking founder unfriendly.<p>As a founder, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with what happened here for the investors given their fund sizes. They’re professionals investing other people’s money and expect this type of thing to happen. In fact, most VCs likely expect you to fail. If these were angel investors putting in their own money, I’d have a different opinion.')
