It was kicked off for multiple terms of service violations and unwillingness to adequately moderate its platform to ensure that further ToS violations didn&#x27;t occur.<p>It&#x27;s a little strange, then, how Amazon took Parler&#x27;s money until a day after others deplatformed Parler right after the election.
