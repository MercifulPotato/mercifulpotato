Item(by='cesarb', descendants=None, kids=[25462220], score=None, time=1608249351, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25460694, text='&gt; I suspect interest in FreeBSD will rise with the demise of CentOS.<p>Indeed, the first thing I thought when seeing this post was &quot;I wonder how long the support for each FreeBSD release is&quot;. Looking at Wikipedia (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;FreeBSD#Version_history" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;FreeBSD#Version_history</a>), it seems to be around 5 years. Still no match for the 10 year support CentOS users expected; IMO, 5 years is too short when installing out of cycle (for instance, since the current stable 12.x was released two years ago, if I installed it today on a new computer I&#x27;d have only 3 years of support left).')
