It is the one tweet in the context of all his tweets.<p>And getting all of them is as easy as getting a speech recording, if not easier.<p>&gt; I found an archive of Trump tweets. It consists of 50000 tweets. Finding tweets in there that somehow confirm the claims that he was calling for violence is more work than just a couple of minutes.<p>The exact same thing happens if his twitter is unbanned and you go there for context.  I&#x27;m not seeing the issue.')
