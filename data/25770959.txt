An example of this would be this paper [1], which I&#x27;m hoping to replicate to some degree, but requires at least 4 PWM outputs. I&#x27;m currently planning on using an Odroid-C4, which has 6 PWM outputs.<p>But the work I&#x27;ve needed to put into that in order to get a motor controller working was way more than I needed than for a RPi4b, since libraries for it already exist for the Pi vs needing to re-write them for the Odroid board. It would have been cool to try it with an open-hardware board as well. But it&#x27;s not just quadcopters--a lot of other projects like rovers or position control with multiple stepper on different axes benefit from extra PWM, and doing it in software can lead to too much jitter, so the hardware timers are necessary.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.diva-portal.org&#x2F;smash&#x2F;get&#x2F;diva2:946992&#x2F;FULLTEXT02" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.diva-portal.org&#x2F;smash&#x2F;get&#x2F;diva2:946992&#x2F;FULLTEXT0...</a>')
