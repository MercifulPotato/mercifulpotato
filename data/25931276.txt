The experience with those isn&#x27;t 100% seamless. I&#x27;d wave an RFID card, and most of the time, it would work after a 5-15 second pause. I&#x27;d occasionally encounter a broken charge plug that wouldn&#x27;t release, or an otherwise malfunctioning charger.<p>Even with the piddling 87 mile range of the 500e, I&#x27;d still drive from SF to San Jose on a regular basis. I could pretty much depend on the availability of Chargepoint chargers in the South Bay.<p>I even went to an event near San Rafael once, and found that the charger at the school was <i>free</i>!')
