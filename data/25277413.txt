I myself drink milk and eat meat while acknowledging the obvious moral superiority of veganism. It&#x27;s even hard to argue against veganism without sounding rather selfish or even psychopathic, as your argument, sooner or later, is going to boil down to &quot;but I like it&quot;. So it&#x27;s amazing how hard it is to change this habit.<p>The path of least resistance and most convenience and least personal sacrifice is hard to leave despite living in violation of my own ethical standards.<p>There&#x27;s also something weird about our relationship with animals and food. We use ethical justifications (or avoid them) that we don&#x27;t use anywhere else. Our eating habits are deep cultural traditions that don&#x27;t budge in the face of even the most agreeable arguments to change them.<p>&quot;But it just feels too good to give up! XD&quot; or &quot;But if I stop, everyone else is still going to do it, so why stop!&quot; aren&#x27;t arguments we&#x27;d level at the carnal pleasures of rape, but when it comes to meat, they make everyone&#x27;s head nod in agreement.')
