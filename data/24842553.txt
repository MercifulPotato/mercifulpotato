Item(by='Dylan16807', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603229492, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24839294, text='&gt; Basically what it boils down to is that people don&#x27;t actually care. Even the vocal people who say they care don&#x27;t care because they won&#x27;t open their wallets or change their buying habits. If you won&#x27;t actually do anything about something, you don&#x27;t care. Whining on the Internet is not doing something.<p>People aren&#x27;t buying features off a list.  In a situation like this a missing feature has to be <i>so</i> important that it completely disqualifies the product, which is a very different thing from a willingness to open the wallet.<p>It&#x27;s similar to how you can get a kindle with or without lock screen ads.  If the only option was with ads, you&#x27;d see more people buying that version because it becomes artificially hard for them to say &quot;I don&#x27;t want ads&quot;.  Even though they&#x27;re willing to pay for the feature.<p>And for convenience vs. control, well, this firewall bypass doesn&#x27;t help convenience.')
