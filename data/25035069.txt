The subtle truth is that, as a practical matter, you often have to care about &quot;opinions&quot; you don&#x27;t respect or admire. Another&#x27;s opinion is a fact, albeit a minor one, from your point of view. What&#x27;s more, it&#x27;s the <i>legitimate</i> output of a computation they performed based on a set of (weighted) inputs. The market is best seen as a machine that measures two things: which market is better (meta market), and within each market, which product is better, from the sole perspective of making money.<p>All things die, including businesses. Layoffs can be a good thing if the job is terrible, the business is a zombie. Can you imagine working at Sears? It&#x27;s good to let bad businesses die because the alternative is worse. That said, humans like to get settled, comfortable, get a rhythm to life, and changing jobs (because of a business failure or whatever) is  a HUGE stressor. And its uncertain if you don&#x27;t know where you can &quot;plug in&quot; to the economy and get a job, so you&#x27;re in a rush, and new employers rush you through onboarding and acquire all kinds of legal leverage over you, and so on.... And the American worker is not trained to examine their options from any perspective other than &quot;Job Title&quot; and &quot;Salary&quot;. Even &quot;Benefits&quot; often get short shrift.<p>Anyway, long ramble short, you don&#x27;t have to admire the minds that move money, but you should take them seriously. It&#x27;s worth considering, though: what would it take to have your cake and eat it too? How would you make the &quot;markets&quot; more admirable, which in your case seems to mean &quot;more moral&quot;?')
