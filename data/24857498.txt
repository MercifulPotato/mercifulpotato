Which requires a G.Fast modem and having to deal with OpenReach.<p>Since upgrading I&#x27;ve been having a couple 30-seconds long disconnections every day. Zen delegates any responsibility to OpenReach, and the latter has sent an engineer [1] which hasn&#x27;t found anything wrong _on my end_ (of course), so I have to pay them 165+VAT for the call. And the disconnections are still there.<p>It&#x27;s perhaps not Zen&#x27;s fault, but I went to the most stable Internet I&#x27;ve ever had to one that disconnects randomly, while being 200m away from the cabinet and no-one can tell me where the problem is. Fun.<p>1: the engineer actually did a thorough job to make sure my line was OK, so the problem is elsewhere.')
