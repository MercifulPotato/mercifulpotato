But if I hadn&#x27;t learned how to do them, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to apply them to more advanced problems.<p>From my extremely limited exposure to US education methods, I would concur that some algorithms are practiced in an excessive manner. But that does not mean that they are useless, even if computers can help you often enough.<p>Maybe you can name a thing or two that you consider &quot;busywork [that] nobody does any more because we have computers and calculators&quot;?<p>(I will note though that biology courses always stood out to me in exactly the way that is lamented in this thread - almost entirely memorizing arbitrary things.)')
