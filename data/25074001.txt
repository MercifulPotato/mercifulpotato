Sending customers off-domain for a payment is not something we were willing to do for a normal credit card checkout flow.<p>Even &quot;hosted fields&quot; is absurd (and by that I assume you mean an iFrame you embed), and would require redesigning significant portions of the checkout process.<p>That, coupled with their refusal to even match our existing rates, was really off-putting. The sales people made little effort to understand our business and pain points - they just wanted to talk about how great Stripe is and all the AI stuff they do.')
