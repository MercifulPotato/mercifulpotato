Looked further into atp synthase. Absolutely amazing. A little turbine, driven by the flow of protons, spinning in 120 degree discrete clicks, around catalyst pockets, where each click changes the shape of the pocket to a new one. And after the pocket has gone through a complete cycle, adp and phosphate have been fused.<p>Never seen the chemical (proton concentration), converted into something mechanical (spinning), and back into chemical (adp + phosphate -&gt; atp) in such a way before.')
