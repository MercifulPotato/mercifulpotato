So, my wife (my target audience for this app) is in the next room practicing even as I write this. It doesn&#x27;t annoy me that she&#x27;s out of tune. It annoys me that she doesn&#x27;t stop, back up, correct when she plays a note badly out of tune. She can sing the pieces very accurately, but when she plays she is so lenient on herself. I don&#x27;t get it, because in general she&#x27;s kinda a detailed oriented perfectionist person who, not to stereotype, grew up in a a country known for detail-oriented perfectionism. I try to teach her (by shouting at her from the next room usually) to isolate the passages she gets wrong and then practice them super slowly. This is all really great for us as married pandemic housemates.')
