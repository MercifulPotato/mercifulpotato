Only at that point were the more obvious signs of a fake democracy implemented (such as making opposition parties illegal and having <i>someone</i> assassinate the leader of the opposition after he complained about election irregularities), and even so, they retained non-free elections instead of getting rid of them entirely.<p>So I think it&#x27;s entirely reasonable for &quot;anti-Fascists&quot; to not be placated merely by the fact that an election took place within a nominally-democratic structure, and in particular entirely reasonable for them to be skeptical of a nominally-democratic election where you can gain power through means other than winning the popular vote and where there are irregularities in counting votes.')
