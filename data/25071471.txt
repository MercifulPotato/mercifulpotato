In a properly functioning economy, people who risk their lives and do the things others are unwilling or unable to do but need to get done get paid a premium. If essential employees can&#x27;t leverage their irreplaceability into higher wages, that suggests a deep systemic problem. This sort of welfare would allow the economy to get through the current crisis without addressing that problem and then get back to suppressing wages as usual.')
