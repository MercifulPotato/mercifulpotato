The width of each line should be about 1-3 pixels. Then map the image onto polar coordinates, so the lines would meet in the middle. Finally, downscale it a couple times with a basic avg(2x2) -&gt; 1x1 mapping. Observe an elaborate &quot;shadow shape&quot; in the middle that looks like r=cos(4 pi a), but with a lot more nuanced details.')
