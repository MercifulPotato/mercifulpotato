It&#x27;s really corrosive.<p>I don&#x27;t accept this premise. Americans don&#x27;t have a lot of the cultural baggage that leads to this. If anything, Americans are quick to admit fault and address root causes. We don&#x27;t have a cultural history of beating around the bush, saving face, deferring to elders who are clearly wrong, etc. Individual exceptions abound, but I think on the whole Americans are ready to admit fault most of the time.')
