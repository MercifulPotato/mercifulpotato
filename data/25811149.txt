What we saw with the email leaks was that the fact that a leak occurred was used as a “hook” to spin a massive network of falsehoods. To this day nobody remembers anything about that leak except “pizzagate.” Was there anything of legitimate truth-to-power interest in there? Maybe, but it was instantly drowned in the ocean of bullshit that is social media.<p>Other far more damaging leaks have occurred but nobody remembers them. They are messages in a bottle bobbing somewhere out there in that vast ocean of shit.<p>You see... you can lie with the truth. Just twist it and tack on falsehood. The small amount of truth there makes the lie more powerful.<p>Maybe that was the establishment’s response: “flood the zone.” If so it worked.<p>If Assange isn’t a fascist in the bag for fascists, he is naive. Personally I still lean toward him being in the bag for the fascists. He strikes me as someone too smart not to see what I outlined above and how the current tactics of his organization play right into it.<p>Wikileaks tactics cannot work unless we can drain the real swamp, namely social media, and get people talking like facts and reality matter. In the present climate leaks are ineffective or worse actually enable more deception.')
