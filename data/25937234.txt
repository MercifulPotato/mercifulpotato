Its as if they never used SMS or anything similar. Unusable.<p>I&#x27;ve also used it for video calls. We had connection issues and swapped over to Houseparty (!) to get group chat working fast. That was stable as a rock. Excellent. And we played Uno during the meeting. Bonus.<p>But Duo seems ok now. For video calls we now use it and are happy enough. So, take that for what its worth. We&#x27;ll continue using it until it is mysteriously cancelled next year.')
