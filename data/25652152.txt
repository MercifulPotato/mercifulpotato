I think we&#x27;ve known for quite some time (at least since the Influenza epidemic of 1918) that masks can help prevent the spread of viruses of this sort.<p>At first in the US, the recommendation was to not wear a mask.  The reasoning was that we weren&#x27;t sure about whether airborne or surface-borne spread was more of a factor (remember the huge shortages of hand sanitizer), and we wanted to prevent a run on masks, so that we would have enough masks for health care workers.<p>This then gets into the reasons why we didn&#x27;t have enough PPE on hand in our strategic reserve which is more of a political question.<p>So in the case of the US at least, I think we are aware of the proper strategies, but many people, from the top down, refuse to adopt and&#x2F;or promote those strategies.')
