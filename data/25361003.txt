Market making in an open, competitive space (e.g. prop shops competing on a public exchange) is extremely difficult.<p>But I get the sense that OP was talking about captive flow. You do see this a lot on sell-side desks. Some client approaches the bank to do a trade that&#x27;s ancillary to their business. E.g. a large multinational needing to hedge its FX exposure. They&#x27;re mostly selecting the bank based on the overall reputation and relationship with the franchise. If the desk squeezes them for a few basis points on a cross-currency swap, the client pretty much doesn&#x27;t care, let alone seeking out competitive pricing on individual trades.')
