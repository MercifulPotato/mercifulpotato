Age 80+ and healthcare or other frontline workers - starting now<p>2. Age 70+<p>3. Age 60+ and those with underlying conditions<p>etc<p>It&#x27;s quite a long list and you&#x27;re looking at millions of vaccinations and boosters before any children will be considered unless they have major health problems. We&#x27;ve done roughly 2 million injections in the UK so far.<p>Also for minors I suspect the decision to vaccinate will be mainly with the parents not the kids, although it would be nice if they were compliant.<p>As mentioned below a statistics lesson on the groups of population by age&#x2F;risk and statistics on catching the virus and outcome would be interesting.')
