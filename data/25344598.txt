The <i>relative risk</i> is almost certainly higher to a baby, but how high? We don&#x27;t know, since there haven&#x27;t been any longitudinal studies (for starters.) Which is why it would be unethical outside a clinical trial to administer it to younger people en masse.<p>Eventually the <i>relative risk</i> will be quantifiable, but it will take years. It took ~4 years for the increased risk of narcolepsy in children due to the H1N1 vaccine (Pandemrix) to be reported, for example.')
