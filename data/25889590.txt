Item(by='alentist', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611466334, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25888645, text='&gt; That comment doesn&#x27;t enumerate or even alludes to any tangible benefits of crypto currencies.<p>Either:<p>1. You didn&#x27;t actually read the comment.<p>2. You have no idea what ZeroNet or Blockstream are.<p>It is no crime to be ignorant of the topic, but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on it while remaining in this state of ignorance.<p>In its discussion of physical <i>and</i> financial censorship (note the 2nd sentence), the comment also <i>did</i> (and I have to wonder how you &quot;missed&quot; this) refer to one of the best real-world illustrations of the value of cryptocurrencies: circumventing Venezuela&#x27;s tyrannical regime and its destructive fiscal and monetary policies. That&#x27;s my home country, and those are real lives. I&#x27;d love to hear you lecture me about how those people don&#x27;t exist.<p>&gt; and the supposed resiliency<p>Why &quot;supposed&quot;?<p>&gt; I&#x27;m pretty sure GP has heard of those.<p>&quot;Heard of&quot;? Maybe. Understand? Clearly not.<p>&gt; Whether HFT provides any benefit in terms of liquidity and smaller spreads is by no means clear.<p>It is. Bid-ask spreads are down to about 3 basis points from about 90 basis points 2 decades ago. Curbing HFT in the past—surprise, surprise—increased the spread. See also [0].<p>&gt; HFT is certainly neither necessary nor even contributing to price discovery.<p>Well, you are certainly <i>wrong</i> [1], despite prefacing your false claim with &quot;certainly&quot;. What does that tell us? Why are you prefacing false claims with &quot;certainly&quot;?<p>&gt; I submit that the economy would work just fine with a price auction every minute (maybe with stochastic cut-off) for, say, 3 hours a day<p>Indeed the economy would &quot;work just fine&quot; with horse-drawn carriages and pigeon post. I commend you for your brilliant proposal. I recommend we implement this novel idea as soon as possible and see how it goes.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;timworstall&#x2F;2014&#x2F;04&#x2F;01&#x2F;hft-really-does-reduce-the-bid-ask-spread-making-michael-lewis-wrong-about-hft" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;timworstall&#x2F;2014&#x2F;04&#x2F;01&#x2F;hft-real...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cfainstitute.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;research&#x2F;cfa-digest&#x2F;2015&#x2F;04&#x2F;high-frequency-trading-and-price-discovery-digest-summary" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cfainstitute.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;research&#x2F;cfa-digest&#x2F;2015&#x2F;04&#x2F;...</a>')
