Obviously developers, if limited to building a fraction of what&#x27;s needed, will go for the more profitable segment first. But that&#x27;s not the underlying problem! The problem is that the total new units are too restricted. If we build a tiny, restricted amount of subsidized housing, there will <i>still</i> be hundreds of thousands of workers lacking housing, because the overall amount is <i>too small</i>.<p>What we need to do is first focus on the overall shortage and commit to building a huge amount of housing. Then it won&#x27;t matter as much whether or not it&#x27;s subsidized, because with an excess of housing, some will end up priced for every segment.')
