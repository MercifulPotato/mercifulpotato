On paper, it&#x27;s to talk about what we did yesterday and what we&#x27;re doing today.  And we do that.  But we&#x27;re allowed to take as much time beyond that as we like to socialize.  We talk about tv, movies, games, sports, whatever.<p>Without this, I think I would be a lot worse off in this crisis, and I&#x27;m a pretty extreme introvert.<p>If I was in your situation and had to actually bug people to talk to them...  Ugh.  No way.<p>Have you asked others if they want to be on an 8 hr&#x2F;day video call with you?  Perhaps there are others that would prefer that, or would do it to help you.<p>I personally would not enjoy that, but if someone on my team needed it...  I&#x27;d at least try to deal with it.<p>Alternatively, maybe you can find a few of them to do it for 2 hrs&#x2F;day and take the edge off.')
