Or, where should I go to learn?<p>I want to:\n  - deploy a REST API, with WebSockets that should be able to handle potentially many concurrent connections\n  - be able to store user sessions in Redis \n  - store data in a scalable SQL database\n  - be able to continuously deploy as I push code<p>I&#x27;m confused by the number of services and options I have.\n  - I&#x27;m not interested in Firebase, or similar services, because I don&#x27;t want to be locked in.\n  - I&#x27;m not interested in cloud functions, or lambda functions, I don&#x27;t want to deal with cold starts\n  - I&#x27;m not sure about Heroku, I don&#x27;t want everything done for me. I feel like this will inhibit learning and growth rather than encourage it.<p>Do I:\n  - Use Amazon EC2, or some other container service? I&#x27;m not sure if this is what they&#x27;re even for. Would these services help me spread connections and requests across multiple containers?\n  - Use a managed SQL database like RDS, or DigitalOcean managed databases? Will this be cost-effective in the long run? What other ways do I have to handle my database?\n  - Use something like Elasticache for Redis? Is there something else I can do here too?\n  - How can I implement a CI&#x2F;CD pipeline along with all this?<p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Any recommendations for books or other resources to learn what to learn would also be appreciated.')
