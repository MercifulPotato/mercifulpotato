The mere fact of its existence causes problems.<p>So you delete your source code after you ship an app? That doesn&#x27;t make sense. The source code is one of every software company&#x27;s greatest assets which is why we have created so many tools to keep track of it like version control, automated testing etc. Otherwise there would be no point in clean code, code documentation etc, just write something that solves the problem and done! No need to even check in the code, just build a binary locally and ship!<p>I understand the point, but saying that code is a liability and not an asset is false no matter how you look at it. Source code solves a lot of problems you can&#x27;t solve with binaries, it lets you adapt to change much better. So instead of saying that code is a liability, use the business saying &quot;Focus on your core business&quot;, meaning don&#x27;t write code for things that isn&#x27;t your core business.')
