British English uses &quot;ground floor&quot; for the floor that is at ground height and &quot;first floor&quot; for the first floor you need to reach by stairs. American English often interprets &quot;first floor&quot; as the first floor entered (the one on the ground). Of course, the British rule has left the American continent these days, but in other countries this could very easily become a problem.<p>In a country with different cultures, languages and systems of writing it&#x27;s only natural that the Chinese representation reflects what a Chinese person would call that floor, with the English representation next to it converted to whatever level of language compatibility someone might choose for international mail.')
