Item(by='skohan', descendants=None, kids=[25892599], score=None, time=1611500206, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25892238, text='I understand these arguments, but I can&#x27;t help thinking that the use of the term &quot;guys&quot; is really a non-issue.  As someone who&#x27;s been living as an expat for the past 6 years, I speak 3 languages decently and another one poorly.  If there is anything this has convinced me of, it&#x27;s that languages in general don&#x27;t make a lot of sense, and the meaning of words is purely defined by how they are used.<p>By that definition, &quot;guys&quot;, when used to refer to a group of people, has always been a genderless term.  In fact, growing up in a progressive town in the midwest, if I heard someone use the term &quot;y&#x27;all&quot; instead of &quot;you guys&quot;, it would signal to me that they might not be that good on gender issues (due to an unjustified stereotype we had about southern people).<p>I think you can pick it apart, and find complex logical reasons why &quot;guys&quot; might be gendered in certain circumstances, but I think in 99% of cases when it&#x27;s used, people are able to understand with complete clarity whether it&#x27;s a gendered or genderless usage of the term.<p>And also I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going anywhere, because it&#x27;s an incredibly useful term which has the right level of generality and casualness for a great many situations.')
