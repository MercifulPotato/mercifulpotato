Its stock behaviour seems a little weird in places, but I’ll try it for a while and see how it goes. But the real thing that’s annoying me is how uncompromisingly <i>huge</i> it is. Its default behaviour has it consuming a shade under two thirds of the available screen space on my not-inordinately-large phone, compared with under half on the Samsung keyboard in its compact (reduced-height) mode. You can control the height of the <i>top</i> row (and it’s compact by default), but can’t control the height of the rest (other than by going to a theme that consumes <i>even more</i> space)? I want to eliminate the wasted ~30px at the bottom, and shrink each row by around 20px. I can <i>easily</i> save 100px here without removing anything.')
