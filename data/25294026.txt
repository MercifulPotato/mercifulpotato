No accommodations, no changes, no talk. You board your plane, stand on a conveyor and it takes you to your slot, you bring your own urine and poo bag if you want, the airline charges you for damage to the slot. No dogs, no cats, no nothing. No &quot;can I get a this&quot;.<p>For the DMV, you have a checklist and you walk up with everything on the checklist and the robot sends you off if you meet the checklist.<p>For stores, you have full facial-recognition and single-entry gateways. Violation is a full ban from the store. Digital signed payment only, no cash.<p>I mean, I get why it is, but for someone normative, not having to deal with people who (often for no fault of their own) have harder lives would be just <i>so</i> much better.')
