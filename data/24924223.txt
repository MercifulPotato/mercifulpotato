See also the AR-22 variant used on the ill-fated DARPA XSP program.<p>The real issue with that engine isn&#x27;t its reusability, it&#x27;s that the industry has learned a lot about rocket engine design, operation, and manufacturing since the RS-25 was developed.  That&#x27;s reflected in the engines available from the likes of Blue Origin and SpaceX.  No knock on the RS-25 - it stands as a watershed achievement for humanity in the engineering of thermodynamic systems.<p>Though calling the SpaceX engines &quot;available&quot; needs the caveat that SpaceX will not make them available outside of SpaceX.')
