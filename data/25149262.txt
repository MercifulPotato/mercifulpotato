In reality it&#x27;s more likely that you&#x27;d end up paying with money <i>and</i> with the data that&#x27;s being collected. Businesses always want to grow revenue so at some point collecting data again or serving you ads in a paid product constitutes low hanging fruit.<p>Look at Samsung and the ads they force on you after you paid thousands on their TVs, look at Amazon who crams some ads in movies and shows you already pay for with Prime, look at Google who still collects info on you even if you pay for YouTube Premium.<p>This isn&#x27;t about paying with money <i>or</i> your data. You may get something for your money at first, until you don&#x27;t anymore.')
