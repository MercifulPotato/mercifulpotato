For some, video interaction is highly personal. You&#x27;re inviting work into your home, and even with virtual backgrounds and quick access to the mute button, video can be exhausting for these reasons and&#x2F;or just because it&#x27;s video. Not everyone has adjusted as well as others to this form of communication.<p>2. You&#x27;re describing a desired end state, which is not necessarily the current reality. Small and agile teams&#x2F;companies may have more success in fundamentally altering their communication structures and habits. Larger (and especially growing) orgs haven&#x27;t necessarily mastered this. Entire teams who have never worked remotely have been asked to adjust overnight. And even though we&#x27;ve all been in this for awhile now, the organizational change required to truly alter the meaning of a meeting, or perhaps remove the need for that meeting altogether is not something that will be achieved any time soon for some companies.<p>3. I can fully dedicate myself to making &quot;remote work effective for myself&quot; (and in fact, I have - I&#x27;ve been remote for ~7 years), but making those changes for myself does not automatically translate to changes for the team&#x2F;org. Anecdotally, pre-COVID, I spent ~6-7 days&#x2F;month IN the office to handle those things that are better accomplished in person. That&#x27;s what made it work for me. That&#x27;s no longer an option, AND everyone who I worked with - folks who were <i>not</i> remote workers - are all going through their own personal transition and set of struggles unique to their home life, personality, prior WFH experience, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree with some aspects of your conclusion - but I&#x27;d argue that they are unreasonable to achieve without a company-wide commitment to changing  how we work, and those changes will not happen quickly for most.<p>This is why people are clamoring to get back.')
