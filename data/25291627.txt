To clarify: I mean stocks are shares in companies, which generally generate profits. Yes, some companies may not, or may even go under, but none of this is an issue if you hold a diversified set of stock and bond indexes for the long haul (I&#x27;m talking about equities as an asset class, not any one stock).
