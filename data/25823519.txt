And there are three things you need to know about it:<p>1. It runs with highest privilege, so it has access to the whole system but you can&#x27;t access it.<p>2. Its always running, even when your device is switched off.<p>3. It has a web server, complete with its own MAC address. There is no discernible way of cutting off its access.
