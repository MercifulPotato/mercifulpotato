It started out with phone numbers which I was okay with at the time (since I \n only chat with ppl who I&#x27;d be okay sharing my cell# with anyways), though I now see it as a potential privacy concern.  But the idea of forcing me to submit a personal piece of information (the name field cannot just be an empty space) doesn&#x27;t correlate with &quot;privacy&quot; and security that they so strongly portray as their priorities.  The fact I can&#x27;t even access the app anymore unless I populate the First Name field with some kind of text -- information I&#x27;m never going to share with another user anyways -- is really disappointing and frustrating.')
