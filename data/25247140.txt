You cannot use the arithmetic mean on interest rates because it does not make sense to add them up. If you just go for the geometric mean &quot;because it&#x27;s a rate and I have read online I should use geometric mean&quot; then you won&#x27;t learn <i>why</i> you need to use the geometric mean.<p>Frequencies also don&#x27;t add up.... But wavelength or time do. So their inverse can be added. So their inverses can have an arithmetic mean. So you can physically meaningfully do the arithmetic mean of their inverse, and inverse the result back again')
