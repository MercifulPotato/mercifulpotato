Some security and telemetry policies need relaxed, audio service doesn&#x27;t run by default, Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration needs disabled so you can grab an installer for your preferred browser, and other minor things like disabling Ctrl+Alt+Del on the login screen.<p>The result, though, is that you get an OS that acts like regular old Windows 10, with _zero_ ads and (I think?) less telemetry. I have not seen anything Pro can do that Server cannot, even gaming (Steam, AMD graphics drivers) works fine. As a bonus, you&#x27;re not subject to any of the restrictions that Pro has for advanced workloads like virtualization. Server Manager along with all the extra utilities not found on Pro are also nice to have.<p>Updates are still downloaded&#x2F;installed automatically, but servers can&#x27;t reboot whenever they feel like it, so I&#x27;m not ever interrupted by unwanted reboots like on Pro.')
