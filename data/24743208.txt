Here we have some advanced version of JavaScript (es7?) going through a series of compilations, asset extraction, tree shaking, dependency graphs that are 10000+ packages long etc. The solutions rust and cargo choose (like having a decent standard library to reduce deps) are all better. Rust is fast and worth paying a compilation prise for, is it worth it in JS so we can have shiny semantic sugar everywhere? I don’t know how crate modules works but hopefully each library needs you to specify versions of all dependencies at the top level rather than magically hiding modules you’re adding 5 levels deep.<p>I could probably go on further if I knew rust better. The ecosystems are completely different IMO and webpack as a build system leads to complexity not clarity - its like a machine where an animal goes in and a sausage comes out, whereas other build systems are more logical in their steps.')
