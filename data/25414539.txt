Item(by='enriquto', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607932204, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25413082, text='&gt; one of the great things about biking is that you get to pick and choose between car rules and pedestrian rules<p>Oh, I hate that!  Bikes are transit, and are not supposed to leave the transit in the middle of their way, especially not for negotiating an intersection.  Bailing out of the bike and going on foot with the pedestrians does not count as &quot;doing the correct thing&quot;, just that using the bike is impossible.  Besides, it is annoying for the pedestrians.')
