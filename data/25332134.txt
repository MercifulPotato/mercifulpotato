As for the embassy itself, it is there only at the pleasure of the hosting government <i>and</i> of the United States. If Cuba wants the embassy gone, it merely has to tell them to leave. Sickening or crippling the staff does nothing to, say, help the cause of recovering Guantanamo Bay.<p>I know I&#x27;m missing something, because I don&#x27;t think this would happen if there weren&#x27;t an advantage of some sort somewhere. I just don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s to the advantage of the <i>hosting</i> country. In fact, I would think it works against the interests of the hosting country.')
