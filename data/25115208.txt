Unless&#x2F;until &quot;there was a valid counter-notice and no response has been received from the plaintiff within 10 days of the counter-notice being forwarded&quot;. (Unclear what happens if there is a valid counter-notice and a response from plaintiff HAS been received, the workflow stop there!). This did not happen here, github reinstated without either a formal counter-notice (that EFF letter is not formatted like one), and definitely without waiting 10 days for a response from plaintiff.<p>Gitlab&#x27;s workflow there is a <i>totally typical</i> DMCA workflow, it&#x27;s not bad it&#x27;s just <i>normal</i>. It&#x27;s the workflow  more or less spelled out in the DMCA itself,  arguably what the DMCA <i>requires</i> for the host to get &quot;safe harbor&quot; status. (I don&#x27;t entirely understand how Github can get away with what they have done and say they are doing going forward, honestly. It&#x27;s think it&#x27;s a potentially risky move for them opening them up to lawsuits from the copyright holders; of course they know they have deep pockets to defend themselves too).<p>The DMCA is actually pretty terrible in it&#x27;s real-world contemporary effects. That&#x27;s general, not about github, or github&#x27;s fault. You are right to think it&#x27;s awful. But it&#x27;s not about github. People seem to be really chomping at the bit to assume that github has somehow acted <i>especially poorly</i> (for those who want to protect people against DMCA takedowns) -- to me the reverse seems to be true.<p>I think both github&#x27;s actual current actions and most especially their proposed new workflow go <i>way beyond</i> what most of their peers (including gitlab) do to resist&#x2F;slow down&#x2F;stop DMCA takedowns.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how github garnered so much bad will, that people are so eager to paint them in a bad light. They clearly have garnered a <i>lot</i> of bad will from developers though, at least on HN; every thread about github has people piling on to suggest extreme levels of unethical behavior from github.<p>I do not believe it is justified here.')
