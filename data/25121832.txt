Publishing of DKIM keys will only allow people to produce more convincing faked emails. If a bunch of faked emails about a political leader signed with DKIM keys were released securities experts are going to say these keys are leaked and anyone could fake those emails but by the time they do the damage will have already happened and no one would be listening to them. The solution is not to release DKIM keys, but to make sure mails are not leaked. Throwing away signatures a few days after the email is delivered would not be a bad plan either, given they have actually served their purpose at that point.')
