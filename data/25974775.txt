They have all been different but have largely gone as described in the book. I&#x27;ve done a lot of therapy in my life and personal growth is a priority in my life.<p>As a result of these sessions I&#x27;ve overcome some serious challenges that I had previously assumed were static aspects of my personality. It has been challenging to be sure, but much better to deal with things head-on for a short time, than to deal with them low-key forever.<p>Thought the community here would appreciate this given the mild interest&#x2F;openness to psychedelics.<p>I&#x27;d be happy to answer any questions about my experience so far, ask whatever you&#x27;d like!<p>[edit: missed a word]')
