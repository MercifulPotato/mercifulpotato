I&#x27;ve seen many data visualisation apps for Covid-19 stats, positive cases and deaths counts, but I thought it would be nice to collect and visualise some thoughts and feelings from people around the world during this pandemic (Got inspiration from InsideOut too, that simplistic yet effective emotion balls).<p>It&#x27;s not trying to be statistically useful - rather, it&#x27;s a place where people share post their feelings and possibly get some condolences(?).<p>There&#x27;s still works to do as it&#x27;s at MVP state.
