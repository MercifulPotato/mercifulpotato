For years, Mac laptop performance lagged years behind high-end desktop performance -- they have been stuck on 14nm+ process chips with a mobile power budget, while desktop users have had 7nm chips that can draw 500W with no trouble.  As a result, what M1 users tell you is fast is what PC desktop users have had for ages.  A Threadripper and 3090 will blow the M1 out of the water in raw performance (but use a kilowatt while doing it, which a laptop obviously can&#x27;t do).<p>At my last job, they issued us 2012-era Macbooks.  I eventually got so frustrated with the performance that I went out and bought everyone on my team an 8th generation NUC.  It was night and day.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how much faster everything was.  The M1 is a similar revelation for people that have stayed inside the Mac ecosystem all these years.')
