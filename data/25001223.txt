In almost all U.S. jurisdictions, a civil forfeiture lawsuit can&#x27;t be filed until the prosecuting agency is actual in custodial possession of the property.  The point of the lawsuit is to give the lawful owners of the property the opportunity to challenge the seizure and get their property back.')
