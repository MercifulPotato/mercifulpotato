Item(by='jolmg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609272088, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25544200, text='&gt; Why is it that despite listening on TCP 9100, some printers will just print the source code when you send them a PDF or Postscript file with netcat?<p>Not all printers interpret those languages on that port. Zebra printers interpret ZPL there, for example. I think most Postscript would look like plain text to a ZPL interpreter.<p>&gt; Are there any networked printers around nowadays that don&#x27;t support Postscript?<p>I&#x27;d be somewhat surprised if most&#x2F;all label printers and receipt printers accept Postscript. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if there are more niche types of networked printers where it might not make sense to support Postscript, depending on the market.')
