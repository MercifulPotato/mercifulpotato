I am an outlier in that I use three external displays, and my current MacBook can just barely support it if I make sure to spread my devices over separate usb-c dongles. If I try to put keyboard, mouse, power, and monitor on a single advertised as supporting multiple USB and power and HDMI, the keyboard and especially mouse stop working correctly, even with “just” two external monitors. I thought things were moving in a direction where I’d have one hub&#x2F;dock I plug all my peripherals into, leaving one cord to plug into the laptop, but now I have a maze of dongles I have to load balance!<p>I don’t mind what they did on phones with the headphone jack, because they provided an excellent alternative. On MacBooks, they just take away ports without a solid replacement.')
