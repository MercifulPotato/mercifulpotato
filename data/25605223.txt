But for some reason we’ve equated the ability to do leet code problems with the ability to do the latter and now I’ve got to spend a significant amount of time churning through a bunch of coding exercises to prove myself instead of proving myself by doing real projects and being able to speak about them. As for take-homes, my main problem with them, other than the risk that you’re doing unpaid work, is that you often just submit your solution to the void without any chance to discuss your solution and the trade-offs you made, improvements you would implement given more time, etc. so you can imagine it quickly becomes an onerous time drain that doesn’t seem like a fair trade of time on your part if every company asks for one.')
