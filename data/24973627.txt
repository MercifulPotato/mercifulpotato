No corporation is giving you things out of the kindness of its heart. They have a plan to get paid.<p>The price of the Ferrari is not just the price of the Ferrari. It&#x27;s the price of all of the logistics and inventory management as well.<p>The extent to which OVH lags behind Amazon in terms of selection and ability to absorb a large order or a new large customer is all factored into the price differential.  Putting &#x27;billions&#x27; into the title role suggests an audience of people who make million dollar purchasing decisions (lots of servers, and get them today), not tens of thousands of mom and pop shops trying to save $1000 a quarter. But maybe that&#x27;s just me.<p>It&#x27;s one thing if Amazon is price gouging. It&#x27;s quite another if OVH is undercutting to build market share. We keep arguing in bad faith about the price difference between a company that can sustain their price point for decades versus one that will have to hike their rates the moment we get comfortable, or risk going bankrupt. If it were all the former, yes let&#x27;s discuss. If it&#x27;s all the latter, I don&#x27;t understand how in 2020 we can still be having that sort of conversation. The road behind us is lined with gravestones, and we should know better. Having another conversation of that sort ranks, for me, somewhere between root canal and spinal tap.<p>Probably it&#x27;s a bit of both. I doubt very much that it&#x27;s that OVH knows how to get a $1000 server cheaper than Amazon can do it.')
