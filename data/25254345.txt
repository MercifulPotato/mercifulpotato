Does anyone risk putting a secondhand battery in their phones for example? Might be okay for old Nokia style batteries, but the integrated ones, not a chance.<p>Another problem is that with EV battery packs, they&#x27;re not really viable to be disassembled and repaired (e.g. by replacing individual cells), they&#x27;re built pretty solid and integrated. Not saying it&#x27;s impossible, just that it&#x27;s likely not viable, not to mention very dangerous work. I could be wrong though.')
