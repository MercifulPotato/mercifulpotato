Assuming ios has a similar amount, that puts the total number of downloads around 1 billion.<p>1.5 million concurrent connections would then represent roughly .15% of their total user base[1]. Hard to say whether that&#x27;s accurate or not. I certainly use Uber less than .15% of the time but I imagine big events like New Year&#x27;s see huge spikes in usage.<p>[1]Number of downloads isn&#x27;t totally accurate for estimating user base but I&#x27;m not sure of another way. Also, article mentions that their system powers  over 10 different apps but I&#x27;m assuming that the those numbers are negligible compared to the main Uber app.')
