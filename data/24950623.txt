I try to be respectful by not suggesting common stuff since they would have already looked into. Sometimes I&#x27;ll suggest looking into some less common things. There are many things that modern doctors won&#x27;t suggest or don&#x27;t know about.<p>For example, I&#x27;m an amateur mycologist and I have heard about health benefits of different mushrooms. If they don&#x27;t want hear about the health aspect, the way I bring it up usually opens the door to a topic change about foraging for mushrooms, eating them, and many related questions.<p>In this case, I don&#x27;t know of anything that would help frozen shoulder. There is some stuff that I find interesting to talk about but don&#x27;t think it is worth suggesting to him. Like some studies on pain management that I barely remember, but I don&#x27;t know if it was on psilocybin or maybe LSD. The way my dumbed-down brain remembers it is that it basically causes a pain &quot;reset&quot; where in some cases the brain ignores the persistent pain signals, or lowers the perceived pain level. There is also grayanotoxin that comes from tincture of ghost pipes that alters how pain is perceived, but I think that is only temporary. Interesting thing is that ghost pipes are actually a plant that doesn&#x27;t contain any chlorophyll, but feed off of the roots of other plants, somewhat similar to some mychorrizal fungi.')
