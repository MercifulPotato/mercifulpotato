Like in Canada, we already have gun registration and background checks (the &quot;common sense&quot; laws that Biden wants but that the NRA says are radical) and the fight is about banning specific classes of assault rifles. In Canada, we already have state health insurance, and the fight is about whether it should cover things like pharmacare, dental treatments, and counseling sessions for mental health. In Canada, the debates about abortion and gay marriage are long settled (1988 and 2003 respectively)— even discussing them is considered political suicide, and the Conservative party has at various points banned back-benchers from attempting to start the debate (for example, by putting forth weaselly, redundant laws about fetal personhood).<p>You could easily argue that the &quot;Conservative&quot; party in Canada is equivalent or possibly even to the left of the mainstream Democratic party in the US. So yeah, it gets a bit weird when right-leaning people in Canada then also support Trumpian politics— sometimes it&#x27;s hard to know if they&#x27;re there after a considered review of the positions, or if it&#x27;s just a knee jerk &quot;pick the guy on the right&quot; response.')
