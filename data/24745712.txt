Humans were not designed to eat white flour, refined sugar, high fructose corn syrup, and hydrogenated vegetable oil. And yet if you analyzed the contents of the average grocery store you&#x27;d probably find these four ingredients accounted for most of the calories. &quot;Normal&quot; food is terribly bad for you. The only people who eat what humans were actually designed to eat are a few Birkenstock-wearing weirdos in Berkeley.<p>If &quot;normal&quot; food is so bad for us, why is it so common? There are two main reasons. One is that it has more immediate appeal. You may feel lousy an hour after eating that pizza, but eating the first couple bites feels great. The other is economies of scale. Producing junk food scales; producing fresh vegetables doesn&#x27;t. Which means (a) junk food can be very cheap, and (b) it&#x27;s worth spending a lot to market it.&quot;<p>All of this is false.<p>Junk food isn&#x27;t cheap calorie per dollar or various nutrients per dollar (source- efficiency is everything) further, fresh vegetables are the cheapest sources of nutrition.<p>And humans are able to eat the foods mentioned and turn into energy through various metabolic processes.<p>The author seems to parrot &quot;common&quot; knowledge, but it&#x27;s not factual by any stretch. (Ok maybe trans fats, but those are borderline illegal)')
