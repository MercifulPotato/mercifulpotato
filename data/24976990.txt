As someone who has been involved in the affiliate space, accepting a token issued by an ad network seems like a terrible idea. Separation of concerns is important in this case.<p>Instead of the ad network facing the consequences of chargebacks, unfulfilled obligations, fraud and abuse, everyone holding the token will be on the hook. With all of the horrible things that go on in the ad&#x2F;affiliate industry experienced publishers should be wary of this.<p>Also, as an expat the KYC stuff has generally been insurmountable. Hard to square that with the privacy angle.<p>However, I do look forward to innovation in this space. Brave&#x2F;BAT has issues, but at least they&#x27;re doing something.')
