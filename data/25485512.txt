It&#x27;s not the title of the linked-to piece of legislation, and after reading it I don&#x27;t see where Christmas is cancelled.<p>For example, it explicitly allows worship - which I assume includes Christmas mass - and allows the sale of living Christmas trees.<p>And makes no mention that household can&#x27;t celebrate Christmas at home. I think they can even celebrate in public outdoor places.<p>Perhaps &quot;UK Tier 4 restrictions during Christmas&quot; is a better title?')
