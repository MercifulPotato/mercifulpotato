Portraying it as a &quot;dial&quot; is also doing a complete disservice to the actual technical problem involved.<p>The documentary was successful in underplaying the challenges of moderating&#x2F;recommending at scale and, in my opinion, scapegoating social media companies as the source of the problem when they&#x27;re really a symptom.<p>The main focal point of The Social Dilemma, Tristan Harris, as creator of the Centre for Humane Technology has an obvious agenda (not saying he&#x27;s wrong). Take the documentary for what it is but to throw the baby out with the bathwater is wrong when there are obvious benefits to social media.<p>Regulating social media is a fool&#x27;s errand imo, it&#x27;s a lose-lose. Either you let ideas flow which includes bad actors&#x2F;ideas to propagate or you now create gatekeepers and censors with ever moving goalposts. I&#x27;m not against more regulation but do you really think the United States Congress is capable of passing legislation to effectively tow that line? Doubtful.')
