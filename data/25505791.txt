Partly because distinctions at the time between gay men who did drag and trans women did not exist, but also partly because the overarching theme of the movement (and the hate it received) has been the sense of &#x27;disgust&#x27; by mainstream society of its subversion of heteronormative values.<p>Many trans men and women lead the movement vocally when many gay men and women who could survive in the closet sat and waited.<p>But that&#x27;s the thing, the good faith discussion happened so many times, and it has been litigated many times. For many of us, trans and non-binary folks gave us many of our rights, and they did not out of a sense of solidarity, but literally because they were fighting for the same thing (really, a revolution against gender norms and expectations).<p>As the gp said, however, this good faith conversation happens a few times (and has been litigated to death over and over, and continues to). But the domination in the &quot;drop the T&quot; movement is really dehumanizing language about trans people, accusing them of an agenda, brainwashing children, etc. It&#x27;s really harmful, and it is things that gay, lesbian, and bi folks have been accused of already.')
