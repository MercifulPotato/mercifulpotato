AFAIK it&#x27;s best to just live with whatever Unity version you&#x27;ve started your game in and be careful of upgrading point releases and avoid upgrading to any major release.<p>Also, I think it&#x27;s worth mentioning that if you care about the longevity of your game (like 10+ years into the future), depending on the Unity runtime being compatible with future OS versions is also a risk.<p>Then again, the alternative requires some pretty hefty engineering chops and prior knowledge of a whole host of lower level concepts and APIs.')
