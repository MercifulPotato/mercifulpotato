To scale fast at that time, the government paid already existing corporations to build but kept ownership of the completed buildings. The point is that it&#x27;s still a state venture and the profit motive&#x2F;investment, &quot;free market&quot;, was essentially suspended. So without this kind of government program the market, because of profit&#x2F;risk&#x2F;investment motives, won&#x27;t build this.')
