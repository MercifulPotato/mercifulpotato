The only services that implemented something that resembles data portability are e-mail providers, and there it works mostly because there already is an underyling protocol that is built with federation in mind.<p>We really need more open protocols to make this happen. A doable strategy could be too look at markets with a lot of existing solutions (e.g. chat, task management, note taking, scheduling, document management, file syncing) and force the players to formulate a protocol that everyone adheres to. Since that will take a long time it&#x27;s probably only doable for the core services, but having something like this e.g. for chat services would be incredibly useful.')
