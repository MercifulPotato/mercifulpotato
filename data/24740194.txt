In case of default, they&#x27;ll repossess the house to recoup some of the amount.<p>Does this mean it&#x27;s a good idea for a bank to give huge loans to people who they know won&#x27;t be able to pay it back, so that they&#x27;ll get the house? Obviously not! Repossession only avoids losing the full amount of the loan; the bank is still making a loss overall.<p>Laos ceding majority ownership of the power grid to the Chinese company that built it only means that the infrastructure investment isn&#x27;t as profitable as expected (otherwise they could just use the profits to service the loan) and they&#x27;re cutting their losses.')
