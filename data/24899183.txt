Smaller sensors means more noise, and that noise is smoothed out with computational photography. That&#x27;s why most manufacturers are going for more discrete sensors with different lenses, instead. Samsung does have a &quot;periscope&quot; design for the super tele in their latest phone that mounts the sensor vertically. Lenses are more important than sensor for sharpness, and there&#x27;s obviously not a ton of room in these phones to put big lenses. Camera bumps are already growing quite large.')
