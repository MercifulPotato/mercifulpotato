What makes me not an extremist but my peers extremists?<p>It is true that we probably have somewhat different values. I don&#x27;t personally value TJ having some high rating as decided by magazines and would happily sacrifice scores if I believed it was possible to better provide education to gifted students across Fairfax County. And I do believe that the test makes it <i>harder</i> for FCPS to do this well, though it certainly allows TJ to select for specific kinds of students that make it score well in magazine ratings.<p>I also believe that it is not good to separate students into many strata earlier in life and believe that the lottery limits the effect of wealth and other inequities on young kids. You may believe that we should reward students who studied their brains out in school, did test prep on weekends, and joined clubs so they could round out a resume. Those are different values and that&#x27;s okay.<p>It is also very likely that we have different opinions about the expected outcome of ending the test. I believe that it will make it <i>easier</i>, not harder for students to access high quality education and recognizing that there are <i>so many</i> students that could succeed at TJ will encourage FCPS to allocate more resources to magnet programs so there can be more slots for these students. I also hope that this will demonstrate the need for a humanities-focused alternative, which currently does not exist (the humanities education offered at TJ is atrocious, IMO). I also believe that moving away from strict testing as the primary mechanism for excellence will help TJ recover some of its creative side that is so valuable for young learners. The creativity available during 8th period has been slowly crushed under the weight of standardized learning processes over the last several decades. A lot of the skills I learned during 8th period are no longer made available to students in order to serve the almighty test score. I hope that admitting smart students who aren&#x27;t bound to testing will help this.<p>It is also very likely that we have different opinions about the ability of the test to separate students into strata.<p>I do not support destroying TJ. I believe that this <i>makes FCPS education better</i> and <i>encourages more TJs</i>.<p>We disagree. That&#x27;s fine. But you list my peers among extremists and you claim that I intend to sabotage quality education. Why is your position not extreme?')
