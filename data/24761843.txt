The patent there is on the dna sequence, not the plant. If you took that dma sequence, cloned it into yeast, amd started fermenting the enzymes the sequences produced, you&#x27;d also be 8 fringing that patent - jt has nothing to do with the pollen or the plant, the plant just happens to be what the patented item is in.')
