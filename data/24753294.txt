Sometimes, the technique of returning a promise (“here’s something that can be converted to what you asked for, even though you didn’t tell yet exactly what you want”) is very useful.<p>A simple example is multiply-add. For your own types, you can have the compiler translate<p><pre><code>   a = b * c + d;\n</code></pre>\ninto<p><pre><code>   a = multiply_add(b, c, d);\n</code></pre>\nthat means you can use familiar notation and yet use faster&#x2F;more accurate composite functions.<p>Stroustrup, in “the C++ Programming Language”, states he has seen a speed up of a factor of 30 using this ‘trick’ on matrix code.<p>He also advices against going over the top on it, though, so he agrees with “you can doesn’t imply you should”.')
