It&#x27;s about $200 and you have to stick under 65W. It&#x27;s basically a big heatsink. They have bigger ones as well that can handle GPUs, haven&#x27;t tested those.<p>Ever since SDDs became available for consumers I wanted a PC without any moving parts or fans. I&#x27;ve had it for over two years now and having a dead silent PC has been just as great as I had imagined.')
