There may have been a handful of exceptions in history, but they are so vastly outnumbered by the other kind that they can safely be ignored.<p>The narrative of doing something for the greater good should be treated as a lie until the burden of evidence is so high that you are forced to accept that it was indeed good. In particular, spy agencies have produced far more terrorism, coups, and disinformation for their own people, with the goal of supporting the monetary interests of their nation, all others be damned, than they have ever defended anything. The exceptions almost always happen when the goals of empire happen to be aligned with those of the people, like during WW2.')
