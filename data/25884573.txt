Many big US companies start a &quot;Professional Services&quot; divison where they help other big corps integrating their products.<p>These roles are, especially now, mostly remote. So it depends, this company wasn&#x27;t afraid of big numbers and hired me. I get paid 120k Euro per year and 40k in stocks each year.<p>I have a family and we don&#x27;t spend more than 3k each month all together. So 120k boils down to around 6.2k each month, plus my wife earns ok as well (teacher).<p>I know a few CTOs of smaller gompanies who make 120k without stocks.<p>So for me, that&#x27;s a decent pay.<p>So yeah, look for other roles than SE.')
