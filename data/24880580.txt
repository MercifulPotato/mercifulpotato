I switched over to using Macs in 2005 or so. I just Googled it and poked around and, yeah, at a high level it looks a lot like the old VB form builder.<p>The thing is, the form builder was just part of what made the VB experience so great. It was how everything tied together conceptually into a complete environment that, crucially, was <i>very</i> easy to understand and <i>very</i> approachable. The form builder was easy to grasp, language was very simple and straightforward, and the documentation was just astounding (to this day I have yet to find anyone who has as good documentation as Microsoft did in the 90s.) You could crank out a simple app in a matter of hours with it.<p>In the late 90s I got swept up in the dot-com boom and started doing web development. That&#x27;s been my primary bread and butter since, although these days I have moved into a more management-focused role so most of the development I do is on my own time to keep my skills sharp. I have occasionally written things in Java (using Netbeans, whose form builder was very similar to VB) and Objective-C (again, Interface Builder reminded me a lot of VB).<p>I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of Swift recently for macOS development because it&#x27;s such a fun language, but I haven&#x27;t jumped over to using SwiftUI. It&#x27;s just not ready for prime time yet, IMHO, especially for macOS apps. And I really just prefer building GUIs using a GUI builder like Storyboards or even old fashioned NIBs&#x2F;XIBs, since most of the macOS apps I write I am the sole developer on, the version control issues with GUI definition files aren&#x27;t a big issue for me.<p>Though I will say that I think SwiftUI has potential - especially with the live preview as you&#x27;re building. It just doesn&#x27;t work very well right now for complex macOS apps.')
