You can avoid writing out lookup tables long-form where the entries are very predictable. For instance you could write a base64 encoder and decoder without putting [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;... ] in your code base, and then have to worry if you accidentally put &quot;D&quot; in there twice. The typical alternative in other languages is to evaluate this at startup time, which adds latency to your program.<p>Compile-time function evaluation is also one of the features of the Jai programming language. If you can&#x27;t get people to use your language, getting them to steal all your features is a good consolation prize.')
