For example, we don&#x27;t say Apple&#x27;s economies of scale are a competitive advantage, because most of their competitors have the same economies of scale, no one seriously believes Apple&#x27;s scale gives it a significant advantage over Samsung.<p>So at best you&#x27;ve got a propriety solution that&#x27;s going to be swamped by the generic charging stations, a network effect on FSD that&#x27;s entirely speculative, and no real advantage of scale.')
