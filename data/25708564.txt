Don’t make this a silly word game.<p>Nobody needs to (risk seeing) see calls for hate, violence and racials slurs.<p>If you don’t want that shit on your platform, ban it. That’s not censorship.<p>Fine if you build your own gab&#x2F;4chan&#x2F;parler. But nobody is required to host you.<p>Nobody is required to give you a soap box.<p>Discussions about gender stuff is fine. I disagree strongly but that is not hate. However calling your own position common sense in a debate is also disingenuous and it makes me question your motives.')
