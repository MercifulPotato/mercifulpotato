If countries keep fragmenting their crypto regulations, then so will liquidity. The decentralized exchanges will be the only venues left that pool liquidity at a global scale.<p>You still need a centralized exchange to be an on-ramp to go from regular money to the blockchain. But that&#x27;s way less lucrative. You convert your dollars to USDT&#x2F;WBTC&#x2F;Ethereum at Coinbase, transfer to your wallet, then do 99% of trading&#x2F;gambling on Uniswap. That&#x27;s not a future where Coinbase is very valuable.')
