This isn&#x27;t anything you couldn&#x27;t do before â€” it&#x27;s just much easier to setup and has fewer points to get wrong (ever see a jump server whose owner forgot to change the port 22 0.0.0.0&#x2F;0 allow rule?). It&#x27;s especially nice because it works for everyone in every context without needing anything setup so you can safely use it for examples, training, someone working with a loaner machine, etc. even if you normally work with a custom configuration.')
