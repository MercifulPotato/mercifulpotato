We&#x27;re seeing a change in developers&#x27; opinions; my friends in video production were getting ready to ditch Apple due to their &quot;professional&quot; software and hardware products getting worse both in relative (hardware) and absolute (software) terms. Part of the Apple cachet is that these are professional tools; how long is their reputation going to hold up if those professionals leave the platform?<p>It&#x27;s a touch of hubris to think that we are and will continue to be taste makers, certainly. Maybe Apple won&#x27;t get burned by alienating this crowd. But it seems a risky strategy for dubious return.')
