In fact after months of talking to other people through zoom, just chatting with my friends with low latency, high quality, and without the auto processing&#x2F;muting that zoom seems to do, was amazing.  Conversation just flowed back and forth better!<p>There’s a bunch of similar bits of software but none of them are super welcoming for the less technically inclined. I guess that the experience is often going to be limited by network performance (specifically jitter and loss on UDP) so it’s a challenging thing to make super slick&#x2F;consistent. I think that low latency 5G with latency guarantees might help solve it when its widely available though.')
