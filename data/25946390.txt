Citadel or whoever will only internalize your order if they&#x27;re willing to offer you a <i>better</i> price than market price. Otherwise RH is obligated to match your order with the best price currently available.<p>They are willing to do this because they would prefer not to leave orders sitting on the books, and there&#x27;s a fee for taking orders off the books which they would prefer not to pay.')
