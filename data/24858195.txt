The main appeal of Firefox today is that it&#x27;s not owned by Google and doesn&#x27;t violate your privacy (as much, anyways). The browser itself is great, I use it all the time, and I vastly prefer the UI over Chrome.<p>However, I don&#x27;t think many would care if the world ends up on a single common browser as long as it doesn&#x27;t consolidate power to a single entity. Microsoft has their own fork of Chromium, and if the possibility of building a browser business makes a comeback (thanks to any changes in Google), I&#x27;m sure many other companies will follow suit.<p>Of course, this all depends on what actually happens to Google as a result of this lawsuit. So we&#x27;ll have to wait and see.')
