Stoplights. Nutrition labeling on packaging. etc.”<p>A good set of examples.  Every one of them is about consumer health and safety.  This is consistent with liberal democracy - people should be free to do what they want unless it hurts someone else.  That is why all product related regulations are related to safety.<p>It seems reasonable to assume you are arguing for rules which prevent the installation of unsafe software on computers which are sold to consumers.<p>Apple would be the most compliant company with such rules, and would benefit greatly.')
