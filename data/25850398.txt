The actor model on the other hand is more loosely coupled and flexible.<p>Note that this is why people recommend using GenServer&#x27;s &quot;call&quot; instead of &quot;cast&quot; in Elixir&#x2F;Erlang by default - it applies a sort of backpressure because call waits for the process to return a result rather than being fire and forget.<p>It&#x27;s not exactly the same thing, or as configurable as Go channels, but it is an option.')
