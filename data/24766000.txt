(This is a very high percentage of people I know from the bay area, hence the anecdote).<p>All had the same rationale: taxes and housing were simply far too high when they could work remotely and live anywhere else. Sure, you don&#x27;t get the same outdoors, food or retail scene, but plenty of places have those things too.<p>I imagine the move to working remotely has made that move possible for more people than before, but those I know aren&#x27;t making temporary moves, they are buying houses.')
