While I have a NAS with my media on it that Kodi worked fine on the need to open a browser and need for a keyboard and mouse became to much of a pain. I switched everything to  AppleTV which had the issue of not being able to mount the NAS. Lucky there is a Kodi &quot;port&quot; to the AppleTV in the App Store called Mr.MC for like $8 that is pretty much Kodi with built in support for NFS, SMB, etc. AppleTV is the perfect box for this to be honest.')
