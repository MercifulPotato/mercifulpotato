It was what I was dancing around in my statement about Fauci being in a difficult situation.<p>I may be being too critical, but I think certain professions of public trust need to be held to higher standards in this regard. Meaning, while I can commiserate with the idea that careers hang in the balance, they owe it to the public to be honest. It&#x27;s why certain roles are &quot;professions&quot; and not &quot;jobs&quot; (there is generally a professed oath to serve the public good). This is where I would hold them deficient in their communication and, unfortunately, a threat to a career isn&#x27;t sufficient to avoid one&#x27;s professed ethics. Misspeaking is one thing, misleading is another.')
