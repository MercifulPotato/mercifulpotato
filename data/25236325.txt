At the risk of exacerbating it: anything to bring up Floyd being black, while identical deaths involving people of other racial backgrounds, like in the case of Floyd, Tony Timpa, are never attributed to racism.<p>Also, way to implicitly accuse him of being a racist for not agreeing with you on the motives and culpability of the police.<p>Maybe it is the prevalence of this knee-jerk assumption you&#x27;re exhibiting now, where you attribute any wrong committed to a black individual to some endemic anti-black societal bias, and not Coinbase&#x27;s workplace environment, that is the reason why so many employees interviewed by Coinbase accused the company of anti-black racism, without \na single definitive piece of evidence.<p>&gt;&gt;Are you suggesting that cops are such snowflakes that they can&#x27;t do their jobs if a civilian criticizes them? I&#x27;m struggling to think of any other customer-facing job where that would be acceptable.<p>Strawman.')
