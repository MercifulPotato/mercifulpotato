I&#x27;ve been wanting to rage against illiteracy lately but I&#x27;m not too active in public discourse (even this).<p>That said, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s some secret key to improving humanity. I think this because literacy is ultimately a luxury, even in modernity. The literate may be able to form more nuanced opinions, but that matters less if they can&#x27;t increase literacy consistently across populations.<p>There&#x27;s an irony here that assumes deep literacy is productive and essential but doesn&#x27;t use it to explain the proposed lack of deep literacy itself.')
