I did not care to educate them. And this is in a first world country with a rather wealthy population.<p>Why am I saying this? Users don&#x27;t give a damn, they expect free things, and they expect things which work. They have been taught to use appstores on their phones where tapping on a button installs an app and everything just works with zero effort on their end, while completely ignoring the work that someone put into creating the very app they depend on. Majority will never, ever, even think about it, let alone click on the developers website to find out who created the miracle they use.<p>This practice needs to end. I believe that it is time to stop making free products. Developers should unite in this and finally start to value their hard work.')
