I love their description of the Pilot G2:<p>&quot;The Pilot G2 is a retractable gel pen. It’s famous for being one of the best office pens of all time as well as being of the top “gateway pens.” A gateway pen being one of the pens who don’t generally care about pens use, grow attached to, and start to realize that not all pens write the same. Many offices, restaurants, banks, and other venues had purchased Pilot G2s in bulk, people have used them them, and started to realize that they are smoother and write better than a normal bulk pen.\n&quot;<p>Exactly my experience - I first used the Pilot G-2 07 in 2005, and have spent the last 15 years refusing to use nothing else.  I have friends in Australia who, after borrowing my pen, used to raid the office supplies for them every time they visited the USA, and they were a great present to bring.')
