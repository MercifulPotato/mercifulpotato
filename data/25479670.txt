How do they control for that? Is it even realistic to control all the health reasons? \nAnd what about thousands of other things, such as<p>1) People who like to take high risks, might be less keen on communal activities, like volunteering.<p>2) People who have bad habits might also be less likely to volunteer.<p>3) Depressed, stressed out, cynical people may be less likely to volunteer.<p>4) Poor people are less likely to donate and also have lower life expectancy.<p>5) People who died earlier didn&#x27;t make it into that point in life where they would be able to donate. This one is easier to control though.<p>And probably countless of other things?\nI&#x27;d need to go deep into the actual study to understand how they controlled for all of that, but right now it makes me very skeptical.')
