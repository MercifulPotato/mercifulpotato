Their experience would be enhanced too since they can now fetch the content from a nearby peer than a far-away cdn<p>This is an interesting idea. If this gets widespread-enough adoption, and if non-metro folks can, on average, find a nearby peer for $whatever they&#x27;re looking for (and those are <i>very</i> big &quot;if&quot;s), I still imagine some problems might crop up:<p>Determining &quot;distance&quot; is quite tricky, and the trickiness goes <i>up</i> substantially the further onto rural&#x2F;less normal latency distribution networks&#x2F;ISPs you get--and that&#x27;s just in the first world. If latency is the main signal used to inform distance, you could end up inflicting a pretty punishing upload-bandwidth cost on users&#x2F;ISPs because of, for example, a fortuitous peering agreement upstream.<p>There may also be a significant penalty paid for &quot;medium distance&quot; non-hub-routed peers: situations in which the presence of many uploaders congest the last-mile&#x2F;backhaul infrastructure of small-scale providers that are least capable of managing the unexpected surge in consumption (least capable as in: most congestion-prone infrastructure <i>and</i> fewest technical solutions on hand to mitigate unexpected long-term congestion).<p>And in places where small-scale providers don&#x27;t control much of the market and mobile networks are the main bandwidth providers, expect a swift no-warning traffic block. There are ways to circumvent those, but they get expensive (in engineering time, user experience, and user bandwidth) fast.')
