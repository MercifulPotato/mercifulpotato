You also seem to be incorrectly conflating the Afghan Mujahideen, the Taliban, and the Northern Alliance.<p>I&#x27;m not going to write a dissertation on the topic on HN, but I&#x27;ll just say that it&#x27;s very clear that you don&#x27;t know as much about it as you think you do, and I implore you and anyone reading the thread to go and read on this 40-year conflict in some detail if they want to gain a meaningful understanding of it.')
