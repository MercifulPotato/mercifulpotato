It&#x27;s also often impossible to guess how many people will see what you post and much much harder to guess what kind of people will want to discuss it. How can you have a meaningful discussion with so little context?<p>In the past, communities like HN had a much more homogeneous user base and, like the article talks about, had a much narrower focus for discussion (i.e. more focused around CS). They also had fewer overall users.<p>I wonder if we need to redefine &quot;internet scale&quot; to include some organic constraints on healthy and well functioning human interactions. The social sciences might be somewhat woolly on that question but that&#x27;s not to say such constraints don&#x27;t exist (Dunbar&#x27;s number being the best example).<p>Boundless community growth clearly doesn&#x27;t work well. There have to be alternatives worth exploring.')
