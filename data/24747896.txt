And that&#x27;s important because it&#x27;s where reductionism subtly goes from being treated as a scientific method to a sort of belief system.<p>It&#x27;s not actually obvious at all that say, complex mind states or intentionality can be reduced to physics. It even seems extremely unlikely, because there&#x27;s no conceivable way to me how the &#x27;aboutness&#x27; of intentional mind states are supposed to be reduced to particles.<p>Another good example is maybe life itself. Schr√∂dinger in his book <i>What is Life?</i> categorised life as local &#x27;negative entropy&#x27;, ordering matter at a local level and exporting excess entropy to the outside, in a sense locally &#x27;breaking&#x27; the second law of thermodynamics. When our civilisation warms the planet up and produces heat what it really does is exporting disorder, I think it&#x27;s quite a good description actually.<p>Aside from the fact that we scientifically haven&#x27;t proven it, it&#x27;s hard to imagine how this sort of top-down causal behaviour and complexity is supposed to be reduced to mostly linear particle interactions.')
