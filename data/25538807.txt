And PV has other advantages. It&#x27;s easier to install since it doesn&#x27;t require specific tubing and the panels are much lighter. The energy is useful for other things when you don&#x27;t need as much hot water. And efficiency goes up in winter because PV is more efficient in the cold whereas efficiency of thermal solar goes down as you need to heat the panel before heating the water. It will depend on your local PV and heat pump costs but thermal solar seems less and less relevant these days.')
