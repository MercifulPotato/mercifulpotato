I think people will use tools like AdS&#x2F;CFT correspondence for a while. And it is worth remembering that in terms of actual dollars, fundamental physics research is not that big of a spend. Like, part of the reason why these articles are important, is that the pie is so small to start with. So I don&#x27;t worry too much about the string theory grant money, if anything I would not mind the absolute dollar amount going up if the relative fraction decreased with it.<p>The one thing that kind of irks me is this Kaku book “The God Equation.” I have only seen one equation that is so universally applicable that it could deserve that title, and even then I would be hesitant about that because it might give people the wrong impression. (It is the transport equation—it keeps appearing and appearing, a bunch of other equations are special cases of it, it is involved in one of the million-dollar Clay Mathematics prizes so there is clearly something hard&#x2F;intractable about it, and it has a term which refers to creation and destruction. It says, a box flows downstream, the time rate of change of stuff in the box is equal to the flow J of stuff through the walls of the box plus the rate Φ of stuff being created&#x2F;destroyed in the fluid. Or, ∂ρ&#x2F;∂t + (v · ∇) ρ = - ∇ · J + Φ.)')
