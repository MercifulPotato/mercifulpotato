That&#x27;s way too hard. This is a development tool that helps write and read SQL code. So simply saves development time by automating the easy stuff, leaving the hard and important stuff for us to deal with. It is different from other formatters that it lints code inside Python strings. For some context, I am a data engineer and I write a lot of SQL code inside Python code (in the future it should support other programming languages as well).<p>However, the tool might suggest improvements on SQL code in the future')
