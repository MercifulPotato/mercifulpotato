My friend who is in that business and owns a prize-winning dog and a cat told me a few examples. Cats may get their claws completely removed so they don&#x27;t scrath furniture. Smaller dogs may get their voice cords &quot;fixed&quot; so their constant barking doesn&#x27;t annoy owners.<p>For myself I decided not to own any pets unless they could live naturally as they were created. (I own two neutered cats now but they were neutered before I took ownership.) I totally understand the author&#x27;s sentiment, first the hesitation and then an absolute certainty that something is deeply wrong here even though you cannot yet rationalize it. The only thing I disagree with is that &quot;it&#x27;s easier to lie&quot;.')
