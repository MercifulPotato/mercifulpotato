So if I&#x27;m setting rigorous expectations for myself that don&#x27;t actually contribute to that purpose in any way, and in fact partly sabotage it by making me miserable, there&#x27;s no logical reason to hold those expectations in the first place.<p>What do you or anyone else gain from &quot;deserving&quot; to put titles for yourself in your Twitter bio? Do those activities if they make you happy; if they don&#x27;t, then don&#x27;t waste energy on them. And certainly don&#x27;t do them just to say that you did.')
