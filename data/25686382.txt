At least it would give you a monthly total of everything and a roll up of everything, but doesn&#x27;t handle carry over cleanly.  I was suggesting it as a way that works for lots of people but fair enough if it doesn&#x27;t&#x27; fit close enough.<p>&gt; Your second approach is closer, but it&#x27;s a fair amount of work (or perhaps I misunderstood it)<p>It would look like this:  Your salary comes in, and instead of matching that transaction to &quot;income&quot; you would split it against a bunch of &quot;envelope&quot; accounts, each however much you want per check.  If you use liability accounts (e.g. like an accounts payable account) for this they will count &quot;backwards&quot;.   This is exactly analogous to envelopes, except that nothing (other than you) stops you from going negative.  You can move funds between them whenever you want.<p>Then when you spent your $100 check you would split that transaction also, and apply the 60&#x2F;30&#x2F;10 each to its own account.  These carry over of course, so if you don&#x27;t spend it all this month you&#x27;ll have extra next month, etc.')
