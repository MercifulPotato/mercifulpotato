It may look like there is, because we keep seeing the same thing happening, but it&#x27;s not coordination - it&#x27;s the outcome of everyone caring primarily about their own personal interests over those of everyone else. We&#x27;ve built an economy and a culture that demands this kind of selfishness.<p>COVID-19 gives solid evidence that there is no playbook involved: in terms of political and business processes, the pandemic happened in a flash.
