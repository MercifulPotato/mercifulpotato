Who are you referring to?<p>All I see is the fact that the Apple employee <i>didn&#x27;t initiate</i> the bribe, the sheriff&#x27;s office <i>demanded</i> it (extorted it) and the employee was put in the unfortunate immediate situation of either not getting their lawfully permitted license, or paying the bribe.<p>At the end of the day it&#x27;s bribery so of course the employee deserves to be charged (and Apple if it approved it in any way), but the sheriff&#x27;s office officials deserve <i>much harsher</i> punishment quite clearly.')
