You&#x27;ve cherry-picked a single vague line from the preamble of that article because it&#x27;s so general that it also fits your narrow definition. The rest of the article goes on about the established definition.<p>The preamble is the most important section of an article. You don&#x27;t &quot;cherry pick&quot; the most important part of an article.<p>My definition is exactly what the terms &quot;institutional&quot; and &quot;racism&quot; would imply when put together.<p>&gt;&gt;You&#x27;re redefining an entire concept coined to mean what we are talking about.<p>It was not coined to mean whatever it is you&#x27;re talking about (which none of you have actually specified by the way, because you know how absurd it sounds when spelled out).<p>&gt;&gt;* The concept of personal property and it&#x27;s distinction from private property. Ignoring ~200 years of socialist history.<p>The concept of personal property is a socialist one. It&#x27;s not used outside of those quack circles.<p>&gt;&gt;You do realize that you don&#x27;t have to agree with the concept to at least discuss it? Something like &quot;Yes, if we use established definition, which I disagree with, there&#x27;s systemic&#x2F;institutional racism against black people in America&quot;.<p>Established by who? Just as socialists don&#x27;t get to establish what private property, or the terms &quot;wage&quot; and &quot;slavery&quot; when used together, mean for everyone else, racial injustice grievance activists don&#x27;t get to establish what the terms &quot;institutional&quot; and &quot;racism&quot; mean when they&#x27;re used together, for every one else.<p>Personal property is a form of private property.<p>Workers are not &quot;wage slaves&quot;.<p>There is no institutional racism in America, except in favor of members of allegedly disadvantaged groups, which receive explicitly favorable treatment by affirmative action.')
