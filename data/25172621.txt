There are many ways to be a 10x engineers but basically none of them is about writing better code or solving algorithm problem (outside of a few very specific domains). Writing good code is necessary to be a competent engineer and one need to be competent before becoming 10x, but itâ€™s not a sufficient condition.<p>Yet this is what almost all companies that are looking for 10x engineers primarily test for during interviews; their ability to write code. Seems to be a mismatch there.')
