That level of attention to detail extends to other areas. For example, I read all of the license agreements I&#x27;m told that I have to assent to. This makes it really hard for me to agree to all of the automatic software updates, which update the license agreement, so I disable updates until I have the time to read the new license.<p>(As an aside, OmniGroup has <i>the best proprietary license I&#x27;ve read</i>, and I&#x27;ve commended them for it. And I&#x27;ve complained to ORCId that they claim their signup takes only seconds, which means they don&#x27;t expect people to read their license.)<p>So one reason I prefer FOSS is that I don&#x27;t to read the <i>#%^#$^</i> licenses.<p>If I switch to the Android ecosystem, and sign up to Google&#x27;s app store, I expect have to read pages of legalese - which I don&#x27;t care to do.<p>I understand that most people are not this way. I hope you understand that some people are not like you.')
