Do you have a source? For example, Diane Rehm got in hot water for assuming Bernie Sanders had it based on something she saw on the internet:<p><i>&quot;As the site Jewish Journal noted, the list Rehm may be referring to seems to be one that has circulated on the Internet for several years concerning U.S. government officials and members of Congress who allegedly hold dual citizenship with Israel.<p>&quot;That&#x27;s some of the nonsense that goes on in the Internet.

Important lesson, never even think the word AIPAC while you&#x27;re tweeting if you&#x27;re an American politician. Nothing good can come of it.<p>Although, there are voices from the inside condemning this, as in this opinion piece in Haaretz by a former AIPAC lobbyist:<p><i>&#x27;Deploying very stark language, naming the Democratic Party, picturing three Democratic congresswomen (two of whom are freshmen) and throwing around accusations of anti-Semitism and of being &quot;more sinister&quot; than international terrorist groups is jarring at best. And although AIPAC subsequently pulled the Facebook ad and issued an apology via Twitter, labeling their own ad &quot;imprecise, poorly worded, inflammatory…that distorted our message&quot; a spokesperson still explained the ad was &quot;popular with our target audience.&quot;&#x27;</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.haaretz.com&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;.premium-aipac-s-fall-i-worked-at-the-pro-israel-lobby-now-i-have-to-call-it-out-1.8535460" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.haaretz.com&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;.premium-aipac-s-fall-i-work...</a><p>It&#x27;s a weird, weird relationship between two countries linking geopolitics, religion, history, blah, blah, blah.')
