Within some Ayahuasca shamanic circles it&#x27;s shared that entheogens open you up to energy, allowing it to flow more easily - positive and negative energy - and so it must be reducing the frictions that are possible between the mind-body interface, perhaps more specifically between consciousness, executive function and&#x2F;or &quot;free will&quot; for the range of what&#x27;s possible on our path, an interplay or friction&#x2F;play balancing out with the universal energy that wants to&#x2F;does surround us&#x2F;is us&#x2F;is in us&#x2F;part of every vibration of the foundation we exist on; there are hierarchical ancient stories, narratives, patterns that gain their position in the hierarchy, strength of those patterns, based on the importance of those stories&#x2F;patterns being perpetuated first through successful biological&#x2F;reactionary mechanisms - reinforced through the quantity of replication of such species who have survived with whatever patterns their genetics lead their behaviours and intelligence toward. Too vague and disconnected from my other thoughts, out of place with the rest of conversation in this thread, but the mentioning of ketamine triggered it - so I&#x27;ll post it for ridicule or scrutiny.')
