My wife&#x27;s notes are either locked in a &quot;safe&quot; at her office (heavy time-locked door to a room, with locking file cabinets) in the city, or in a small locking fire-proof file safe at home.<p>Really the only things that get computerized are the things required by insurance (diagnosis and treatment plans).<p>But notes are highly personal to the therapist, and can include any number of on-topic or off-topic , and it is rare even under subpoena to release your personal notes. Her office has a lawyer on retainer who&#x27;s only job is to quash subpoenas. She&#x27;s never had one served to her, and I dont know if any of the other clinicians have.<p>But back on topic - though, I&#x27;m 90% sure the clinicians at the psychotherapy clinic in GP&#x27;s comment probably had the same thing. They would take paper notes, and only digitized what they needed to digitize, and most of those digitized records are non-transferable anyway, because they would be diagnosis and treatments for that patient&#x2F;client provided by that clinic, and if a clinician left, and was allowed to take clients&#x2F;patients to their new practice (sometimes allowed, but often times not), the clinician would take their personal notes with them.')
