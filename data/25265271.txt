People think, for example, &quot;I&#x27;m running antivirus software; I&#x27;m safe,&quot; which they&#x27;ll use to justify all sorts of risky behavior that could (and sometimes does) lead to a security breach.  They don&#x27;t understand that antivirus software only reduces the risk of a security breach, never eliminating it, and it only works on certain kinds of attack vectors.<p>The same goes for vitamin D.  Sure, lots of people are deficient, and the current evidence-based medical consensus is that people who are deficient should supplement.  And maybe there&#x27;s a weak correlation with COVID-19 infection&#x2F;mortality risk, but people who aren&#x27;t experts might misinterpret that and think they should hang out with their buddies in the sunshine or something equally risky while we&#x27;re in the middle of a pandemic, instead of following the other bits of the current evidence-based medical consensus, which tells us to stay away from one another and to wear masks over our mouths and noses, which we know will greatly reduce virus transmission rates.')
