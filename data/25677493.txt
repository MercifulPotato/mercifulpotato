But that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s observable. There seem to be other factors at play that don&#x27;t always center around money.<p>&gt; no new company that starts with the environment you are describing is going to be successful.<p>That would mean no upstart could ever compete in the same space any established player. But again, that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s observable.<p>It appears to be much more multi-faceted than just &quot;he who has the most money always wins.&quot;')
