It is extremely rare for a constitutional monarch to so publicly undermine the democratically elected government.  The Danish Queen and Norwegian King made speeches this Spring, where they were very careful to not undermine the government&#x27;s strategy, but rather emphasis the significance of the pandemic.<p>Additionally, in Sweden, it is has become pretty recognisable by all that the Swedish approach has failed, but no one is willing to take the blame.  The King effectively cuts through all this, and says the blame lies squarely with Prime Minister Stefan Löfven.<p>In political terms, I wonder how long Löfven&#x27;s government will last.')
