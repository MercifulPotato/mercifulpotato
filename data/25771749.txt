Item(by='hackeredje', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610596527, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25771617, text='What it also means is that when the thing grows at a certain moment you see a parallel in the taxonomy you put in your local organisation with external &quot; all knowledge ever&quot; for instance on wikipedia portal &gt; categories etc or any of the &quot; all knowledge&quot; systems like dewey or libray systems.<p>And in many cases you write the thing that has a linkage to already being in a place in other generic taxonomies e.g. when i my son has an exam on e.g. French Grammer we put some stuff in there to undertand these lessons, but this &quot; structure &quot; is also already on wikipedia. But the structure on wikipedia is just too much too handle. So I think that the end-situation for larger parts of the personal household knowledge management system overlaps with the structure found in &quot; all knowledge ever&quot; systems. So im in the phase that I try to look at the taxonomy of these systems e.g. wikipedia and also e.g .structure &quot;mathemetics in the taxonomy that is on the wikipedia portal page for mathematics&quot; (but slower since i only need what is in there what my kid has currently on school). The younger kid can then leverage on this and read up on this. Since we already made it for the older kid.<p>But I feel that exchanges between &quot;external taxonomies&quot; and &quot; household taxonomies&quot; have not yet been establised. E.g. I also have all my &quot; stuff&quot;  in there like &quot; household applicances&quot;  (warranties, but also comparison sheets, instructions  etc) but the overal taxonomy and the &quot; wording&quot; is matchable with e.g. shops who sell household appliances. If there would be a taxonomy standardization on all of these things it would enable exchange information on meta level.')
