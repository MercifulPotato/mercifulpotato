To what extent does lazy&#x2F;imprecise&#x2F;presumptive&#x2F;forgiving communication and thinking permeate the systems that implement our incredibly technically advanced advanced societies, where it is simultaneously common to find people who smell like pee sleeping on the sidewalk, and hardly anyone bats an eye, or finds the situation even remotely curious?<p>This comment isn&#x27;t directed at you, it&#x27;s just more of an esoteric observation.')
