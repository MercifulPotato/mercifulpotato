Their names are just usually dropped when talking about it, which is a shame. I recently read Krakauer&#x27;s Into Thin Air and appreciated that he treated the sherpas on the expedition as fellow humans. They figured as important as anyone else in the story. He was also careful when talking about past climbs to mention all the climbers, sherpa and otherwise.<p>Very interesting book for me. I knew (know?) very little about mountaineering.')
