You should see how they drive.</i><p>...<p>&gt; <i>They wear masks without flaking out about it as slavery or being against their will or whatever nonsense you guys are on about back home in the west.</i><p>The 2nd part is what the GP was talking about with regards to &#x27;obedience&#x27;. In some western countries like the US and UK, even the simple request for individuals to wear a mask is seen by some as an infringement on their human rights. There are literally documents floating around social media in the UK citing the Magna Carta[1] as a legal document for why they are entitled not to have their temperature checked!<p>Granted these people are idiots. But unfortunately the UK and US has also fostered a culture where everyone&#x27;s voice is deemed equal, even the idiots. A classic example of this was during the EU referendum with the oft quoted phrase &quot;why should we trust those so call experts?&quot; as a retort against financial analysts voicing their concerns.<p>The problem is when you have research demoted to the same level as hearsay, a general distrust of the government and mix in a large does of fear due to economical, political and&#x2F;or social unrest, you end up in an environment where those aforementioned idiots end up recruiting more idiots into their cause.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Magna_Carta" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Magna_Carta</a>')
