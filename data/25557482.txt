Any airline can use those gates, but all US flights must originate from there.<p>You just go through immigration&#x2F;customs in Canada (it looks very similar to those in the US).  Then once you land they treat it like a domestic flight - so it allows airlines to fly to more airports (not all US airports have customs) and relieve some congestion at customs itself.')
