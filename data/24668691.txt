Surely a first-tier professor of physics is sufficient expertise for this, no?  And yet, not so much.  For example, it&#x27;s possible to see an atomic nucleus with your naked eye.  But only because their are a couple of oddballs, that can be made to fluoresce visibly.  The very good rule of thumb is &quot;high energy, can&#x27;t see&quot;.  And that&#x27;s the confident answer you&#x27;ll get from many a first-tier chemist and physicist.  To reliably learn of the exception, you need someone whose focus is nucleus dynamics.  A tiny community.  But unless you engage them, you won&#x27;t know you can include a &quot;this is real! see the glowing dot!&quot; photo.  I don&#x27;t know of any non-visitors at MIT with that focus.  So my not-quite joke is that MIT has insufficient domain expertise to write a truly excellent kindergarten intro to atoms.  One would need to draw on expertise more broadly for that.  (A more common failure mode is being able to field cross-domain questions like &quot;does this story convey the right insights? what might a better one look like?&quot;)<p>So what might it take to pull together a massive breath of expertise to create content?  The scale is daunting.  A cell bio tome textbook publisher commented on their hundred+ authors, and I not-quite joked &quot;great, and how many for the second page?&quot;.<p>Incentives for researchers are a challenge.  But a VR intro cell biology project, pulling in researchers with direct expertise for interviews, reported a recurring problem... of getting them to stop and leave.  So intrinsic motivations are significant.<p>Even recognition there&#x27;s a need, let alone one worth funding, isn&#x27;t well established.<p>And the collaborative tech infrastructure to make this possible... that&#x27;s not a small endeavor.')
