Some people can&#x27;t see the forest for the trees no matter what kind of programming language they&#x27;re using.<p>What&#x27;s needed here is to sit down and think REALLY hard about how the system works and what some of the terms are that are used to describe things. And also to have an intution for when someone is using imprecise language. GP cited use of a &quot;Schedule&quot; object as a way to enforce the invariant. That might represent a block of intervals by a sequence of times.<p>The less precise you are about what&#x27;s needed and how the system should work, the more of a soupy mess you&#x27;re going to build.<p>People gravitate toward OO because OO makes it feel like you&#x27;ve got a lot of conceptual clarity. You can get back to that familiar &quot;subject&#x2F;object&quot; dual we love in English. But the problem is actually that, although people can pick subjects and objects readily from a sentence, they might not have much luck picking the important subjects and objects from a sentence. And that&#x27;s the problem we really need to solve.')
