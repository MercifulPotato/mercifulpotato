My understanding is that even though shorts can in theory have “infinite downside”, in practice the short-sellers have to bail if they can’t post enough collateral to buy back the stock. And the 140% isn’t some “impossible fraction” thing, it just means that if there were 10 million shares before, well then now there are technically 24 million, and the short-sellers will need to buy back the “extra” 14 million in order to exit all their positions (not 100% sure if I got that right).<p>I get that the Redditors are doing something funky and unusual here, but whenever I see people talking about this being some sort of “buffer overflow! Game over, Man!” scenario, I get pretty skeptical. If markets survived April’s negative oil prices and the weirdness that entailed, I’m pretty sure they can survive a brief increase in the price of a small mall retailer’s stock.')
