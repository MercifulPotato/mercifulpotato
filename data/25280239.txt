Two simultaneous conflicting writes with eventual consistency will appear successful.  Strong consistency guarantees that one of the writes will fail.<p>EDIT: I think the reason people care about the lag is specifically for this case; if you want to know if your eventually consistent write <i>actually</i> succeeded then you need to know how long to wait to check.')
