I know, I know, Apple, but like Google Music, they allow me to upload any music I have MP3s of. That includes all the tracks I bought from bands I love (usually through bandcamp, or ripped CDs) who aren&#x27;t on streaming services yet.<p>Just import them into the music app on my laptop, sync my library, and boom those tracks are available everywhere, just like google music. I actually like it better, since it&#x27;s an actual app and I don&#x27;t need to upload the tracks through chrome â€“ I don&#x27;t use chrome, I use firefox, and I used to have to use chrome just to upload my music.')
