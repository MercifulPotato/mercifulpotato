And in prod, why use a vm inside a vm?<p>On the contrary, it&#x27;s easier to debug with Docker - it eliminates dangling system level libraries &#x2F; old dependencies &#x2F; cache, and everything is self-contained. If you have the problem in dev, you&#x27;ll have it in prod as well.<p>Docker is not a VM, it&#x27;s basically a big wrapper around chroot and cgroups, the performance hit is minimal. The advantage is that, again, it&#x27;s self-contained, so there&#x27;s little risk some OS &#x2F; dangling library muddies the waters ( especially in Python that&#x27;s a great risk  -OS level python library installations are a thing, and many a Python library depend on C libraries on the system level, which you can&#x27;t manage through Python tooling). It&#x27;s also idempotent ( thus making rollbacks easier) and declarative.')
