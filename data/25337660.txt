My high-efficiency furnace had issues in 2019 when we had -30f weather for a few days. Basically it&#x27;s a multistage condensing furnace, and on those really cold nights it would fail to kick into the later stages. After failing so many times, it would enter a &quot;reset&quot; mode, where it basically would shut down for 10+ minutes at a time, which isn&#x27;t great when it&#x27;s really cold!<p>In trying to fix it, I had multiple techs come out and none really fixed the issue. These are basically some notes on the experience:\n- First tech stayed for 6 hours. Cleaned the system, replaced a high pressure switched, and readjusted the PVC in and out takes. The pressure switch alone costed over $500 dollars. He did the PVC for free. The problem persisted after he left.\n- First tech sent a second guy out the next day. This guy comes in and within 10 minutes recommended replacing my Nest with their &quot;preferred&quot; smart thermostat for a cost of $500. He also wanted to redo my humidifiers water setup ($200), and redo the elbow joint in the condensation output of the furnace ($200). After he quoted me all of that I asked him to leave. I redid the condensation output myself ($15 in parts), and humidifier ($15 in parts). I looked up the high pressure switched they replaced, and was shocked to learn it only costs $150.  \n- I wrote my first Yelp review ever because of this company. They contacted me a day after I posted my review asking me to take it down in exchange for a partial ($300) refund. I agreed.\n- I had two family friends who do HVAC come out afterwards to look at it. After seeing that it was a high efficiency unit they basically wouldn&#x27;t touch it. They are older and basically said they never retrained for high-efficiency units. It was never needed because they have more work then they can handle with older units. All they were able to offer was to give me a good deal on replacing it with a less efficient unit if I wanted.<p>At the end of the day my issue was never fixed. Luckily we haven&#x27;t had as cold of weather as that week, so the issue hasn&#x27;t manifested again. If it happens again I honestly will cross my fingers and hope the next company that I use is more helpful then the previous.')
