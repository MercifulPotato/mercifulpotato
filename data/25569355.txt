Item(by='bluedino', descendants=None, kids=[25569699], score=None, time=1609246981, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25566642, text='I realize I wasn&#x27;t the target market for these iMacs, but I had one, and I -hated it-.<p>I worked at a retail store and at the time, we got 25 iMacs in. Almost every single one of them came back. People just didn&#x27;t know what to do with them.<p>I got one on discount, $699 I believe. Twice as much as the Celeron 300 eMachines that we had at the time.<p>It wasn&#x27;t very fast. It didn&#x27;t have any expandability. The screen was <i>terrible</i>. 14&#x2F;15&quot; and it had a horrible dot pitch. You could run 800x600 but it would give you a headache.<p>I returned it, and got the next hardware revision. It wasn&#x27;t much better. It did, however, have a 6MB ATI video card in it so I could play some Quake.<p>The screen was so limiting when it came to real work. The keyboard was passable but the mouse was awful.<p>Later on, I stuck a pair of 128GB chips in it, and the biggest IDE HD I could find at the time (Maxtor 80GB?). It helped a little bit. But once I installed OS X, it was crippled. My friends PowerBook G3 Pismo was quite a bit faster but still too slow. It was a weird generation of Apple product where you got left behind almost as soon as it came out.<p>About 10 years later, in 2009, I got another iMac (the newest model at the time), and completely fell in love with it.')
