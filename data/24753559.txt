If you show up to court, you get the money back. If you don&#x27;t have that money on hand, its common to take out a loan.<p>If you&#x27;re rich, yes. In practice, poor people can&#x27;t round up enough money, so they must rely on a bondsman. So they&#x27;ll pay something like 10% of the bail, and the bondsman will post the rest of the loan. The bondsman keeps the 10% at the end though.<p>Often people can&#x27;t even round up the 10% and have to just stay in jail.')
