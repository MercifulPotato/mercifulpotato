When I see the Gmail logo in the Android header bar, it doesn&#x27;t evoke <i>mail</i> like the little envelope did. It just looks like a wide, foppish, transparent &quot;M&quot;. It&#x27;s like a single entendre. Where previously it represented &quot;mail&quot; (semantically) and &quot;envelope&quot; (visually), now it simply looks like a nondescript bat-signal.')
