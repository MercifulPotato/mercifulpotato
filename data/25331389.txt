I&#x27;m a front-end developer but I&#x27;m interested in diving into a back-end language and Elixir&#x2F;Phoenix caught my attention due to LiveView.<p>Currently I&#x27;m using an udemy course (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.udemy.com&#x2F;course&#x2F;the-complete-elixir-and-phoenix-bootcamp-and-tutorial&#x2F;) and although it has been great, I fear that I might be missing something important along the way.<p>I&#x27;ve also looked into Elixir School for documentation and Exercism for, well, exercises, but I was wondering if you guys suggest any other material.<p>Thank you in advance!')
