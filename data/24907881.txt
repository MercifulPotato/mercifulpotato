The first site is Let&#x27;s Webauth - which is also open source on Github [1], and then I&#x27;ve also built a related SaaS system called Presence [2]. Let&#x27;s Webauth has pseudo-code examples you can try out (they are quite involved and will need a decent amount of work though), and Presence is available for you to sign up and try out for free (no payment card required).<p>There is still a lot that I want to improve and add to both of them, but I want to share to get early feedback!<p>I&#x27;m based in London and I&#x27;ve entirely built and bootstrapped this myself, after leaving my last job as a developer &amp; project manager in April, I was meant to be starting a night job on the London underground working Friday and Saturday nights so that I could build my own tech Monday - Friday, but that fell through due to the pandemic.<p>I&#x27;ve built on a Symfony (PHP) and Vue JS stack, using AWS ECS for container deployments. I would really appreciate any feedback, and let me know if you sign up to Presence and I&#x27;ll extend your free trial! I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ve quite got the right market-fit yet, so I&#x27;m going to try to continue adapting and building on this especially based on any feedback and suggestions.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mioko-tech&#x2F;letswebauth.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mioko-tech&#x2F;letswebauth.com</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;presence.mioko.tech" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;presence.mioko.tech</a>')
