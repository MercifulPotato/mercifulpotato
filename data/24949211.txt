These things happened in Babylon and in Persia thereafter. It happened in Rome and Greece. It happened in 7th century Arabia and continues to today. It happened in the 15th Spain until the 19th century. It happened in Europe in the early 20th century. It happened in Russia from the early to late 20th century. It happened in the USA in the mid 20th century. It has happened in China since the early 20th century. It is happening now in all sorts of countries throughout the world today.
