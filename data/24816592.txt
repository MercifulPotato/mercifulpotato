Anything else is superfluous.<p>Or you can vote for Biden and get a vague promise that by 2050 we will be emitting as much CO2 as we were in 2000. And the less said about Trump the better.<p>The difference in policy options in the US is like the difference between jumping out of a plane and jumping out of a plane tied to an anvil.')
