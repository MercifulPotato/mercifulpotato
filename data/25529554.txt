But even here, one has to be careful about what definition of &quot;even&quot; you&#x27;re employing.  = 0 (mod 2)?  Has two as a factor? One less than an odd number? !(x % 2)?  I remember my confusion when I found out that the answer to &quot;is 0 a natural number&quot; was &quot;it depends&quot; and I still run into people who insist 1 is prime, which I think is insane.  A lot of these things depend on the norms of the mathematical community discussing them.')
