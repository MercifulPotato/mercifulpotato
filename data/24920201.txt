By all means a significant amount, but nowhere near the required 560MW needed to stabilize the grid.<p>This is where hydro-based power plants excel, they&#x27;re able to adjust the power output as quickly as gravity can push the water down the pipes. They&#x27;re able to ramp up from almost no output to full capacity in minutes. Gas-turbines are also able to do this.')
