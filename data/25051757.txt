I remember being in high school in a group project with some theater kids. They needed a ton of free stock footage from Vimeo and they were going through links one-by-one to download each video individually. I just compiled a list of the links, ran youtube-dl, and had it done in 5 minutes when they&#x27;d already wasted three hours on it.')
