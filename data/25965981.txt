Or are you just arguing in bad faith? I’m gonna assume the former and explain the difference.<p>The interest you are paying when you take out a loan is a) compensating the creditor for money lost because of inflation, and b) paying for a service. The bank&#x2F;credit union at the same time will at the same time a) compensate for inflation and b) reward savings accounts for injecting money into the bank&#x2F;credit union.<p>This is fundamentally different from shareholders buying stocks from a business siphoning parts of the profits from the workers to the shareholder.<p>People taking loans <i>need</i> the people that open the saving account, and get something of value (money they need). Workers <i>don’t need</i> the shareholders, and they get nothing in return (except lower salaries).<p>I’m sorry if I sound like I’m talking down to you. It is just that the different is so obvious I don’t know how to explain it differently.')
