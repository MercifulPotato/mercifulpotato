I am finding new topics that take my interest and dig deeper and deeper. Topics I hated in school like geography, biology etc. are fascinating now, can&#x27;t read enough. But there are also some weird ones - looking into how guns work, details of systems like ar-15 (I know some people judge me as next crazy shooter, for me its just curiosity). Learning how to repair various things at home (variable light switch disassembly is the latest one). Little things. Previously, couldn&#x27;t care less.<p>Picked up psychology, trying to understand why many folks behave so weirdly and differently. Again, addicted to no end (Jordan Peterson&#x27;s videos are a treasure trove for me now).<p>But still struggling with learning french, so not everything is so shiny.<p>Or maybe its a common story for my age group, don&#x27;t know. But I know plenty of folks who are so deep in their comfort zone they don&#x27;t care about new stuff anymore.<p>Maybe its normal')
