I have a lot of connected switches but they are still functional as dumb switches.  If you moved into my house they&#x27;d all work like normal, you might notice they didn&#x27;t feel exactly the same as an old-fashioned switch but when you push up they go on, down they go off.  I&#x27;d of course let the buyer know they had options to connect them, but they could just forget about that and go on with their life.')
