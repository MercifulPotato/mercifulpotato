This idea that early humans &quot;took only what they needed from nature&quot; is quaint.  They took what they could use, which means basically whenever usefulness outweighed the risk of the hunt.  I remember an early history class about a buffalo jump.  Teacher told us that &quot;all parts of the animal were used.&quot;  Well, not that giant pile of bones.  If the dogs were hungry, or one needed some fresh bones to carve a tool, some large herbavore was killed.  Im sure that lots of useful meat was left to the elements, just as with hunters today.')
