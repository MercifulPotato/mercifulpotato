And a Coldfire based system (Firebee) following in Atari lineage, for which the FPGA and supporting software are all open source. Most hardware add-ons have fairly open specifications and drivers etc. are usually open source. Nobody is under the illusion that they&#x27;re going to be making a living or a profit out of this community, they&#x27;re doing it for passion.<p>But looking over at the Amiga, I see new and interesting projects all the time but they seem to be always closed.')
