Not to say that the regret here isn&#x27;t valid, but just to be careful how much stock to put into missing the &#x27;good ole days&#x27;.<p>&quot;The people who questioned my decision to become an extronomer were right.

You are not wrong because you took a leap in life and it didn&#x27;t work out perfectly, its a valuable learning experience.
