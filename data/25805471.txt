I care a lot about longevity. I want to make things that keep getting better over time. It&#x27;s also why I try to write on the web instead of on Twitter. Not only can I not improve my tweets, I feel like my tweets will get read over merely a few days, but my web page will be read over ten thousand days.<p>How I wish it was easy to collaborate on and improve all sorts of media.')
