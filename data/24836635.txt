It&#x27;s not quite &quot;full&quot;, it doesn&#x27;t have quite all images and video, etc. But the size is still reasonable for a desktop&#x2F;laptop PC.<p>I also have a 10GB snapshot on my phone, but it&#x27;s a bit lacking. I don&#x27;t have enough storage on my phone to fit the bigger one. But a battery powered offline Wikipedia is high on my list of necessary things in case things go south.<p>I haven&#x27;t found a great way to keep these synced up, glad to hear if someone has a good solution for up-to-date offline wikipedia.')
