Eradicating smallpox has apparently saved 5 million lives a year!<p>The question you&#x27;d have to ask is whether some low level amount of coronaviruses is important to human survival.  It seems like it&#x27;s not.  We have certainly seen the opposite effect -- people get pretty sick when you kill off all their gut bacteria (it lets unhelpful bacteria reproduce, and the bacteria actually perform digestive functions).  Unfortunately, we didn&#x27;t really realize that until we developed the technology to kill bacteria indiscriminately, so I see the worry.  But I doubt anyone will be harmed by having too few coronavirus infections, so I&#x27;m probably not worried this time.')
