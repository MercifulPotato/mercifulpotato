Item(by='dwheeler', descendants=None, kids=[25691374], score=None, time=1610139695, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25687421, text='It&#x27;s weird to talk about &quot;switching&quot; to atomic time. If you want seconds to always go 58,59,0, and you want time to always increment 1 second at a time, then UTC has <i>never</i> been appropriate. People who need to measure time this way should already be using TAI or GPS Time (which do this). Many people <i>already</i> do this, there&#x27;s no &quot;switching&quot; needed.<p>However, most civilian applications want a time that is synchronized, to bounded degree, to the Earth&#x27;s rotation. UTC has leap seconds, which are occasionally added or removed, to make that happen.<p>There&#x27;s been a push for removing leap seconds from UTC, because that&#x27;d be convenient for computers. But no one&#x27;s figured out how to change the Earth&#x27;s speed to match this new definition of UTC :-). So if we want time-of-day to be related to the position of the sun in the sky, adjustments like leap seconds are necessary.')
