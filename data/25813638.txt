Item(by='gorbypark', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610909567, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25810539, text='I have a 65W Baseus 2x USB-C with 1x USB3 port charger that&#x27;s pretty good. The only problem with it is that when a device is plugged in and it &quot;splits&quot; the wattage between the ports, it temporarily cuts off the power (I&#x27;m talking like 100-200ms or so) to the devices.  I had some issues trying to power a Thunderbolt 3 dock with it.  Anything with a battery is no issue, though (phone, laptop, etc). I also assume any multi port charger is going to have similar issues, all the ones I&#x27;ve seen do the &quot;wattage splitting&quot; thing when there&#x27;s more than one device plugged in.')
