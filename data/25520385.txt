I&#x27;ve used their service for load testing, you upload a payload file with instruction, its own macro language. I like their product but not their pricing structure: paying monthly but then limited to 15 tests&#x2F;month. If I need 20 the next step is too high.<p>Something my uptime monitoring service doesn&#x27;t have: they inspect SSL certificates for expiry, but don&#x27;t inspect the full trust chain. The certificate of the SSL provider (who signed our key) got replaced. With more abstraction (resellers) we got no notification. Until it expired, making our SSL certificate invalid, too. That caused avoidable downtime.')
