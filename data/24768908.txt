Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602615483, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24767223, text='&gt; Republicans control the senate despite only having 40% of the popular vote nationally in the Senate races.<p>That&#x27;s because the Senate is there to represent the states themselves in the federal government as individual political entities.<p>IMHO, if you want pure majority rule everywhere, you might as well just abolish the Senate entirely, as it would be redundant with the House.<p>Personally, I think some kind of geography-proportionate representation is necessary to prevent the non-urban areas from becoming neglected hinterlands.  That said, I do dislike the way the Republicans have used this system to extract maximum partisan advantage, so some reform is necessary.  Rather than making the Senate representation proportional by population, I think it should lose its monopoly on executive&#x2F;judicial confirmations and the House should have equal say in those.')
