(The county judge, I believe, is the one who was appointed by DeSantis and immediately (suspiciously) approved the warrant against Jones that resulted in police guns being pointed at her and her children.)<p>2) The State prosecutor tried to levy all sorts of crap like no internet.  That&#x27;s probably typical.  Note that this person had amazingly stable video &#x2F; audio somehow.<p>3) Jones lawyer made some mild arguments about needing to get a job and use a phone etc.  Said nothing about the DeSantis judge.  The judge in this video immediately disregarded a lot of the prosecutor&#x27;s asks and deflected a ton to the DeSantis judge.<p>4) The audio is extremely extremely bad, especially for one of Jones lawyers.  The audio just goes garbled half way through his argument.  Whoever this is (Zoom?  MS? Cisco?)  is really liable for screwing up tons of court cases.<p>In all, this video shows exactly how political the justice system is.  This judge and the DeSantis judge are pretty night-and-day in their actions against Jones.')
