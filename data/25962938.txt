AZ has issues, Moderna has issues, Pfizer has issues. Instead of playing a blame game, I would have argely preferred to see a coordinated effort of getting the ordered doses earlier, and have deliveries coordinated with vaccination campaines. We have neither, and at least in germany I doubt we have anything like a planned vaccination campaig. None of which can be blamed on the suppliers or the EU.<p>And none of the urrent discussion are helpfull in solving any of these issues.')
