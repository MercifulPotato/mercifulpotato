I&#x27;ve resisted joining academia myself, but that shouldn&#x27;t prevent finding partners there. Recently I started working with 3 transportation&#x2F;civil engineering professors, and their expertise is already helping to fill some gaps with the project. I&#x27;ll try more aggressively looking for more academics to loop in. UW in Seattle almost certainly has this sort of meet-and-greet; I&#x27;ll poke around and see if they have anything happening online these days.<p>Thanks again!\n-Dustin')
