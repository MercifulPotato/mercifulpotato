QNX, VxWorks, IOS (the Cisco one), the multitude of Unixes and BSDs, boutique&#x2F;experimental ones like SkyOS or ReactOS.<p>Would anyone buy Playstation OS apart from a console? I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a market for that (how is SteamOS going?). There might not be consumer demand, but a B2B offering could result in a sustained business.<p>Companies used to provide an OS to sell hardware. Linux mostly consolidated that market, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t room for more (macOS, remarkably, is still rocking 35 years later).')
