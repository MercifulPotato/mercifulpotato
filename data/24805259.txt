Now they know about the choice they made; of course they value it over an unknown (the choice(s) not made).<p>The human animal is characterized by this: learning from a single example. For better and worse. Its the reason we created civilization; its the reason we believe in witchcraft and the lottery.<p>E.g. walk into a chimp&#x27;s domain with a screwdriver, fool with the screw on an outlet cover, set the screwdriver on the floor and leave. The chimp may wander over, may pick up the screwdriver, might chew on it.<p>A 3-year-old human will go straight to the screwdriver and jam it into the socket.<p>I&#x27;m not sure anything new was shown by this experiment.')
