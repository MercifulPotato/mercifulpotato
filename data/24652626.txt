The error was: the URL was blocked by a content blocker&quot;. Deceptive link, doesn&#x27;t go to the regular ios app store for sure.<p>If you want to &quot;unf*ck the internet&quot;, perhaps start doing exactly that with your own links. I cannot understand why &quot;adjust dot com&quot; needs to insert itself between this page and the app store. If it&#x27;s for installation tracking, why not host whatever tracking service on your own domain? AFAIK &quot;adjust dot com&quot; couldn&#x27;t possibly offer any magic installation tracking that the first party domain couldn&#x27;t offer.')
