They are a mixture of situational comedy, singing, and basically anything entertaining you can do on a scene. Crucially, they are <i>by the university</i>, <i>for the university</i>, and <i>about the university</i>. They are some of the funniest things I&#x27;ve ever seen. And they achieve this by having an incredible amount of injokes and references, that just wouldn&#x27;t work for a general audience.<p>So this would be my message to hobbyist board game makers: Make one aboout your university, company, town, or maybe about your other hobby. Tell your own story. Reference people and events that will be familiar.')
