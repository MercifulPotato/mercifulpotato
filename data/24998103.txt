It did not have a singular owner but a number of very large, very bureaucratic and very rich companies with vested interests. In my outsider&#x27;s perspective, this caused the language to effectively deadlock for the better part of a decade.<p>Go in the meantime is chooching along gradually, trying hard not to do anything too big in one go. Modules was the big thing this year, and people are still adjusting and transitioning. Generics MIGHT be the next big thing (idk if the draft design is finished, approved, and work on implementing it is underway). But they spent years considering, humming and hawing, objecting, polling and reconsidering this particular one.<p>They could have pushed for it much harder and much earlier on, but they wanted for the language to settle first, for use cases to be discovered, etc. They learned from the past, e.g. Java&#x27;s implementation, and how it added so much complexity to the language spec, compiler, and all the build tooling - which they really wanted to avoid, because of the use cases of Go as a language and the problems it wanted to avoid (including complicated and slow compilation).')
