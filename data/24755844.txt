They didn&#x27;t allow the now-considered-right-thinking viewpoint (in the case of gays) or were not consistent in support of it (civil rights).  Those who were pro-gay and pro-civil-rights needed alternate means of communication.  The same may be true today.<p>Fortunately, we have such means - email, phone, text, snail mail.  You don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to talk to people who think like you on Facebook or Twitter.  If the mainstream media becomes too censorious, <i>talk somewhere else</i>.<p>Note well:  This does not mean that I am in favor of Facebook censoring, especially if it goes several steps further than just holocaust denial.  But if they do, it&#x27;s not the end of dissent.  Dissent just grows underground.')
