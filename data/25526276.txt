It appears you are cherry picking and missresenting my post again.<p>It had several points where the first point was about me as someone reading dozens of HN posts a day following links and needing to go on a googling spree to find out about a product I might or might not be interested in.<p>The other point was about the missed opportunity to attract users.<p>And even the second point used &quot;projects&quot; and talked about relase pages which made it clear that the it&#x27;s about the generality of the problem (the linked page wasn&#x27;t even a release page) Picking out the specifics you either haven&#x27;t read the post or are misresenting it intentionally.')
