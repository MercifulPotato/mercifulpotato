It&#x27;s better if you&#x27;d stop such speculation.<p>The reality is much more pedestrian than what you describe: the person that was retaliated against only wrote simple, inert, strings of plain text.<p>That text was not injected anywhere, and there was no arbitrary code involved.<p>In fact, everything was safe, and went through the usual security controls.<p>The only &quot;danger&quot; in having that, is that people can read it.<p>Ultimately, it&#x27;s laughable how you think that informing other coworkers about the NLRB is some kind of politically extreme agenda. It&#x27;s clear that you have an axe to grind')
