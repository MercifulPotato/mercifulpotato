It turns out that the part that we were watching was the advertisement that was put together by the creator and it&#x27;s supposed to be terrible. After watching it a bit longer, it hits its stride. It&#x27;s not as good as &quot;Ted Lasso&quot; or even &quot;For All Mankind&quot;, imo, but it&#x27;s a decent comedy with some very self-aware humor.')
