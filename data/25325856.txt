Whoops.  How long did you have this device unenumerated for?  1 second each time you plugged it in?  Well damages can be calculated then...<p>1 second * 365 (number of times plugged in per year) * 500mA * 5 volts * 5 years (expected lifespan) * $0.14 ($&#x2F;kWh electricity)...<p>Total compensation is $0.00014...   Would you like a check for that?')
