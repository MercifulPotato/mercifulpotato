I thought that if DNS were spoofed then people could be redirected anywhere else, no matter what the certificate said. I thought that could be mitigated by CAA records, but that too could be spoofed, eg, by your service provider.<p>How do I prevent the government of China from MITM-ing access to my web site from someone in China, using a Chinese mobile phone with certificates pre-installed and automatically by the local Chinese telco?<p>&quot;This seems like a very strange semantic argument&quot;<p>I think you&#x27;re making the strange argument. If I get a &quot;free&quot; cell phone which has a modified browser that inserted ads when viewing my web site, then from the customer&#x27;s view those ads are on my site, right?<p>But of course there&#x27;s nothing I can do about that. Nor can you.<p>So why place the responsibility on me?<p>&quot;if the only broadband provider that serves your area injects ads on non-secured pages&quot;<p>Have you not seen all of the ads for systems like SecureVPN?<p>&quot;pervasive passive surveillance&quot;<p>One of the pervasive passive surveillance attacks mentioned in the ietf link is traffic analysis, which I mentioned earlier. Can you guarantee that if I simply switch to https then the NSA could not use traffic analysis to figure out what users access from my static-pages, public-facing web site?<p>Do you seriously think the NSA hasn&#x27;t automated something as simple as remembering download sizes for each page, for a large number of web sites, in order to infer things like this? So do my readers gain any additional security against NSA surveillance by switching to https?<p>Don&#x27;t forget that my service provider (in the US) can be forced to reveal details and do tracing without telling me, including providing clear-text access to the logs.<p>Since I cannot defend against NSA surveillance on my readers, I have to choose a threat model where I can make a difference.<p>And I can&#x27;t figure out who I should care to thwart, where https would make a meaningful difference.<p>Clearly there are web providers which can and should use https to protect privacy against non-nation-state actors. Passwords, money, and the ability to insert code without review are three things which change the balance.<p>But I don&#x27;t see any benefit for my basic blog site that&#x27;s been around for 20 years, and there appears to be a (small?) negative.')
