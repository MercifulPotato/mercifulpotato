I&#x27;ve been tracking expert advice on Covid and practically all experts have been right about almost everything related to the disease from the start of February until now. They even predicted the reactions of the population correctly over time, and the second wave in autumn in my region. There were minor disagreements about measures, but overall mostly agreement, and practically every expert has been and is still advising more stringent measures than the governments end up implementing. (Which is not surprising, given the different responsibilities at play.)<p>I felt not only well-informed, I actually felt and still feel a bit over-informed about the topic. My country of residence handles the crisis relatively well, so it&#x27;s kind of silly and depressing to me to continue to collect data and look at daily Covid figures.<p>May I ask where you live? Maybe the US? Did you get your information mostly from print media, online media, or TV?')
