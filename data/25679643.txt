Everyone is there and you are unlikely to create something substantially better enough to cause the ecosystem to migrate. Addons need to interop with the established places users host their code.<p>Watch how GitHub Actions is eating CircleCi and TravisCI for lunch. These platforms have becoming increasingly user hostile and I see tons of people migrating over to the GitHub embedded solution, despite it being buggy at times. I&#x27;ve personally tried Google&#x27;s mirrored solution and have been disappointed by it and now have the GHA migration in my queue.')
