How is the delivery even possible if they aren’t already allowing for the poor experience through take-out? If it’s meant to be served at the table then it should be table only and then it’s fine right? There’s plenty of restaurants that do this, so it’s unclear how the delivery is causing this issue. But I may just be misunderstanding.')
