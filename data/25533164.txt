If the call is taken from someone in Frankfurt and they forward it on to someone in London, does that count? How about if they work in a team together? Or if the Frankfurt banker asks advice from someone in London. It seems difficult to draw a line there. I&#x27;m not really clear whether it&#x27;s just about having a local subsidiary for compliance purposes, or whether it literally means no assistance at all, or what.')
