I prefer my mobile device manufacturer to be different from my auto maker. Maybe that&#x27;s just me.<p>Another aspect I think Apple will struggle with (if they really pursue a full blown car) is the very same reason it succeeds: brand affinity.<p>It was easy to ditch BlackBerry when the iPhone came out because the cost of buying a first gen product wasn&#x27;t so high.<p>I love BMW and don&#x27;t see any current or nascent tech changing that. I&#x27;d love for them to compete, really compete(!!) with Tesla et al. because EVs and all they represent is exciting but I&#x27;m not so hot on Tesla. Great brand and product but kinda feel I&#x27;m not their primary demographic: tech bros who wear Allbirds and live in Silicon Valley.<p>German carmakers have a rich history that speaks for itself when you see the badge on the bonnet. Can&#x27;t say the same about Tesla, let alone Apple.<p>Say what you will but Nazi Sled &gt; Tesla any day. At least for me.')
