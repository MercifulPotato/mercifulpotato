Every remotely interesting discussion gets locked by moderators. Every interesting subreddit gets deleted. So you’re left with content that is diluted to appeal to the lowest common denominator. It’s sad, it used to be a great place to read intelligent discussions from a variety of perspectives, a lot like HN is today but with a broader scope. But today that’s gone.')
