For instance, one of the things many people complain about is that it&#x27;s possible (and indeed easy) to end up with multiple DMs with the same person.  So we&#x27;re in the process of defaulting to &quot;canonical DMs&quot; (i.e. one DM for each pair of people).  Others complain about the hassle of managing E2EE (verifying new logins; backing up your keys with recovery passphrases&#x2F;keys, etc) - the Matrix equivalent of the Signal recovery PIN drama.  We&#x27;re going to be reworking that all (again) next year, too.  So yeah, the UI isn&#x27;t perfect, but hopefully we&#x27;re working on it, and it should get better.<p>Meanwhile, the nice thing about Matrix is you can use whatever app you like - e.g. SchildiChat is a fork of Element Android, FluffyChat&#x27;s good too, so use whatever floats your boat.')
