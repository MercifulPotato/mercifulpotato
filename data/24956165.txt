Do you eagerly grant revocations, in the process protecting more users in cases of disaster but exposing yourself to the pain of false positives (like this one)? Or do you verify such requests, thereby making accidental revocations unlikely but increasing the time it takes for compromised software to get pulled?<p>Given revocation is more easily reversed than fixing a compromised computer, I stand with Appleâ€™s decision to revoke first and ask questions later. But this is a preference, nothing more. Based on how Apple has positioned itself with respect to privacy and security, I imagine this is not an uncommon preference among its customers.')
