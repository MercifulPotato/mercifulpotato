Section 2.5.2 is just the excuse. If 2.5.2 didn&#x27;t cover it, they&#x27;d make up another rule to do so.<p>Apple isn&#x27;t going to let people sidestep copyright on iOS. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether youtube-dl or curl or wget have legitimate uses. If they can be used to sidestep copyright, Apple will ban them.<p>I&#x27;m an Apple user. This pisses me off too.')
