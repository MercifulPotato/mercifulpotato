Especially summer holidays that last three months in Italy.<p>They are my sisters and brothers, even though I only have one &quot;real&quot; sister, my 8 aunts are my moms, my 8 uncles are my dads, when I was a kid I probably spent more time with them than with my parents that were working 12 hour shifts in hospital (they did the exact same job and shared 50&#x2F;50 parenting) and sent me and my sister to our grandparents when schools were closed, so we didn&#x27;t have to be alone at home or with a baby sitter.<p>I feel lucky to have a family where no one is left behind or alone.<p>I never felt we were dependent, on the contrary, they let me develop my independence and I have been a kid who spent long moments alone and still do as an adult.<p>What you call pastoral I call it sense of community.<p>Yes, women had it bad in the past, but what you&#x27;re seeing is not reduced dependence, it&#x27;s solitude.<p>Maybe the fact that I grew up in a socialist family makes my perspective different, but I can&#x27;t imagine old people wanting to be alone, away from their family and loved ones, unless they are forced to.<p>And the worst thing is that even if you were right and old people are simply fulfilling their desire of independence, women have it worse all the same: stats say that in USA 75% of the elderly living alone are women and to make things even worse widowers have more chances of remarriage than widows.<p>Considering that old people living alone have more chances of falling into poverty, that poverty increases the chances of being alone even more, that eating it&#x27;s a social activity for many people, so living alone increases the risk of  malnutrition and that in the presence of health issues loneliness increases the chances of the symptoms getting worse, I wouldn&#x27;t consider more time alone a blessing, not for men nor for women.')
