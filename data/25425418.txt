The vaccines have unknowns.  I see less risk for both myself and family with avoiding the vaccines until there is strong data about their efficacy and safety.<p>&gt;While I&#x27;m obviously glad that vaccine development happened quickly, I really wish rather than being so focussed on vaccinations exclusively we paid more attention to the fact that some countries, Taiwan, China, Singapore, New Zealand and Australia have managed to quell the disease through correct social policy and appropriate levels of social coordination.<p>They&#x27;re either islands, took authoritarian measures, or both.  And again, an endemic virus that will only come back as soon as international travel comes back and lockdowns go away.')
