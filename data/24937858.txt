Nothing about that is about him. In this quote it doesn&#x27;t even matter whos article they didn&#x27;t wanna publish. The whole quoted part could almost identically be written about someone else article they rejected. The &quot;my article&quot; is the only thing that would need to be changed and its quite obvious that if he cant make them post it no one else would get a similar article to be posted. This is not about him at all and certainly hes not the victim hes the one who attacked &quot;the media&quot; in what he wrote. He certainly was well aware that he asked them to publish something that criticizing themselves and he certainly was also fully aware that if they decline they proof his point. Checkmate for him - not a victim.')
