We&#x27;ll even ignore the easy ones like violating the emoluments clause and blatant nepotism.<p>Withholding aid to Puerto Rico. Calling for the governor of Michigan to be locked up for implementing covid restrictions then refusing to condemn the folks that attempted to kidnap her.<p>Charlottesville.

Refusing to condemn Russia for assassinating citizens of other nations with chemical weapons. Jamaal kashoggi.  Saluting North Korean soldiers.
