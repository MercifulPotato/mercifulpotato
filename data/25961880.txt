(so someone has to put collateral for that)<p>Sure, but I wonder why RH didn&#x27;t just change their rules to being that you won&#x27;t be able to trade instantly with any sold GME, and then used client funds as collateral? This seems much better than stopping buying altogether. I suppose maybe the code wasn&#x27;t in place for something like this, idk.')
