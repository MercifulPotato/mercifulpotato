Many people hear hear that phrase, and immediately assume you are not arguing in good faith.<p>Yes, immigrants built America. But so did enslaved people. So did natives. So did rebellious colonists of the British empire. Most of those people did not consider themselves immigrants - and nor do their descendants.<p>Many immigrants have contributed amazing things to our nation, and they still do. But immigrants as a group are not a monolith. Many of the &quot;highly skilled workers&quot; that come over on H1Bs, are frankly - not highly skilled workers. Many are semi-skilled workers who are preferred over qualified Americans because they work for low wages and nearly never quit when abused.<p>Americans have a right to say that we don&#x27;t want our immigration system used as a tool to devalue working conditions - something which affects all of us. If we can solve this problem first, then we can talk about allowing in more immigrants. But it&#x27;s absurd to say to reduce this to &quot;immigrants = good = America&quot;. Not when we know the current system is abusive to both immigrants, and to the Americans who are part of the toxic workplaces that the H1B visa-mill paradigm has created.')
