The number looks small, so people see that and say &quot;oh, no big deal&quot; but they don&#x27;t realize how big of an impact it has on their net worth if their assets are mostly fiat currency. Additionally, most people don&#x27;t notice how this affects their behavior and encourages people to save less and spend more, but from a macroeconomic perspective the effect is plain as day, most people have less than 1k in savings.')
