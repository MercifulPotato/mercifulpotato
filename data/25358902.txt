Worked great on Firefox Android.<p>I play plenty of puzzle games, and I always wonder what the process of designing the problems is like. Do designers develop some notion of solvability, and quickly generate puzzles &quot;in reverse&quot;, procedurally, or nearly so? Or do they start sketching an idea of a puzzle and then tweak it until it&#x27;s solvable at just the right difficulty level, with lots of gameplay testing?<p>I&#x27;m sure it depends on the puzzle mechanic, and this one seems particularly amenable to the procedural approach, being almost purely geometry-based.')
