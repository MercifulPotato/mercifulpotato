Since they are effectively editing what can and cannot be shared via their service? Wouldn&#x27;t that place them under much stronger legal scrutiny?<p>Maybe I&#x27;m reading too much into it. I understand a business can refuse to do business with anyone they please. That&#x27;s already the case though. Why a change like this to the TOS?<p>Either way, I&#x27;m all for businesses being able to pick and choose their customers. I would never use Mailchimp based on a change like this, but they are free to change their service however they&#x27;d like.')
