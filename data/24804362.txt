Nobody pays attention to the 999 times someone prays for rain and fails but the 1 time it does and it called &quot;working a miracle&quot;. That sort of selection bias is in play here but worse as they ignore the background yields of regularly applied rationalism.<p>Not to mention the projection involved - &quot;success&quot; is easy to come by if you have a crowd of rubes paying for what they want to believe but rationalism doesn&#x27;t offer anything with such popular appeal directly.<p>Really the whole article is anti-intellectualism fallacies strung together in a &quot;If where the rays of the sun don&#x27;t create gold why aren&#x27;t you rich!&quot; style fallacious retort.')
