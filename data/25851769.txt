This company is many years before revenue and their valuation is absolutely huge.<p>Its not clear to me that their technology is significantly better then other solid state companies. They are the best at marketing of those companies and are much better known.<p>Even if their technology is pretty good, the manufacturing challenge is incredible. There are currently literally 10s of billions put into conventional cell manufacturing lines. QS will have to reinvent a fair part of that and also have huge capital investment to build that production.<p>The direct competitor to Lithium Metal anodes, is Silicon anodes. Many companies are on the same or faster timelines, and the main advantage of the Silicon anodes is that you can basically just put them threw existing plants.<p>There are many reason why I think they can&#x27;t justify that valuation.')
