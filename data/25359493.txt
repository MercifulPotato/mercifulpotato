As such, whether someone is or isn&#x27;t vaccinated could be considered a private matter (patient-doctor confidentiality), just like any other medical treatment.<p>If vaccination became mandatory, we&#x27;d have a different discussion. But if it&#x27;s not, a public government has little argument to keep a record about your medical history, and, even less so, divulge that information to private actors.<p>Can private actors - venues, hotels, restaurants,... - force someone to divulge medical information?<p>No. They can&#x27;t. They could ask, but you&#x27;re not obliged to answer anything related to your medical history.<p>Could they refuse entrance if you refuse to provide medical information?<p>I&#x27;m curious when the first legal cases will pop up where someone decides to take a venue to court because they were actively refused entrance over being unwilling to divulge medical information.')
