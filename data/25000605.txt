If I gave you a system that was losing 30% of a resource to replace a system that lost 60%, you&#x27;ve cut your losses in half.<p>If I told you a mechanical system could get that to 15%, you&#x27;d replace that again. Anyone who tells you they can get a heat engine down to 15% losses is a charlatan and should be reported for fraud.')
