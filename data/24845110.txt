Chrome has used a dirty-bit<p>This mentality sorta falls into the exact pitfall GP mentioned (i.e. what you really want is for IE&#x2F;Edge to be significantly faster bringing speed gains for everyone else along the way, not for Chrome to be microscopically faster at the expense of every other browser)<p>There are real and significant costs in things like random access of .childNodes or bottom-up DOM construction in some browsers. At the height of the whole virtual dom thing, there was a lot of super browser-specific micro-optimizations going on, a lot of it w&#x2F; a heavy focus on Chrome, with IRHydra and stuff.<p>It got a bit ridiculous when I figured out that you could make a significant dent in one of the popular benchmarks at the time not by tweaking JS anymore, but by removing unused CSS rules from bootstrap.css...<p>But as you said, engines change quickly and I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s really worth to be chasing micro-optimizations anymore. We&#x27;re getting to a stage where the only way to get faster is to simply run less code. Some frameworks are getting the idea (svelte, marko).')
