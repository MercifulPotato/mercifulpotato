I was surprised by that, but he showed me data that supported that.<p>Update: I just found <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.circleid.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;20180731_the_ipv4_market_2018_mid_year_report&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.circleid.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;20180731_the_ipv4_market_2018_...</a> which says<p>&gt; As we head into the last half of 2018, small blocks are selling for just over $18&#x2F;number, mid-blocks are in the $15-$18&#x2F;number range, and large blocks have surpassed the $20&#x2F;number threshold<p>so it seems there&#x27;s a bit of an U shape, where mid-sized blocks have the lowest price per address.')
