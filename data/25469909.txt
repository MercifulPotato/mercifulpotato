It would require a change in our constitution, which can&#x27;t be done in a hurry. (there is legislation being worked on to address the cases the shortcomings of the law but it is not being rushed)<p>Our PM also doesn&#x27;t have the authority to tell our public health agency what to do, this amounts to ministerial governance, which is illegal [1]. (if the US would have such a law, for example, then we would have seen a lot less involvement of POTUS)<p>And re our king: he&#x27;s (arguably) not an idiot, but he&#x27;s not very bright either. We generally don&#x27;t take his opinion seriously.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ministerial_governance" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ministerial_governance</a>')
