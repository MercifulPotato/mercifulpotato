And sure, the <i>systems</i> were much simpler. Systems get more complex over time. I wouldn&#x27;t be typing in this edit field in a web browser within a window in a multitasking GUI OS if not.<p>With that said, things certainly were not easier. Plug in a device now days and viola it works! Transfer a archive from Linux -&gt; OS X -&gt; Windows and you can view it (and even using the same multi-platform apps) across the board. ...the list goes on forever.<p>Can things be easier? Sure? Simplicity? Yes! Is it all rainbows and unicorns? Nah (as people have pointed out already you lose control).<p>Many systems exist for things like single file applications. Of course no one can agree on what that should look like it seems. AppImages, .apks (which are just Zip files), static binaries, containerized applications, etc. OS X has had .app&#x27;s for a long time which are just a folder of files (and the common way to transfer that is a mountable image or archive).<p>People have tried many times to come up with embedded icons in ELF. Why some Linux users push back is still beyond me. Yes we know we need multiple formats and resolutions. OK, support that. .desktop files are nice, but that shouldn&#x27;t be something I have to mess around with generally. Most systems still don&#x27;t have a nice way to even create these files (which let&#x27;s be honest: are just the Windows equivalent to a .lnk desktop shortcut).<p>Oof I could go on forever here. I think I&#x27;ll stop.')
