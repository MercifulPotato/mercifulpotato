(More people getting up before sunrise not just in all of the Winter, but also large parts of Spring, and Fall.)<p>Neither permanent answer is great for the entire hour-wide width of today&#x27;s timezones. In some ways the DST switch is a large part of how we can sanely keep such large timezones at all.')
