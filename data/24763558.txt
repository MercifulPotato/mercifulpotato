Yeah it’ll be harder to spread hatred for about five minutes but there’s still a bunch of nazis everywhere.<p>The education system is imho the root cause of all of these problems. We don’t teach children critical thinking. We teach them <i>about</i> science but not <i>why</i> science.<p>We also dump our kids at school for childcare rather than education, which doesn’t inspire an interest in learning just for learning’s sake <i>at all</i>.  Relying on overworked and underpaid teaching staff to care more about educating our kids than we do clearly hasn’t worked either.<p>My point is that a well educated person will be able to easily identify most bulls<i></i>t when they read it, will know how to check the credibility of their sources, and will know why some opinions really are more valid than others (you wouldn’t ask a plumber for advice on a tumour, or a doctor for advice on a busted boiler, so why would you trust some rando on the internet’s whackadoodle conspiracy nonsense?).<p>I hate saying this, but I hate more that you’re not allowed to say this.<p>Every time a post is made about Facebook or Twitter or Instagram it comes back to a variant of “how do we manage what gets shown to the cattle?”. We don’t use that language, but it’s what we mean.<p>They’re not cattle, they’re our friends and family, and they’ve been failed by our broken education system.<p>Not to go all Will McAvoy (not least as this is not a partisan problem) but the first step to fixing a problem is acknowledging there is one. There is a not insignificant number of people in the world who have been failed by the school system. We need to solve the real problem. We need to invest in intelligence and critical thinking.')
