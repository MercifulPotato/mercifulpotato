The provide tools to generate this as well as convert docker-compose to kubeyaml<p>* podman-compose is not official, but it works well. you have to note that its not 100% compatible with dc but a lot of dc files run out of the box without modifications<p>* ansible with podman<p>* i personally use the podman cli with makefiles to get docker-compose like functionality<p>* also, podman v2 supports a docker comptaible rest api so its possible that docker-compose can be modified to support podman in the future')
