They consistently show people doing two categories of work:<p>Creative, meant the way an ad agency uses the word: graphic design, video production, photo editing, desktop publishing, etc.<p>Office work: reading and writing emails, reviewing and editing and signing documents, messaging, etc.<p>I can’t remember any product marketing that even implies the iPad is a platform for coding. I think developers get hung up on the word “Pro,” thinking it refers to them. But in Apple’s world, “Pro” has covered a wide range of professions and often leans more toward the “creative arts” as listed above.')
