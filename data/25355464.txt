Every interpreted language out there is like this. Also, the gem install step can be done outside of the unikernel and then have the artifacts loaded on.<p>We have current ESXi VSphere support today - both for 6.7 and 7.0. There are some docs here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nanovms.gitbook.io&#x2F;ops&#x2F;vsphere" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nanovms.gitbook.io&#x2F;ops&#x2F;vsphere</a> .<p>When you deploy a unikernel it&#x27;s packaged as a virtual machine so it&#x27;s not like you are deploying a linux vm and then running this on top - you are deploying your application as it&#x27;s own isolated vm and it is hardware accelerated. Without hardware acceleration the &quot;cloud&quot; wouldn&#x27;t exist, however instead of running 2 layers of linux (hypervisor and guest) we recognize that we&#x27;re virtualized and that we don&#x27;t need an extra full blown linux running as guest.')
