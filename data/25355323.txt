This has been true for as long as humans have lived in civilization. Laws like this just give them more cover.<p>The law in question[0], in part, requires:<p>&quot;The bill amends the Open Public Records Act (“OPRA”) to exclude from the definition of a government (i.e., public) record the portion of any document which discloses the home address of any active or retired 1) judge, 2) prosecutor or 3) law enforcement officer.<p>Further, the bill prohibits government agencies, individuals and businesses from knowingly publishing on the internet, or otherwise making available, the home address or unpublished home telephone number of any active or retired judge or any active or retired prosecutor.&quot;<p>Now there&#x27;s certainly an argument to be made that such restrictions, if we are to have them, should be much, much, broader, given the harassment (including SWATting[1]) of other folks outside the specific job functions mentioned in the law.<p>I&#x27;m trying to view your comment in the best possible light, but I keep coming back to the last sentence:<p>&quot;Laws like this just give them more cover.&quot;<p>How, <i>exactly</i>, do you mean that restricting access to the home addresses of such folks  &quot;gives them more cover?&quot;<p>Is it your assertion that judges and other folks <i>should</i> have their home addresses available as some sort of extra-legal check on their authority?<p>What purpose does that serve?  So that those who disagree with such people can go over to their house with a fruit basket and calmly discuss how their decision was incorrect and caused harm?<p>That seems pretty unlikely.  As such, I&#x27;m <i>forced</i> to interpret your statement as:<p>&quot;We should publish the home addresses of these people so they can be harassed, threatened, assaulted or killed if they make decisions I disagree with.&quot;<p>If I misunderstand you, please explain and accept my apologies.<p>If not, I hope I don&#x27;t live anywhere near you.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nj.gov&#x2F;governor&#x2F;news&#x2F;news&#x2F;562020&#x2F;approved&#x2F;20201120b.shtml" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nj.gov&#x2F;governor&#x2F;news&#x2F;news&#x2F;562020&#x2F;approved&#x2F;20201120b....</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Swatting" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Swatting</a>')
