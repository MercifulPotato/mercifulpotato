It <i>works</i>. I go off and make the art and comics it’s there to hold, and I spend a few minutes in WP posting it. And WP autoposts about my posts to the social media sites that have completely replaced RSS. The last goddamn thing I want to do is be on the bleeding edge of some bullshit that I have to be constantly hacking on.<p>It may be a giant mess under the hood, but my experience <i>is</i> one of automation, robustness, and simplicity. It just keeps on trucking along with no more thought on my part than “oh it wants to update, okay let’s hit that update button on the core and plugins” every so often.')
