You dislike algorithms that feed right wing propaganda to people.  What about left wing propaganda? What about sites that don&#x27;t feed right wing propaganda? How would you craft rules that address what you see as the problem? The devil is in the details. I totally get you want to attack Facebook and its ilk, but regulation can entrench the incumbents and reduce competition if not thought through.<p>3. Thanks for answering the question this time. So advertisers are getting taxed, which will increase the cost of advertising for companies seeking to drive awareness for their products. Some potential effects of this:<p>* It raises the cost of advertising. This means that you&#x27;ll need higher margins for the increased cost of advertising to make sense as an advertiser. Given the higher cost&#x2F;margin requirement, you may see smaller advertisers drop-off, having the potential to reducing competition in different markets. This would be a good thing for big companies&#x2F;incumbents.<p>* Depending on the size of the tax, it could put upward pressure on prices elsewhere, as businesses attempt to maintain their margins and account for the increased marketing costs.<p>* Tax collection will add a new operational cost for ad networks. Google and Facebook, given their size and profitability will be able to deal with this cost easier than most.<p>* If it reduces total ad revenue for publishers, you&#x27;ll likely see a bunch of smaller companies go out of business that depend on ad revenue. Smaller and local news&#x2F;content sites will be hurt, leaving fewer sources, and further entrenching the major news companies. Ad revenue models by their nature promote strategies to appeal to the widest audience possible, in order to maximize impressions&#x2F;engagement. The alternative model in news (just to use as an example) is subscription, which doesn&#x27;t have that same incentive. The incentive is to maximize <i>paying</i> customers. In some niche areas you may likely see higher quality (which we already see today). But some of the downsides are: less privileged people won&#x27;t have access to the same information that they may have previously, increased polarization &amp; bubbles as publishers cater to exactly what their paying customers want to hear (and thus continue paying for).')
