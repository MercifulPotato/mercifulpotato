The result is that AI-generated language will be homogenized, reflecting the practices of the richest countries and communities.<p>It seems amusing to read this when the same person and her followers hounded Yann LeCun for pointing out the same thing with image models.<p>Anyway, this seems interesting. But I am not sure how you solve this. Do we take representative dataset according to population of a place? Also, assuming this is limited to a single language. How can AI generated language account for nuances from regional differences at the same time in a common model. Isn&#x27;t what the author asking for here is kind of train, en_US, en_GB, en_IN separately here. For things like completion don&#x27;t language models already account for this?')
