The problem is that most laypeople don&#x27;t even know it exists. Combined with dark patterns used by microsoft and google to steer users toward their own browsers, it&#x27;s an uphill battle. I&#x27;ll stick firefox and appropriate extensions on a friends computer so they can watch youtube etc completely ad free, which is a major tangible QOL improvement, but then find them watching ads in ms edge a few days later without having realized.')
