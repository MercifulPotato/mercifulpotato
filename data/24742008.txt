The SL blog uses Jekyll, so I&#x27;m limited to just using a markdown document with some ugly hacks.<p>Essentially, there&#x27;s a div before each paragraph specifying the timestamp in its id - all done manually. I use `querySelectorAll` to get a list of those divs, extract the timestamps from the IDs, and store them in an array.<p>In the audio&#x27;s `timeUpdate`, I check which paragraph we&#x27;re on, and if it has changed then scroll to the next sibling of the timestamp div.<p>No magic bullet sadly!')
