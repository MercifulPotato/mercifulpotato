Humor me by explaining this coordinated attack in the context of what is guaranteed by the first amendment, perhaps I am missing something?:<p>- YouTube says it will no longer allow users to upload videos claiming that President Trump lost the 2020 presidential election due to fraud.<p>- A video message from president Donald Trump calling for peace and to go home, was deleted by Facebook, Twitter and YouTube on Wednesday as a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol.<p>- Many conservative twitter users are reporting significant drops in followers, likely because many small accounts are being purged too.<p>- Reddit banned &#x2F;r&#x2F;DonaldTrump, the largest pro-Trump forum on the site, and Discord banned the server “The Donald” while acknowledging there was no evidence the chat played any role in inciting violence at all.<p>- Michael Flynn was kicked off Twitter permanently<p>- Steve Bannon’s YouTube channel was permanently suspended.<p>- Parler was taken off Google’s Google Play store, and Apple has threatened to follow suit.<p>- Twitch, a streaming service owned by Amazon, and Snapchat, both suspended Trump’s accounts.<p>- Shopify took down two online stores affiliated with Trump, one belonging to his campaign and the other to the Trump Organization.<p>- Finally — Trump’s Twitter and Facebook is indefinitely suspended until “at least” the inauguration.<p>I am not even mentioning the hypocrisy that has occurred... No effort by these companies, or anyone really, to stop violence by leftist causes. No such drastic measures taken. If you know something I don’t, again— make me informed.<p>I’m sure I haven’t covered all of it. But please, out of respect and the sharing of ideas: I ask for 15 minutes of your time (don’t know why i care so much lol) but seriously! Give these a watch, he does a much better job than I can covering why this is relevant to free speech and censorship, in a succinct manner:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;8SicsQervb4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;8SicsQervb4</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;xH9XWNz0GW4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;xH9XWNz0GW4</a>')
