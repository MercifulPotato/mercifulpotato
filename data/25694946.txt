But I think still worth highlighting the behavior. No offense meant. :)<p>While definitely catering to it due to the nature of the platforms intentions, I think it may be going to far to just classify a platform like Parlor as “alt”.<p>It attracted an ‘alt’ crowd due to it trying to be a purist in free speech, which I think on the surface is something we all think we want.<p>The real conversation here is that we are learning as a society that “free speech” does need governance and it’s going to be a long violent road to defining what that actually means.<p>“Freedom” in the sense our lazy minds have generally defined it, has failed. Not to say that’s a bad thing, but we’re still in a time of our evolution where just that very sentence sounds as evil as the devil himself.<p>Our next 100 years is going to be tumultuous and we should all have some apprehension, even if it’s 80% right, perpetuating the same lazy thinking that Has resulted in a future that is guaranteed to make the future of our kids a major struggle.<p>All this. All of what’s going on now... it makes me sad to know that the ease my life has enjoyed so far is not the same future for the ones I love the most in this world.<p>This is all a VERY BIG DEAL. It’s not just a headline deserving no more than a lazy label. We should treat it and discuss it as such.')
