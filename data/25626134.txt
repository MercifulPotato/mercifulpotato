This isn&#x27;t about having an FPGA embedded into the CPU or near the CPU, it&#x27;s about having a programmable FPGA like execution unit that can be programmed to be say a 4-bit floating point adder, or any other weird execution unit one might need.<p>Why is this important? Have a program that does a lot of integer multiplications? Let&#x27;s program all of these programmable execution units to multiply integers on the fly, etc. Now your integer multiply throughput is higher, as per the current program&#x27;s needs.<p>Have lots of weird old x86 instructions you are forced to support but no one actually uses? Don&#x27;t waste transistors on them just program an execution unit to execute that instruction on the fly, etc.<p>I think it&#x27;s great, and that most people are missing the point.')
