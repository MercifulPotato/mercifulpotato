That&#x27;s not just rhetorical, I don&#x27;t understand why you&#x27;d ask that question. The main advantages of separate processes are (1) any global variables are not shared between them, which is sometimes what you want (like Python&#x27;s GIL), and (2) there is memory protection. Neither of those seem relevant to a Rust data processing program.<p>To actually answer your question a bit: Threads allow all the benefits of processes (except the two I just mentioned), with the added benefit of being lower overhead and allow sharing information more easily (but you can still use full-blown IPC to communicate between them if you wish).')
