Seligman&#x27;s work is more than just &quot;Pessimism should be avoided&quot;, and he didn&#x27;t say avoid negative feelings, but that there are 2 ways of seeing setbacks; the pessimist usually thinks it&#x27;s permanent (&quot;it will be bad forever&quot;), pervasive (&quot;everything is fucked&quot;) and personal (&quot;it&#x27;s because of me&quot;). Meanwhile the optimist would see a problem as temporary, specific (&quot;We just need to fix this thing&quot;) and not due to the self, but more to do with circumstances (e.g. &quot;I didn&#x27;t sleep well so I didn&#x27;t perform that well&quot;).<p>So it&#x27;s not about how to avoid acknowledging problems, it&#x27;s about how you shape your mind to see and deal with problems...')
