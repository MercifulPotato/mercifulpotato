One the one hand I certainly tend towards a preservationist mindset and as the sibling comment notes, we don&#x27;t really know what we should save for various reasons. The guy who is responsible for having saved a bunch of Usenet archives made a comment to the effect of: &quot;I didn&#x27;t realize that what we really should have prioritized was discussions about social issues, culture, etc.--not bug fixes for a long obsolete version of SunOS.&quot;<p>OTOH, I&#x27;m kind of glad that nothing I wrote that wasn&#x27;t filtered by an editor from before maybe age 30 or so exists online. (And even the filtered stuff you probably would need to know where to look.)')
