According to my analysis of the original ST80 v2 virtual image there is a very high interdependency among objects; and since there is no static type information, many dependencies are not statically identifiable. There are also many objects that have not been created or initialized anywhere in the source code (neither in the sources file nor in the Bluebook interpreter), but on which the functionality of the system depends. Versioning of objects and corresponding source code is difficult, also combining a certain version of different components or communication drivers with other parts to be integrated, and so on.<p>&gt; Compared to what?<p>E.g. Java or C++ or any technology with clearly identifiable compilation and configuration units.')
