DNS-over-HTTP is encrypted. Or DNSSEC or any number of newer standards that secure the DNS lookup. At that point, filtering will require MITM proxies, whether it&#x27;s for DNS or HTTP or any other protocol.<p>It&#x27;s a trade-off with security on the open network meaning harder penetration and control in your internal network.
