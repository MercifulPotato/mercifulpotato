Mainline Protestantism, for example, is in decline: Mainline Protestant churches represented the &quot;default&quot; Christianity for generations of moderates, and by moderates I mean both moderate in religion and moderate in politics.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mainline_Protestant" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mainline_Protestant</a><p>These days, they&#x27;re losing members to a growing irreligion, people who can find everything they need without joining any religious faith and, perhaps more importantly, can remain irreligious without suffering a serious social disability. (There are still places where the first icebreaker question is &quot;What church do you go to?&quot; and not having a <i>good</i> answer is not really an option if you wish to get along.) Therefore, expecting the old standbys to pick up the slack isn&#x27;t going to work.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;religionunplugged.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2019&#x2F;8&#x2F;30&#x2F;as-nones-increase-mainline-protestantism-is-headed-for-an-age-cliff" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;religionunplugged.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2019&#x2F;8&#x2F;30&#x2F;as-nones-increa...</a><p>The above has some great quotes:<p>&gt; &quot;People are either being intentionally and intensely religious – like really active evangelicals, or conservative Catholics, or yada yada – or they&#x27;re leaving the more moderate churches that we&#x27;ve always seen as holding down the middle of religious life in this country,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#x27;ve ended up with two trends that appear to be related. We&#x27;re losing moderation in the political space in American life and we&#x27;re losing moderation in the religious space, as well.&quot;<p>&gt; The political implications of these trends are complex, he said. But there does seem to be a Big Idea at the heart of it all: Millions of Americans, especially young adults, have decided that &quot;religious&quot; equals &quot;Republican.&quot;<p>&gt; Burge put it this way on Twitter, describing how doctrines can affect public life: &quot;There is no religious group in the U.S. that places itself halfway between the political parties. Instead, every religious tradition has a &#x27;baked-in&#x27; political preference now. Nones favor Democrats. Christians (by and large) favor the GOP.&quot;')
