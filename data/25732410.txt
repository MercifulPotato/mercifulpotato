They choose what to show you, just like the NYT or any other traditional publisher. The only difference is who does the choosing---algorithms or humans. But that, to me, is just a logistical detail and shouldn&#x27;t have an effect on the distinction between publisher and platform. To think that Facebook and other companies act as merely connectors between viewpoints and are really just platforms for free speech is ridiculous.<p>From the article, no, Facebook did not &quot;fail to prevent its platform from being used to foment division and incite offline violence;&quot; they published content which foments division and incites offline violence. The distinction is important.')
