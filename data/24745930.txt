Item(by='gravitas', descendants=None, kids=[24746011], score=None, time=1602425657, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24745785, text='&gt; I think you&#x27;re perhaps inadvertently proving my point<p>Yes sorry that was the intention - the &quot;market mechanics&quot; which I observe as a passive investor support your theory, as well as my own choices in how I move that money. My goal is overall return on investment as opposed to say socially-conscious or other types of investing choices (although I have dabbled in some of the socially conscious funds, good for the soul but not really the pocketbook); the data shows that using the index funds over total market funds is a better financial choice for a guy like me who just wants to &quot;sort of care from time to time&quot; over the long term.')
