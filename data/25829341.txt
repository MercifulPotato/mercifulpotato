The average number of placements is maybe 2 - are you perhaps thinking of the average number among children who never leave care?<p>As for the idea that &quot;even a single CPS placement&quot; is worse than being left with violent parents - I&#x27;ve never seen anything supporting this but if you have some I&#x27;d love to read it.')
