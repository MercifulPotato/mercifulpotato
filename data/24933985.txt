But we can&#x27;t.&quot; So Mueller has admitted that Trump obstructed his investigation<p>There&#x27;s a pretty big excluded middle between &quot;We can say with authority that X obstructed&quot; and &quot;We can exonerate X of obstructing&quot;.<p>(Which is not to say that details in Mueller&#x27;s report don&#x27;t tend to support the conclusion of obstruction, but Mueller saying that they could exonerate doesn&#x27;t equate to saying that Trump did obstruct.)')
