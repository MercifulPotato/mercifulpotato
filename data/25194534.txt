There is significant variation in every state by race.<p>&gt; Are other races somehow not American? I never understood this argument. &quot;If it weren&#x27;t for all those black people and immigrants we&#x27;d actually be really good! Those other countries are just too &#x27;homogenous&#x27;. &quot;<p>Can we please speak about issues that affect different races without assuming that the person of the &quot;other&quot; race is disparaging the race being discussed? Noone said anything about other races not being American until you did. The parent commenter did not express that their country would &quot;actually be really good if it weren&#x27;t for all those black people and immigrants.&quot; Those are your words, not theirs.')
