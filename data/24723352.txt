It lets you create new tools using several lines of concise code; see the example from this article:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;devopsspiral&#x2F;ebpf-bt-unlock&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;bt_dev_read.bt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;devopsspiral&#x2F;ebpf-bt-unlock&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;b...</a><p>As BTF (BPF Type Format) becomes the default in kernels, this short tool will become even shorter: the &quot;( struct hci_dev *) arg0&quot; cast won&#x27;t be necessary as the kernel will already know what type arg0 is. So line 9 can be skipped.<p>I see a lot of people start with other BPF tracers that made sense years ago as we hadn&#x27;t built bpftrace yet. It&#x27;ll really save you a lot of time to look at bpftrace first and then others only if need be. bpftrace is installed by default on all cloud instances at Netflix and other companies: it&#x27;s the go-to tool for whipping up custom tracing programs.')
