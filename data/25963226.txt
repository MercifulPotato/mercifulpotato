I got 3.0xxx shares on Wed. 1&#x2F;27 on Robinhood for 999 bucks. I&#x27;m pretty sure I began a transfer to Robinhood of $1,000 from my bank account BEFORE I bought them. Well, the shares were in my possession in a matter of seconds after but my $1,000 won&#x27;t clear until Feb 2. I have NO idea if I bought on margin and if am subject to margin call&#x2F; holding liquidation etc. If anyone has any insight I would very much appreciate it!!!! Thanks-- An idiot')
