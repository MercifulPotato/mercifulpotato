Solar is cheap when it&#x27;s only providing supplemental power during the day, same with wind. Using them as a primary source of energy requires staggering amounts of storage, and proposals to fulfill these demands exist either on paper or in the form of prototypes 4-5 orders of magnitude smaller than what is required.<p>I&#x27;ve repeatedly [1] [2] addressed the shortcomings of your assumption that hydrogen will deliver low cost storage, in particular electrolysis and compression remains only ~30-40% efficient, underground storage is not widespread, and existing infrastructure to transport and storage methane cannot be used for hydrogen.<p>At this point, claiming renewables + storage is a solution to decarbonizing the economy is analogous to saying fusion is a solution. Yes, it&#x27;s possible and we are familiar with the physics of how to make it work. And <i>if</i> it works, then yes it&#x27;s a good solution. But it doesn&#x27;t currently work, and it&#x27;s unknown whether or not it will work in the foreseeable future. Technology that&#x27;s 10-20 years away tends to stay 10-20 years a way for much loner than 10-20 years.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23735379" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23735379</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24619197" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24619197</a>')
