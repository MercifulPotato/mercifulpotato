They would shoot and kill and many as it takes.&quot; Parent also stated &quot;The government is also quite scared, and to make sure there wont be uprisings, is spreading fear. They execute people and hand cruel sentences to everyone. Last weeks they gave a 10 years sentence to an 18 years makeup artist who had a famous Instagram account. Journalists are executed, etc. People&#x27;s morale are completely shattered.&quot;<p>You, and others, don&#x27;t have it better in the US? Really?<p>I think you are trying to show empathy and I agree with most of your comment, but to me, you can&#x27;t empathize unless you&#x27;ve experienced it.<p>And I don&#x27;t wish to demean experiences of some oppressed people in the US and their experiences (certainly the wrongfully convicted come to mind as a huge injustice), but your comment is not objectively accurate.')
