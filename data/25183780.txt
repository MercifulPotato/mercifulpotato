Say group X posts content proclaiming superiority over group Y. And group Y also posts content proclaiming superiority over group X. Say website does not take action on either instance of hate speech. It would follow that the website is condoning two contradictory views.<p>The reality is that hosting content is not condoning it. An approach of &quot;we&#x27;re treating this like a whiteboard, we are not going to be involved in taking action against particular content&quot; isn&#x27;t an endorsement of anything. Whatever objectionable content someone might post, another person could post the complete opposite.<p>Not getting involved is exactly that: not getting involved. Ultimately, this claim that refusal to take action against hate speech is the same &quot;inaction with respect to _____ is condoning ______&quot; rhetoric that&#x27;s been trotted out time and time again. At best, it&#x27;s a misguided effort to inspire opposition to harmful views.')
