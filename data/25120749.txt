What benifit would having multiple usernames if all could be identified anyways?<p>I guess you could have some sort of a unique hidden watermark to identify users that break the screen shot rule (if they reposted on another site) but I&#x27;m not sure it would prevent someone taking a picture with an older camera.<p>Have you considered building a community using an existing forum backend that you can admin? As a test run? It is my understanding that administrating social media can be a very stressful thing. It would be a shame to develop a whole new social ecosystem only to be overwhelmed by the pressures and stress.<p>Anyways<p>Good luck with Your project, I hope You are successful.')
