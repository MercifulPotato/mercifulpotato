Yes a private key is like a very long password, but the important part is that it never leaves the client side and it&#x27;s safe to use on every computer you want access to without the hassle of remembering one password per server.<p>If you access many machines, how will you know when one is compromised?  How will you prevent an attacker from logging in as you?<p>Public keys really are the better way to handle user auth, less of a minefield for regular users.')
