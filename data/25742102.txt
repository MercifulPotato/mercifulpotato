We do not start with enough information and we lose too much down the stack. Especially around concurrency. I think that at the end of the day there is some atomic information needed by hardware and OS to make optimizes about all code running on the system.<p>I see the approach taken here in an effort to retain needed information by integrating compilation and OS level functionality. I think this is correct but we will see a shift to OSes having there own byte code as a translation layer between higher level languages. I also think high level languages lack some needed information in the first place...')
