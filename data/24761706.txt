The link to the Privacy Settings page does not appear in the menu.  There is a Privacy Dashboard link which also does not contain a link to the Privacy Settings.  I only found the link to Privacy Settings after submitting a request to Verizon to delete the data they have stored about me.<p>I would switch to a mobile service provider that cared about its customers, if one existed.  The options in my area are AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon, their subsidiaries, and Google.')
