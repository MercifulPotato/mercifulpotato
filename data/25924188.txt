Blatant misinformation, vague encouragement of violence... hate?<p>Why do they have to be rules? Why can&#x27;t we have a culture of tolerance? Robots aren&#x27;t running these companies. They&#x27;re people, just like you and me. They can choose to be tolerant.<p>Tolerance is about tolerating the most horrid things. Not because it&#x27;s nice or those things have some value. They&#x27;re horrid, they have no value. It&#x27;s because the alternative is worse. Because censorship is worse. Because when a person is censored, when they can&#x27;t speak, they resort to violence and through censorship, you encourage violence. And violence can&#x27;t be censored. It can only be suppressed with further violence.')
