It&#x27;s really one of only a few Ikea bits left since my wife and I got together. Ikea made it possible to furnish our home at the time, and as we&#x27;ve stabilized and our careers grown, we&#x27;ve replaced the Ikea items with nicer things. I have no ill will toward Ikea, and while they do not make furniture you&#x27;ll put in your will, they enable a lot of people to have decent things at a decent price.')
