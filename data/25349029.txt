They essentially subsidize healthcare for much of the rest of the world (meaning the U.S. bears more of the cost so other countries can have cheaper care). There&#x27;s plenty wrong with the U.S. healthcare system that needs fixing, but trite sentences don&#x27;t begin to capture the real nature of the problem.')
