However, I could not understand the following and would greatly appreciate if someone could help me out:<p>-- The need for complex numbers in describing a quantum bit. Why do we have to use complex numbers when the system is very much real? What is the real world interpretation?<p>-- The fact that an n-qubit quantum computing system is significantly powerful than classical system because of 2^n states. But, a classical system with n-bits will also have 2^n states, isn&#x27;t it?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;quantum-computing-lfmu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;quantum-computing-lfmu</a>')
