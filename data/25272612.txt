The company raised ~225 million in the IPO at a split adjusted price of $3.5&#x2F;share. That stock is now worth $580&#x2F;share and not a penny of that increase went to the company.<p>Similarly, the market cap at IPO in 2010 was $1.7 billion and is now $580 billion.<p>The company can get some benefit from high market cap and valuation through borrowing and secondary stock offerings. Since 2010, Tesla has raised about $6 billion in secondary stock sales, which can actually invested in production. But this is about 1% of the cash spent by investors to purchase public stock from each other.')
