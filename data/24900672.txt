The legal theory is that your money (and property) doesn&#x27;t have the right to due process, since it&#x27;s not a person.  So basically you have to prove that it <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> involved in a crime.  Which just leads to police officers stealing from poor people who haven&#x27;t been convicted of a crime.')
