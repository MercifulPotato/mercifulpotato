A small system developed by business (one person who had subsequently moved on) using Excel and Word and macros to keep track of information and generate letters to &quot;customers&quot; had become an essential tool, but unsupported and undocumented. When we (IT) recommended redeveloping it in Java with an SQL database (and documentation and testing and backups), they balked at the cost. Partly because the original person did the work &quot;in their spare time&quot;, so the business never saw the actual costs. And partly because there are zero infrastructure costs with Excel and Word. There was very much a feeling that IT massively inflate the costs and will build a Rolls Royce when a Ford will do. It was a house of straw vs house of bricks situation, but they were happy with their straw house, they thought their only problem was that the little pig who built it was no longer there.')
