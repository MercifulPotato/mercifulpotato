One is messing up absentee balloting. They believe that helps them so that they then get maybe a narrow advantage in the Electoral College on Election Day... Joe Biden should not concede under any circumstances because I think this is going to drag out.<p>She clearly meant on Election Day, not even if all the votes are counted.<p>Another flaw in the argument is that the 2016 election was objectively undemocratic and indisputably subject to foreign interference designed to tilt the scales towards Trump. Whether that means 2016 was “stolen” is maybe a matter of perspective (in my view it was illegitimate). But only one of the parties is actually willing to steal a presidential election they clearly lost.')
