But shipping to the UK from outside the EU has always incurred the exact same customs&#x2F;VAT charges. There are no new tariffs being introduced between the EU and the UK either, so none of the costs there change either. Although you will have to ship with specific providers to make the customs declarations go through easily.<p>I’m not sure that the customs changes are significant enough to warrant this reaction, and I suspect most companies on this list are just pausing to make sure they don’t have issues in the short term.<p>The freedom of people movement changes are much more concerning though.')
