I&#x27;ve just done MicroPython and it&#x27;s here\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microbit-foundation&#x2F;micropython-microbit-v2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microbit-foundation&#x2F;micropython-microbit-...</a> ...as the temporary home while we stabilise things before hopefully the port can head upstream.<p>Headsup that the location of CODAL (the underlying layer that supports the micro:bit) is going to move today as part of going private to public so there will be times when that repo doesn&#x27;t build (or at least, docs are out of sync with where the repos are) at some point during the day.<p>The MicroPython build has SoftDevice in it, including a Bluetooth bootloader so you can flash MicroPython programs using the mobile apps (betas being released today, too, see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.microbit.org&#x2F;software&#x2F;beta&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.microbit.org&#x2F;software&#x2F;beta&#x2F;</a>). However, we want to do the BLE API design in the open for how MicroPython will be a GAP Central or GAP Peripheral. Of course, as the code goes upstream it should also be possible to use other BLE stacks and existing MicroPython APIs, but for now our focus is on the classroom environment and getting consistency in experience on MicroPython and BLE flashing&#x2F;update.<p>In the classroom we strongly expect people to continue using micro:bit Radio for user programs because of how easy it is to use and the way it allows micro:bits to communicate with each other.')
