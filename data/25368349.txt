I mean that is a pretty sweeping statement, and I can think of a lot of counter examples.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what proof (or evidence really) would be required. You can observe animal territoriality in the wild, or you can trust animal behaviorists to report on it accurately. They have areas they defend against other members of the same species. Behavior varies widely, solitary species don&#x27;t like any other members of their species (except for sexual partners), social species have different arrangements. Sometimes an elder male will have several females and young that are permitted and when the young get big enough they either leave or fight. Sometimes the males will have a hierarchy and defend the territory against other members of the species who are not part of their group. Sometimes they even make war on another group for their territory. If you let me know what kind of evidence you&#x27;re looking for I might be able to supply it.<p>&gt; Sure but that isn&#x27;t a contradiction to what the OP said. He did not say the state is identical to property rights.<p>He said that state is a formalization of the social construct of property rights. I&#x27;m saying the state is not a formalization of the social construct of property rights, but a social construct of nation and government; and that the two have relation but exist independently of each other.<p>&gt; But you don&#x27;t specify what a right is either. In fact you earlier said it&#x27;s incarnation of territoriality. How can that be a right? I mean maybe a desire, but a desire is very different to a right.<p>Excellent question, thanks for asking. Rights are a social construct that emerges from mutual cooperation, essentially a social technology that allows people to co-exist and pursue their own interests and desires without needing to establish the same agreements with every individual and without generating unnecessary conflict. This is to say that rights are emergent and arise from individuals agreeing to respect each other.<p>Perhaps an example would help: I don&#x27;t like to be the victim of violence. Neither do you. At some point we agree not to do violence to each other. A third person shows up and attacks me to steal my food. You make the rational choice to help me defend myself because if he kills me for my food he may do the same to you. Being that he is outnumbered he stops and we explain &quot;don&#x27;t do violence on people.&quot; He says &quot;you contradicted yourself, you say you&#x27;re against violence but you used violence to stop me.&quot; We say &quot;You&#x27;re correct, it must be the initiation of violence that is bad, and it would be ok to use violence on someone who has used violence on you.&quot; He says &quot;ok that may be the case but you used violence on that gazelle I was trying to take from you.&quot; We eventually conclude that rights are a social arrangement between humans as a result of our preference for cooperation with humans and do not apply to inter-species relations.<p>&gt; you earlier said it&#x27;s incarnation of territoriality. How can that be a right?<p>Property is a human expression of territoriality. Property rights are a social arrangement where people customarily or by agreement avoid violating each other&#x27;s territory. Rights are a social arrangement that allow people to minimize the amount of violence in a community.<p>This is already kind of long but let me know if you have more questions and thank you for the opportunity to discuss these issues.')
