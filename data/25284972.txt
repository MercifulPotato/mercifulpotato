I don&#x27;t remember the asking price, but it was substantial, many thousands of dollars<p>Okay, many thousands of dollars for how big a block of address space? I&#x27;m guessing it was FAR, FAR less than $20 per planet. Because, you know, that&#x27;s how technical projects like this work. The price of address space has been going up over time as development of the project and engagement with the network increases and risk decreases<p>&gt;Yes, the crowdsales priced individual addresses at less than one cent, but it&#x27;s a 64-bit address space, so even at one cent that puts the gross valuation of Urbit at many orders magnitude greater than the gross planetary product since the dawn of human history<p>Oh boy. No, the price I quoted you there was less than one cent per planet, because that&#x27;s the unit that we&#x27;re talking about here. Planets are the 32 bit level of the address space, so that puts the gross valuation at around $40 million<p>Maybe you think that&#x27;s still overvalued; I have no interest in speculating myself. But the point is that you are absolutely wrong about the $20 per planet figure above being a lot less than earlier figures<p>&gt;the addresses are not sold individually but in large blocks, with part of the pitch being that people who get in early can turn around and sell parts of their holdings<p>Which is true of pretty much any digital asset, corporate stock investment, etc. Yes, people investing money early in an experimental software project with explosive growth potential are probably speculating to try and make money down the line. You think this is shocking news to anyone?')
