Crank out a booking website?  Give me a couple weeks.  Deal with your byzantine organization, your incoherent standards, your security department coming out of the woodwork with list of requirements, your torturous system for provisioning government services like VMs in secure data centres... and then pile on that integration with a variety of legacy systems across another slew of organizations that bring all their own baggage to the process.<p>I would blame government, but I&#x27;m simultaneously experiencing all these issues with a Fortune 100 company.  They&#x27;re almost indistinguishable in the degree to which their cumulative organizational headwind is a hurricane I&#x27;m supposed to fly into.
