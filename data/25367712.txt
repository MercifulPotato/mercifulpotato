I mean that is a pretty sweeping statement, and I can think of a lot of counter examples.<p>&gt; &gt; Unless you subscribe to &quot;might makes right&quot;, the idea of property rights is inherently a social construct which the state is a formalization of.<p>&gt; The state is a formalization of a particular social construct that is not identical to property rights.<p>Sure but that isn&#x27;t a contradiction to what the OP said. He did not say the state is identical to property rights.<p>&gt; &gt; Limitations on rights is precisely the foundation of any society.<p>&gt; Do you have any support for this statement? It seems to contradict your earlier assertions and despite that I&#x27;m not sure how it would be true on its own.<p>&gt; &gt; To claim otherwise is just the semantic game of &quot;oh, I don&#x27;t mean those rights&quot;.<p>&gt; Well, I don&#x27;t think its a meaningless semantic argument for people to discuss what specifically is referred to by &quot;rights.&quot; If you think people have a right to steal food out of other people&#x27;s homes then I can see why you would think the government was a necessary limitation on that &quot;right.&quot; But I think its a reasonable response to say &quot;there is no right to steal food from other people&quot; and then we can discuss what is and is not a right, which is much closer to a necessary conversation than a game (when conducted by sincere interlocutors).<p>But you don&#x27;t specify what a right is either. In fact you earlier said it&#x27;s incarnation of territoriality. How can that be a right? I mean maybe a desire, but a desire is very different to a right.')
