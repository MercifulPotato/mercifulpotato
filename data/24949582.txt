Genetically your people are more similar to people from Europe then the &quot;asians&quot; the article refers to. The article uses the word &quot;asian&quot; but technically the article is just referring to people who have certain facial features that are similar to people from China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam... etc. You are asian yes, but in terms of facial features you are in a very separate category than the previous countries I mentioned.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what is the proper term here. I&#x27;ve seen the terms &quot;mongoloid&quot; and &quot;oriental&quot; used to refer to my people but I&#x27;ve also seen things written about how these terms are dated and considered to be insulting. I have found no other word to refer to &quot;asians&quot; the way the article refers to &quot;asians.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s strange that it&#x27;s so hard to find a term here as there is a very clear cut category here. Whatever... it&#x27;s just words.<p>I would respond to your query and say that &quot;mongoloids&quot; have a very different experience with racism in the US than Indian people due to a multitude of factors one of them being that most Indians already know English.<p>Qualitatively speaking, in the software world Indians are easily dominating that arena over &quot;mongoloids&quot; so it&#x27;s a completely different experience.<p>Whatever hardships Indian people are going through would imho warrant a completely separate article to cover that topic.')
