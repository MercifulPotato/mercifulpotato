Sure, building Electron apps is incredibly wasteful and NodeJS&#x27; type system allocates way too much memory for something that C++ would be much more frugal with, but who cares? Hardware is cheap, and processing power is cheap. Computers are becoming a commodity layer that simply facilitates human requirements, rather than being the thing that humans have to understand and optimize for.<p>We&#x27;ve seen the same mind-shift happen for storage: remember the pre-gmail days when Microsoft&#x2F;Yahoo&#x2F;Your internal IT department gave you 2MB of email storage, and you had to optimize your mail archive to fit this constraint? Do we really want humans that are better at optimizing mail archives? Of course not, we want mail storage we don&#x27;t have to think about. And the same is true for computation.')
