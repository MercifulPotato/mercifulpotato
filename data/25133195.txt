I’m not into hardware either, going by engineering side of the event. In the announcement, there some parts shot at the lab&#x2F;studio, where the engineers explain the chip. Ignore the marketing people with their unlabelled graphs, the engineers explain it well.<p>But yes, they’re basically saying because this is “unified memory”, there’s no copying. No RAM copies between systems on the SoC, no copies between RAM and VRAM, etc. because the chips are working together, they put stuff on the RAM in formats they can all understand, and just work off that.')
