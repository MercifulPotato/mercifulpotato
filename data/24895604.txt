It works really well for hole-punching through my stupid Comcast router! And I anticipate it will continue to work really well as I add more devices on my parent&#x27;s, sibings&#x27;, etc networks. It&#x27;s cool to not have to think at all about where my devices are, since they&#x27;re just all directly accessible through their dedicated IP on the wireguard VPN.<p>I also have my phone, laptop, etc all on the wireguard VPN, so I can ssh to anything from anywhere. I also have my laptop open to password-based ssh only from my wireguard VPN, so I can ssh (via termux) into my laptop, which has been extremely convenient in addition to being just plain cool. I can&#x27;t speak highly enough of wireguard!')
