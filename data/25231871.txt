Bikes with throttles can be used to assist in moving, some have a &quot;walk mode&quot; where you hit a button and its like a 5 mph throttle, mine has both, you could use up steps if it made sense.<p>I just have it in a garage and take off and ride whenever no steps, so day to day it&#x27;s effortless. If I want to take it long distance I put it on my bike rack which is a real pain due to having to lift up on, looking at tray racks with ramps going forward.')
