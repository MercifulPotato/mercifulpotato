There&#x27;s a flat rate probability  that each of us has cancer right now, when perfect knowledge of our bodies could answer the question precisely. Each doctor exam we have reduces or increases that probability until we subjectively understand it&#x27;s time to sample a point of the body and know for certain.<p>The local sample is related to the larger system, and the hidden variable (cancer or not). The local sample at the time of capture has a probability of being malignant. We measure directly and back propagate the results to the system.<p>But, unintuitively, there&#x27;s been some famous results that seemingly preclude a deterministic explanation of quantum mechanics.
