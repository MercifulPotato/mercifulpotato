High power is needed when doing stuff like QAM64 over the air.<p>If wifi was louder than it needed to be, you wouldn&#x27;t have to be mere feet away from the router to get maximum speed.<p>Wifi bands are saturated because there&#x27;s so little spectrum for a widely used service. Everyone has multiple wifi transmitter in their house yet there&#x27;s only enough spectrum for three non-overlapping channels.<p>Imagine there was enough spectrum for 30-40 wifi channels. There would be hardly any overlap and everybody would have better range. Maybe 500-1000 feet line of sight.')
