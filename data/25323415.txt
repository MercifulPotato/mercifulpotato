Item(by='pessimizer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607262255, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25323150, text='&gt; He could have legitimately wanted to help Kiss My Keto, which would have strengthened their relationship and potentially led to gains for both parties.<p>Maybe, as a company, it&#x27;s a bad idea to rip people off for $88. Turns out that people who have to fight you for trivial amounts of money aren&#x27;t motivated to either repair the relationship or improve your company. The only people motivated to make a big deal about it are people who can figure out an angle that makes it profitable for them.<p>Is there no difference between good and bad things? Aggressive marketing is annoying, not a moral failure. With some people, exploiting being a victim for personal benefit can be rationalized as worse than victimizing people. It&#x27;s like a killer being angry that a relative of their victim writes books about the crime. &quot;Where&#x27;s my share?&quot;<p>In terms of good and evil:<p>- Kiss My Keto set up an affiliate program. (morally neutral)<p>- Mr. Lynch joins that affiliate program. (morally neutral)<p>- Kiss My Keto has changed that affiliate program to exclude their primary product. (morally neutral)<p>- Kiss My Keto doesn&#x27;t inform its affiliates of that change, or update the information on the website of that change. (morally bad)<p>- Kiss My Keto asks affiliates to share holiday promotion codes in order to &quot;boost earnings,&quot; yet has a policy that refuses to pay referrals who use holiday promotion codes (morally bad)<p>- Kiss My Keto also offers promotion codes in pop-ups to people referred to its site, and if any of these promotion codes are used, they refuse to pay for the referral. They also do not mention this in any material they share with their affiliates (morally bad)<p>- Mr. Lynch notices that Kiss My Keto has effectively created an referral network that doesn&#x27;t pay for referrals, and doesn&#x27;t tell its affiliates that it doesn&#x27;t pay for referrals. (morally neutral)<p>- Mr. Lynch spends weeks in an email exchange being ignored and argued with, until someone at Kiss My Keto notices that they are dealing with a loudmouth, updates their website terms, and starts paying for referrals. (morally neutral)<p>- Mr. Lynch blogs about it, and ties it in to a product that he&#x27;s selling. (morally neutral)<p>What&#x27;s not included:<p>- Mr. Lynch deceitfully fails to blog about the interaction from Kiss My Keto&#x27;s perspective, completely fails to make an effort to preserve the image of Kiss My Keto in that blog, and viciously includes a reference to a different blog (that describes the approach he was taking in this dispute) rather than making up an original framework for dealing with disputes in general. (obviously destroying the world with his evil.)')
