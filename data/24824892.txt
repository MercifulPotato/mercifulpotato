The kind where I’ve gone on a long drive and something has happened, I need help, and I’m    unable to access my phone and pass on my location myself.<p>It’s not a particularly likely scenario but nice to have the backup in case of that or something else I haven’t imagined.<p>I’m considering switching this off, though, because several times they’ve used it to just look up where I am because they’re being nosey. There is always a reason given, but being able to give a reason doesn’t make something legit.<p>This just feels creepy and I’ve pointed this out, yet they keep doing it - and perhaps without my knowledge sometimes too.<p>Now I feel like if I turn it off then it’ll look like I have something to hide, but that’s okay. That feeling is massively outweighed by the desire not to be followed around. My phone provider and probably several government agencies are doing that already. At least they don’t send me messages asking if I’m planning to leave work soon.')
