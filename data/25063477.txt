So technically, you can have Dropbox people looking through your stuff, and you can also have Amazon people looking through your stuff. Obviously, if this ever happens without a good reason, employees that do this can get fired and&#x2F;or sued (and the company itself might also be held liable). Everything is also logged, so there&#x27;s a paper trail. I skimmed over both the T&amp;C and the Privacy Policy and it doesn&#x27;t really seem that Notion breaks from this norm.')
