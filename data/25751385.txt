Item(by='aidenn0', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610476851, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25751234, text='&gt; When we call software “free,” we mean that it respects the users&#x27; essential freedoms: the freedom to run it, to study and change it, and to redistribute copies with or without changes. This is a matter of freedom, not price, so think of “free speech,” not “free beer.”[1]<p>All of these things are allowed by Signal.  Look at what is happening to WhatsApp right now because of damage to its brand.  Moxie thinks that allowing 3rd party clients or federated servers would damage the Signal brand.  If you disagree with him, go ahead and fork it.  There are probably 100s of forks of signal that let you connect to unofficial servers.  If it weren&#x27;t open source that option would not be available to you.  How many forks of the (closed source) official AIM client are there?  Of the server?  In terms of freedom offered by the software Signal is positioned pretty well.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;philosophy&#x2F;open-source-misses-the-point.en.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;philosophy&#x2F;open-source-misses-the-point....</a>')
