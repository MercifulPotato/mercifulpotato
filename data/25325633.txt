Short of a browser knowing what Certificates are allowed for what websites (and the trusted MITM not modifying THAT content) there just isn&#x27;t a simple way to know that your connection is being monitored or modified.<p>Short of quantum encryption, is there any simple way to detect such an attack once the user trusts the MITM&#x27;s CA?')
