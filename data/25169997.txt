They will have to work more hours to meet their basic needs, and the money left over will be used at places available to them -- far from the best the world has to offer.<p>It&#x27;s not something anyone deserves, it&#x27;s a consequence of limited care being prioritized by economy. It&#x27;s a damn shame, but that&#x27;s pretty largely applicable to all facets of living life.<p>Higher quality lifestyle&#x2F;housing&#x2F;food&#x2F;travel, less work hours, less stress, better medical care and opportunities to seek care leads to better health versus someone with none of those advantages.<p>It&#x27;s a well known phenomena across the health spectrum, and it&#x27;s nice that it was quantified and linked in yet another way as it was in the article.')
