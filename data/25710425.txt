For instance if someone believes they must experience a feedback-free Class-A amplifier, well, yes they&#x27;re going to have some thermal drift and poor power supply noise rejection. that can be hard to replicate. ;-)<p>Good mainstream designs take component tolerances into account, and it&#x27;s worth remembering that a 1% variation is a tiny fraction of a dB.')
