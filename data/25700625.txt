The rands slack has a number of virtues:<p>* large, with over 10k members. This lets you see a lot of different perspectives.<p>* because he used to work at slack, it doesn&#x27;t suffer from the &#x27;memory hole&#x27; or other limits of the typical community slack. There&#x27;s a ton of knowledge you can gain just by reading old messages.<p>* curated. No one can just join, everyone has to send an email to him. I don&#x27;t know what kind of vetting happens, but there&#x27;s at least some.<p>* active. Almost too active, it can be overwhelming. But this means that when you post a q, you tend to get some kind of feedback (unlike some other communities I&#x27;ve been in).<p>* clear code of conduct <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;randsleadershipslack&#x2F;documents-and-resources&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;code-of-conduct.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;randsleadershipslack&#x2F;documents-and-resour...</a> I know they have active moderators, not sure I&#x27;ve seen anyone get kicked off, but definitely folks have been scolded (personal experience).<p>* clear purpose: promote tech leadership. Not just for VPs, CTOs, but any kind of tech leadership.<p>That said, haven&#x27;t joined the channel that parent mentioned, but have definitely had some great high level discussions in some of the other channels.<p>Fun fact, anyone can start a channel there. When I was a startup CTO a few years back, I started #startup-cto and now there are 1000+ folks in the channel.')
