The Antirim report was conducted by Russell James Ramsland who is the exact same non-expert person who mixed up Minnesota and Michigan. So, yes it does have something to do with it.<p>2. The report was not ordered by a judge, it was <i>permitted.</i> The distinction matters, because suggesting the judge &#x27;ordered it&#x27; implies that it was some sort of impartial inquiry, instead of just another hack job by someone who wanted Trump to win.<p>3. The surveillance footage and the water pipe events happened on different nights, 17 hours apart.<p>That&#x27;s just purely on the basis of facts that even aren&#x27;t up for argument. There&#x27;s much more to disagree with when further analyzing your claims, and while I&#x27;d be happy to go over them, I don&#x27;t feel like a deep comment on an old news story is the best place for me to spend my time.<p>That your three main points contain full on factual misstatements should give you enough pause to reconsider the certainty of your conclusion.')
