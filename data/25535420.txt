Canada has mandatory arrest policy if the wife or partner makes a domestic abuse allegation. But its bailable under strict conditions. There is no enquiry done by the police about the merits of allegation and always results in arrest on the spot. This sudden arrest traumatises the defendant, destroys his career, finances because the case wont be dropped even if no charges are pressed. The prosecution continues till guilty&#x2F;not guilty. This is a very scary policy and makes men really question the idea of getting married, having kids or even to live with a partner under the same roof.<p>This system is skewed towards women and it has a very low conviction rate too. A waste of tax money. Courts are flooded with DV cases according to StatCan.')
