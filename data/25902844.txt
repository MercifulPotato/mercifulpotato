I&#x27;m quite happy (content even) to wait 2 days, as long as it is actually 2 days, and not 1-5 days depending on the position of the moon.<p>My supermarket offers 4 hour delivery windows that you book about a week in advance, and it&#x27;s perfect (other than the occasional dodgy swap or missing item). I can work with that. But amazon (for example) offers same&#x2F;next day delivery, and I&#x27;d estimate maybe 10% of my orders are late. That doesn&#x27;t work if I&#x27;m relying on them for food')
