I now have more anecdotal data to back up my anecdotal feeling that I don&#x27;t agree with most people on HN on matters such as this.  The highest voted answers are things I feel are overhyped.<p>Harry Potter, Breaking Bad, The Wire, Apple Watch, Ruby on Rails, Hamilton.<p>I&#x27;m not saying these things are <i>bad</i>, but the hype level far exceeds the delivered value, in my opinion.<p>I had to scroll down to things like M1, AMD Zen, and the original iPhone before I felt a sense of agreement.  Perhaps I am overly sensitive to hype, so fewer things can possibly measure up for me.')
