Not the threadripper in your desktop. And in that case maybe the M1 IS for you, since I&#x27;d be willing to bet it outperforms your existing laptop. Assuming I&#x27;ve found the right computer, my existing (non-M1) Macbook Pro is beefier than your Lenovo, and it gets outperformed by the M1 too[1].<p>Just seems pretty disingenuous tbh. The argument that you <i>need</i> a seriously beefy threadripper machine to compile your code because you&#x27;re an 800k LOC C++ developer falls a bit flat when you tell us later that you also compile code on your Lenovo Y700.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;browser.geekbench.com&#x2F;v5&#x2F;cpu&#x2F;compare&#x2F;5150606?baseline=5150675" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;browser.geekbench.com&#x2F;v5&#x2F;cpu&#x2F;compare&#x2F;5150606?baselin...</a>')
