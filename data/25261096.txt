Technology is supposed to make our lives easier. While surveillance may help catch more &quot;bad guys&quot; (clearly something we as a society argue over the definition of) it also causes many a lot of anxiety. One has to question if the added incrimination is worth the cost of anxiety to the public. Personally I do not think this is a good trade because even long before all this surveillance technology I felt safe in society. I believe most people did even in the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s. So has the added surveillance really helped decrease crime? Or is it just correlated? (I&#x27;m not even convinced it is correlated).<p>As for tests, there is an easier solution to all this. Write your test as if it was a take home. Open notes. You can&#x27;t stop people from communicating but often these types of exams&#x2F;assignments it becomes clear who is doing it. In my undergrad all my upper division classes&#x27; exams were take home because &quot;I can&#x27;t test you on anything worthwhile in 2 hours.&quot; Honestly, most of us enjoyed these more. We often did the exams in the same room (we had the back of a building that was dedicated as a lounge to the physics students) and no one really cheated. The closest was &quot;hey, I&#x27;m stuck on this problem and I know you are finished. Can I just use you as a rubber ducky?&quot; (more like just explaining the problem to the person and the other person saying &quot;uh huh&quot; and no more) It also made me feel like an adult because our professors trusted us. As someone that frequently does poorly in a testing environment I was also surprised that I was able to get much higher scores on these tests despite the added complexity. The simple fact that I could &quot;take a break and come back&quot; was all the piece of mind I needed (or grabbing a beer when I felt frustrated). This also better reflected, in my opinion, what solving difficult problems were like in the real world. I could grab my book, go to the page that I know is helpful, sit and think, take of my shoes, pace, whatever. I was treated like an adult and it felt good.')
