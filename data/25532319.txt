My claim was needing to avoid real attack vectors is a good sign the cultural is bad and security is theater about how much it&#x27;s worked on rather than how real risks were discovered, tracked, and approached.<p>I agree this shouldn&#x27;t need to be a &quot;gotcha stunt&quot; though but if this would be to you then yes you&#x27;re doing it&#x2F;communicating it&#x2F;following it up wrong. It should be an awareness call that phishing is going to target you in very thoughtfully real and meaningful ways, not just boring fake tickets&#x2F;issues or the like. If you can&#x27;t find a way to send that message in your org then again I claim your org already has bad culture as it can&#x27;t talk about or examine real security issues and instead has the first reaction to a real risk that you&#x27;re just trying to improve your reporting numbers again.<p>Also a small year end bonus being not only considered exciting but not existing at all is probably the real callousness problem in the org, not that one points out the allure of money is used by malicious actors to get people to click things. But that&#x27;s separate from the whole role of security discussion.')
