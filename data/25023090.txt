It’s Windows in a VM (with all the overhead that entails), showing the rasterized app windows into the Linux desktop window manager and launcher via the remote desktop protocol which is more commonly used for remote machine access. Definitely nice to have that seamless integration, but realistically it’s heavier than WSL. In the readme it says the author is trying to strip out some of the heavier elements of the Windows shell, in which case it could be more lightweight, closer to what WSL2 is doing. But if you wanted to do that, you might be better off using Windows Server Core Edition in the VM.')
