I suspect that more weight is put on the rear and trailer axles than the front as well, and that two tires in close proximity aren&#x27;t as good as two tires separated by greater distance. So even 1000x is probably optimistic.<p>My main point though is just that the study happened to use truck axles as a measurement and that can&#x27;t blindly be substituted for car axles. The back of the napkin math is just there to show the difference it can potentially make.')
