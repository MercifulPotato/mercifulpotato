Only a few CSS properties can be set with it (all related to color). But if there was a way to detect the color difference or timing of the painting that would be a big deal.<p>Possibilities might be with mix-blend-mode, @property, or applying &quot;slow&quot; css properties like a blurry text-shadow dozens of times. I&#x27;ve played around with this a little but haven&#x27;t found a crack yet.')
