I can&#x27;t remember the last time I&#x27;ve used my phone for something that doesn&#x27;t involve data, so I would rather detox temporarily with no phone at all.<p>In case anyone has any suggestions: For a more sustainable long-term detox to avoid extensive screen time, I&#x27;m trying to find a very minimal Android device that can preferably be de-Googled (with Lineage or related Roms) but definitely at least supports a few basic Android applications but isn&#x27;t very comfortable to use for just browsing. It&#x27;s surprisingly difficult to find a small-display Android device these days...')
