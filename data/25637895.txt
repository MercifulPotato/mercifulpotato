But most textbooks aren&#x27;t really designed and written as standalone resources to learn a topic. For example, most don&#x27;t have problems to work through and ways to evaluate how well you learned the material. Certainly there are topics you can learn on your own but in many cases just reading a book isn&#x27;t going to be sufficient.')
