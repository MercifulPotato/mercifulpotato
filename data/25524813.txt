(rinse and repeat).<p>This approach is popular because it makes wonders in a &#x27;near-model&#x27; context (for example in order to develop software or even to build a bridge), but it seems less convincing to me when applied to human beings (especially when some make a living because the problem exists =&gt; they may not really want to solve it).')
