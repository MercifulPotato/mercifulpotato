They weren&#x27;t lied to, they misjudgedâ€”and mainly because of a lack of understanding.<p>Traditionally, acting without understanding but still a high degree of confidence was called hubris.<p>And it appears the institutional traders expressed hubris when they over-leveraged, and this subset of retail investors expressed hubris when they didn&#x27;t properly understand the capabilities and limitations of the app they decided to use to engage with the stock market.<p>I haven&#x27;t seen people on other platforms complain in the same ways. I mean, for instance I haven&#x27;t been restricted on my platform. I haven&#x27;t heard anything about Questrade or E-Trade or anything.<p>To go back to my contrived motor analogies, it looks like a lot of people also expected a lawnmower to compete with a Tercel, never mind a Ferrari.')
