These systems support room-by-room zoning. They&#x27;ll do air conditioning in any climate and can be designed to provide heat in conditions down to 5 to 10 degrees below freezing.<p>If you&#x27;re in a climate that gets colder than that, get either baseboard heaters, or a zoned boiler system, for backup heat for when the heat pumps can&#x27;t keep up during cold weather. Which option makes the most sense will depend on how cold it gets and for how long.')
