Some web dev agencies&#x2F;consulting companies can actually be very nice to work at, for example, since you&#x27;ll often get to work on greenfields projects. Try looking at smaller companies or maybe governmental or non-profit companies.<p>On a coping note: prioritize reducing your stress&#x2F;anxiety in whatever (healthy) you can even if you feel guilty for not getting enough work done. For myself, I&#x27;ve had to do things like force myself to go for a walk every afternoon even if I hadn&#x27;t completed all my tasks for the day yet, shut my computer off at a certain time, visit family over the weekend even if I feel like I need to stay at home and &quot;catch up&quot; on work, etc.')
