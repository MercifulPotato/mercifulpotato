Item(by='seppin', descendants=None, kids=[25600099], score=None, time=1609462682, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25597865, text='&gt; Do you feel the same towards writers being used by the CIA to spread their stories?<p>As per the previous question, it appears you don&#x27;t understand what journalism is. Journalists report stories as objectively as possible, they don&#x27;t play an active and knowing role in foreign intelligence operations. Surely the NYT and WaPo have played roles in furthering propaganda before (Iraq War), but they weren&#x27;t co-conspirators. And it wasn&#x27;t a foreign spy agency feeding them stolen materials to leak for destructive purposes. Big difference(s).<p>IF Wikileaks actually were journalists, they&#x27;d have a hell of a story to write about how their bipolar manic founder had been coopted by an autocratic intelligence agency to do their bidding, throwing away years of good work to actually expose the bad behavior of criminal governments.<p>I&#x27;d read that story.<p>&gt; As things stand, Snowden would not receive a fair trial, as Assange is not.<p>Yeah that&#x27;s not what he said. He said Snowden would face the full wrath of the US Gov (true) but that he&#x27;s been able to protect others (in the last year even) that had the same pressures. The idea that Snowden &quot;had no choice&quot; is a ridiculous myth believed only by those who see him as a hero first (as part of their general world view), then figure out the facts of the matter later on.')
