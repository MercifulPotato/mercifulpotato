I only set this up a couple of days ago. :-)<p>However, I don&#x27;t think it will ever be available to &quot;average&quot; people (those who spin up a free WP theme that know little to nothing about web design) mainly because many of them will have very little inclination to learn this stuff.<p>I do have <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mylight.website" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mylight.website</a> which takes people through creating a fairly good looking, lightweight site from start to finish. I intend to spend some time sprucing it up soon though, then I will likely integrate the two sites somehow.<p>WRT WordPress, my personal website is WordPress and comes in at ~350KB (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kevq.uk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kevq.uk</a>) so just because something is running WordPress, doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t be lightweight.')
