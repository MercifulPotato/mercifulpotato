Objective doesn&#x27;t mean Crockford wrote a book about it or &quot;lots of people agree with me&quot;.<p>Objective means factual. You&#x27;re putting the word &quot;objective&quot; in front of your own and others opinions to arrogate the credibility of objectivity onto statements that are not based in observation of material reality.<p>More people holding an opinion doesn&#x27;t make it a fact. &quot;Terribleness&quot; or &quot;justifiableness&quot; are not matters of fact, they are both matters of opinion.<p>Do you understand? You keep repeating your opinion and then using the word &quot;objective&quot; to claim that your opinion is fact. You think I am disagreeing with your opinion, rather I am disagreeing with you stating your opinion is a fact. No matter how many people agree with you it will never be a fact, it will always be an opinion because &quot;terribleness&quot; is not a matter of fact! &quot;Terribleness&quot; is the result of a value judgement.<p>There are no such things as &quot;objective conclusions&quot;, objectivity is not a manner of reasoning. You&#x27;re looking for something more like &quot;observations&quot;, &quot;measurements&quot;, hard facts.. none of which apply to &quot;terribleness&quot; because it can&#x27;t be materially observed--only judged.<p>&quot;Objectively&quot; isn&#x27;t an intensifier unless used in the form &quot;Objectively [something that isn&#x27;t objective].&quot; Why would actual facts need to be intensified? What kind of insane argument would anyone have where facts and opinions are compared directly?<p>I know it sounds stronger to say your opinions are facts but it is okay to have opinions. Just remember that the difference between opinions and facts is a difference of kind rather than a difference of degree. You can argue an opinion, you can attempt to persuade me to your way of thinking if you show your reasoning.')
