Keep your identity small. “I’m not the kind of person who does things like that” is not an explanation, it’s a trap. It prevents nerds from working out and men from dancing.<p>This is one I&#x27;ve been trying to emphasize with a few friends for a while. The act of labeling yourself is the act of restricting yourself to what you think fits that label.
