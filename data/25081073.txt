That way, passive listeners are foiled, and only active MITM would be able to see which certificates you&#x27;re checking.  It&#x27;s better than HTTP plaintext, which is how it works now.<p>Most of the bulk surveillance, pattern-of-life IC stuff is passive, not active.<p>Ultimately, though, I should be able to opt out of app&#x2F;binary signing (and associated certificate checking) entirely if I so desire, ideally with a preference setting, or at least with Little Snitch.  It looks like I&#x27;m going to have to compromise platform security overall to disable it, or use external network filtering hardware.')
