This doesn&#x27;t mean it makes you feel &#x27;depressed&#x27;, but rather that it dulls some sensations, which can include anxiety (it may also cause mood swings that reverse this affect).. so yeah when it wears off, that anxiety or other thoughts&#x2F;feelings that it helped avoid may come back even stronger.')
