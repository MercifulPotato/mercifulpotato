I want to be able to write a loop and see a timeline of all the steps, arranged like these video concepts. Certainly for teaching children—the 11-year-olds I taught at Girls Who Code pre-COVID would absolutely benefit from something like this—and possibly even for my own use when debugging certain types of problems, depending on the editor&#x27;s robustness.<p>This article was written eight years ago, and every year since, it has been dutifully posted to Hacker News, where we all stare in wonder at the concept... and yet nothing like this exists yet?<p>&quot;Why has no one else done a ton of work (that I&#x27;m also not planning to do)?&quot; is never a great question, so I don&#x27;t want to be too flippant... but seriously, it would be an <i>excellent</i> project, either for someone stuck at home in lock down, or possibly even as the basis for some sort of coding education startup.')
