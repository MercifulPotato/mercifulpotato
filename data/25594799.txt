This whole thread is about <i>hardware</i>, not OTA software updates or a timeframe to deliver FSD. They&#x27;ve repeatedly claimed since 2016 that all Teslas have necessary hardware for Level 5 functionality. I&#x27;ve explained in this comment chain why that claim is disingenuous.<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;10&#x2F;19&#x2F;13340938&#x2F;tesla-autopilot-update-model-3-elon-musk-update" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;10&#x2F;19&#x2F;13340938&#x2F;tesla-autopilot...</a> and repeated Elon Musk tweets.')
