It&#x27;s the logical conclusion of a huge social experiment to see how much political benefit you can wring from an industrial lie machine.<p>And it&#x27;s working far better than anyone on the left was expecting it to.<p>The downside is that the US now has a huge voter demographic that is literally disconnected from reality. These are the people who scream that Covid isn&#x27;t real - because something something George Soros and Bill Gates - while they&#x27;re in hospital dying of it.<p>This doesn&#x27;t end well. You can&#x27;t push a large percentage of your population into delusion without some very destructive consequences. Even if it does mean you keep your Senate seat.')
