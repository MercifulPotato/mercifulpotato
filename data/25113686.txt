Like banning the NYPost after they fabricated a ridiculous story how Hunter Biden flew across the country to give his laptop to a computer repair guy who &#x27;found&#x27; all this data. As MSNBC says, NYPost is a conspiracy theory peddling tabloid.<p>Though I do agree Twitter hasn&#x27;t done enough to remove the hate and misinformation.<p>Sure, Twitter did ban lots of people who were defending that racist maga hat kid. The Native American man he was taunting explained what happened very well. His explanation that the boys surrounded him and threatened him is so typical of MAGA people. I also agree that anyone who threatened to kill the maga hit kid shouldn&#x27;t be punished.<p>Banning the people who called Jussie Smollet a hoax, after he was attacked by Trump voters. That was justice.<p>I also agree with all the transphobes who have been banned. They should never be allowed to use the wrong pronoun, or use a deadname, or for that matter just say things like women have 2 X chromesomes. All these abusive people have no place on Twitter.')
