If my home owning neighbor with a yard wants to park a truck in their yard I really don&#x27;t care, and I abhor any organization that punishes someone for that. They could have a perfectly good reason to park it there. I&#x27;ve had former neighbors yell at me for fixing my car in my own driveway which makes no sense whatsoever except perhaps to privileged elitists with no DIY skills.')
