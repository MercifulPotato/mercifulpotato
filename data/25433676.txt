But as an example, imagine you&#x27;re sitting home alone deciding what to eat for dinner. I  have quite a verbose thought process where I almost pose questions and answer them to myself, like &quot;Pizza? Naah, I had it yesterday, and it&#x27;s quite fattening, I haven&#x27;t worked out all week, I should get a sallad instead&quot;.<p>That was totally impossible to do. I could speak those things out aloud, but I couldn&#x27;t really do them inside my head. If someone asked me a question, I couldn&#x27;t prepare an answer in my mind before speaking. And those existentially depressing places my thoguths sometimes goes to were also not accessible.<p>I expressed it to those around me as &quot;I can&#x27;t think&quot;, which was obviously not completely true, but I think I was so focused&#x2F;grounded in the pretty overwhelming experience that my mind couldn&#x27;t really waste CPU cycles on wandering or evaluating what the best answer was to a question.')
