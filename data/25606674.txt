The processor is an AMD Elan SC520, which is a 133 MHz AM5x86 core and about on par with a 75 MHz Pentium. Sadly the memory is not expandable.<p>Getting a buildroot based system to work was fairly easy starting with &quot;make tinyconfig&quot; for the kernel. IDE was a real hangup because there really isn&#x27;t an IDE controller, it&#x27;s a legacy IDE interface with no DMA. Disk IO is abysmally slow. Found that libata has experimental support for legacy IDE, rather than use the old IDE drivers. So I&#x27;ve managed to not select any deprecated kernel options.<p>Booting a current Gentoo stage3 with networking was a major challenge though. Still haven&#x27;t managed to get IPv6 and all of the standard netfilter modules before the kernel hangs mysteriously between finishing self extract and producing any logs.<p>I also haven&#x27;t managed to get ZONE_DMA support working for legacy DMA on ISA (for the PC&#x2F;104 bus) without it using too much of the remaining DMA&#x27;able memory to load the Intel 82559 ethernet driver (e100.ko).<p>It&#x27;s rather hilarious seeing a 5.10 Linux kernel complaining that it can&#x27;t find a 256 KiB contiguous region of physical ram.<p>Buildroot boots in a matter of seconds on it, Gentoo takes a few minutes.')
