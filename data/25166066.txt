I guess you could even open the bottomless barell of a discussion about racism, but my point is just this:<p>Seeing &quot;them&quot; as &quot;behind&quot; is a bad way to think about it and prevents true understanding.<p>Family staffed restaurants which revenues are 90% regulars remake their website and the agency slabs a 4MB hero image on their &quot;landing page&quot;. They of course don&#x27;t need any of that. Only clicks the website gets are people checking the opening times or showing their friends how grass-roots it is. To literally quote the article &quot;Once a precedent has been set for things looking or behaving a certain way then everybody follows it, regardless of whether there is a better solution.&quot;<p>Consider the memes about the weird distorted discolored vector graphics <i>everything</i> tech now has [0].
