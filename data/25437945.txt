If they do not explain it well they either A. Do not understand it well themselves, or B. Do not want you to understand it.<p>Also be wary of big promises up front. No one can actually promise XX% increase or XXX more leads without having advertised your specific product before. They might be able to provide a general estimate based on past experiences, but that is it.<p>Best of luck.')
