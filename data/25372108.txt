This post is very much giving off the vibe of being a personal project but judging from their website[0] it&#x27;s a Chinese company that&#x27;s behind it.<p>Besides, the claim on their help center page that<p>&gt; SharpAI DevKit is the world&#x27;s first video camera that can run machine learning models and perform inference on devices<p>is not true at all. There are countless other companies offering similar products. (Which I&#x27;m not going to spell out here because I don&#x27;t think technology as dangerous as surveillance AI deserves advertizing.)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;translate.google.com&#x2F;translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fsharpai.github.io%2F" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;translate.google.com&#x2F;translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u...</a>')
