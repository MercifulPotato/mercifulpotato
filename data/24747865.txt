Make it so it&#x27;s easier to produce pairs across 27,000 light years than to do what it&#x27;s doing now. No violation. Just stop a spinning coin that&#x27;s been growing at the discrete speed.<p>Envelope the earth, our stellar system, in a matter wave for greater precision. Grow and extend our influence to all.<p>Now! That&#x27;s a worthy ambition! To demote these lofty and mystic objects of the cosmos as just another data point, a commodity on the workbench. Machining and forging with the orbits of Mars and Saturn, a noble engineering pursuit indeed.')
