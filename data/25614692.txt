Like QMK[1] -- develop in Visual Studio, compile in WSL, flash in QMK Toolbox (Windows). Or in some very specific corner cases, have a Linux-based workflow that suddenly calls into a Win32 utility.<p>In some cases I need to test something that&#x27;s Linux-only -- an idea or a GitHub project that just doesn&#x27;t run on Windows -- and it&#x27;s easier to jump into a WSL console than boot a VM. But on the other hand, I don&#x27;t do that frequently enough to just keep a VM running all the time. (Plus there&#x27;s VM idle RAM usage, and I can&#x27;t use Hyper-V [which can reduce VM RAM] due to host performance concerns)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;qmk&#x2F;qmk_firmware" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;qmk&#x2F;qmk_firmware</a>')
