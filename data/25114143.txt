Hodges is activism. You should read the 5-4 decision yourself and decide whether or not you think it is.<p>My personal opinion is that I don&#x27;t care whether others think it&#x27;s (liberal) activism.<p>My beef is that Alito is also engaging in (conservative) activism but claiming he is not by hiding behind originalism.  I won&#x27;t belabor this point further because I&#x27;ve already cited a source that makes the argument better than I can.<p>Disclosure: I want our government to use every tool at its disposal to make the world a better place. Of course the constitution should be interpreted in line with modern values in order to extend rights and protections to people. The declaration:<p>&quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&quot;<p>The preamble:<p>&quot;We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.&quot;<p>Those are our stated shared values. Those align with my values. Not allowing gay people to marry is contrary to those values.<p>That five judges found a constitutional justification to extend the right of marriage to all, I&#x27;m glad for. If people want to call that &quot;activism&quot; so be it. Now, Alito still wants to take that right away. Indeed, he wants to be able to express that view and not be called a bigot for it. I find it deplorable to try to hide that view behind a legal theory called originalism.<p>Any originalist argument against &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; could equally be applied to &quot;Loving v. Virginia.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scotusblog.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;05&#x2F;constitutional-interpretation-and-loving-v-virginia&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scotusblog.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;05&#x2F;constitutional-interpreta...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ahousedividedapd.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;originalism-and-the-loving-problem&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ahousedividedapd.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;originalism-and-the-...</a><p>For a counter-argument (with which I don&#x27;t agree):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digitalcommons.law.byu.edu&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;viewcontent.cgi?article=2684&amp;context=lawreview" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digitalcommons.law.byu.edu&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;viewcontent.cgi?artic...</a>')
