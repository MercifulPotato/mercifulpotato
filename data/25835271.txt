Item(by='freeflight', descendants=None, kids=[25835661], score=None, time=1611074645, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25835069, text='<i>&gt; Android lets you choose which contacts app to use</i><p>How many people actually go trough the trouble of getting a third party contacts app?<p><i>&gt; does not require you to log into any accounts at all to use the phone</i><p>That still doesn&#x27;t stop Google from processing the data that people enter. Just like the fact that even without logging into an Google account there&#x27;s a ton of unique identifies to track just baked into phone hardware alone.<p><i>&gt; You seem to be transferring what you know about iOS to Android when that does not transfer at all.</i><p>I&#x27;m not &quot;transferring&quot; anything, nor did anything similar happen in the 10+ years I&#x27;ve been using iOS phones.<p>None of my iPhones contact apps ever pulled account details from other Apple services to populate the phone contact with. Yet on my friends Android phone all he had to do was enter my phone number and the same e-mail address I used to register a <i>YouTube</i> account, and Google matched and linked those two together to populate the contact with my YouTube profile picture.<p>Which means that somewhere in the massive Google database these two identifiers will now be linked, even tho I specifically went out of my way not to give Google my mobile number.')
