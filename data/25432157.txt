Item(by='philh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608051695, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25430881, text='&gt; It&#x27;s simple, at least in theory: Don&#x27;t go along with decisions you disagree with until you&#x27;ve voiced your concerns and they have been addressed.<p>Depending how I read &quot;go along&quot;, &quot;disagree&quot; and &quot;addressed&quot;, I think this either doesn&#x27;t help or is unrealistic.<p>Like... suppose I say &quot;this plan will run into scaling issues at some point&quot; and the other person can say &quot;that&#x27;s true, but we don&#x27;t know if we&#x27;ll get enough usage for that to be a problem and in the meantime it lets us iterate quickly&quot;. I agree with this, but I still think we should go with the more robust thing up-front. How do I proceed?<p>I could say that I&#x27;m not going to work on that plan until I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s the best plan. But if everyone followed this advice, approximately nothing would ever get done. If you have a team implementing a feature or product, it&#x27;s important that everyone is working in the same direction even if they don&#x27;t all think it&#x27;s the best direction to go. It&#x27;s not realistic to expect unanimous agreement on what the best direction is, even if everyone sits down to discuss it calmly and sensibly for a few hours.<p>Or I could say that my concerns have been addressed, and I go ahead and work on this plan. But why this plan, and not the plan that I prefer? There&#x27;s a risk that we just go with the plan proposed first, or by the person who&#x27;s most stubborn about liking theirs, or drawn at random from a hat. That seems bad too.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a good way to proceed where I don&#x27;t at least try to answer: which of us is more likely to have a good plan? And if I assume I&#x27;m below average when I&#x27;m not, I&#x27;m more likely to get the wrong answer to that question, and then bad decisions are more likely to get made.<p>&gt; Having valid concerns is orthogonal to whether someone is above or below average.<p>The things that make me a better dev than I used to be, and a better dev than most people just starting out, certainly aren&#x27;t orthogonal to my ability to have valid concerns and not-have invalid ones.<p>If you simply mean that above-average people can have invalid concerns, and below-average people can have valid ones, then I agree but I don&#x27;t know why you bring it up. I don&#x27;t think I suggested otherwise.')
