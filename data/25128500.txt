What benefit do you actually get from that?<p>I could.  Its just a docker image and a $15 usb stick, so... The benefit is as per the linked article the hardware (and software?) doesn&#x27;t scale beyond 100 devices or so, and I&#x27;ll never have more than 100 devices in one room...<p>My house only has a couple dozen zwave things so I&#x27;m not bumping up against the scalability limits as seem in the linked article so I&#x27;m all good.<p>Strange room idea:  Since I have presence detection I could redirect incoming connections from my phone to the current room LOL.  &quot;Microsegmentation&quot; also makes some strange possibilities for security.')
