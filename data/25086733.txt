That&#x27;s almost like saying the US government is keeping a dozen carriers because it&#x27;s scared of Russia (or China).<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but the US actually is scared of Russia and China and it&#x27;s whole point in having a large Navy with carriers and such is to counter them. Those two countries are the only adversarial countries to have any meaningful naval presence, so there really wouldn&#x27;t be any treason to maintain such a large carrier fleet unless they were scared of them.')
