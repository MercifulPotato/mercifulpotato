It feels nice to have a clean discussion like this.<p>I used to write a lot on paper but the convenience of using a digital tool makes sense to my workflow, personally and professionally.<p>When I write on paper, it is usually a huge brain dump. And it tends to get messy. However, I learned to be more organized when I used a tool like Notion. I know in which workspace I&#x27;m keeping my thoughts and in which workspace I do work. If ever I need to link a certain thought together, I can simply connect the docs using the linking feature.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to do so on pen and paper. And I agree, paper notebook is great :)')
