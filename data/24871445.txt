There is a proliferation of mediocre music in such abundance no one would ever be able to listen to it all. Sure it&#x27;ll lead to eventual gems as skills increase but will we ever find them in the mountainous waves of creation being churned out in increasing amounts? As far as coding should developers produce more and more code for the public as a learning tool for themselves or wait and develop adequate skills that don&#x27;t require extra work to fix later?')
