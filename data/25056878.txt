Anyone who has held Pfizer stock for a while must have at least considered if this news was the moment to cash some of it in.<p>When he made the decision to sell he&#x27;d have known the trial results would have been coming in, but couldn&#x27;t have known what they&#x27;d be.  If they&#x27;d just come back with a &quot;no go&quot; the stock would have tanked. If anything it seems like an unfair disadvantage, every other long term investor in Pfizer can decide on the day of the announcement what to do, the CEO has to bet months in advance.')
