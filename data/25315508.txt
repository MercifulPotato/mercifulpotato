What about pre-processing? What about feature selection?<p>There are <i>a lot</i> of examples of linear regressions where, for example, you can reverse the sign of the correlation by picking some features rather than others.<p>Assigning meanings to features of your model is something that requires extreme care and deep understanding of both the model and your dataset.')
