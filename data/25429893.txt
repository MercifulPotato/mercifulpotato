The fan on my MacBook has had a tendency to spin like crazy and it&#x27;s been quite unresponsive at times for it&#x27;s spec and age. When this post came out, I went for it and deleted it all and it&#x27;s been acting surprisingly more responsive. Doing a conference-call used to kick of the fan after about a minute or so, the fan doesn&#x27;t make a sound at all now. I&#x27;ve put in an order for an M1, but I think dropping Chrome (Canary in my case) could have been a worthwhile solution.<p>To add to my suspicion.\nA month or so ago, I was running Big Sur beta and was asked to give a system service from Google, admin access and restart. That in turn broke my Mac, so I had to spend hours to get back up and running. Why does the service require admin-access? Why did it require me to restart my computer?')
