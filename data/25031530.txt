It&#x27;ll be what, maybe 90 days before those &quot;law enforcement keys&quot; are public?<p>1b - If it&#x27;s already backdoored then there is no need for such an act, the problem is already solved.<p>2 - It&#x27;s ineffective for it&#x27;s stated goal because the stated goal is not the real goal. The goal is to enable a continued abuse of power, one which is already ongoing, and one which produces no actionable results or meaningful outcomes. Five eyes &amp; co is upset that they&#x27;re losing some of their toys.<p>3 - Who says governments should be able to regulate weapons? Likewise these days, who is to say they meaningfully can?<p>4 - Sex trafficking existed prior to encryption. The government failed to stop it then. I strongly suspect that even if the government gets it&#x27;s way and breaks encryption, sex trafficking will continue exactly at the same rate. Most sex traffickers are not technology ept, nor do they need to be - the track record for capturing them is atrocious. Epstein anyone?<p>This is a bad faith argument. &quot;Protecting children&quot; and &quot;stopping terrorists&quot; are the siren&#x27;s song of every government overreach basically since the dawn of time and yet the government remains terrible at solving either problem. I don&#x27;t think encryption is really the issue preventing those things from getting resolved. I do think encryption is very inconvenient for a very snoop heavy government.')
