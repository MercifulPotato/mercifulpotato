There are plenty of studies showing Mediterranean diets improving gut bacteria diversity and also people on it tending to be more likely to have better sleep, so I think it might be more to do with the gut bacteria that than the specific ‘anti-inflammatory’ properties of foods (which probably aren’t much of an issue unless you are specifically trying to help manage something like an existing autoimmune disease).<p>A book I just read (Fast Asleep by Michael Mosely) recommended that kind of diet, but said apparently some studies showed that being even a bit overweight can reduce or even eliminate the improvement, so that is one thing to tackle first if that’s an issue. Other ones were a big emphasis on managing stress, and suggestion to try intermittent fasting (even just limiting all eating to 12 hours apparently can help, but some people limit all food to 8 hours and then fast for 16).<p>Trying to ensure that you get a bit of outdoor light exposure, and as early as possible is apparently good too, and I think it’s helping me. I just wake up and sit by the window for 20 minutes.<p>I’m also interested in trying doing a 72 hour fast (just drinking plenty of water taking a bit of electrolyte supplement) three or four times a year which apparently is good for gut bacteria, immune moderation etc. but people should have a chat to a doctor about doing it safely. I’m specifically interested in autoimmune disease because I have psoriatic arthritis, which is almost 100% managed by immunosuppressant but I’m interested in seeing if I can reduce my dose (working with the rheumatologist, not by myself!) but I’ve always been terrible at sleep and am trying to improve that as well (since that can help manage my condition too).')
