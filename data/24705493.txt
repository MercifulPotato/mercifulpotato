There&#x27;s a setting that allow you to start search when you type text.<p>For instance on this page if you type &quot;look ma&quot; it searches the text, and selects the first occurence, which is the link. You can then press enter and it will open the link. Or ctrl+enter to open in a new tab.<p>I use it everyday, it&#x27;s easy and convenient, you don&#x27;t need to think much ; you simply start typing the some letters of the link you want to open.')
