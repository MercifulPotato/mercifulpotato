No amount of protest or agitation among these groups is going to alter the outcome of the 2020 election. The main harm they&#x27;re doing is to the reputation of the Republican party itself. The notion that there is any possibility of overturning the election is counterfactual. Legitimate avenues of disputing the election have been explored and exhausted. Biden is already working with a transition team. All important institutions like the military, judiciary, and others recognize Biden as the 46th President.<p>I agree, we need to take these events seriously. And the ones talking about a coup <i>aren&#x27;t</i> taking them seriously. The staggeringly high rate of belief in a fraudulent election, and agitators like the ones we&#x27;re seeing today are <i>very</i> serious indicators in their own right. Resorting to embellishment and hyperbole ultimately diminishes is not being serious.')
