Item(by='pwdisswordfish0', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602857412, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24800327, text='&gt; The proliferation and commoditization of F&#x2F;OSS is what made SaaS business thrive[...] after decades of personal computing striving to liberate users from mainframes.<p>That&#x27;s because of developers&#x27; (read: devops folk) own narrow focus of open source.  When someone talks about open source having won, they&#x27;re referring to how their company has three dozen services published on GitHub that can somehow be strung together to approximate 60% of what their company is actually putting in people&#x27;s hands at the end of the day.  That&#x27;s open source for you.<p>Stallman and his acolytes had it right all along about focusing on free software as a philosophy meant to empower <i>users</i> and not career programmers (who already generally make more than the average household...).  It doesn&#x27;t matter if a smattering of SaaSsy services are open source if (a) it&#x27;s mired in the sort of headaches that are par for the course in devops today with respect to actually being able to run the thing, and (b) the app that real, actually people are jabbing with their fingers and literally touching is still proprietary.<p>So it&#x27;s not a problem of too much open source; it&#x27;s a problem of not enough, and a problem of eschewing with the user-focused underpinnings of free software along the way, to instead follow the career devopser&#x27;s AWS&#x2F;GitHub&#x2F;whatever-powered path while advertising it as win.  To borrow liberally from Alan Kay, the computing revolution hasn&#x27;t been wonâ€”because it has not yet even happened.')
