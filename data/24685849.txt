In reality people in power have more than sufficient means to intimidate you and bring you trouble.<p>&gt;&gt;the onus is on the company to go to court and do this. And this gets rejected. because indian courts have rejected non-competes as a matter of policy.<p>That is if you decide to stay put despite all this for years and fight it out. Also note I myself pointed out most companies won&#x27;t bother with this. Because they often have bigger fish to fry.<p>&gt;&gt;I would suggest you recheck the ground reality.<p>Would give you the same advice. In fact just try walking into the city civil court in Bangalore and see for yourself how it works there. Many times the advocate has to plan the exact statements to speak, write them down on paper and quickly spit them out in front of the Judge, because there is no time. The Judge himself is generally swamped and has to listen to dozens of cooked property litigation cases everyday. Your case will go sandwiched some where in between, and it will keep accumulating dates and legal fees until you give up. Long before that your will power will run out.<p>If you are an individual wanting to fight a company that&#x27;s taking you to court for non-compete stuff the company lawyer will show up do the routine. You have to take leave from your job and deal with all these court hassles. Might as well for your own sanity give up.<p>Look man I get it, you are trying to sell India in a predominantly US forum. But seriously, none of what you are saying works. In fact not even remotely close.')
