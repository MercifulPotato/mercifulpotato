Our plan is to create something that users control - don&#x27;t contact me unless it&#x27;s above this title, or above this $, or includes these technologies. Or, simply don&#x27;t contact me at all.<p>From our research, devs aren&#x27;t looking for another LinkedIn spam machine, so we&#x27;re going to build something better than that. Our thought is that if we do that well, and we update users&#x27; resumes for them each year, then it will work out well. If we do that poorly, then we can&#x27;t update users&#x27; resumes annually, and it won&#x27;t work.<p>But it is free, no hidden cost, no hidden spam. And if we aren&#x27;t adding value to your career, then it&#x27;s easy for you to simply opt out permanently.')
