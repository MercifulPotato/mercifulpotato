These were both typically scanned to fill a 4:3 screen, meaning the Amiga&#x27;s resolution had slightly tall pixels (DeluxePaint actually had an option to compensate for this when using round brushes and the circle tool, called &quot;square pixels&quot;). So artwork transferred from an Amiga to a PC would look slightly squished.')
