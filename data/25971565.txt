Item(by='cxr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612031559, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25957758, text='&gt; there is an 8 year time gap between the release of 7 and XP<p>Which is why the metaphor is off.  Safari+WebKit and Chrome+Blink are being developed in parallel and competing with one another.  They&#x27;re not two releases in the same product line where one is the dead forebear and the other a successor.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s not terribly pedantic to insist that Windows 7 is, in fact, built on top of Vista and not XP<p>What?  That wasn&#x27;t the topic.  None of this is relevant.<p>The topic is which engine Chrome is using.  Explaining that Chrome doesn&#x27;t use WebKit isn&#x27;t pedantic.  However, when someone does explain it, for someone else to appear and point out that the engine it uses is <i>forked</i> from WebKit—a nugget of information that changes nothing about the discussion—<i>is</i> pedantic.<p>I think you&#x27;re responding at this point for the pleasure of feeling like you&#x27;re having a conversation, or you&#x27;re still misinformed about which browsers use which engines.  WebKit is not Blink, and Chromium is using the latter, not the former.  That&#x27;s the whole point of this entire digression.')
