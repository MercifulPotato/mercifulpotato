The first officer did not say anything regarding the alarm and told the captain that the aircraft should turn at 1.5 miles according to the distance measuring equipment. The older and more experienced flight engineer did call out &quot;bank&quot; four times in 19 seconds, but the captain ignored his warnings, continued to ignore the chiming alarm, made no verbal response, and actually continued to increase the left bank angle. At 18:38, 55 seconds after take-off, Flight 8509&#x27;s left wing dragged along the ground, then the aircraft plunged into the ground at a speed of between 250 and 300 knots, in a 40° pitch down and 90° left bank attitude. The aircraft exploded on impact.<p>ouch')
