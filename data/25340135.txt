It&#x27;s not an outage, my internet isn&#x27;t <i>out</i>, it&#x27;s intermittently <i>wrong</i>. The phone support agents aren&#x27;t prepared for this, and I can&#x27;t find any way to escalate or speak to a network engineer.<p>I feel like if I spoke to the right engineer, there&#x27;d be a ticket on this and they&#x27;d roll at truck to their facilities or the IPX within an hour. It&#x27;s a major network issue to flip bits, it&#x27;s costing them bandwidth with retransmits and could be breaking SLAs with their business customers.<p>On the phone the most they could do was roll a truck to me.')
