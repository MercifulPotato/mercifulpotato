Item(by='qayxc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610476106, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25745973, text='&gt; The intelligence needed to carry out your described outcomes is more or less AGI already<p>Yes! And that&#x27;s exactly the point at which AI safety comes into play. Nobody is afraid a of a dumb NN that generates texts or images given an input or a classifier. That&#x27;s not what the paper is concerned with, either.<p>&gt; Further, if you want to optimize stamp collection, you don&#x27;t tell a model what it can&#x27;t do, you tell it what it can do.<p>Again, the example is not concerned with a dumb computation graph. The example is about an AGI with access to the physical world, like robots that need to interact with their environment.<p>The idea of superintelligence even being possible without this interaction (the paper uses &quot;current state of the world as input&quot; to express this) cannot be justified.<p>AI safety is geared toward machines that are capable of manipulating their environment, be that directly (i.e. using physical manipulators) or indirectly (e.g. by controlling external inputs and outputs, communicating with humans and other machines, etc.).<p>If you need a very tangible example that is currently being developed and not at all in realm of sci-fy, look to Japan. The Japanese government recently started an initiative to develop autonomous machines to help caring for their aging population.<p>Such automated caretakers cannot be programmed in a traditional way and are likely to be trained using (unsupervised) reinforcement learning in both virtual and physical environments.<p>Seeing how optimisers love to cheat and game the system in unexpected ways, guaranteeing safety is a real concern in this area and not decades away either. Your average Rumba might be a harmless toy, add an arm and the ability to use an oven to it, and we&#x27;re talking about a serious accident waiting to happen if we&#x27;re not careful...')
