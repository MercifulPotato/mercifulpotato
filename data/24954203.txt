Powerful but confusing arrays&#x2F;dictionaries. Inconsistently named stdlib functions with inconsistent parameters. Little to no support for threading or concurrency models outside of making event loops or running multiple processes. Memory management that allowed for leaky memory all the time. Lack of proper support for stand-alone daemon processes (you could make it work but it was clearly not the main way PHP was meant to be run). Lack of namespaces or modules with all variables being global.<p>This was PHP 5 and it sent me running for the hills (Python, ES6). I am sure PHP 8 is an improvement and I’ve worked with PHP versions past 5.3 but it left such a bad taste in my mouth that yes I will avoid it if I can. Fixing what shouldn’t have been broken may make this language almost as good as something like Python but why would I reach for PHP when better things exist unless that decision is not made by me?')
