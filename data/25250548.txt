Item(by='wwweston', descendants=None, kids=[25250753], score=None, time=1606708206, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25250337, text='&gt; Except courts do not determine truth<p>Courts <i>definitely</i> rule on matters of fact. Or truth. The fact that they also have a responsibility to apply the law once matters of fact are established doesn&#x27;t exclude the fact-related portion of their focus and responsibility. Where known true evidence is dismissed, it&#x27;s usually to protect defendants against violations of due process or other important rights.<p>If your point is that courts have limits in their ability to bring truth to light and apply it... sure. <i>Every</i> human being and every institution has such limits. If your point is that courts have failed catastrophically in some cases and improvement in how they&#x27;re conducted or how prosecutiorial incentives are placed or examining other aspects of the system would be worthwhile, I heartily agree.<p>But if your point is that courts are useless when it comes to arbitration of the truth, then you&#x27;re not on any particular road to truth. Social arbitration of truth is necessary for society. There have to be <i>some</i> institutions trying to do that work, whatever shortcomings they have.<p>Courts are one particular model for such institutions. There may be others but most institutions are going to converge on similar functions (though potentially distributed across different roles with different incentives).')
