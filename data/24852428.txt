Cognition requires different, specialized, energy-efficient tools.<p>&gt; consciousness<p>All talk about this is premature and &quot;pre-science&quot;, before we figure out more basic, fundamental things like object storage and recall from memory, object recognition from sensory input,  concept representation and formation, the exact mechanism of &quot;chunking&quot; [1], &quot;translational invariance&quot; [2], generalization along concept hierarchy and different scales, representation of causal structures, proximity search and heuristics, innate coordinate system, innate &quot;grammar&quot;.<p>Even having a working, biologically-plausible model of navigation in 3d spaces by mice,  without spending a ton of energy training the model, would be a good first step. In fact there is evidence that navigational capacity [3] is the basis of more abstract forms of thinking.<p>On all of these things we have decades worth of research and widely published, fundamental, Nobel-winning discoveries which are almost completely ignored by the AI field stuck in its comfort zone. Saying &quot;we have no idea&quot; is just being lazy.<p>Edit: As for OP&#x27;s actual paper I think something like complex-valued RL  [4] might bypass his main claims entirely. But my point is that RL itself is a dead end, trivializing the problem at hand.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chunking_(psychology)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chunking_(psychology)</a><p>[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.moreisdifferent.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;09&#x2F;hinton-whats-wrong-with-CNNs" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.moreisdifferent.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;09&#x2F;hinton-whats-wrong-wi...</a><p>[3] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scholarpedia.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;Grid_cells" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scholarpedia.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;Grid_cells</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.google.com&#x2F;scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=%22complex-valued+reinforcement+learning%22&amp;btnG=" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.google.com&#x2F;scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=%22c...</a>')
