Less high-frequency current in the serial line means less radiation and less interfering current induced on wires inside the monitor.<p>Wouldnâ€™t that be to detriment of signal integrity on receiving end of the serial line? Is it so that only higher harmonics are affected, which is okay?<p>Why did I hear putting ferrite on USB cable will improve signal integrity? Is that nonsense?')
