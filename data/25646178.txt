She opened it up and we were unable to add the Bluetooth device no matter what we did. It was the most frustrating experience I had in months (I am a macOS and Linux user). Later I discovered that there is an entire different Bluetooth managing app on Windows. One had the old school look, the other had some modern oversized bullshit look. Turns out one of those two worked, the other didn&#x27;t. Windows search returned the non working one first. In the taskbar was a Bluetooth icon to the other one. WTAF?<p>Honestly, fuck Windows for being such an utter pile of shit.<p>They don&#x27;t need a UI re-design. They need a fucking working operating system.')
