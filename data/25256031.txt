Perhaps you misread a very long and confusing sentence?<p>Background, Neural networks have two modes 1) training - where you learn all the model weights and 2) inference - where you run the model once on new data. Training takes takes a long time, because you&#x27;re computing derivatives to implement updates rules on millions or billions of parameters based on iteratively examining massive datasets. Inference is extremely fast because you&#x27;re just running matrix multiplies of those parameters on new data. And TPUs&#x2F;GPUs are specially designed to compute matrix multiplies.<p>The article said: &quot;We trained this system [...] over a few weeks.&quot; I searched for, but did not see them identify the inference time. I do expect inference time to be well under one second, though I&#x27;m not personally experienced with running inference on this type of network architecture.<p>For comparison, GPT-3 and AlphaStar have month long training times and real-time (sub-second) inference times.')
