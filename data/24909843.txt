In many cases the performance hit may not be relevant or noticeable. I know this because I&#x27;ve been very productively using the following approach to build dynamic webapps for my personal use:<p>1. Compose HTML strings using Javascript, especially with string interpolation<p>2. Slap the resulting strings into div&#x2F;span elements with innerHTML= statements.<p>This approach results in extremely clean and simple code - much cleaner than the OP&#x27;s code in my view. I have never noticed any kind of performance issues, the updates are always instantaneous. I don&#x27;t know what the author means by breaking functionality like text selection and focus, but it&#x27;s never been relevant for me.<p>For an example of the coding style, see the reDispActiveTable in this code, which draws a table of TODO list items with some operations like edit&#x2F;delete&#x2F;mark complete. \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;comperical&#x2F;WebWidgets&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;minitask&#x2F;widget.jsp#L296" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;comperical&#x2F;WebWidgets&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;m...</a>')
