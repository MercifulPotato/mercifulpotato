Local networks are still going to see the MAC address (randomization means they can&#x27;t track you specifically across different WiFi networks, but they still know it&#x27;s an Apple device). VPNs aren&#x27;t perfect so an attacker is almost certainly going to see enough from DNS queries, HTTP user agents, TLS SNI headers, etc. to detect the OS in the times where the VPN isn&#x27;t active. Traffic analysis is also likely to be leaky at this level, too â€” if you see a big download around the time that Mac&#x2F;iOS updates come out that&#x27;s pretty indicative even if you can&#x27;t see the traffic.')
