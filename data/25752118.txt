I was surprised the media coverage didn&#x27;t really cover those much, it chose to focus on like the single instance of a car lit on fire at 3am and those very minor instances, sometimes the media photoshopped images too, where they&#x27;d like superimpose a person holding a weapon in front of the photo of the car on fire and things like that. And I mean all media, left-wing, right-wing, small media, big media, like they all did this, which I was very surprised about.<p>I felt pretty safe for the most part, when people weren&#x27;t protesting I&#x27;d still go and have coffee and order croissant at my favourite places in the area that was &quot;occupied&quot;.<p>Things got scary when &quot;anti-protester&quot; started showing up, and suddenly everyone felt like people would show up with guns so protesters felt they needed guns too, and then there was this weird tension of like why we all have guns?<p>I was really surprised personally at the intensity of the police response, especially in the beginning, and to me it felt like the police really escalated tensions early on which is what led to protesters starting to bring fireworks and umbrellas to protect themselves from police &quot;croud control&quot;. Like if a single person in the croud threw a single bottle that was enough for the police to just start pepper spraying and tear gazing everyone. I always wondered why the police doesn&#x27;t just go after that person that threw a bottle or broke a window, I&#x27;m not sure what justified all this collateral damage from them. There were kids and moms and even handicapped people at a lot of those protests.<p>Most striking is the way the police organises around protesters, even though the protests are peaceful, they flank the croud, and really position themselves like the police and protesters are about to have a Braveheart style face off. I don&#x27;t understand why the police doesn&#x27;t spread themselves through the croud and instead help keep the protest peaceful by deterring the few people who are there to cause raucous. They should focus on the people disrupting the protests, help protect others from them, and arrest those.<p>I was just really surprised by that, because if there was a parade, the police would do what I&#x27;m describing, but for a protest it seems they treat the protesters like a huge threat and that makes the whole thing really tense and makes people feel like the police is actually against them. It didn&#x27;t help that the protesters were there to protest police brutality and they were welcomed by more police brutality and confrontation.<p>What I really want people to focus on here is this fact, I&#x27;m from Montreal, where we take Hockey seriously, and when the team Wins or Loses at the final, police cars are lit on fire, windows are smashed, while people celebrate the victory to the street or morn the loss of our hockey team!<p>Now in Seattle, you had 60000!! Yes I said Sixty Thousand!!! PEOPLE marching an entire day completely peacefully without a single broken window or fire: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seattletimes.com&#x2F;seattle-news&#x2F;thousands-march-in-seattle-in-silence-to-show-support-of-black-lives&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seattletimes.com&#x2F;seattle-news&#x2F;thousands-march-in...</a> when the population of the whole city is 600000. That means 1 in 10 people participated in this protest, and there were not even minor raucous! That&#x27;s the most peaceful assembly of such a large number of people I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life.<p>In Montreal, you have 1k people in the street it doesn&#x27;t matter why and there&#x27;s more raucous then that.<p>And these protests, they didn&#x27;t just happen once, day over day thousands of people over and over again, and everytime only a handful of incidents, mostly in the late evening or at night. Just do the math, 60k people, if 100 of them broke windows, threw rocks and lit some things on fire that would be 0.16% of the protestors. It be enough for the media to have footage ad-nauseam and publish 100 article about the &quot;riots&quot; and for police to bring out the tear gas. But it also means that 99.84% of the protestors were peaceful. Honestly, if it was for me, I think I&#x27;d call these the most peaceful protest I&#x27;ve ever seen, I think they should be given an award for how peaceful these were given the amount of people and the circumstances of how tense the topic was and how they were received by the authorities.<p>Disclosure: I&#x27;m just a bystander here, I didn&#x27;t participate in the protests myself, I only observed and watched from the sidelines, and I knew people who did and heard from them. So take my info for what it is.')
