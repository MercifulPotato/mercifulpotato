The competition at the time was MS-DOS 4 or 5, windows 2 (and 3.0) were still a toy — and they had compatibility problems.<p>BeOS had no chance to be evaluated on its own merits because by that time Microsoft had already applied anticompetitive and illegal leverage on PC vendors - for which they were convicted and paid a hefty fine (which was likely a calculated and very successful investment, all things considered).<p>The Amiga wasn’t even expensive for what it gave: it was significantly cheaper than a PC or Mac with comparable performance, and even had decently fast PC emulation and ran Mac software faster than the Mac.<p>It did not have a cheap “entry level” model, though, which was one big problem. The other (not unrelated) problem was incredible incompetence among Commodore management.')
