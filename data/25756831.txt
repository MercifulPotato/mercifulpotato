Europe is caught pants-down. They are realizing how weak they are in tech and scrambling to fix it. The facts:<p>- None of the 20 most valuable companies in the world are European. Most are US or China based, and many are tech.<p>- A tiny number of successful startups are European. I think their biggest in the last 20 years is Spotify...<p>- This is a sad showing for a continent with a $20t GDP and 500 million citizens (EU + UK).<p>- Software is eating the world. This was a lukewarm take when pmarca wrote that famous essay a decade ago, now you could almost restate it past-tense.<p>Europe is simply not participating in that process meaningfully. Sure, there have been vast shifts in many aspects of life--Europeans spend just as much time on their iPhones as we do, on Twitter, no FB, on Insta, on Gmail. But they neither invented nor control the development of any of those things.<p>So yes, European world leaders are belatedly realizing that a guy in SF with a footlong beard could ban them from Twitter at will. But that is the tip of the iceberg. They have developed deep dependency on US tech in all kinds of ways. If GSuite or O365 went down tomorrow, how many EU governments would be able to get any work done?<p>This situation mirrors the (more extensively discussed) military situation. Europe has complacently decided that the US can manage it for them, and are now experiencing a rude awakening.')
