Item(by='lionkor', descendants=None, kids=[25313963], score=None, time=1607168067, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25304595, text='zero index makes sense because (and i will use C syntax here)<p>a[b]<p>is equivalent to<p>*(a + b)<p>with a being a pointer and b an integer. this can be seen as well in the fact that<p>a[b]<p>is equivalent to<p>b[a]<p>where in both cases a is a pointer and b is an integer.<p>Thus, the index into an array is fundamentally the same as an offset into that array. Usually, in languages that do use 1-based indexing (like in pascal strings), the 0th byte is used for something else.<p>The point being that thinking in terms of 1-based indices means that you have to use a system where addr+0 is invalid, and the first element of an array at address X is X+1.<p>Now you could just shift everything by 1 and just declare that +1 means +0, but then you lose all meaning to the offset vs index and ahhhhhh')
