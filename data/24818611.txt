The vast majority of users are also using it via their web client, meaning that Google can put arbitrary JavaScript on the page to record which links are being clicked on. They already have most of the metadata that they <i>could</i> scrape from a rewritten URL, since you&#x27;re already on their property. It&#x27;s possible that I&#x27;m missing something, but it feels like it&#x27;s a lot of effort for information that Google already possesses.')
