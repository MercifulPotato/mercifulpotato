I&#x27;m especially proud of the Print layout that lets you print well-formatted map-driven adventures straight to PDF.<p>This is a start on some ideas I have around AI-based content generation for tabletop RPGs. The idea is to let the AI generate content you can drop into your own adventures. Or it might stay just a simple map-maker, I already have a laundry list of features to add like tokens and decoration types. Feedback, bugs, and suggestions are always welcome.')
