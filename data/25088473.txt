The concept doesn&#x27;t work out.<p>The shuttle did have a military requirement: the air force wanted to be able to launch into an orbit over the south pole, then up across Russia from the south, to return and land after that single orbit. That pretty much forced the use of wings that could glide, vs capsule style re-entry, and opened the path to most of the shuttle&#x27;s design flaws.<p>As for why the air force wanted this, the presumption is surveillance, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve ever officially answered, other than denying that they ever considered a bomber mission for the shuttle.')
