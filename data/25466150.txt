With the amount of activism now happening in the western world, it&#x27;s amazing that it&#x27;s not against China or other abusers of human rights. No, it&#x27;s usually against your own country which is multiples better to live in than somewhere like China from an oppression point of view, yet it&#x27;s taken decades to even get it into the conversation.\nIt&#x27;s literally taken concentration camps of muslims for even a mild interest to take place in big media organisations about whether China is a decent place or not.<p>And I&#x27;m not saying they should cover it. They&#x27;re free to do what they want. But claiming to be activists against tyranny and oppression while ignoring china is very hypocritical.<p>Where are the calls for boycotts? Where are the kneeling sportsman? Where are the protests?')
