That&#x27;s in 80h so far in the game.<p>Everyone&#x27;s experience is different, but don&#x27;t say people don&#x27;t pay attention. If they break the immersion for you, just stay away from the game for a while. It was the exact same situation with The Witcher 3, took a good 6 months for it to get good.<p>But they are still supporting that game after what, 5 years? I&#x27;m absolutely sure they will with this aswell.')
