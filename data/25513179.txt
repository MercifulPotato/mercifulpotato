I have significantly better-quality Zoom calls if I use the front-facing camera on my phone.  But that&#x27;s cumbersome to use, so I generally put up with the bad quality from my laptop.<p>A better-quality camera for my laptop would turn my Zoom quality from &quot;garbage&quot; to &quot;satisfactory&quot;.  Yes, if I wanted to go from there to &quot;movie quality&quot; I&#x27;d have to invest in better lighting and other things, but that&#x27;s not important enough to me to go to that bother.  A better-quality camera (built into my laptop; I don&#x27;t want to have yet another peripheral with yet another cable) would be something I&#x27;d happily pay for.')
