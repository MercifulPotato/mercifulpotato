Reading them, it&#x27;s easy not only to recognize that he had wrong predictions, but even that he didn&#x27;t have a good enough idea about the world of his time. Interestingly enough, in spite of that, some of his observation and conclusions based on them, when they were correct as far as his myopic view reached, can be indeed lucid.<p>Still, I&#x27;m very sure that he&#x27;s not at all unique, neither in his time nor in our current. Most of us are myopic as soon as we start to write about the &quot;big&quot; topics, and even more when our political biases are to be present. In many decades, whatever we saw wrong will be much more obvious.')
