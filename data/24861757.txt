Are there flame retardant PETG? Are they any better than just printing with normal filament and spraying flame retardant on it?<p>I&#x27;ve been hesitant to use lithium batteries in home robotics projects, but I can&#x27;t find charging and power mux boards for NiMH, so that has been a huge blocker in making robots that charge and operate at the same time.<p>Also I wonder if it is possible to put mini pressurized CO2 balls inside the battery enclosure such that if a fire happens they explode and release CO2, putting out the fire?')
