Current economics paradigms are severely limited in scope by focussing only on &quot;excludable goods&quot; and may have little interesting to teach us about other forms of value preservation (e.g. protect nature&#x27;s resources  as 1st class citizens, not as externalities), value exchange (e.g. FOSS and open content).
