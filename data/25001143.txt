But programming skills are needed everywhere nowadays and there is a lack of good software developers,&quot;<p>This is an important distinction and often missed from programming language discussions.<p>Engineering languages like C++, Java, Rust focus on being able to create robust APIs, handle incredible complexity, deal with dependencies, etc. Hacker languages like Python, PHP, erlang, and Go focus on an approachable language, libraries that tackle problem domains, etc.<p>There is obviously a lot of overlap. But I think it&#x27;s good to keep in mind that engineering and hacking don&#x27;t always align.')
