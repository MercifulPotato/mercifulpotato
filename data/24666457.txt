When we&#x27;re allowed to do motivated reasoning with enough uncertainty, we can usually prove whatever we want, and that sort of simple utilitarianism ends up being too easy to abuse. I think we can look at cultural taboos as a practical solution to this problem: &quot;Ok, clearly there&#x27;s no reliable way for us to say what killing is good and what killing is bad, and we all agree that most of it is bad, so let&#x27;s make the simplifying assumption that all killing is bad.&quot;')
