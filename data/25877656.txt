The holidays generally fall on different days. Why not say &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; on Dec 25 and say &quot;Happy Hannukah&quot; on the appropriate date(s), etc.? That would be more inclusive without appearing to snub anyone, and it would be interesting to hear about holidays you might not otherwise be aware of.')
