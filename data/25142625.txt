If her addiction was painting, and she had meltdowns from not finding her brush, or fighting with mom because she can&#x27;t stay up late, her mom might have the same reaction.<p>The author obviously wanted to allow for a balance but it quickly grew out of control to the point where the only thing that mattered was her phone.
