There are lots of ways to design a manipulateable currency. That would make it less attractive to the people who want a gold standard, but as I said, I&#x27;m skeptical about that. While <i>a</i> crypto is like gold, <i>all the cryptos</i> are like the Zimbwean dollars.<p>Maybe Bitcoin will sweep those away eventually, but for the moment, the imbalance between BTC and the other cryptos makes me wary.')
