Just bored on a day off. I am passionate about Covid related topics because I am frankly concerned by the rhetoric around Covid. It boggles my mind that this has become so politicized and opposition is equated with homicidal disregard for human life.<p>There is also so much sensationalism around Covid that it&#x27;s impossible to actually discuss. Mask compliance for example. I&#x27;ve heard so many times that if only dumbfuck America would mask up we&#x27;d be sitting pretty. Except the US has some oh the highest mask compliance of western nations. People talk about anti-lockdown protests as being pawns for the far right and hating science, yet these protests are not unique to the US or the Right.<p>Essentially our response to a pandemic has devolved into people shouting memes at one another while 30 million unemployed are liking up at food banks. It&#x27;s fucking crazy')
