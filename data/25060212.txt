A terse one-liner is all it takes to compute something like &quot;what&#x27;s the correlation between number of children and home size for people over 45 who live in counties with income variance at the 90th percentile weighted by population&quot;.<p>Not that pandas&#x2F;scipy&#x2F;numpy don&#x27;t make an admirable job. You can do something like this, but it&#x27;s nowhere near as ergonomic as it is R. At the end of the day, R is fundamentally a language for data exploration, whereas with python those facilities are bolted on top of a general purpose environment.')
