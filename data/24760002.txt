If it’s valid Python, it’s valid Cython. Cython supports the full range of Exceptions and Python stack traces, and you can annotate on a per-function basis whether you want this in Cython.<p>Managing Cython implementations as separate extension modules is a feature, not a bug - it separates concerns and allows only spending any effort on type system constructs in the small amount of cases where those optimizations will help you.<p>Cython is extremely easy to compile and standard Python packaging tools work easily with it out of the box, conda included.')
