Item(by='iKevinShah', descendants=None, kids=[25502841], score=None, time=1608610014, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25502403, text='I am not the original commentor but would like to address :<p>&gt; &gt; It is an absolute disgrace how it&#x27;s become normal\n&gt; Why?<p>I have seen where almost ALL discussions lead to judgement based on politics and that takes away from the core discussion point. What is the point of having separate subs then?<p>For example take this link (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;soccer&#x2F;comments&#x2F;khlnyz&#x2F;ronaldinho_on_twitter_dear_friends_my_mother_is&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;soccer&#x2F;comments&#x2F;khlnyz&#x2F;ronaldinho_o...</a>), this was the top post on the subreddit when I saw it last night, the top-most comment is not about well wishes for his mother OR about how he thought about Covid OR whether or not he denied covid but rather the fact that he is &quot;right-wing&quot;. Now I understand how bad it is but that is not the point of the sub. And that has become the norm , at least on reddit, which if not a disgrace, at least leaves a bad taste.<p>I&#x27;ve seen people take time to go through your profile and dig out one comment and then label you, just one. That feels like a disgrace.')
