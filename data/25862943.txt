The premises from the discussion (as I recall):<p>- Art museums have more than 10x the number of pieces in their archives as they do on display. Some of this art will <i>never</i> be seen by the pubic.<p>- When art galleries charge admission, patrons feel the need to &quot;get their money&#x27;s worth&quot; so they rush to see as much of the exhibits as possible, without taking time to thoroughly enjoy anything.<p>- The purpose of art is to be enjoyed. The above two points make this goal much harder.<p>The conclusions:<p>- Museums should be free admission and funded by selling pieces from the archive (really interesting discussion on how this is taboo for curators)<p>The second-order effects:<p>- Patrons can sit and enjoy a very small section of the museum instead of rushing through, since they can simply come back for more later<p>- More people get to see fine art<p>- Second- and third-tier museums start to gain access to better art, since they can simply buy it instead of waiting for estate donations (which go to larger museums)<p>I think it&#x27;s worth a listen.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.econtalk.org&#x2F;michael-ohare-on-art-museums&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.econtalk.org&#x2F;michael-ohare-on-art-museums&#x2F;</a>')
