Apparently the graphics are just broken beyond repair with the frame rate dropping below 15 on a lot of scenes in PS4 which is just insane;m, and which I simply doubt that any post-release patch is going to be able to fix at all. It is simply crazy that they released unplayable games at this state for those platforms.<p>Also bear in mind that this is the PS4 version that’s being pulled. Maybe that’s where your confusion came from. The proper PS5 edition is not released yet. The PS5 runs this PS4 version somehow fine... But that’s definitely not how it’s supposed to work in the first place.')
