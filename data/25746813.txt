Item(by='louthy', descendants=None, kids=[25749381], score=None, time=1610459450, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25746050, text='&gt; Violent insurrection is how the republic that governs the people who operate Twitter was started, there can be good parts of it<p>So you&#x27;re comparing the insurrection that happened last week, in a mature, functioning democracy to the overthrow of rule-from-afar by a king?  Are you sure that a violent insurrection in America, today, could be a good thing?  An insurrection is usually to replace the embedded status quo.  What should democracy be replaced with that&#x27;s better?  Do you believe totalitarianism&#x2F;fascism is really a better system?  Because that appears to be Trump&#x27;s preferred system of government.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t trust that Trump incited the violence<p>He staged a rally called the &quot;Save America March&quot; with a speech loaded with violent imagery and threats to &quot;weak republicans&quot; with phrases like &quot;We have someone in there who should not be in there and our country will be destroyed and we&#x27;re not going to stand for that&quot; with repeated phrases like &quot;fight like hell&quot;, giving the impression that there were similar marches around the country, etc. etc.  all carefully crafted to make it seem like today was the day that, if the mob didn&#x27;t do something about it, they would lose democracy itself.  Making it appear that the election was still ongoing, putting it in the present tense, and that in 1 hour&#x27;s time, it would all be over.  He even laid out plans for what he would do in office going forward, like a State of the Union speech.  It was all timed to finish 45 minutes before the electoral college votes were due to be counted.<p>This was after Guiliani had called for &quot;trial by combat&quot;.<p>If you haven&#x27;t seen the full transcript of his speech, I would encourage you to dig it out.  The incitement is absolutely plain as day.  It&#x27;s textbook propaganda and was designed to rile up the crowd to believe they, the &quot;real Americans&quot; (like Hitler&#x27;s &quot;real Germans&quot;), could stop what he was decrying as a fraudulent election.<p>I get it that if you&#x27;re a Trump fan or a Republican, you may be willing to give more of a benefit of the doubt.  But to a non-partisan (I&#x27;m not American, but deeply concerned by what I can see from my part of the world) it&#x27;s plain as day.')
