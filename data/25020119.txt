Germany spends quite a lot on foreign aid, which &#x27;could&#x27; be understood as a risk preventing defense spending.<p>I was skeptical, so I looked it up. You are correctâ€”Germany does spend a large percentage of its GNI on foreign aid [0]. However, as you put it &#x27;could.&#x27; Ultimately you are comparing apples and oranges. Defense spending is different from foreign aid spending, although they may be related. So, this is not a strong argument IMHO.<p>&gt; 1. The 2% target is a non-binding guideline.<p>Not fulfilling a non-binding obligation is also not a strong argument. It&#x27;s a non-binding obligation for me to to wash my hands at home after touching raw chicken. It would still be irresponsible of me not to.<p>&gt; 2. Germany has (for some time) a plan in place to increase the defense budget to meet the 2% target. It will increase on a year-by-year basis.<p>IMHO this is your strongest argument, but the fact that the level is not there yet after so many years of NATO, leaves the policy rightly open to criticism.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_development_aid_country_donors#:~:text=Net%20official%20development%20assistance%20by%20donor%20%20,%20%20%20%2025%20more%20rows%20" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_development_aid_countr...</a>')
