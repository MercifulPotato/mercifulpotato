But getting that same model from 70% to 75% accuracy might be deeply mathematical and require the latest and greatest mathmeticians, statisticians.<p>But in this hypothetical example, an engineer who stands up the 70% model and keeps it running 99.9% of the time, with high uptime; is more valuable to the bottom line of the business than the 75% accuracy model hacked together with scripts with 50% uptime.')
