Item(by='cableshaft', descendants=None, kids=[25479618], score=None, time=1608399091, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25478995, text='I doubt it went on sale without fully passing the console manufacturer&#x27;s certification process.<p>As someone who has gone through the certification process a few times with these companies, they&#x27;re not really testing &#x27;does your game have bugs that kind of suck for the player&#x27;, it&#x27;s more technical, like &#x27;do the names of controller buttons match our provided excel sheet that tells you what they need to say&#x27; and &#x27;did we catch it crashing at certain spots&#x27; and &#x27;did the game have periods when it looked like it crashed because there&#x27;s no animation for X seconds but it&#x27;s really just loading something and you didn&#x27;t include a loading animation&#x27; or &#x27;can i leave the game on pause for 24 hours and it hasn&#x27;t crashed during that time&#x27;, stuff like that. I don&#x27;t think they try to &#x27;beat the game&#x27; or anything either.<p>And it&#x27;s usually a standard checklist that can apply to every game.<p>So something can pass certification but still be a buggy mess in spots, like have objects fall through the ground and stuff, or have crappy jaggy graphics with big dips in framerates like the PS4 and Xbox One versions of this game had.<p>Although it&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve gone through the process, so I may not be remembering everything (they are pretty long checklists). Also when we got rejected it was usually just a few small things that we had fixed in a few days (but it took much longer to get queued up to go back through the process, that&#x27;s what took so long for us). But we also made much smaller games.<p>Well, I say that, but we did have a game that completely passed certification but the multiplayer networking ended up being super laggy on release and we got dinged pretty hard for that in reviews. The system had a multiplayer test zone where you could simulate low latency, but while we never had problems when testing, it didn&#x27;t fully emulate what the production environment would be (or at least it didn&#x27;t seem to for us). We weren&#x27;t the only game that had that issue either, some high profile games had the same problem on that system and required a patch to fix it.')
