I&#x27;d love for this to take off but so far I have not seen anything that convinced me that it will. I have a proof-of-concept of &#x27;life&#x27; in clockless form, which was quite a bit of a headache, and since life is theoretically Turing complete that generalizes to the possibility of making clockless computers at scale. The one nasty little detail is that the computer implemented on the life substrate would have a clock simulated in life...<p>Pretty hard to get around that limitation.')
