Every sentence should begin with a capital letter. Many sentences in the post do not.<p>2. No explanation of buffer overflows is complete without an explanation of undefined behaviour in the C and C++ languages.<p>3. The colour scheme used gives somewhat low contrast to the text. It would also boost readability to use a dark-on-light style rather than light-on-dark, but I think it would be enough to just improve the contrast. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s unreadable or anything, but I think it could be improved.<p>4. It&#x27;s annoying to have to horizontally scroll to read the code. I suggest tweaking the second code example so the comment gets its own line and no scroll-bar appears.<p>5. You say <i>and these are just some of the basic mitigation used in 2020.</i> This is true, but you&#x27;ve missed the big one: modern languages include runtime checks. Might also be worth mentioning that with formal verification frameworks, it&#x27;s possible to definitively prove the absence of out-of-bounds array accesses.<p>6. It would be worth explaining the one-past-the-end rule in the C and C++ languages [0] and how these languages consider it an error (i.e. undefined behaviour) to even <i>point to</i> anything beyond that, whether or not you actually dereference the pointer. [0][1]<p>7. I have to agree with brudgers and jiveturkey that the article is a bit perfunctory. It&#x27;s quite a deep topic.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;988220&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;988220&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;41667789&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;41667789&#x2F;</a>')
