The Wayland protocol is much more restrictive than X&#x27;s -- things like screen capture and window managers don&#x27;t work because the APIs they need aren&#x27;t present. Conversely, there are X APIs for everything a Wayland application is able to do, so a Wayland-app-in-X shim would probably work a lot better.<p>The outermost layer, where you run the X session inside a Wayland compositor, would probably work alright too because it just needs to send pixels to the screen and accept mouse&#x2F;keyboard input. Wayland is able to do both of those things!')
