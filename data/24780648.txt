They still have that data last I checked, but it&#x27;s very much hidden in the account settings and they&#x27;ve long since deprecated user reviews. They now say &quot;98% match.&quot; Match to what? We pretty much use a single user account across two households; what is that statistic referring to?<p>Nowadays, I never find anything I want on Netflix and am glad I&#x27;m borrowing an account, otherwise I&#x27;d drop it. Hulu&#x27;s trying to catch up, but Netflix is easily the most user-hostile media interface I&#x27;ve ever used, and that includes hotel channel guides.')
