Why, too much weight on health care sector already due to COVID-19.<p>Up till age 12 or so, parents are legally responsible for their children. So if you&#x27;re 11 and use a catapult to destroy gnomes in a garden, your parents are liable.<p>I&#x27;m concerned about my children for a different reason. We&#x27;re both nerds. We got nothing with fireworks and all that. I&#x27;m worried my children will be outcasts and get bullied, just like we both were. Additionally, for our boy I am worried about staying on the right path. Statistics show men are more likely to commit crime than women. Furthermore, women achieve better education than men, nowadays. To put it bluntly: I don&#x27;t want my son to become alt-right white trash. I believe all of these concerns being normal for parents, and of all time. Being concerned or worried about your children is normal, as long as its reasonable. Its of all ages, except that women achieve better education than men; that is actually a relatively recent change.')
