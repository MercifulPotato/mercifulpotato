Arguably it&#x27;s one of the largest social networks too. But for most video creators, YouTube is the only option to reach an audience. Bear in mind, even big movie and TV studios who operate their own video streaming platforms... where do the trailers all get posted? YouTube, where people can find them.<p>As someone who&#x27;s not used Google services since 2016... it&#x27;s still the one Google property I can&#x27;t really escape, because nobody is posting their content anywhere else.')
