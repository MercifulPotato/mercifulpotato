For some reason, sometimes they fire when you don&#x27;t want them to fire.<p>Incidentally I had this very problem when using Mac Os on a Macbook 2015 and I couldn&#x27;t do much about it. When I started using linux on said Macbook at least I could disable ACPI signals.<p>The first thing I do in any linux laptop I own is disable all ACPI signals and setup a script to do so at every boot.\nThen you just need to have a DE to suspend after X amount of inactivity (often the default) and you&#x27;re set.<p>Sure, you won&#x27;t turn off&#x2F;on your laptop by closing the lid, but it should work fine, turning on &#x2F; off with power button.')
