Every question has a dozen or more responses and almost none of them have anything useful to say. Absolutely awful.<p>I suspect the reason the quality of the community support for Linux is so much better is that the community is smaller, self-selecting, and generally more knowledgeable versus the majority of the Windows community. Up until recently it required a certain commitment to run Linux on the desktop and that still bleeds through.<p>Normally when I buy a new computer I just get a Macbook Pro but, with Apple seeming a bit off the rails, and working from home making a desktop machine more viable again, I&#x27;m thinking about building my own machine. I&#x27;m also seriously considering Linux because Windows 10, I&#x27;m afraid, drives me to distraction most days (I have to use it for work unfortunately).<p><i>[0] The StackExchange sites aren&#x27;t quite as bad, but the other forums are absolutely grim.</i>')
