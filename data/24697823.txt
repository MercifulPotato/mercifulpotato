Item(by='dredmorbius', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601993640, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24696790, text='Agreed that you learn much about a work (I&#x27;ve retyped a few articles and books simply to get a usable copy).  But <i>copying</i> is not the same as <i>creating</i> --- you&#x27;ll see the finished product, and may intuit hints as to how it was created, but what you&#x27;re <i>not</i> getting is <i>the creation process itself</i>:  research (especially for nonfiction), structure, plotting and character (for fiction), editing, rewriting, restructuring and reordering content, additions and deletions.<p>Writing (and reading) short disconnected bits is fairly easy:  nothing interrelates strongly, composition is simple and forgiving.  Longer works are <i>complex</i>:  they have structure, arcs, need to retain interest, jumps and connections need to be plausible, the whole be consistent (unless inconsistency is used for effect), etc., etc.<p>And you don&#x27;t get this knowledge <i>simply</i> by copying out great works.<p>I see a similar failure-to-grasp in some proposals for hypertext or advanced publishing systems.  <i>Reading is inherently serial</i>, in that we follow lines of text on a page.  Interactivity --- usually defined by the ability to skip between previously-written segments --- just offers <i>more serial paths</i>.<p>The value of hypertext and related tools may be far more on the <i>writing</i> process, where vastly more sources can be referenced and cited with greater ease. Some might be incorporated into the final work, but an excess of interconnections and quotations is itself distracting.<p>I see this as a particular blindness of Ted Nelson&#x27;s Xanadu project, despite many fascinating and original elements to it.')
