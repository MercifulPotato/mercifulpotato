They think we can create a system where all forms of &quot;bad&quot; speech are stopped. But the problem with that is you end up having to define &quot;bad&quot;. My definition of &quot;patriotic speech&quot; might be your definition of &quot;mean speech&quot;, so unless you appoint power-wielding dictators to make the final decision, the only solution is to just say everyone is free. Once you allow dictators they&#x27;ll always become corrupt and self-interested.<p>The left thinks they&#x27;re in a war against evil and meanies, but really the only opponent they&#x27;re fighting is freedom itself.')
