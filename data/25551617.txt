Personally, while I did get addicted to it I never actually <i>enjoyed</i> playing it and was all too eager to put it away forever as soon as I launched my first damned rocket [0].<p>Players who get way into Factorio see that as <i>the beginning</i> of the game, some 40hrs after starting in my case. If the idea of playing essentially a 40hr tutorial doesn&#x27;t make you want to run away then Factorio might be for you.<p>I prefer Dwarf Fortress if I want to make large swaths of time disappear, personally... though I haven&#x27;t played that in many years come to think of it. I guess as I approach 40 and my awareness of my own mortality increases I care less for making time disappear.<p>[0] I think pushing robotics much earlier in the tech tree may have made it more enjoyable for me, and there are mods for that, but I <i>never</i> paly a modded game until I&#x27;ve experienced it as it was intended and by that point I didn&#x27;t want to pay more of that damned exercise in complexity-fetishism.')
