The results of science normally lie above any democratic discussion. No mater how you vote and what your values are COVID-19 exists, and global warming exists either. If you publish an opinion piece - even if it&#x27;s a well-informed opinion - as a scientific paper, you are basically saying &quot;here&#x27;s what the policy should be, and you&#x27;re not entitled to discuss it, because we know better&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not against scientists having an informed opinion an political matter, and I&#x27;m not even against scientific journals publishing opinions if they consider them important  enough, but there should be a distinction in this case between the part where science is published and the opinion column.')
