Until things got heat in 2020, Apple wasn&#x27;t even allowing payment competition in their iOS App Store. Think about that. Roman empire did the same with their provinces, wanna get romanised (civilised)? You got to pay the tax.<p>More so, Apple is #3 in the world in game revenue and guess what, Apple doesn’t even make games.<p>I can&#x27;t buy an Apple device because of the ideology behind their products. Why expect Apple to put other storefronts on their platform? They have all the rights not to but this also implies that their ecosystem is less liberal, which is also fine. They made the OS and the device. If you hate the App Store, don’t use iOS. It&#x27;s simple. They run 1984 ads but they are the core of 1984.<p>There is basically no reason for not providing an OS interface for others to build their own storefronts on your platform. Android showed that it&#x27;s possible, there&#x27;s no excuse. Period.')
