(Like, <i>literally</i> all the time, I normally have it running in the background so I can see whether it’s my computer’s wi-fi adapter, the wi-fi router or the local ISP that’s playing up this time.)<p>I remember it was a few days after they came out with 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1 that it dawned on my that I could drop the zeroes. I’d been wondering why they hadn’t chosen 1.2.3.4, but once I realised 1.0.0.1 was just 1.1, it became fairly obvious why they had chosen it.<p>(P.S. mtr’s stripchart with latency information is <i>super</i> great for this sort of thing; I have MTR_OPTIONS=--displaymode=2 set in my environment.)')
