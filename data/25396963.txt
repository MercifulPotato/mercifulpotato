By treating it as a &quot;family&quot; problem, any solutions will exclude people who <i>still</i> can&#x27;t fall back on a functional&#x2F;safe&#x2F;sane&#x2F;accepting family.<p>I can understand it makes you sad if you have a happy family and wish this for others. But in some situations it&#x27;d be equivalent to wishing someone would stay with their abusive partner.<p>Also, what&#x27;s this about only grandparents getting to enjoy company in their old age? What about the people without children+grandchildren?? That singular fact makes their lives carbon neutral several times over, which deserves quite an amount of respect, unlike people who did it because say, they feared being alone in their old age. Which you should not underestimate as an actual reason people use. And it also does not create happy families.')
