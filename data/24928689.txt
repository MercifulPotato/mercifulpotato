Item(by='waterhouse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603964317, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24928286, text='&gt; if you are simply willing to let go on a dance floor as a male, you were likely to be termed a good dancer in my youth<p>Can confirm.  My strategy for single dancing was quite literally &quot;do arbitrarily chosen motions in rhythm to the music with a straight face&quot;, and even when I chose motions I thought were silly (like pantomiming scooping ingredients into a bowl and stirring them), I never got the impression that anyone thought it was silly, and I started getting lots of people telling me that I&#x27;m a good or even a really good dancer.<p>My experience is that, if you move a lot, do it with an approximately correct rhythm, and do it with energy and enthusiasm, and you don&#x27;t actually bump into people or fall over, then people will be pleased.  It is <i>possible</i> that I&#x27;ve developed actual skill, but I think the above is most of it.<p>It does not translate into being good at dancing with a partner, except by implying basic proficiency with movement and rhythm.')
