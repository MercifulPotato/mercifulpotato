For example, Parler cites the hashtag “#hangmikepence,” which briefly trended on Twitter.<p>&gt; But AWS does not host Twitter’s feed, so of course it could not have suspended access to Twitter’s content.<p>I&#x27;m curious to understand what they actually mean by this. Portions of twitter are <i>not</i> on AWS? Certainly runs counter to this press release from amazon: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;press.aboutamazon.com&#x2F;news-releases&#x2F;news-release-details&#x2F;twitter-selects-aws-strategic-provider-serve-timelines" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;press.aboutamazon.com&#x2F;news-releases&#x2F;news-release-det...</a><p>I guess they&#x27;re saying they don&#x27;t host Twitter <i>yet</i>.')
