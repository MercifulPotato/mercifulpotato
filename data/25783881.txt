I was able to implement some ideas from the initial Nix paper that aren&#x27;t present in Nix. Nix is also quite dependent on the use of the &#x2F;nix&#x2F;store path, but I was able to allow a user to use almost any path for their build store without sacrificing on the potential for a shared build cache. I also want to have<p><pre><code>    - better native support for things like building docker images\n    - better dependency management\n    - no build daemon\n    - etc...\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m currently implementing sandboxing and finalizing some of the build structure, but hoping it&#x27;ll be usable sometime soon.')
