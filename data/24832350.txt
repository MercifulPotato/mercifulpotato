Item(by='dkulchenko', descendants=None, kids=[24833315], score=None, time=1603150997, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24831637, text='I recently modeled churn for my subscription box calmbox (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thecalmbox.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thecalmbox.com</a>) by using an actuarial table (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lifeexpectancy.org&#x2F;lifetable.shtml" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lifeexpectancy.org&#x2F;lifetable.shtml</a>, formulas at the bottom) which I found to be a lot more informative than the standard churn formula.<p>Subscriptions still active at month x are represented as `l(x)` and subscriptions that &quot;die&quot; (cancel&#x2F;expire) in a given month are represented as `d(x)`.<p>This gives you a &quot;life expectancy&quot; and a &quot;mortality rate&quot; (so, churn) for any given number of months that a customer has been subscribed. So I can project how long someone will stay subscribed when they&#x27;re brand new (at month 0) and how long they likely still have when they&#x27;re at month 8 (longer than at month 0, funnily enough).<p>With those subscriptions where the month-specific churn will largely <i>decrease</i> the longer someone&#x27;s subscribed (after passing the initial high-churn first months), this allows measuring&#x2F;projecting churn on a much more granular level.')
