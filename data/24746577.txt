Transitioning from Python 2 to 3 was already a nightmare.<p>I know there&#x27;s some interoperability between Julia and Python, but a lot of stuff is not interoperable, and there are annoying differences in array indexing etc.<p>Why can&#x27;t people just settle on some tech, let it mature, and enjoy reaching higher and higher in capability? Why do we have to always tear things down and start from scratch?<p>This causes a lot of artificial bit rot, there&#x27;s a never ending treadmill of just porting well-developed concepts and mature code to slightly changed representations. It&#x27;s the busywork of tech.<p>Does the scientific community also want to follow web dev in their insane churn of frameworks and libraries where last week&#x27;s best practice is laughable ancient stone-age primitiveness today?')
