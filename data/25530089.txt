Anyway, some of the tests for the Lustre PFS use Linux&#x27; fault injection system. Also, Linux documents specific support for NFS fault injection, which I know nothing about, and may or may not apply to pNFS. (It probably doesn&#x27;t make it any more relevant or databased, but the OrangeFS PFS uses bdb or lmdb instances for the arbitrarily distributed metadata.)')
