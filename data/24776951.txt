You&#x27;re welcome to disagree, but I personally wouldn&#x27;t hold up the distant 3rd place in desktop computing as evidence against my argument.<p>FWIW, Windows also has a package “manager”, although it didn’t manage installed packages last I checked (despite being basically a copy-paste of WinGet IIRC). But I see no reason to hold up what AFAIK is the shrinking 3rd place in computing (behind cloud and mobile) as evidence. Servers and phones install software too.')
