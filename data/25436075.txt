With the Cloud Shell, it&#x27;s all preinstalled for you.<p>- You have to &quot;log into&quot; the CLI if you&#x27;re running it locally, which can be a minor annoyance. (I know the AWS CLI doesn&#x27;t have this issue, as it doesn&#x27;t use OAuth for authentication with the console.)<p>- All of the data transfers in Cloud Shell are happening between machines in Google&#x27;s data center, so you get gigabit speed file transfers in the Cloud Shell. For example, this is super useful when you need to download a large bucket to a working directory to make edits to multiple files, or if you need to run scripts that pull and push to&#x2F;from Cloud Storage.<p>I think a Cloud Shell for AWS is a net positive! It can make some workloads easier and reduce the amount of configuration you need to do.')
