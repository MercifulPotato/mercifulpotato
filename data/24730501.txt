I mentioned I&#x27;d be happy to include it if he got me a Bloomberg api subscription, but no luck!<p>My guess would be that expectations wouldn&#x27;t help much. The analysts at banks that provide estimates are relatively conservative (don&#x27;t want to stick out from the crowd too much). For instance, it&#x27;s much better to be way off from actual as compared to other analyst estimates. Because you can always say everyone else believed the same thing as an excuse. If you&#x27;re way off from others and you happen to be wrong, then thats more embarrassing.<p>The analysts also rely on internal estimates pretty heavily, and companies aren&#x27;t dumb, so they usually downplay expectations. So much so that the majority of companies beat their own estimates (over 70% of the time). So I think these numbers are gamed and without being a sophisticated practitioner, they wouldn&#x27;t help IMO<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;insight.factset.com&#x2F;record-performance-vs.-eps-estimates-by-sp-500-companies-in-q2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;insight.factset.com&#x2F;record-performance-vs.-eps-estim...</a>')
