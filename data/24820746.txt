Item(by='n1try', descendants=0, kids=[24821091], score=2, time=1603051988, title='How does WhatRuns.com make money?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I just found https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.whatruns.com&#x2F; and also found a 3-year-old HN discussion (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15098028) on this tool. I really like it, but I just can&#x27;t figure out what the operators of that site get out of it? It&#x27;s free, there&#x27;s no premium version and they claim to not collect any data. I&#x27;m a bit sceptical.')
