The operating model seems to simply be to replace parts in a pre-determined &quot;likelihood of failure&quot; model.<p>I don&#x27;t blame the techs - I liked most of them but after casual conversation it seems clear that most of them don&#x27;t get much training.<p>I guess my main complaint is that while I definitely want to &quot;call a pro&quot; my experience finding a good professional in HVAC (and plumbing for that matter) has not been particularly successful.<p>And don&#x27;t get me started on part pricing - I am very happy to pay for knowledge (with high hourly technician costs) but more than once I have had easily purchasable OEM parts massively marked up by HVAC companies in what seems just like price gouging.')
