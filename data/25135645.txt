Why don&#x27;t we make this issue completely disappear in the easiest way possible, by banning those corporations only from any polluting? Job done.<p>Well on that we definitely have common ground, all you need now is a few spare million to form a political lobbying group. Bare in mind that much of that pollution is to make products&#x2F;utilities that are then used by consumer. So it is still consumer driven pollution. But I absolutely agree on the principle that Government and Industry should be leading the Carbon emmisions reduction.')
