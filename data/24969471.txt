The form could be factual data (lists of things) supporting or disproving their theory,  creative imagery (internally seen things) obscuring what is normally viewed as reality, or perhaps sound or voices in the form of hallucinations (internally heard things).<p>After armchair analyzing this for nearly 4 years, I&#x27;m pretty sure Trump is a &quot;bigly visualizer&quot; and has some ability? to make others see what he is seeing, while at the same time filtering facts that thinking mind might normally bring.<p>To clarify, when I mean facts I mean non-imagery or non- sound&#x2F;vibration based data forms: words, labels, conditionals, etc., which are used to form a process which may be followed  by another to arrive at the same &quot;conclusion&quot; to what is currently being seen through our collective awareness.<p>It would seem about 43% or more of the population of the United States is infected with a means of operation which eliminates or completely disables critical thinking mechanisms and relies exclusively on internal fabricated imagery or audio for their measure of &quot;truth&quot;.<p>Maybe narcissism has gone mainstream here.')
