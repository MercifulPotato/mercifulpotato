When I was in high school, there was someone who has this skill. He had started music when he was a very little. Most perfect pitch persons starts their music in their early ages. This person in my school &quot;senses&quot; pitches (I think it&#x27;s similar to how we see colors.)<p>THERE&#x27;S NO KNOWN CASES OF ANY ADULT DEVELOPING PERFECT PITCH. There&#x27;s a number of studies saying it cannot be developed as an adult.<p>However, I&#x27;m doing research for a few months and trying to develop perfect pitch myself (I have a fine relative pitch). None has worked for now. I strongly believe there must be a way for adults to develop this.<p>My thoughts on this app: It may help to improve something called &quot;tone identification&quot;, but that instinct of having perfect pitch is completely different.<p>By the way, anyone here have perfect pitch (possibility is 1&#x2F;10000)?<p>(For any one interested, search Youtube for perfect pitch. There&#x27;s a lot of fascinating stories)')
