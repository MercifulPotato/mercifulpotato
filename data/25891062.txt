Such a pump is really great!<p>What I have noticed is that some bottle necks are slightly too large or of a weird form for the corks, letting the vacuum escape. When everything is OK the cork makes a pleasantly sharp &quot;ssssshhhhup&quot; sound when releasing the vacuum. For some bottles there&#x27;s just a faint sloppy &quot;shh&quot; or perhaps even nothing, and for sure the taste isn&#x27;t optimal then.<p>After pumping I always put the bottle to the fridge. If storing a pumped wine at room temperature I suppose the wine would quickly end up tasting like donkey.<p>Then later, when it&#x27;s time, I open the cork and let the wine warm up (!) to the required temperature.<p>A pumped wine won&#x27;t hold for months of course, but I&#x27;ve kept more robust red wines up to a few weeks max, and they are OK for my tastebuds.<p>So, after any decanting and airing I usually test the bottle with the pump + cork, to see that it gets sealed properly, if I plan to pump it.<p>Probably all Frenchmen and Italians are rolling their eyes and writhing in agony now but hey, it works for me...')
