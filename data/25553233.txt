On a typical 60-70mph freeway you should have a gap of at least 15-20 car lengths, and then accidents like that will happen only when other factors are at play (and if those factors are predictable like water on the road then your distance&#x2F;speed should be adjusted accordingly).<p>While I think that example was bad, your point about there existing accidents without single points of blame is still valid.')
