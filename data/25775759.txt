I am having trouble understanding your argument, however, that includes both &quot;consistent&quot; and &quot;choose your own adventure&quot;.  I also don&#x27;t buy that, other than simply being used to it, that piping last to sequences is more &quot;natural&quot;.  &quot;reduce a into b with c&quot; or &quot;reduce value a into value b using function c&quot; reads perfectly natural to me.  I&#x27;m happy to hear arguments otherwise.')
