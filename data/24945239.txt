But I use it all the time. In certain fields (eg FEM applied to mechanical engineering), it&#x27;s just one of those absolutely counterproductive standards we have to deal with all the time.<p>Sometimes I have tried using side-by-side figures with other colormap, usually to prove some specific point, but changing the habits of a whole field is really difficult. It is even more difficult when there is not a clear alternative, but several to choose from; I have seen a few other people using alternative colormaps too and they did not use the same as me (or I did not use the same as them).<p>To give a more extreme example: if a doctor has to check my cancer tests and he has been diagnosing tumors using the jet colormap for decades, I would not feel comfortable if my results were given to him using the much better cividis colormap.')
