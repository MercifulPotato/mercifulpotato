I don’t know where it came from or where it went, but that was a remarkably worse period of my life.<p>Reflecting on it I wish I wasn’t dragged down so much. But in all honesty I think I’d handle it even worse now. It was agonizing at times. I remember laying on the floor squirming in pain, no idea what to do. Hours of it. Thinking about it makes me a little anxious. I should be more grateful that I’m healthy again.')
