Otherwise you lose sound stage depth and get bloated bass. Its such a shame to see people giving 5-10k$ on pair of really good speakers and putting them 20-30cm from the wall (i see that ALL the time on various FB groups).  \nI have mine floorstanders around 1.2m away, where they sound the best. Is always a compromise between room and speakers placement.')
