Special awards to those who not only got money granted to provide and unneeded service, but by virtue of their applying to serve the reservation, got the legitimate reservation organization&#x27;s grant blocked and unfunded.<p>It is actually illegal, as in there is a tribal resolution, for me to provide any demographic information to any entity without tribal permission.<p>The worst part is those folks who say they are Native American from a particular tribe and are NOT on that tribes enrollment rolls.  They are always fun to deal with.')
