Many with simple checks and balances:<p>- Require nomination or agreement by the AG.\n- Prohibit pardoning of political crimes or other self-interest.\n- Require approval by at least on other minister, or the whole cabinet, or some portion of the legislative body.\n- Require a published request for pardon, justification of the pardon, and the judiciary&#x27;s comment about this justification.\n- Prohibited during lame duck or caretaker periods.\n- Allow commutations only.\n- Allow pardons only when someone is actually serving their sentence.\n- Eliminate mandatory sentences, allows judges to exercise mercy in sentencing.')
