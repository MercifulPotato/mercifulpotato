I don&#x27;t really want to say more about that in particular because it feels like I will be accused of proselytizing. What I will say is that I think you&#x27;re reading too much into what not believing in deities may or may imply about someone.<p>Edit: I should also ask, from your edit, what do you mean by &quot;deity&quot; and &quot;universe&quot; when you say that atheism holds that the universe is a deity?')
