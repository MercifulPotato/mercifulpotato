It&#x27;s not explicitly called out in the article and critics here saying Gresham&#x27;s law isn&#x27;t equivalent are right that the article doesn&#x27;t solidly make the case, but I think there is a case to be made.<p>High quality information and analysis is being sequestered behind paywalls. This is exactly equivalent to Gresham&#x27;s Law, where the coins with higher material value are hoarded. High value journalism is being hoarded outside the free flow of common discourse.<p>The torrent of low quality information and engagement driven &#x27;content&#x27; makes it appear that there is an abundance of information. In fact in depth analysis, informed opinion and investigative journalism have always been expensive. Until recently most people would pay for it (newspapers, advertising supported news channels, paid cable) because there weren&#x27;t many free information channels. This made it relatively cheap per consumer, because there were so many consumers of it.<p>Now there&#x27;s a torrent of social media and low value comment available free. This is the debased currency, and it absolutely is hurting old media style high value journalism, which is being hoarded behind paywalls. Readerships are contracting and so the price per consumer is getting driven up, so it ends up disproportionately in the hands of elites.')
