Convincing end-users of internet hardware to update their switch&#x27;s firmware is hard. Ubiquiti has done a pretty good job of making updates actually doable, but for most hardware I doubt it&#x27;d happen more quickly than the hardware itself would fail.<p>&gt; That isn&#x27;t to say IPv6 couldn&#x27;t have been done in a backward compatible way. I can think of ways to do that<p>Can you explain any of those ways?')
