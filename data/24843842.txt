Item(by='gumby', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603241168, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24843731, text='&gt; but the disadvantage of increasing the risk if one is electrocuted.<p>Avoiding this was one of the design parameters of the &quot;Schucho&quot; plug design that is reasonably standard across Europe.  You&#x27;ll note the three prong plug has a longer ground that makes a connection before any hot one does.  The US three prong is supposed to work that way too but the ground pin isn&#x27;t long enough.<p>I continue to be amazed how many devices still ship with only two prong plugs (everywhere: Europe, North America, Australia...) even if those prongs are polarized.')
