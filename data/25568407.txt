I suspect that cost may also be inordinate on various realistic workloads.<p>Back in the PowerPC days, something along these lines happened with Java. Java mandates that integer divide-by-zero throws an exception, but PowerPC doesn&#x27;t have a mechanism to signal that a divide-by-zero occurred (1&#x2F;0 == 0, as far as PowerPC is concerned). This forced the JVM to wrap every integer divide with an explicit test for a zero divisor, which put a significant drag on JVM performance...')
