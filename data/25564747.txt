The tax benefits entirely shifts the market towards the benefit of properties that have been in the same hands for a very long time. So building new units will be far less profitable than old buildings, long-held, without any significant renovation. It&#x27;s very rare to find an existing property on the market that is profitable to rent out at current market prices, because there&#x27;s a lot of anticipated value gains built in to current prices.<p>In cities with zoning constraints, developers are the only natural predators of landlords. They are entirely different skillsets, building new units requires managing an extremely difficult political process for permits, raising capital, working with contractors and labor, etc.  Being a landlord requires very different analysis and skills.<p>There may be a few landlords with the capacity to cross over to development too, but it isn&#x27;t many of them.')
