You need to:<p>1. Ask yourself &quot;why am I reading the feedback at all?&quot; Is this because I am just curious or is it because I want to learn something actionable that will benefit myself?<p>2. Is reacting emotionally going to help? We teach kids to not react too emotionally at school but then we oftentimes can&#x27;t do the same as adults.<p>3. Why would the other person give you negative feedback? Is the reason stated in the feedback or is there some underlying cause (you started on a wrong foot, he&#x2F;she doesn&#x27;t like you, etc.)<p>4. Are the things in the feedback something that you can fix directly or indirectly? There is no need to worry about things that are outside your influence.<p>5. Are the things in the feedback something that you want to fix? Somebody gave me the feedback that I program slowly (I am developer). I actually do it on purpose and the person lacks the experience to understand why. Of course, no need to point it out loud. On the other hand, I can think how to improve the message.<p>6. Is there anything you can think of that can benefit yourself? Use feedback as a potential trigger to do some potentially deep thinking about yourself. I sometimes benefit from feedback in ways that would be very difficult to directly link with the feedback itself -- it just happened to start a fortuitous line of thought.<p>7. Always thank for feedback, whatever it is. Tell people you value the fact they came to you and that you need to think what you are going to do with this. Tell people that in the future, you would like them to continue coming to you if they have any more feedback. Don&#x27;t get defensive and ABSOLUTELY NEVER get hostile.<p>It is a little bit of process I go through every time I receive feedback.')
