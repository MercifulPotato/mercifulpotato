Nobody has ever been &quot;happy&quot; about this vendor lock-in, why would no-code be any different?<p>The current proprietary tools are valuable but they don&#x27;t allow users to export their creations between vendors offering the same functionality - that means they are more locked-in then ever. Users have the added emotional element of having to abandon their creation and accept the sunk-cost if they want to switch. I&#x27;m quite sure that nobody is happy about that fact.')
