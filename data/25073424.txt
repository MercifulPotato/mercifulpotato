I&#x27;ve worked with everything that came before Angular&#x2F;React (MooTools, Ember, Backbone) and you&#x27;re right, I like the idea of an opinionated framework that provides enough tools to get up and running and to maintain for the next few years (at least).<p>This is why I liked Elm as well because it bakes in a particular structure and adds static typing.<p>The other advantage is if you&#x27;re hiring freelancing. From personal experience, anything that was custom and less opinionated cost more billable hours. Dealing with a framework like Laravel, Django, Rails cut costs in a noticeable way and the remaining work was actual hard problems to solve.')
