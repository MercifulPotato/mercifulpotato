But you&#x27;ll soon be able to get a Zen 3 CPU that&#x27;s just as good.&quot; Which may or may not be true, but:<p>- Apple has a material (and apparently perceptible) performance advantage against the majority of the  laptop market - which will do wonders both for their and Arm&#x27;s brand.<p>- The M1 has killed the idea (which I&#x27;ve heard a lot) that you can&#x27;t get performance out of an Arm core.<p>- There is now a credible desktop platform on which to develop for Arm in the cloud.<p>I think the real impact of this will be in 2-3 years and it&#x27;s not good for Intel.')
