Looking at the textbook, the author certainly covers the fundamental questions in vector spaces, linear maps, and decomposition&#x2F;normal forms.<p>There&#x27;s even a really great section on projective geometry that would have been helpful before seeing it quickly defined as homogenous coordinates before moving on to the definition as a quotient manifold of a sphere and Lie group.<p>Are you complaining about the axioms for a vector space? Because that list will exist for any LA class lol. That&#x27;s like complaining that a college Calculus class is teaching the limit definition of the derivative.')
