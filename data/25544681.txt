I have an “enterprise grade” HP scanner (3500 F1) with buggy Twain drivers I had to manually disassemble and patch that will crash any time you try to duplex scan a single-sided sheet of paper. The blank page detection algorithm caused a null pointer dereference if two-sided mode was selected but the second side was elided.<p>The bug reproduced 100% of the time with all available versions of their drivers in any application using the TWAIN rather than WIA or proprietary scanner interface. It was as simple as scanning any one-sided document in duplex mode. I escalated the issue to their engineers who kept insisting the issue was with my PC until the product was EOL’d just a year or two after production.<p>I had other hardware issues pop up and ended up getting a Fujitsu for ADF document scanning and keeping the HP for scanning photos with the flatbed. Not many stand-alone hi-res dual color ADF&#x2F;flatbed scanners out there.')
