Or evaluating every interview candidate&#x27;s communication skills and cultural fit based on a conversation about rock climbing and craft beer.<p>And other stuff managers might need to get good at aren&#x27;t taught at home or in college. If you get performance complaints about an otherwise-good employee who is fasting during Ramadan, what&#x27;s the right way to address that while respecting privacy and being fair to the complainant, complainee and the company?<p>I can understand why an employer might want their employees to have a bit of extra training, above and beyond what college and life experience have already taught them. At least for the employees destined for promotion to senior positions.')
