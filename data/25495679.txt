When I worked in Telecom, we were usually the contractor for Comcast, but sometimes there was another contractor above us and we were the &#x27;sub-contractor&#x27;.<p>But then, below us, were often 1 or 2 more layers of subcontractors.<p>1&#x2F;3 of the time we had decent contractors and scope of work and everything worked out. The other 2&#x2F;3 of the time, it would be one or more of the following:<p><pre><code>  - The contractor mis-bid the project in a way that would lead them to go bankrupt in a year or two\n\n  - The contractor did a cut-rate job to maximize their profits.\n\n  - The deadlines or work rate were unreasonable and led to mistakes.\n\n</code></pre>\nBut, the important thing about all of this, is that the number of layers involved in the transaction lets <i>everyone</i> point the finger at each other and never point out that maybe it&#x27;s the system itself that is broken.')
