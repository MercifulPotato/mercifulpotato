Are there really Anachrocapitalists who believe that the market should decide whether or not we have mass extinctions, or is this post mostly satirical?<p>There are so many problems with this idea, not the least being that markets aren&#x27;t designed to eliminate niche ideas, they&#x27;re designed to support them -- and because wild populations of elephants are a shared common resource, even a small number of people who are happier owning tusks means that their preferences suddenly outweigh the vast majority that want them to stop killing elephants.<p>Markets aren&#x27;t designed to stop people from irreparably damaging commons and messing up the world for everyone. That doesn&#x27;t mean markets are bad, it just means... that&#x27;s not what they were ever designed to do. You&#x27;re using them to try and fix a problem that they&#x27;re not optimized to fix.<p>This is very much a, &quot;if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail&quot; proposal. We don&#x27;t need to solve literally every single problem with Capitalism.
