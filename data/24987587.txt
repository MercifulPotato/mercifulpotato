It&#x27;s unfortunate that we have no direct democracy, but do have good safety nets (at least comparatively). Meanwhile Cali has no such nets but does allow majority rule in this way.<p>I actually also like the Uber model because its honest (between the participants at least) . I hardly ever used taxis before, not just because of the price but also because of the service. &quot;Your car is 10 minutes away&quot; actually meant &quot;your car has to complete 3 other 20min journeys before coming to you&quot;. &quot;about £10&quot; meant &quot;£26 after a weird journey and no we don&#x27;t take credit cards or give change&quot;. I imagine the same applied for drivers: people would misbehave in your car because there was no penalty for doing so. Dispatchers favoured other drivers because you were new.<p>The whole thing was a race to the bottom for everyone. Uber with a rating system and an algorithm that minimises waits has fixed that issue. That&#x27;s their &quot;killer feature&quot; to me.<p>But I can see how people have issues with their model.')
