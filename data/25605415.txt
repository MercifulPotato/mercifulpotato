A private key is very long password that is magically¹ never revealed to anyone during normal use, only it&#x27;s accessibility is proven.<p>If the user does not verify the remote host&#x27;s fingerprint (vast majority doesn&#x27;t), they could be sending the password to an attacker &#x2F; honeypot or just wrong server &#x2F; password. And if they reuse passwords, server can record passwords and someone could try them elsewhere.<p>If you&#x27;re using passwords, it is very likely the password was copy-pasted to an inappropriate host (or passwords common for many hosts). It is also very likely the first connection to a server from a given computer was without verifying the remote host (server fingerprint), users are likely try and accept all kinds of things if they connection doesn&#x27;t work, and I&#x27;ve even seen people disable host key verification so they wouldn&#x27;t be bothered when a server is reinstalled &#x2F; ip is reused.<p>Local accessibility of private keys is a significant issue, but if a program can read .ssh&#x2F;..., it can usually also alias ssh=store-pasword-and-ssh, so using password doesn&#x27;t help <i>that</i> much, vs. it&#x27;s other issues.<p>If you&#x27;re using passwords for yourself, it may be manageable, but I never give other people ssh login access using passwords.<p>¹ using asymmetric cryptography')
