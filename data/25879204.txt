The SWP have miniscule political clout.  In general the left (not the liberal center often mislabeled as &quot;left&quot; in the USA) has few institutions and less power.  The most likely outcome is the consolidation of censorship in the hands of Republican&#x2F;Democratic censors.  Left-wingers will be welcome to post to ten followers at a time on Mastodon.<p>There really is only one obvious response to this:  Facebook, Google etc are common carriers, not allowed to censor.  They should also be broken up given their massive size which enables them to drive policy which affects them.')
