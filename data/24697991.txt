And people with less talent and knowledge inevitably tried to follow the incomplete instructions.<p>This meant you had just enough cases of real success to justify the existence of doctors even though the value of an average medical expert historically was questionable (with the probable exception of nursing care which usually did less active harm).<p>That’s just my theory anyway')
