Intros through indiscriminate folks like that tend to be disregarded unless there is a highly targeted ask simply because most of the folks they are connected to <i>don&#x27;t</i> actually have an existing relationship or particular affinity with them. Similarly, so called &quot;LinkedIn Open Networkers&quot; that accept all incoming connection requests are also something of a red flag, unless you are actually in an industry like recruiting, marketing, or PR, where a &#x27;reach&#x27; numbers game is a viable strategy.<p>Once your network starts growing, you&#x27;ll start to get more incoming requests from folks trying to do the same thing you are. Don&#x27;t accept the ones that don&#x27;t make any sense (eg. If you are a medical software dev in the Midwest, feel free to decline that random connection request from an accountant in Azerbaijan), or you&#x27;ll start to get a <i>lot</i> more of those (because folks who connect to lots of random folks tend to be mostly connected to others who do the exact same thing).<p>Absolutely reject and report requests that are outright spam. If you aren&#x27;t sure, you can reply to ask what led them to try and connect with you <i>before</i> you make the decision to accept ignore or reject the request (saying &quot;Hi, thanks for reaching out. I&#x27;m sorry, but I have a terrible memory, and I don&#x27;t recognize your name or profile image. Did we meet at an event last year?&quot; will work without being insulting).<p>It all boils down to this: if you want to have a large but high quality&#x2F;relevance network, you need to be prolific but not indiscriminate in making connection requests.')
