An evil face to jeer at, some one or group of people to blame for a problem before moving onto the next hyperbolic issue. Otherwise perception of a problem is too diffuse, complicated, and nuanced to process in an iota of thought. Don&#x27;t bother considering the fact this company acted in good faith with the law, or the blind faith people put into a medical system fundamentally designed to profiteer from peoples&#x27; lives, and dismal support for the mental or physical health of our nation&#x27;s poor and struggling. Because if you look hard enough for someone to blame and it&#x27;ll eventually come full circle, because we collectively decided to co-opt a society based purely on self-interest.')
