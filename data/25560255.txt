So it can take YEARS to just get the first shovel in ground, because these projects go through so many rounds in city councils and what not.<p>That&#x27;s how you end up with extremely partisan &#x2F; one-sided city councils, consisting of established home&#x2F;land owners, that will fight tooth and nail to impose draconian zoning laws, and general NIMBY-politics.')
