It&#x27;s the best of all worlds. Quiet space to work, it is outside of the house for separation, but very close so the commute is minimal on a bike and don&#x27;t need to drive.<p>I don&#x27;t love having to pay for the space but objectively it is less than the cost of fuel I was spending every month on the commute so I&#x27;m still saving money. And my commute is ~7 minutes on a bike instead of 60 minutes driving. And I&#x27;m so close to home I can come back mid-day to see my son. Win-win-win.<p>So yes, I&#x27;m planning for permanent remote, life is so much better.')
