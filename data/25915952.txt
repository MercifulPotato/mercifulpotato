They&#x27;ve seen the writing on the wall and are moving to where the money will be in the future. Apart from this acquisition, they have also invested in wind parks (their offshore expertise is quite handy apparently), hydrogen electrolysers for damping renewable production peaks and several other large and capital intensive projects that they are very well positioned to take on.<p>The main concern seems to be whether they can make the cultural switch in management as there are quite a few &quot;old hands&quot; in middle management that are quite attached to the fossil fuel sector that they grew up with. On the other hand, the CEO and board seem fully on board so we&#x27;ll see how it plays out. In the coming weeks with the annual report they are expected to present a new strategy document for the coming decade with more details on how they plan to go about it. This is a company that has tens of billions per year to invest in new energy projects, as well as some top tier talent. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see what they come up with.')
