Same number of servers (3x c5.large), just higher CPU utilization (from ~15% to 70%).<p>Scala was great, but unfortunately it made it difficult to onboard new team members into the project, so development suffered. Also the rest of our stack is mostly Python, so we couldn&#x27;t use a lot of the common tooling, and libraries we had built for other projects.<p>We migrated it within a month, and it&#x27;s been running for almost a year without issues.<p>At some point the service even recorded 3k+ req&#x2F;s at ~200ms 99p latency. Yeah, maybe not Google scale, but more than enough for 99% of the businesses out there.<p>This service handles about 2.5 billion requests per month from one AWS region. We&#x27;re a small team, and that&#x27;s only one of the services we support. Which is great because we don&#x27;t need to spend all of our time optimizing it.')
