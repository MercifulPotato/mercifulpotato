I&#x27;m on macOS using Divvy. When I&#x27;m on a zoom and its fullscreen mode has been triggered, I hit esc to end fullscreen, then cmd-shift-(arrow or enter) to put it wherever I want it. With 2 monitors and a handful of easily-defined, keymapped positions, I&#x27;ve never felt a need for autotiling per se. (If I were to get into more sysadmin &#x2F; SRE -type terminal-based work, I think I&#x27;d reach for tux in that context; shrug.)')
