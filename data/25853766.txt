From this exercise you will come to understand your opponents view perfectly.<p>But its a difficult exercise to do without the proper incentive. You can&#x27;t just say &quot;congrats you won...because the side you had is right&quot;. You have to want to win. You would be forced to empathize with the other&#x27;s situation.<p>For me, lack of understanding of the other side&#x27;s argument is the biggest problem with discourse today.')
