Republican congressman in Pennsylvania, Arizona, Michigan and several other states are attempting to introduce legislation that would force states to overturn free and fair elections, while their supporters phone in bomb threats to ballot counting centers and democratic headquarters, and their TV stations continue to pump out propaganda with no basis in reality. This is also the same party that has seen notable success in radicalizing young white men to commit terrorist acts. Oh, and republicans are closing polling places in Georgia, because too many black people voted.<p>When looking at the situation, it’s hard for me to see how you feel it’s only a tiny minority of trump followers, as opposed to the entirety of the Republican Party - especially when the leadership of the party on down is pushing full steam ahead in a single coordinated effort.<p>It’s especially hard for me to understand how you think this is normal and healthy for a democracy, and why being alarmed is “fear-mongering” and “exaggeration”.<p>I think an honest acknowledgement of the current political situation would find you are trying to downplay the situation and threat that sabotaging democracy represents.')
