They lied to both PC and PS4 customers repeatedly that the license was renewed, they weren&#x27;t going to lose the game, it was OK for them to charge us insane prices for stuff on the ps4 version.<p>Surprise, surprise-PS4 version never made it out of beta but for like a week before closing servers, and it was years old stripped content from the pc. A friend and I sunk so much money for the PS4 launch to be killed right after actual release from beta.<p>I had friends who warned us that they saw the writing on the wall for the PC version, as they had completely dropped the ball on it once the rumor mill started up about the licensing.<p>For example you had to spend I believe $300 US to get the venom spiderman costume (must have purchased all other heroes&#x2F;packs), then he paid for nightcrawler, all to log on to...nothing.<p>How these companies can get away with this is beyond me. Once gaming becomes a SAAS permanently, how long before they charge by the minute like AOL used to?')
