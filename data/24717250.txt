They&#x27;re often old or broken and not many people use them (modern cars are better engineered for winter starts).<p>However the wiring for these cannot handle what an EV car chargers requires, so they&#x27;re useless for charging a car. For EVs typically new charging points are installed and this can be costly. It depends upon if the residents&#x27; association agrees to pay for them to be installed.')
