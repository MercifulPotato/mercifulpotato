To me one of the biggest things is the convenience of random sites that I can create an account with one click linked to my google account.<p>People seem to really really underestimate the power of that.<p>Like during this last year of craziness, my kids both have google accounts on chrome so when we find new random websites for learning that I want them to have accounts with, they have all had google click to signin.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t have even bothered with various places if they didn&#x27;t have that.  For my kids being able to visit 5+ sites regularly and the worst that happens is they have to re-login by clicking &#x27;login with google&#x27; cannot be understated.')
