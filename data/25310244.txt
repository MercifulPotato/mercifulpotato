If you go to that section intending to test it well, you’ll get a lot of lines of test code for a modest increase in coverage.  If you’re just trying to boost coverage, you’ll check off the todo without accomplishing much.<p>The only place these two metrics line up at all is when you can keep the number of conditions in each method close to one, and the functions pure. Otherwise you have a bunch of little functions that accumulate state and you’ve just moved the combinatorics where it’s even harder to reason about.<p>I think the most you can say with any certainty is that coverage percentage should not go down when adding code. But staying flat doesn’t prevent things from getting worse.')
