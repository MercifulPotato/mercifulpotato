That belief still isn&#x27;t enough to get those people to stop using Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.  It isn&#x27;t that people don&#x27;t think they are being spied on.  It is that people don&#x27;t really care that they are being spied on.<p>Snowden didn&#x27;t fail to change things because people didn&#x27;t believe him.  He failed to change things because he didn&#x27;t articulate a compelling enough reason for people to be fearful of what he revealed.<p>If people reading this want to see this changed, we need to do a better job of showing the real world consequences of this lost privacy.  Talking about theoretical concepts like lost freedom and privacy isn&#x27;t enough.  You need tangible examples of how people&#x27;s lives are made worse by this spying.')
