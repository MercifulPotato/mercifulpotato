This is an advantage of being a white man. When things don&#x27;t go my way, I don&#x27;t need to wonder if it&#x27;s a macro-aggression, an act of systemic discrimination, or suppression of a marginalized voice. I don&#x27;t envy my colleagues who navigate these waters.<p>Furthermore, even if my manager or employer makes it an explicit priority to promote more women or PoC, I don&#x27;t question whether my own gender or skin color will ultimately work against me at promotion time. I grew up in a time and environment where I didn&#x27;t need to question that, so I tend not think about it. Even if I did think about it, it&#x27;s a culturally inappropriate question to ask, so my only option is to keep my head down and work harder.')
