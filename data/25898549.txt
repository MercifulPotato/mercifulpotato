The number of tech progressives I met that possessed a murderous hate of homeless people was unreal. I still can’t believe that such a wealthy area has such a fundamental problem meeting basic human needs. Not everyone can be a tech worker, but very few of the “Silicon Valley” types can imagine someone living outside of tech, and if someone wasn’t in tech they were considered subhuman.')
