If Martin Rees was <i>honestly</i> asserting that the probability of a &quot;bioterror &#x2F; bioerror&quot; event in that 4-year window was &gt;50%, I think he was clearly wrong, and falling victim to the &quot;availability bias&quot; that Pinker describes.<p>Now, this may be a situation where the sides think they&#x27;re talking about different things: Pinker may be arguing that the probability is &lt;50%, while Rees may be arguing that the probability, while low, is non-negligible.  In which case, in my opinion, they&#x27;d both be right: But Rees&#x27; bet (again in isolation as a bet) isn&#x27;t rational (since the expected payoff is negative), while Pinker&#x27;s is.')
