It threatens stability.<p>And now, free trade memes (short squeeze, or long-term ones like HODL to the moon) generate a huge snowball that may end short selling. It threatens stability.<p>This is true whether it&#x27;s people organizing for Navalny against Putin, or against Lukashenko, or protesting the election, or reddit bros coordinating a short squeeze. Flash mobs organize. Stability vs Freedom. The people who enjoy stability are also blatantly profiting off their privileged position and access to the levers of power. The angry mob gets some short term wins but ultimately the loss of stability may drastically decrease overall wealth for everyone.<p>The question is ... how would the people who are in favor of stability even regulate or enforce the ability of flash mobs to get together, if there is no centralized organizer, just a meme or an idea? This is how revolutions occur. But often, the result (anarchy in Libya, 20M dead in Russian civil war after the revolution) is worse than the situation that came before.')
