Item(by='hinkley', descendants=None, kids=[25909092], score=None, time=1611608700, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25908677, text='&gt; In the U.S., the term accredited investor is used by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Regulation D to refer to investors who are financially sophisticated and have a reduced need for the protection provided by regulatory disclosure filings.<p>In a pre-IPO company, VCs and other investment groups consider unaccredited investors to be a liability, and they&#x27;ll either give worse terms or no terms. If you&#x27;re worth a million bucks the SEC considers you to be a grown-up and that you&#x27;ll ask questions rather than being spoon-fed data that can help you protect your investment, which takes away a bunch of scenarios where you can litigate.<p>I worked at a company that turned out to have an unaccredited investor. I didn&#x27;t hear the details but they had to &#x27;fix it&#x27; before the VCs would move forward with discussions. (They still didn&#x27;t get the money.)<p>GP&#x27;s implication is that if you have a million bucks you can get (are?) accredited, which will give you access to private shares. I&#x27;ve heard this too, but I couldn&#x27;t tell you the details.')
