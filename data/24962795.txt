You could publish a Flash project to target iOS with their AIR runtime, which converted everything into OpenGL.  Tons of people made apps with it, but the performance was terrible and all the UI controls were non-native and thus had no voiceover support. This is just Google reinventing or should I say rediscovering past techniques of app building.')
