Item(by='ketamine__', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605193640, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25070398, text='&gt; Go careful here. Ketamine infusion is a pretty heavy duty intervention and patients require careful monitoring while taking the infusion and for a short term afterwards.<p>I&#x27;ve been taking ketamine lozenges at home for 2+ years now. Ketamine is a very safe drug. It is used in pediatrics and on the WHO&#x27;s list of essential medicines. It&#x27;s hard to find any fatalities directly attributed ketamine in the literature.<p>The infusion therapy you speak of has been used to rob patients blind. Before I found a doctor that would prescribe I was on target to waste 10k a year. And that&#x27;s not even considering the wasted time of appointments in the clinic.<p>&gt; We know that in the US there&#x27;s already a problem of &quot;doctor shopping&quot; -- going around doctors until you find one willing to prescribe ketamine &#x2F; eskatamine. This is normally associated with harmful prescribing, although it&#x27;s too early to say if that&#x27;s the case with these meds.<p>Doctor shopping refers to going to different doctors to get more medication or to divert the prescription for profit. If one is depressed and seeks treatment from a researcher and doctor in another city or state it is not doctor shopping because of the underlying medical condition. Seeking help is not a crime.<p>Nevertheless, could you please post proof that there is a problem since you made that claim?')
