Any decision Github takes has a trade-off that will affect all users. Any time they allow a bypass of 2FA <i>and</i> email, they are putting potentially every account at risk of compromise. It doesn&#x27;t matter how good the excuse given to the Github customer service rep is, bypass shouldn&#x27;t be allowed so that all users&#x27; data is kept safe.<p>Let me put it in HN terms. One person grousing how they lost their account due to their own fault is a minor HN comment in the middle of a thread. A person complaining that Github customer service assisted an attacker in account compromise is a front page thread by itself, probably picked up by mainstream news. Does that make Github&#x27;s decision easier to make?')
