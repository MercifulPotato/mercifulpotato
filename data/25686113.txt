It&#x27;s much better to get your news from a single source who employ a large number of fact-checkers and are willing to issue retractions, than it is to get it from a &quot;variety&quot; of sources repeating the same claims with absolutely no independent verification of the facts.<p>Multiple sources reporting something does not make it credible if the sources in question aren&#x27;t performing independent verification.  Many &quot;news&quot; sites today engage in circular references where they say, &quot;blah is reporting...&quot;, then another site picks that up and reports that &quot;multiple sites are reporting...&quot;  And none of them bother with independent verification.  This is often exploited to spread hoaxes.')
