I like cast iron because: (1) It is extremely durable and can be repaired rather than replaced. (2) It is general purpose, reducing the number of pans I need to own. (3) It is well suited to cooking at low temperatures, which are much more forgiving (I can walk away and write a comment like this and come back to something other than a charred mess).<p>edit: I discovered cast iron about a year ago and now I do roughly 90% of my cooking on it. If there were reliable, <i>science-based</i> information about how to care for the pan best, it would have saved me a lot of trouble. As an example, a lot of people caution against seasoning with too much oil. They say that when you season your pan (e.g. initially, in the oven), you should wipe the oil off until the pan looks dry. I took this literally, and wiped until it looked the same as before I put on the oil. As a result, my seasoning had approximately no effect. After experimenting, I&#x27;ve decided that the &quot;looks dry&quot; advice isn&#x27;t <i>wrong</i> exactly, but &quot;dry&quot; needs clarification. It should look more like how you would like it to look when it comes out of the oven â€” dry, but darker and with more sheen.')
