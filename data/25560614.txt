Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609173752, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25552611, text='&gt; but the result is still everything I&#x27;ve said<p>No, the result is not “Republicans only have a shot if they don&#x27;t compete with each other” (except to the extent it it is equally “Democrats only have a shot if they don&#x27;t compete with each other”; it does disadvantage a party having support spread among many candidates vs concentrated on a smaller number, but there&#x27;s nothing that makes that more true for one party that the other.)  And no third party candidate ever had a chance <i>before</i> the blanket primary. (The blanket primary probably slightly improves this for the Green Party in certain Democratic-dominant districts, but only if Democratic support is highly concentated on a single candidate such as an in-party popular incumbent, but its still not much of a chance.) But, again, that&#x27;s not new with the blanket primary; classic partisan primaries and FPTP voting were more than sufficient to make that generally the case just as it pretty much is everywhere in the country that uses those systems.<p>So the two things that make up “everything you said” are <i>not</i> the result of the system.')
