Doesn&#x27;t it make more sense to reduce the blue color from your monitor that way instead of wearing glasses all the time? That being said, I was watching some interviews about this topic last week and the conclusion was that blue light doesn&#x27;t harm your eyes, but it will keep you awake at night. So, try to reduce screen time or use the night light &#x2F; f.lux later in the evening. Also, take a break a couple of times an hour for 10 seconds just to focus on something in the distance.')
