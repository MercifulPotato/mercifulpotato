If you accept that this one company should be allowed to decide to cut off someone for ideological reasons, you tacitly accept that all companies could cut someone off for the same reason. Hiding behind it being &quot;only one&quot; right now is to use a technicality to dodge having to defend the principle you are implicitly advocating. The action isn&#x27;t more right or wrong because one or more company is doing it--you either defend the principle at full usage or you disavow it.')
