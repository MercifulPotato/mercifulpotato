I don&#x27;t let race enter into my interactions. I sleep well at night, because I know I&#x27;m not a racist.<p>I’m pretty sure many racists think the same things... You don’t need to be in the KKK to be racist. You don’t need to be saying the n-word to be racist. There are a lot of more “subtle” things you could be doing that &#x2F;are definitely&#x2F; racist.<p>Btw, the fact you don’t let race enter your interactions probably means you’re not accounting for what people experience as part of their race. So, you’re probably racist for not considering their position.')
