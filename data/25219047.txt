They live in &#x27;rural&#x27; areas. Its common for them to drink alcohol, a lot. Drugs? no never no interest don&#x27;t care.<p>While i already had ~5 year of experience with weed, they didn&#x27;t even see it once. why would they? They have alcohol, it works for them, its common, easy and fun.<p>They had a really really hard time of even trying a brownie. They didn&#x27;t even get why i would smoke weed if the effects are shallow. They didn&#x27;t knew that you will not see halluzinations.<p>i think i&#x27;m over curious. This leads me to not being happy about what i have and looking for new. They are under curious and they are happy with that they have. Is that a problem? No its just different balanced.')
