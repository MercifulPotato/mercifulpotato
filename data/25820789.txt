(If you want to generalize from the specific libraries more accurately than “dynamic language”, it&#x27;s “using a low-level library whose type system doesn&#x27;t match the host language type system” issue.<p>&gt; Quants tend to use fixed precision types. It is like a float in every way, except base 10 instead of base 2 so there is no floating point error.<p>No, a type that is like binary floating point in every way except base 10 instead of base 2 would be decimal floating point, not fixed point. Decimal fixed point is different from binary floating point in more ways than base.')
