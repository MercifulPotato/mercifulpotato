I think it&#x27;s that Haskell is not good for heavy-IO programs. I&#x27;m not sure how PostgREST works, but shellcheck and pandoc, for example, are really well suited for &quot;IO on the edges&quot; style: you feed bytes in once, and then at the very end you spit some other bytes out. Everything in the middle is parsing and transforming data.<p>If you&#x27;re writing some boring CRUD app, or a GUI program that makes a bunch of syscalls, Haskell sounds like a giant pain in the ass.<p>From that POV, I think that Haskell&#x27;s relative lack of popularity is perfectly fine. Not every language has to be maximally general.')
