Monica is a separate app from the ones you usually use, using a separate database, with more latency before first input, and more button presses before you can actually store anything. These are all bad features if you&#x27;re trying to augment short-term memory. I&#x27;m not a fan.<p>(Moreover, Contacts is absolutely relational, in any sense that matters. There&#x27;s a Relations field. It&#x27;s stored in a sqlite db.)')
