A few weeks in and the nextcloud client icon has vanished after an update on my Ubuntu machines. Nextcloud guys say it&#x27;s gnome&#x27;s fault...yada yada...I don&#x27;t really care. It&#x27;s taken the shine of nextcloud only a few weeks in.<p>I imagine I will incorporate your solution into my pi and see how that goes. Thanks')
