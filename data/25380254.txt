Telling people how many children they can have is one step away from telling them who they&#x27;re allowed to have them with.<p>&gt; So what is there to prevent some people from having 10 children, every generation, until the system collapses under their weight?<p>The fact that if they can&#x27;t feed those children those children will die and the standard of living of their other children will be significantly reduced. Natural economic pressure handles this problem already.<p>&gt;You say that people with increased access to education and health and such naturally reduce their birth rates. That may be. But I think it would be only a matter of time before they got selected for impulsivity, high libido, inclination to adhere to the parents&#x27; religion that says to maximize children, or whatever other traits would lead to a bunch of people actually having tons of kids they can&#x27;t support.<p>That&#x27;s more speculative than anything I&#x27;ve said so far, everything I&#x27;ve said so far has a historical example to reference. Even if that were to happen, not bring able to support the people you create means reduced standard of living, and therefore reduced resource consumption, at best. Again, the problem is self correcting.')
