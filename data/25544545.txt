Reasons:<p>1) Open late<p>2) Variety and style of toppings often better than traditional NYC pizza places.<p>Ex. Dominos uses thin pepperoni that crisps on the edges, regular pizza places use fat ones that grease up your pizza. Dominos uses dried jalapeno, regular pizza places use pickled that gets some brine on your pizza. etc.')
