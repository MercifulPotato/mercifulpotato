The guy was a stellar developer but he didn&#x27;t have a PhD or anything and was only 5-7 years out of school.<p>We got to talking one day and he said that the only reason he&#x27;s making so much is that he was at the right place at the right time, he worked for this place before and they asked him to come back, and offered an insane rate to do so.<p>Making $200k to $500k in the industry isn&#x27;t hard (the actual work). The hard part is finding a company that needs someone of your skill level and are willing to pay whatever they need to. Finding that job is going to be the really hard part.')
