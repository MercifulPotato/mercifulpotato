It does, however, protect service providers from the liability that a publisher would take on for publishing content that otherwise <i>should</i> be censored. As these companies voluntarily embrace more censorship, they are calling into question their status as &quot;service providers&quot; since they are effectively operating as publishers; i.e., not protected under 230.<p>&gt; there has never been a set of free speech protections “normally recognized by content platforms”<p>I agree; legally there hasn&#x27;t been anything like that, but in the past, those platforms were demonstrably more reluctant to censor political content (e.g., views that didn&#x27;t align with the company&#x27;s political views) because they <i>knew</i> that more active involvement might jeopardize their classification as neutral platforms (along with their protections under 230 as described above). In effect, they stayed out of politics not by law, but out of fear of being forced to censor all content if they became &quot;publishers&quot;.
