Just think about how often libpng broke compatibility. Some libraries are so bad about this (like libpng) that even rolling release distros like Arch have to package multiple versions.<p>No one is willing to put in the effort on Linux to make deployment of software easier. And from the PoV of the distros there is nothing to fix anyway. Windows has invented and largely fixed the DLL hell. Linux only managed to copy the problem.<p>It’s great that the kernel is taking it so seriously, but everything else doesn’t care and constantly breaks compat.')
