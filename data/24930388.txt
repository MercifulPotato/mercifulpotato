It is parked somewhere to either act a conduit moving from owner to owner (which can be laundering).  Or just to park it and not lose much value until better opportunities arise as a good hedge against inflation.  Renting can be a pain as anyone who has got a bad tenant will tell you.  That the Chinese are&#x2F;were speculating in this way is not too big of a stretch (but is an assumption) as they have whole cities are that are basically big empty apartment cities.')
