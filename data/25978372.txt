In context, that was an example of someone getting caught on a philosophical landmine. Anyone who&#x27;s argued consequentialism before has heard that response, as it sounds like you have.<p>Actually, you also arguably got caught in a philosophical landmine there.<p><i>This seems like a rather shallow take on what it means to be creative and original.</i><p>&quot;Cached thought&quot; is a term of art on Lesswrong. See the link above the article text. The author isn&#x27;t talking about quoting dead people, they&#x27;re talking about trotting out thoughts which have been marked in your brains thought-store as high-quality, but may have not been reevaluated for years, and certainly haven&#x27;t been re-evaluated for this particular conversation.<p>So what is a philosophical landmine? It&#x27;s some conversational trigger which distracts an interlocutor by reminding them of their hobby-horse philosophical issue and causes them to start rehearsing the five standard arguments for their position on that issue instead of saying anything relevant to the conversation at hand.
