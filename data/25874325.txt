And it is glorious. Until everyone got used to it, I got consistent compliments on the sound quality. You&#x27;ll sound like a radio DJ. Because everything is wired, latency is minimal and a lot less of &quot;okay, go head. No, go ahead...&quot;<p>Now, that&#x27;s a lot of money and fiddling. Bang-for-the-buck IMO is the already-mentioned Blue Yeti, along with a wired set of headphones (anything, just wired, and not coming out of the speakers to take the load off the DSP feedback cancelling). So, prolly $150 total? Point being, if you use just a wired mic and headphones of <i>any</i> quality, you&#x27;re  loads ahead in sound quality of those using the built-in mic and speakers on their laptop (or worse, their phone).')
