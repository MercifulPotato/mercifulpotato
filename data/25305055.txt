But in any case, I&#x27;m also a Finn, and my contract also refers to that agreement. Still, I don&#x27;t think I even know anyone who just drops what they&#x27;re doing when their hours are up for the day or the week. It seems that everyone&#x27;s working around the clock, even on weekends and holidays. And just like you would expect by now, people take pride in it and boast about it too. Sure, that&#x27;s pathological, but I really can&#x27;t even imagine working 9 to 5 and then disconnecting for the rest of the time, union or not. I think you&#x27;re considered exceptional in Finnish IT if you can do that.')
