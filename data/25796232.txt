Colleagues can&#x27;t get to work, public transport goes to standstill so everybody drives (very ecological).<p>Its a double edged sword at best - government is properly afraid of the citizens. But overall the economy suffers badly. This is just a small part of overall french &#x27;package&#x27; - high social benefits, its extremely hard to fire people, tons of paid holidays days per year, early retirement etc. Result is startups start elsewhere, companies move away whatever they can (even state semi-owned like car industry). Another result is tons of monopolies, which distort the market and make very small amount of citizens profit at he cost of everybody else.<p>Economy is weak compared to Germany, I would say salaries are 1&#x2F;2, although there shouldn&#x27;t be the reason - big smart well educated population. But then comes the french mentality and way of doing things...')
