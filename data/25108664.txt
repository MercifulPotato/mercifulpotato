After that he restarted emacs and continued right where he left off.<p>&gt;&gt; Greatness isn&#x27;t about &quot;team player&quot;, &quot;hard working&quot;, (...) Greatness is a property of the person, a deep love of the craft, and a focus on &quot;doing it right&quot;.<p>In your history I see a great deal of &quot;hard work&quot; and &quot;team player&quot;. Moreover, to be able to perform like that, I&#x27;m quite sure he has been hard working for a long time. Of course, there is talent and virtuosity which I&#x27;m not downplaying. My point is that when people see such a virtuous performance (in all fields, like you mentioned), where there is clearly a lot of talent, there is a tendency to downplay the hard working part.')
