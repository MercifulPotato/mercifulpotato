I drive, i walk, i cycle.... and the cyclists are always the worst in traffic, and the police does nothing. Left side, right side, green light, red light, noone cares. Packed pedestrian street and cylists drive waay to fast down it, bump into pedestrians and just drive on. On a bike, on a bike lane, there are more people driving in the wrong direction than in the correct one (seen at every traffic light, if you count the waiting cyclists). If you&#x27;re in the car, sometimes they drive on the bicycle lane, and then just drve into the steet deirctly infront of you to overtake a slower cyclist, or cross the road at pedestrian crossing (they&#x27;d have to obey the yield sign, but they see the crossin, and just drive over, without slowing). Plus of course earphones + phone in hand. We also build some really nice bicycle paths outside of towns (eg: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;MqrId1R.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;MqrId1R.jpg</a> - road on the left, bike lane in the middle), and still get a lot cyclists driving on the main road, because &quot;they can drive faster there&quot;, and then complain about cars.<p>Does the police actually police the cyclists, or do they just controll the cars, and let the others (pedestrians, cyclists, skaters, rollerbladers,...) deal with themselves by themselves?')
