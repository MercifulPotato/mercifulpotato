Just because I have a goal to do X in ten years, that doesn&#x27;t mean I am forcibly committed to reaching X even if I no longer want to.<p>Let&#x27;s say I have a vague dream of becoming a sailor. Consider these four scenarios:<p>- Scenario A: I make it an explicit goal. In year 1, I read some books, take a sailing class, and forgo some luxuries to start saving up for a boat. In year 2, I buy a boat and sail. Dream attained!<p>- Scenario B: I make no goal. In the absence of a concrete goal, I don&#x27;t read or save in year 1. In year 2, I still long to sail but am no closer to getting there. Eventually I run out the clock on my life.<p>- Scenario C: I make it an explicit goal. In year 1, I read some books, take a sailing class, and forgo some luxuries to start saving up for a boat. In year 2, I decide I am no longer interested in sailing. I remove that long-term goal, and spend the money I saved on something else.<p>- Scenario D: I make no goal. In the absence of a concrete goal, I don&#x27;t read or save in year 1. In year 2, I lose interest in sailing. Nothing gained, nothing lost.<p>The two failure modes are B and C. If you fail to pursue a long-term goal that <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> change (B), you are eternally unfulfilled. If you pursue a dream that changes before you reach it (C), you have some lost opportunity cost for the work you put into that dream that is now not relevant.<p>For most people, the latter is a much smaller harm than the former. It&#x27;s more rewarding to strive towards something meaningful even if it ends up not panning out than to abandon your dreams pre-emptively.<p>Of course, the ideal is A or D, but none of us have a time machine to determine who our future selves will become. So the only choice you can make today is A&#x2F;C or B&#x2F;D.')
