Python and Flask were new to me and I had a lot of fun building this. BUT I feel like it could be improved in a lot of ways and that it&#x27;s not really &quot;pythonic&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m looking for a honest feedback on this. I have a lot of new features in mind, but the code is probably terrible and I&#x27;d like to get professional opinions before diving too deep...<p>Thanks!')
