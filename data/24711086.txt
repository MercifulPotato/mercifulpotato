Item(by='kaens', descendants=None, kids=[24711392], score=None, time=1602094896, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24709659, text='food, water, shelter, and healthcare are universal human interests. it&#x27;s fine for you to believe the government shouldn&#x27;t have a hand in them, but then in my view you are simply not in favor of what has been defined in this thread as a &quot;healthy representative democracy&quot;<p>you could argue that it&#x27;s not your fault if lots of people don&#x27;t vote so they get what they get, but you would be oversimplifying things for a HUGE section of the populace who don&#x27;t vote because they have no one to represent their interests, where their interests are not starving or getting thrown on the street or being in debt for years and years because they slipped on the ice. these people not only do not have a meaningful way to vote, they also often do not have the time or energy to engage in local politics or trying to massage the system. they are currently risking their lives at metaphorical gunpoint every day to deliver &quot;essential&quot; services. minus the pandemic, it&#x27;s been this way for a long time.<p>This:<p>&gt; The duty and role of a government is to act in the best interest of their citizens which that government represents.<p>and this<p>&gt; In a well functioning representative democracy, voters will kick out politicians&#x2F;administrations that donâ€™t represent their interests well.<p>do not describe this country, even if you assert that only those who vote are represented. There&#x27;s zero accountability to the people, the gaps are too large for people who do represent our interests to get through the door (and when they come close the rules tend to change suddenly) Something being against the rules has never stopped someone from doing it if they really wanted to when they are the enforcers or writers of the rules.<p>if i lie to you a bunch and you vote me in, i&#x27;m not representing you. i have no intention on acting in your interests. politics is a crooked game, and ours is a particularly easy one to fix.<p>and what of the rest of the citizens who didn&#x27;t vote because they risk losing their job or because of a million other reasons? are they not still citizens? most of them didn&#x27;t choose to be, and regardless of whether that gives them some sort of moral obligation to participate to their best in the politics of their situation it does not remove their need for food, water, shelter, and healthcare which has been an increasingly difficult need to meet with essentially zero assistance from the system that is supposed to represent them.<p>to me it seems a lot like the conclusion is either that they are simply <i>lesser</i> for <i>whatever reason</i> and <i>too bad for them</i> or that the institution is just insisting on itself the way that institutions tend to do when they&#x27;ve been around long enough, and maybe a lot of people are actually very out of touch with what it is like to live in america for about half of our populace.')
