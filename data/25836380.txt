In places like the USA or Latin America where criminals are believed to possess guns, passersby wouldn’t want to risk getting shot for the sake of some stranger’s vehicle.<p>Even in Europe, if passersby in the big cities saw e.g. a bike thief taking an angle grinder to a bike lock, they are unlikely to intervene. It would just be asking for trouble.')
