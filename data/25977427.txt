Like xapian.<p>git grep works only for primitive results, but for all the metadata you need proper indices and an ui. \nEg. exclude forks, rank headers higher than source. Rank titles or headers higher than bodies.\nVerbatim vs regex vs parsed search queries.<p>Xapian can all do that. And is very efficient on that scale. Unlike elasticsearch or Google code search.')
