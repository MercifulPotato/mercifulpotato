A selfish company that wants to have control over every aspect of the customer&#x27;s digital life. If I want to develop a software, I have to be a registered developer with Apple. If I am a user, I can hardly use software developed by non-Apple-registered developers. There is now a section on my paid legally-purchased Apple Mac, over which no one has any control or access privileges, except Apple. and they are still planning to strip users of further control over their own purchased Apple device. Every step Apple has taken over the past decade has been toward isolating and stripping the rights of its customers more and more. What amazes me is how people fall for their advertisement tricks, that anyone who uses Apple products is smarter than others.')
