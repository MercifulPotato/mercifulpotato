A better interface would seemlessly embed the games into the virtual world (perhaps inside a &quot;picture frame&quot; or &quot;portal&quot;). This isn&#x27;t an aesthetic complaint. It would mean that spectators could walk by and see what is going on in the games - just like peeking around a space in real life.')
