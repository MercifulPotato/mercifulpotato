Hosting an open source alternative would need  time, effort (to understand the new environment) and money. There is a reason people outsource tasks that are not core to their skillset. Cause, the expenditure will be significant and result will not be half as good. Same reason we do not host mail servers though much easier self hosting options are now popping up and wonderfully maintained. A good business will always find ways to trim the fat and play to their strengths.<p>But much much more importantly, GA has billions of pages of free documentation (aka blogposts) for every task a business needs. If you are stuck with a problem, there is a huge community of people to reach out to and the answer is somewhere out there (Or you just learn to live with it, just as everyone else. You are not conceding any advantage to the business competitor). On the other hand, the open source alternatives have not yet benefited from the adoption of such a massive community, yet. It is very important to have some early adopters, who can show exactly how the end user can replicate the workflow they have setup in GA in the open source software.<p>* Then, for existing businesses, there is also the problem of sunken cost and huge amounts of existing data in GA that they cannot abandon.<p>* Then there is the thought process that exists in online communities on the value of accumulating data and how it can add value to their business. So, we will need to break them out of the FOMO on GA.')
