There&#x27;s certainly enough time to prep a helicopter crew, if there isn&#x27;t any on standby.<p>That said, at least in Germany and the surrounding countries, there&#x27;s a fairly dense network of rescue helicopters which are usually ready on the pad, crew on standby. They&#x27;re supposed to be airborne within minutes.')
