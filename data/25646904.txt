Many people preferred to buy an e-Golf or e-Up rather than a Leaf or Zoe even though the range was poorer simply because it came from VW, a brand that they had bought before and found reliable.  And of course many people could not afford to buy a Tesla until the Model 3 came along and even now it is one of the more expensive electric cars.')
