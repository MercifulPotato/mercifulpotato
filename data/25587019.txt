I mean think about a program that runs a copy of that program recursively, you&#x27;d run out of memory. Now I am aware that some argue that we could be ancestor simulations which would only render what we same like in gaming, BUT! that would mean they would have to simulate billions of minds and a world with physics and fidelity as convincing as our own which would take an insane amount of energy that I can&#x27;t imagine anyone wanting to do.<p>If we are a simulation then reality is much more complex than our own.')
