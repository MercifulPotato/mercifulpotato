To be honest where I live (Montana) guns really aren&#x27;t a problem. At least not the kind of problem that makes it a win to require Democrat candidates to support additional gun control measures. I think it&#x27;s not unrealistic to imagine that we could completely dispense with the crazy Republicans if only democrats would drop gun control, it&#x27;s such a wedge issue. Imagine that: Trump would never have happened, in exchange for not pursuing gun laws that probably wouldn&#x27;t have achieved anything.')
