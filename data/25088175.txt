Absolutely not, the things the OP mentioned (webpack, 1000 node packages etc) are essential.<p>Till this very day I can count a handful of devs who can give me a reasonable use case for react and why evey website should be a webapp. Im bad guy uno at every dev meeting because I have the audacity to suggest that not every webapp is facebook or something similarly complicated.<p>God bless NPM but Ill be damned if I dont get heart palpitations at the node modules ever increasing bundle. Its all magic or filth under the carpet. Magic is good when sprinkled and self contained but not when its all made of magic.<p>So Im detoxing and going back tk life without node modules and using jquery a lot more.')
