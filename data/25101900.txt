Again, they pretend to use an impartial &quot;originalist&quot; principle when decision-making but cherry-pick the &quot;original&quot; texts they use or ignore them when they would lead to ruling in a way conservatives don&#x27;t like.<p>How is it &quot;originalist&quot; to take the 2nd Amendment, which refers to &quot;well regulated Militia,&quot; and using it to say there&#x27;s a Constitutional right to owning a handgun for personal protection (without safety requirements like a trigger lock or safe)? It&#x27;s not, yet that&#x27;s what conservatives decided, specifically Scalia in his majority opinion in District of Columbia v. Heller.')
