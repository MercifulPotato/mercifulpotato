The coaches are just that confident in their training and coaching that they are willing to take less experienced players over more experienced, but injured, ones.<p>I didn&#x27;t read it that way, but that&#x27;s an interesting take too. Ties into the end of the article that describes the crushing physicality of rowing.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d ascribe hubris, though: elite level sports is marginal gains theory taken to the extremes.  If a coach evaluates two players as &quot;similarly talented as of today&quot; but one player has years of access to elite coaches whereas the other has only played recreationally or in minor regional tournaments, you couldn&#x27;t look past the potential of the latter. Find enough diamonds in the rough and you&#x27;ll be rich.<p>And if the reality is that it&#x27;s not about diamonds in the rough but actually about finding uninjured players, well â€“ that&#x27;s possibly a sensible optimization to make too.')
