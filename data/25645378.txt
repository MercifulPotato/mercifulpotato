My theory is that we use probability because we don&#x27;t really understand the true &quot;why&quot; of things, or we don&#x27;t know them. For example, we use probabiliy to guide us when playing poker, but that&#x27;s because we don&#x27;t know the cards. Whence we know the cards there is no need for probability.<p>But again, he is probably not speaking about the same &quot;level&quot; of things. I wish I knew more Physics.')
