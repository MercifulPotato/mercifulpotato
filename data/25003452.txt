Most likely. We rarely recompile kernels these days to tailor to some specific hardware, most are supported via modules. It could be that some adjustments are going to be necessary (network interface names? nonfree drivers). For the most part, it should work.<p>Windows? YMMV. 10 is much better than it was before and has more functional disk drivers out of the box. Maybe you need to reactivate.<p>The problem is mostly reproducibility. A system that has lived long enough will be full of tiny tweaks that you don&#x27;t remember about anymore. Maybe it&#x27;s fine for personal use but it has a price.<p>Even personal servers (including Raspberry Pis) I try to keep some basic automation in place so if they give up the ghost, they are cattle. Not pets.')
