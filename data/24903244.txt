Unconscious bias is a concept derived from statistical study and observation. The similarity is that unconscious bias, like original sin, appears to be innate to the human existence---a byproduct of the way we think about the world, the thousands of quick decisions we make subconsciously to go about our days. The parallel doesn&#x27;t make it untrue.<p>The entire point of some exhibits in science museums I&#x27;ve seen is to bring people awareness of optical illusions and help them transition from not knowing that the human eye has some fascinating corner case failure modes to awareness of the existence of those failure modes. And the eye being imperfect doesn&#x27;t make it &quot;worthless,&quot; it&#x27;s a pretty ordinary side effect of evolution in the context where those failure modes are rare to observe.')
