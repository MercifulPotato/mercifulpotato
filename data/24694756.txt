Sure, it&#x27;s not &quot;inaccurate.&quot; But framing is everything, and we&#x27;re increasingly living in an intensely context-free, implicitly dishonest world. I could build a website where all I talk about all day is all the cool things Trump does (he undoubtedly does at least some cool shit) without a single mention of his inadequacies. Would you disagree with the dishonest characterization there?')
