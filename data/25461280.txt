And that’s the problem. The regulation should make bankruptcy or a massive risky change of business Model look attractive and low risk compared to “agree and continue”. Otherwise why would shady sites not try to do exactly what they are doing.<p>Tracking ads are unfair competition. It’s like a business not paying their taxes. The reason you can’t start a site paid by non-tracking ads, is that the competitor uses tracking ads.<p>When tracking ads aren’t an option, the money in “good” advertising goes up. (Or, all the money is concentrated to Apple and Facebook, the bad scenario).')
