Play a sport. Go to meetups. These responses are not wrong, per se, but they&#x27;re one step divorced from the deceptively simple looking actual process of making new friends, which is this:<p>Find people to talk to, and talk to them often. The ones who you like talking to and like talking to you will end up your friends.<p>That&#x27;s all there is to it, but like you already know it&#x27;s harder than it looks, because the problem is finding like-minded people to talk to, and that&#x27;s why you&#x27;re getting a bunch of advice about hobbies. Turns out that people who like certain hobbies tend to enjoy talking about them with other people who enjoy those hobbies. It&#x27;s a proxy for an easy conversation.<p>Those who find it harder to have conversations with strangers will find it harder to make friends, so try to teach yourself that skill, because at some point it&#x27;s all down to being a numbers game.')
