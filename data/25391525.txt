The freedom you get from cooler weather is great from an energy utilization stand point and for allowing safer and more desirable conditions outdoors. Not to mention you have much more beautiful choices of nature in Northern California. Think about whenever you travel to Austin for conferences, it&#x27;s oppressively hot and you basically travel from one air conditioned building to the next. Now imagine 10 years time of increased global warming. California will still be coastal to one of the coldest waters in the world at this latitude, which is a natural air conditioner. To me this spells the end of Oracle&#x27;s supremacy in anything other than selling smaller and smaller volumes of mainframes. They&#x27;ve started focusing further and further on cost reduction.<p>Edit: For those downvoting me, Texas is a wasteland of has-been tech companies that couldn&#x27;t cut it when in competition with the west coast and the rest of the world. Oracle isn&#x27;t going to change that.')
