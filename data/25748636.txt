If you&#x27;re trying to prevent a site (or service or group) reaching a certainly level of mass use then censorship definitely can work. There are a large number of piracy sites blocked in the UK by court order. The blocks are trivial to get round but they are probably effective for a good proportion of UK users.<p>But if the goal of censorship is to completely prevent a leaked fact from being communicated - that&#x27;s much harder (and I&#x27;ll say it&#x27;s practically impossible after a certain point).')
