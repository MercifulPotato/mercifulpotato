Pico VR seems to be the only standalone headset? Don&#x27;t worry about selling them, there were no reported problems with switching Quest&#x2F;Rift to a different account.<p>I still expect existing devices will continue to work with Oculus account. The FB account will be required for slew of upcoming social features, like using same avatar across different games, group of people moving between games,  the Horizon and other social content... If they make existing HW unusable without switching to FB account, they would face class-action lawsuit and media backlash. I think they want to self-regulate as much as possible so they&#x27;ll try to avoid those pesky court rulings.<p>As for your original question, FB doesn&#x27;t care about few hundered dollars across few tens of thousand users that are reluctant to switch to FB accounts. They are playing the long game of becoming the only relevant player in VR&#x2F;AR market.')
