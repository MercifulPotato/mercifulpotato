There are ways to address this with REST, mainly though creating additional endpoints, but that quickly grows out of control for complex applications and requires touching multiple application layers. With GraphQL, the consuming app specifies what it wants returned, and only that data is sent. For Facebook&#x27;s mobile apps, this worked well because you might only want to retrieve a person&#x27;s name and not care about the other 10,000 bits of personal data Facebook has accumulated about them.')
