Bitcoin is up almost 2x the peak from 3 years ago which isn’t that exciting from a ROI perspective.  Tesla for example hit 10x over the last 3 years peak to peak.<p>The current peak might go much higher, but without that \nthe peak to peak growth slowdown may discourage a lot of people long on Bitcoin.  In other words if the price falls to 20k without hitting 100k, you might see a truly giant sell off.<p>PS: Peak to peak growth is what’s important from an long term investment standpoint.  You could have made great returns investing in say gold at the right time, but gold is a terrible option across 40+ year timescales.')
