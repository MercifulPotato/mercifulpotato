I suspect that current circumstances will dictate immediate change. Google Meet is hot on the heels of Zoom. It&#x27;s only a matter of time before their chat service becomes on-par with Slack. A $6&#x2F;mo. chat service is going to be hard to justify on top of a $12&#x2F;mo. GSuite&#x2F;Teams subscription.')
