I&#x27;d like to point out that Rotten Tomatoes is a TV&#x2F;film ratings website and so does not have a rating for that video game. As such, if that <i>is</i> what you meant by LOU2, then you clearly have no idea what you are talking about.<p>RT is also an aggregator of reviews, so any rating on RT of a film like Cuties is not &quot;RT&#x27;s rating&quot;, but rather a score calculated from professional TV&#x2F;film critics. If you think most critics are bad at doing their job then fair enough, but this entire subthread was about a claim that Netflix has terrible programming compared to &quot;Hollywood&quot;. Not sure who you think is better equipped to judge such things besides professional critics, except of course your estimable self.')
