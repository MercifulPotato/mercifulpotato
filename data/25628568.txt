Every pay phone, which was a phone anyone with a couple coins could make anonymous calls from, had this giant book right there for your reference. Everyone knows this, right?<p>If you didn&#x27;t know someone&#x27;s number you could look it up and call them. They wouldn&#x27;t have caller ID so you&#x27;d identify yourself and then you could talk to them.<p>This was 99.99% of the time not a problem.<p>We need to stop freaking out about a &quot;security vulnerability&quot; that does 1&#x2F;50th of a system that everyone used mostly without incident for decades.<p>Besides, none of this information is actually private now, it&#x27;s all still for sale.
