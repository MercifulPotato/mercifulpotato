People are still getting conned when it comes to shoes. Custom designed soles, with padding in the &quot;right&quot; places based on the shape of your foot, in order to &quot;absorb impact&quot; or &quot;correct overpronation&quot;. Which is nonsense and unnecessary unless you have foot deformities. Your foot is perfectly capable of absorbing impact and whatnot. This is all marketing aimed at gullible new runners who want to go from couch to marathon without taking the time to learn proper running technique and without giving their bodies time to adapt to running. All the while ingraining and reinforcing bad running habits. But at least we&#x27;re no longer xraying people&#x27;s feet for no apparent reason, so that&#x27;s a start.')
