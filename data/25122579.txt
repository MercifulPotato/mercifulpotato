If you can’t be bothered to understand a crucial tool you use everyday I don’t know how you expect to be a professional developer. Hell even hobbyists have mastered git and are not running around complaining.<p>“Started using git when GitHub was in beta” what a newbie haha.<p>Saying that git’s distributed nature makes things harder - well it’s the entire nature and point of git to be distributed :)<p>People don’t want simpler, friendlier source control, this is why bzr failed and was abandoned.')
