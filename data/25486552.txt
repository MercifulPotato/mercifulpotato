Item(by='libertine', descendants=None, kids=[25487660], score=None, time=1608475856, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25485989, text='&gt;How many executives and powerful managers are there at CDPR and how many of them have significant development experience?<p>I bet a lot of them, due to the origins of the company.<p>If you&#x27;re talking about something like EA, then I&#x27;d believe they&#x27;d brought in people with more marketing&#x2F;sales skills because they know how to make money.<p>But, it&#x27;s easy to criticize managers - their work has visibility, and they own the responsability of the product (assuming you&#x27;re talking about product managers). They have deadlines as well, or not? It&#x27;s not like deadlines are something arbitrary.<p>Yet it&#x27;s like: developers can deliver bugged software due to limited deadlines&#x2F;bloated features, but management can&#x27;t deliver bad outcomes due to limited deadlines&#x2F;bloated features? Something doesn&#x27;t add up here.<p>Why isn&#x27;t it fair to say that bad developers hide behind tight deadlines? Why not say that simply the dev team isn&#x27;t good enough to pull this off on these timelines?<p>It&#x27;s like time constrains doesn&#x27;t help anyone, and the release a new franchise isn&#x27;t something easy. Right?<p>&gt;So the right thing to do might have been to release a beta version for people who wanted it, say it&#x27;s a beta, and give people back $10 or something. Because if you say it&#x27;s not finished, people are not going to want to pay the full $60.<p>Clearly they wanted to be one of the first &quot;true next gen titles&quot; for PS5&#x2F;Xbox S X, I don&#x27;t even think such platforms allow for beta releases, neither it would make sense to release a beta game in a brand new platform - that would suck for their brands.')
