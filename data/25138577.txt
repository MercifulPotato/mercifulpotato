Would these Facebook employees be happier if Fb decided the equilibrium point was way <i>below</i> SV&#x2F;SF subsistence and reset everyone&#x27;s salary accordingly? &quot;We&#x27;re being fair. Work from wherever you like. Happy now?&quot; I don&#x27;t see that scenario hurting Fb. In fact, if I were Zuck, I might do it to clean house. There are plenty of talented people outside SV&#x2F;SF and I bet they might be less focused on work as a source of free snacks and as a vehicle for their pet political causes.')
