If we can&#x27;t observe glorfball games directly, we look for ways to find out about them indirectly, or outside conditions that might possibly affect glorfball). It&#x27;s not reasonable to posit that glorfball results must be driven by cross-referencing the Da Vinci Code against a message written on the back of the Declaration of Independence, which seems to be what the article is advocating for.')
