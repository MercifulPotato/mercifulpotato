They really were.<p>I remember back in the day the HardOCP forum[0] had massive threads about people buying the FW900 in the mid-2000s. It definitely achieved legendary status. Sadly I never had a chance to use one.<p>I remember having a 21&quot; NEC that let me play Quake 2 &#x2F; 3 at 120hz at 640x480 in the mid-late 1990s and I think I paid like $120 for it back then from one of those refurbished monitor sites. It also did 1600x1200 at 60hz for non-gaming.<p>I still don&#x27;t know how those refurbished sites stayed in business because they offered free shipping, but a decently sized CRT back then used to weigh like 60 pounds (30 kg).<p>Back then I remember waiting so many years to get an LCD because the input latency, refresh rates and color accuracy were horrendous for so long despite being 3x the price.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hardforum.com&#x2F;threads&#x2F;24-widescreen-crt-fw900-from-ebay-arrived-comments.952788&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hardforum.com&#x2F;threads&#x2F;24-widescreen-crt-fw900-from-e...</a>')
