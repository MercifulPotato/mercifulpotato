This was a deliberate choice by the designers of the cryptocurrency because ASICs centralise mining even further.<p>Only real reason to mention bitcoin is that basically all cryptocurrencies go up and down in price with bitcoin, so when bitcoin goes up in price, other cryptocurrencies tend to do so as well, incentivising mining all of them.')
