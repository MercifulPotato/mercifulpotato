If someone wanted to throw a loud party they&#x27;d rent a space for it. That doesn&#x27;t seem common in the USA in my experience. But, having gotten used to it in Japan, it&#x27;s kind of disappointing that it&#x27;s not more common. Sure you can sometimes rent an entire bar or restaurant in the USA but it seems super rare where as it&#x27;s common in Japan. On the other hand, it&#x27;s also not common in the USA to pay for a party but in Japan no one blinks an eye if someone invites you to a party and says &quot;We&#x27;re having a party Friday night. It&#x27;s $30 a person&quot;<p>I know it&#x27;s not entirely the same because it&#x27;s indoors.')
