I was getting at the &quot;political opponents&quot; thing. I feel there&#x27;s a tendency where people like Jack and Zuckerburg get categorized as &quot;not on the right politically&quot;, because they work in tech and live in California I guess. I disagree with that characterization, and my main reason is how they&#x27;ve allowed their platforms to be used.<p>For a very long time now, I&#x27;ve personally seen Twitter being used to amplify regressive, right-wing views while quashing (via suspension or permanent suspension) leftist voices that challenge them. The best way I can describe it succinctly would be a pervasive double-standard when applying their rules. So I, personally, specifically do not believe that Jack or Twitter leadership have aligned themselves politically against the right.')
