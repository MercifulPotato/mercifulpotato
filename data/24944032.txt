I hunt in northern Minnesota, and have really seen the wolf population take off.  Watched a big one walk under my stand a couple years back.  The coyote population is gone and you can hear the howls all around you as they feed on the gut piles.  Nice to see them make a come back.  Seen them up in the BWCA area too - they are making a come back.')
