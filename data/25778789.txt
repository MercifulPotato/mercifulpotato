It&#x27;s mostly described as a wine fork optimized for games. But is it otherwise identical to wine wrt usage? Or is it integrated into steam? If it&#x27;s standalone, should I even still bother trying games on wine? Does code from proton end up back in wine? Could I run other Windows apps with proton instead of wine and benefit, eg CAD software?')
