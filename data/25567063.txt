Tried it on a variety of material that I already know well, from pedagogical texts to academic papers in multiple discipline to legal briefs to news articles, including my own output.<p>I like it. it&#x27;s got potential. With north of 5000 pdfs in my library I&#x27;m extremely open to tools like this, and the methodology seems pretty sensible to me. But at present it feels kind of random - good at picking out summary sentences of what a document section will cover, or emphatically stated conclusions, bad at highlighting necessary context. I wonder if it might be better trained on clauses rather than full sentences, although that&#x27;s probably significantly more work.<p>I&#x27;m sorry I don&#x27;t have a more positive review, but I think it&#x27;s a bold attempt even if it falls short, and want to see where it goes. Even as is, I can see myself using it sometimes as its selections offer an interesting alternative to my own skimming&#x2F;emphasis preferences. Very impressed with the clean no-BS user interface and <i>fast</i> performance.')
