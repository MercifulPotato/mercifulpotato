Item(by='SZJX', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607159478, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25302269, text='&gt; Sounds like they&#x27;re looking for assembly line programmers<p>Feels to me there are a lot of stereotypes and misconceptions about FAANG floating around in this thread, which I guess is not exactly surprising given the type of post this is (criticism of the &quot;broken&quot; interview process).<p>In your case it&#x27;s more understandable if you wouldn&#x27;t like working a conventional job, since you mentioned you&#x27;re not neurotypical (though I guess you would most likely find work at most smaller software shops even more suffocating).<p>However, for the majority of commentators, it almost feels like some people find excuses to not even try, or have some sort of sour grape mentality&#x2F;avert their eyes from the issue, if they feel themselves unlikely to pass the interview, even though they haven&#x27;t spent the time required to master the algorithms questions at all. (Of course, there might also be people who simply find it quite hard to find such time, as mentioned in the article, which is understandable.)<p>My understanding is that those companies themselves also freely acknowledge that interviewing is hard. Due to the sheer volume of applicants, fast algorithms questions is the most reasonable compromise they can find at the moment. If you were in the position of the interviewer, it would also be hard for you to come up with an alternative that works for all sides involved. So instead of complaining about this reality, one needs to face up to the challenge.<p>I would conjecture that most lower-paying &quot;programming&quot; jobs, e.g. writing enterprise Java, are much much more &quot;assembly line&quot; and &quot;soul-sucking&quot; than jobs at top-notch tech companies, which should offer a decent amount of creativity and freedom for one as an ordinary employee.<p>It is actually a paradox: You seem to be unfree and doing something pointless when you were grinding interview questions. But after you&#x27;ve made it, it would suddenly be very easy for you to have a lot of freedom and security in your life with all the capital you have accumulated. In a sense it&#x27;s like how college entrance exams work. It&#x27;s unfortunate but again, if no better <i>practical</i> solution could be found at the moment, one just has to face the reality and do it. It could even be fun. Talking about &quot;ideals&quot; wouldn&#x27;t get you anywhere in the real world.<p>The one valid thing I think you may get by not working for FAANG is complete freedom in shaping what you&#x27;re working on. However this is hard anywhere unless you&#x27;re the founder&#x2F;executive of the company yourself. If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re after and you have the safety to pursue it, sure. However, in terms of working as an ordinary employee, there are very few possible reasons why a place could be better than big tech.')
