Without that, you will have to generate more code than necessary.<p>- WASM&#x27;s representation is very close to what you want in the compiler.  In particular, you can directly tell all incoming control-flow edges, which makes analysis much more precise, gives optimization opportunities you would otherwise miss.  Recreating this information from a binary is either impossible (due to computed branches) or expensive both in terms of analysis and the guards you have to generate to protect your assumptions.')
