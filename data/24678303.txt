All ethical considerations are processed in our brains.<p>This is debatable. Some metaethicists would argue that the ethical realm is much like the mathematical one, and less of a matter of the functioning of the human brain. Further, it seems to me there is a difference between saying &quot;I don&#x27;t like X&quot; and saying &quot;X is morally wrong&quot; - if there is a difference between those two statements (as a moral cognitivist would claim), then deduction of morals from &quot;what feels right&quot; is suspect. The argument of cognitivism vs non-cognitivism is interesting[0].<p>&gt;There are some basic ethical concepts on which human societies tend to universally agree on.<p>The number and reach of those principles is very debatable. Arguments from moral disagreement cast doubt on the extent to which human societies share ethical standards.<p>&gt;humans living in roughly the same social structures<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true at all; post-globalization, there has been a convergence in what social structures look like around the world, but it&#x27;s very clear that humans have had and in many cases still do have a variety of social structures, and with that, a variety of obligations. The moral obligation to do X in Japan, for instance, may be different by virtue of a different social structure.<p>Using neuroscience to &quot;deduce&quot; ethics seems like the ultimate briding of the is-ought gap and I&#x27;m not aware of any professional philosopher or theory who has successfully argued that this is possible. The attempt in Sam Harris&#x27; <i>The Moral Landscape</i> has been shot down from practically every angle imaginable, and I think for good reason.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plato.stanford.edu&#x2F;entries&#x2F;moral-cognitivism&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plato.stanford.edu&#x2F;entries&#x2F;moral-cognitivism&#x2F;</a>')
