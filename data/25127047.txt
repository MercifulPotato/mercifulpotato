Even with noise-cancelling headphones, if I hear any crying at all I feel an incredible emotional reaction that totally prevents me from focusing on work until she&#x27;s calm and happy again. I&#x27;m also glad to read that there&#x27;s a natural (hormonal?) explanation for the disproportionate effect that her crying has on me.')
