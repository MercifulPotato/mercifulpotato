Item(by='dorchadas', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610566983, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25765505, text='I think that&#x27;s absolutely the key, honestly and it&#x27;s why I&#x27;m a fan of AP&#x2F;accelerated courses where at all possible. I also think ability grouping is great as you can work with students of lower ability without having to worry about those with higher ability being bored. I think that you need contact with those who aren&#x27;t self-motivated, even if that&#x27;s live classes they have to attend, as then they know there&#x27;s accountability. But I do think that a good self-motivated learner, <i>who knows how to learn</i> would greatly benefit from just reading texts&#x2F;watching quality videos (while taking notes) and having a teacher to basically ask questions to when needed.<p>Sadly, I&#x27;m not sure how much of the grouping I&#x27;d like to see is legal. I know my school got in trouble for offering &#x27;Core&#x27; classes which were basically remedial education classes in core content areas (So you&#x27;d have &#x27;accelerated algebra 2&#x27;, &#x27;algebra 2&#x27; and &#x27;core algebra 2&#x27;), which worked as you could find ways to focus on real-life examples for those students, but gave rise to a host of other issues. But, overall, I see the only real way to do online learning entirely is through group segregation, at least at the secondary level. Hearing some of our AP teachers complain, it&#x27;d almost need to be a double split -- one on ability <i>and</i> one on motivation.<p>Of course, a lot of the latter, in my opinion, stems from the culture of the area. Sadly I&#x27;m in a rural area where well-paying jobs used to be plentiful right out of high school (or even without a degree!) and so a very anti-intellectual culture developed. Sadly, even though those jobs aren&#x27;t present, the culture stays as most who have other values move out and leave. Me and a few of my colleagues (all from the area) are exceptions, but I know several of us would leave if we could. So you&#x27;re also fighting a cultural battle on top of all the other stuff.')
