The issue I had with previous generations was that a carrier wave (for lack for better word) was always audible, which admittedly wasn&#x27;t as bad as the noise it was cancelling, but it could be annoying for home use when you just wanted to cancel the fridge, AC or similar room tone humming.<p>With current gen ANC from the good brands this sound is very quiet, in some cases bordering on inaudible.
