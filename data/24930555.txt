That something else is Earth&#x27;s rotation. And the only way to take energy out of the system while still conserving momentum is for the Moon to move into a higher orbit while the Earth rotation slows (because the Earth rotation is faster).<p>That can lead to either the Moon being ejected from orbit or to its rotation being locked with the Earth day (that gets very long). Our current configuration leads to the later.<p>But none of those will actually happen. The Earth tides from the Moon rotation are just not relevant enough for them locking on a Sun-like star lifetime.')
