I have no complaints about Preston either. But they are both outliers in the Progressive camp, not the core of it!<p>Edit: from what I know of Preston, at least. I&#x27;m not in SF, just have to deal with the terrible politics there providing cover for conservatives in my area to be reactionary in housing. And this is the core reasons that the Progressives in SF are so bad, they say all sorts of regressive things (like seemingly supporting Prop 13?!) because they are too deep in a culture war to realize the policy that will support the progressive values they claim to support, but all too often, do not. For example refusing to make 100% affordable housing by-right.')
