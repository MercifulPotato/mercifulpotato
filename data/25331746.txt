Though I&#x27;d also say the ones that are seen as &quot;too positive&quot; like Jack Ryan, get criticism from the media even when they try to please both sides by talking of &quot;fixing it from the inside&quot;). Anyway, other examples of negative depictions:<p>In &quot;2 guns&quot; Bill Paxton played a psychopathic CIA agent who ran a contra-stye operation by squeezing drug lords for a cut. Awesome performance by the way.<p>In the recent version of &quot;Dirk Gently&quot; TV series, the CIA operation kidnaps psychics to experiment on them, and eliminates people who know too much or get in the way. Whenever the leader of the operation has a change of heart, he gets replaced with a new one with less scruples. &quot;Mr. Priest&quot; (another awesome character) is the CIA&#x27;s psychopathic fixer brought in &quot;for protocol violations&quot;.')
