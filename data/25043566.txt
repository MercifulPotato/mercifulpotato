The killer is the short answer section. You would waste a lot of time searching for an answer, and if the professor made their own questions you will need to take some time to synthesize bits of information from here or there into an actual answer. Even referring to your notes or lecture materials will chew up valuable time. Sometimes even if you do know everything you are working till the bell.<p>But if you do have repeated questions, there is software that will basically grep the internet for you to catch plagerism. All the students know that going in, so copy and pasting is no go. Sharing answers can land you in trouble if two students don&#x27;t rephrase their answers well enough.<p>All of this can get you kicked out of college and potentially ruin your life with that mark, not to mention the money spent. Still, people do get caught cheating with those risks even before the pandemic.')
