Why stand 8 hours &#x2F; day doing a repetitive manual job if a thing can do it just as well? Why expose yourself to the worst the internet comes up with when you can train an AI to detect CP?<p>I don&#x27;t believe we&#x27;ll see jobs becoming largely obsolete in our lifetime, but I would like to fantasize about a future where work is a choice and everybody can live comfortably (quality housing, food and spending money) even without a job. Not going to happen as long as capitalism and the never ending pursuit of profit and profit increase are still a thing though. But, we&#x27;re seeing some hopeful developments in that regard, with things like UBI and the like.<p>(Aside: I don&#x27;t believe UBI will work in the end, if everyone has a baseline income, nobody does. UBI only works if it&#x27;s coupled with assurances of housing and that it&#x27;s enough to cover all basic needs, which right now depend largely on the area you live in. I couldn&#x27;t get an affordable rental place on my own income some years ago, because first there was a 15+ year waiting list, and later I was earning too much so I was thrown out to the &#x27;free market&#x27;, and there&#x27;s a pretty big gap between the most expensive social housing and the cheapest free market housing. That gap is filled up with &#x27;student&#x27; houses, think houses split up into multiple units &#x2F; rooms. But nobody should be forced to live like that if they&#x27;re out of college and have a paid full-time job.')
