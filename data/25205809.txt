I&#x27;m not up to date on the material these sorts of posts are Hallmark-style-loosely-inspired-by-true-story-esque based on. Edit: FWIW, weikju seems to claim that `sudo reboot` still works correctly (forces a reboot regardless of what the OS wants) as of Catalina; I dunno about `kill -9`-ing the sync.<p>But other than that, yes. I was expecting this to be a legitimate problem like two-factor authentication on the computer.<p>0: by which I mean that both options are available, and you choose which, not that at least one is available.')
