I&#x27;d like to mention a few things that differentiates it from other solution and made me using it:<p>1.) Instead of providing a full featured app for the etesync environment on your pc or smartphone, it provides proxies &#x2F; adapters for the encryption layer that make you use your native tools! What does that mean? I do not need a dedicated etesync calendar app, neither on my smartphone, nor on my desktop. I can add calendars using the etesync adapter to thunderbird and the mobile app provides the calendar natively to android (like davdroid etc).<p>2.) Light-weight. Compared to e.g. the fully blown Nextcloud, it is very lightweight and does what it does very well.<p>3) Open source and easy to self-host.<p>4) Traceability &#x2F; History. Etesync provides a journal so you can see who added a calendar item.<p>5) Easy to use. This corresponds with 1) since you don&#x27;t have to learn a &quot;new&quot; app. You just install it and the rest falls in place :-)<p>I used radicale for my calenders and tasks before but it neither provides encryption nor the functionality to share your calendars with others. I had to create soft-links on my docker by hand if I wanted to share a calendar. I used nextcloud for this, too - but it always felt clumsy.<p>Putting it together: I can highly recommend trying it!')
