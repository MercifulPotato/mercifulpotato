Item(by='Geminidog', descendants=None, kids=[25557554], score=None, time=1609140551, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25557251, text='&gt;&quot;logic is true&quot; from &quot;logic appears true to us but it&#x27;s actual truth status is unknowable&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s just a paradox. No point in going to deep into the paradox as it&#x27;s unresolvable. At best it can be &quot;Assumed&quot; that logic is true. Replace &quot;assume&quot; with &quot;pretend&quot; it&#x27;s the same thing. Science pretends logic is true. Whether it&#x27;s actually true or not is the paradox.<p>&gt;That may be the case in circumstances where it&#x27;s convenient and other forms of analysis serve the function of useful tools or mental aids. However empirical observation always trumps other forms of analysis when they&#x27;re in conflict. Otherwise we&#x27;re no longer discussing science anymore.<p>Sure but this can only be done in conjunction with logic. If you observe evidence and the evidence leads to a conclusion the &quot;leading to a conclusion&quot; is done through logic.<p>Another way to put it is, if logic wasn&#x27;t real no observation would make sense. If I observed a pig, then pigs exist by logic. If logic wasn&#x27;t real then the observation doesn&#x27;t imply pigs exist. By logical analysis, An observation is therefore useless without logic.<p>Suffice to say at this level of analysis we can clearly conclude that Science &quot;pretends&quot; logic and probability are true. Getting deeper into this dives into paradoxes which are ultimately uninteresting dead ends to me because it&#x27;s unresolvable.')
