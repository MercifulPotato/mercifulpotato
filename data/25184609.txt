Did i do that right given they&#x27;re combining the two dosing regime)?<p>Maybe its chance that none of those 39 got really sick. I&#x27;m not sure what the age breakdown of trial participants was- were the people in the oxford trial younger? Did the distribution match the distribution from the mRNA trials? I have no idea.')
