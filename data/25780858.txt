There are people in LA that can provide babies for TV&#x2F;film appearances, preferably twins, with only a few hours notice.  That&#x27;s how the Olsen twins got started.  The entire entertainment industry, from strip clubs to hollywood, is premised on renting people to pretend to be something they aren&#x27;t, to provide personal appearances in places they would otherwise not.  It only become weird when you describe it in non-industry terms.')
