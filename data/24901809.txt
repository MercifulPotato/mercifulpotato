I guess recessions are quite common and ZeroHedge is ... much more reliable than I thought? A scary discovery.<p>If you are planning your investments around not having a recession about once a decade, I&#x27;m unconvinced it will end well for you.<p>Anyway, the point stands - regularly predicting recessions is a sensible approach, and saying ZeroHedge overpredicts is wrong. The normal financial press are reckless in assuming that recessions are not imminent. Looking 5+ years into the future to assess the present state is prudent.')
