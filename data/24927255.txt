We can’t insure away high costs. They just pass through the costs via premium and deductible increases. Even if health insurers were nonprofits that would only directly save us 5%. High deductibles encouraging shopping around but price discovery is very limited as even doctors don’t know how much a service costs. Focusing on price alone is an issue as people don’t know medicine and are unable to evaluate quality so they end up giving five stars for having a private room or suck up staff. What ends up happening is the not well off or frugal avoid care until there’s an undeniable problem. Others consider consuming medical services a dignity not a price and will never give up their low co-pay plans.')
