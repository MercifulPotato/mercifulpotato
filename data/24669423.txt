This honestly feels like a DDoS attack on open-source rather than promoting open-source.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any way to save this.<p>EDIT: I think DigitalOcean completely missed the point on promoting open-source. It&#x27;s not about the PRs. It&#x27;s about everything that goes before you submit your first PR. Reading mailing lists. Actively participating in discussions with the maintainers. Reading the docs. It seems like they wanted an easy way out to promote their brand without putting in the effort to review the PRs and filtering out spam by raising the bar on what qualifies for a PR (i.e. not requiring all the leg-work for writing your first PR).')
