Then you jumped down my throat about pointing out that you’re wrong, and deflected the criticism to my minor point that you swapped the two terms.<p>I’m ready for bed, I had a nice day thanks. I took a small walk, learned a couple of songs and now I’m ignoring the TV while I sketch out designs for a web service, but your deliberate continuing obtuseness is keeping me entertained for the evening.<p>Edit (upon reflection): I&#x27;m salty about the downvotes because I don&#x27;t yet have the karma to downvote comments myself, so I can only reply expressing my negative opinion. This so often results in further downvoting that I get further away from the privilege of a silent dismissal of comments with which I disagree.')
