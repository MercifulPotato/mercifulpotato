To avoid ambiguity it is better to talk about data <i>values</i> and data <i>objects</i> which have different properties. This can be formalized as follows [1]:<p>o data values are modelled via mathematical tuples â€“ tuples are immutable<p>o data objects are modelled via mathematical functions (one field is a function from this reference to the field value) - functions are supposed to be mutable<p>(In reality of course we meet quite different situations, for example, struct is mutable and objects can be immutable.)<p>[1] Concept-oriented model: Modeling and processing data using functions <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;337336089_Concept-oriented_model_Modeling_and_processing_data_using_functions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;337336089_Concept-o...</a>')
