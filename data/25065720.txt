You do have to use the Push to launch clips of a specified length in live performance. There have been very complicated workarounds built by third parties (BinkLooper). I have wondered if this is all a ploy to force people to buy the expensive Push. At any rate, it has definitely kept me from buying Ableton. It is regarded as a live performance tool by many but the lack of this feature, which they could easily add, makes that regard incorrect.')
