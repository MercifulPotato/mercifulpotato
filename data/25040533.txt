But I measured, and it&#x27;s about 2% of the die.<p>&gt; If they had cared about speed, they would not have shoehorned it into 18 pins.<p>My interpretation is that the 8008 team didn&#x27;t have any control over Intel&#x27;s bizarre 18-pin limit, but improving speed by adding carry lookahead was something they could do. Even so, the 8008 was slower than the Datapoint 2200&#x27;s processor that it was supposed to replace and Datapoint abandoned the 8008.')
