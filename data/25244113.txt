Governments have limited ability to micromanage their contractors - in fact, a reason to hire a PMC is to <i>outsource micromanagement</i>. You tell them where to be and what to do, and they manage themselves.<p>Now if you give a company permission to use violence and legal cover, the obvious thing happens - the companies start to do their own things on the side. Documented cases include murder, smuggling of alcohol and weapons, sex trafficking and host of other evil acts[0].<p>&gt; <i>I think the Telecom and Orange one is more of some people within the corporations hand in hand with some people within the government.</i><p>That&#x27;s true, but this is always the case with large corporations. Private markets and governance aren&#x27;t independent - they&#x27;re very much intertwined. Power begets money begets power. Trying to talk about government vs. private interests, we have to remember that the boundary between them is very fuzzy - the separation makes sense when economists talk about bakeries and barbers and mom&amp;pop stores. It breaks down as you approach bigger and more wealthy companies[1].<p>--<p>[0] - Bunch of examples listed at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Private_military_company" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Private_military_company</a>.<p>[1] - Hell, you could say it breaks down as soon as company&#x27;s wealth or influence approaches the wealth or influence of the political unit in which it&#x27;s embedded. It&#x27;ll take a megacorp to seriously play on the national politics stage, but even a humble factory can have huge impact on county politics if it employs a significant chunk of said county&#x27;s population.')
