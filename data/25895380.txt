The wine was probably manipulated with specific strains of bacteria that don&#x27;t play well with oxygen.<p>With white wines, I&#x27;m one of those people who migrated towards Rieslings, especially the German Rheinhessen ones, and found that to be a pleasant experience. Sweeter wines tend to keep better, but a well-crafted Riesling will still have some dryness to it (although I&#x27;m probably not using that work in the strict sense).')
