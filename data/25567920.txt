Basically every childcare of colleagues with children has been shut down at one point in October&#x2F;November (when the numbers started rising here) due to infections among the children. In most cases one or multiple of the families have been completely infected as a result of that, and I guess the only reason it hasn&#x27;t spread around the workplace is due to good precautions.')
