Also, the ES6 standard library is not as bad as people claim.<p>The real problem is with development dependencies. The amount of dependencies required by Babel, Webpack and ESLint are the cause for 99% of the dependency bloat we complain about in JS projects. Those projects prefer to have monorepos, but when it&#x27;s in your machine they&#x27;re splitted into tens or hundreds of dependencies. Also remember that left-pad was only an issue in 2015 because a Babel package required it. If those projects were able to get it together we wouldn&#x27;t even be having this conversation. Solve this and you&#x27;ll solve the biggest complaints people have about JS.<p>I really would like to see a discussion on this, as most people seem to put a lot of blame on JS as a whole, while it&#x27;s mostly a handful of popular projects generating <i>all</i> the complaints.')
