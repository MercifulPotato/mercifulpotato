Queries will need to touch a lot of data - will cost a lot, and there is no ability to optimize the queries in any way (no EXPLAIN, no indexes, no downsampling)<p>2. No integration with data exploration and visualization tools<p>3. No ability to have non-timeseries data, or correlate any data in two different tables (no JOINs)<p>(Disclaimer: I work at TimescaleDB)')
