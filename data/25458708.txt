That&#x27;s well over a decade. Microsoft bet a huge amount of resources on NT because they could see that DOS was never going to work on in the long term, especially on servers. There&#x27;s no reason for them to spend so much resources and time on a switch a *nix kernel when there&#x27;s (currently) nothing like that at stake with the NT kernel.<p>Longhorn was the codename for Vista, which just used the same NT kernel as before (with some feature improvements, just like in every new Windows release).')
