These kinds of science-y puff pieces come out every day, on all kinds of topics (I can&#x27;t count the number of times claims around cancer cures, fusion reactors, new battery technology that&#x27;s 1000x better, etc. are made). This is one engineering group making very preliminary case (that they may have embellished for the media attention - wouldn&#x27;t the first time - see: recent &quot;life on Venus claims&quot;).
