So the patient data actually shows that the vaccine achieved its maximum efficacy ~12 days after the 1st dose, not necessarily related to the 2nd dose at all.<p>Original comment:<p>I don&#x27;t know where you&#x27;re getting this, but the Pfizer paper [0] clearly shows that disease prevalence is much lower after the second dose:<p>&gt; Among participants with and those without evidence of prior SARS CoV-2 infection, 9 cases of Covid-19 at least 7 days after the second dose were observed among vaccine recipients and 169 among placebo recipients, corresponding to 94.6% vaccine efficacy (95% CI, 89.9 to 97.3).<p>&gt; Between the first dose and the second dose, 39 cases in the BNT162b2 group and 82 cases in the placebo group were observed, resulting in a vaccine efficacy of 52% (95% CI, 29.5 to 68.4) during this interval and indicating early protection by the vaccine, starting as soon as 12 days after the first dose.<p>You are right about the severe cases though - they had 1 in the vaccine group and 4 in the placebo group, which is far too little data to draw any meaningful conclusions from (it&#x27;s also worth noting that the single severe case in the vaccinated group occurred &gt;7 days after the second dose, so there is absolutely no data to draw conclusions on severe  disease impact with a single dose).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nejm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1056&#x2F;NEJMoa2034577" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nejm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1056&#x2F;NEJMoa2034577</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nejm.org&#x2F;na101&#x2F;home&#x2F;literatum&#x2F;publisher&#x2F;mms&#x2F;journals&#x2F;content&#x2F;nejm&#x2F;2020&#x2F;nejm_2020.383.issue-27&#x2F;nejmoa2034577&#x2F;20210108&#x2F;images&#x2F;img_xlarge&#x2F;nejmoa2034577_f3.jpeg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nejm.org&#x2F;na101&#x2F;home&#x2F;literatum&#x2F;publisher&#x2F;mms&#x2F;jour...</a>')
