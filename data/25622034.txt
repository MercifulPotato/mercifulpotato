From the manual:<p>&gt; [Once a variable is set to undefined], it is no longer possible to detect that the value is undefined. undefined means the value could be anything, even something that is nonsense according to the type. Translated into English, undefined means &quot;Not a meaningful value. Using this value would be a bug. The value will be unused, or overwritten before being used.&quot;<p>&gt; In Debug mode, Zig writes 0xaa bytes to undefined memory. This is to catch bugs early, and to help detect use of undefined memory in a debugger.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ziglang.org&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;master&#x2F;#undefined" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ziglang.org&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;master&#x2F;#undefined</a>')
