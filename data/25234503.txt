However, I do think there&#x27;s sense in the general premise of &quot;hire people who care about what they do&quot;, but this doesn&#x27;t need to translate to &quot;work your ass off&quot;.<p>A lot of the time when I see people produce really crap code it&#x27;s because they just don&#x27;t care. They show up for work and anything that meets the minimal standards is fine with them. There&#x27;s no passion or interest in doing more than absolutely needed. This isn&#x27;t about &quot;hours worked&quot;, but about passion and trying to make whatever you&#x27;re working on the best it can be. You can do that perfectly fine in just 40 hours&#x2F;week.<p>But yeah, some people seem to conflate &quot;passion&quot; with &quot;work your ass off for 60+ hours&#x2F;week&quot;, and that&#x27;s just silly.')
