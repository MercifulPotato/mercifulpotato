They want a working application, that does what it promises, and is dependable. Things like having an underlying server is just an implementation detail, nobody really cares (talking about the big public here, not the more technical users of HN who might have a say about the technology choices, but are overall a very small portion of potential users)<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean the implementation should be sloppy, though! Make sure to iron out all those security concerns regarding 127.0.0.1, because it could cause a data breach or some other severe damage. Other than that, just aim to provide the best user experience.')
