The better question is, would offsite talent (at or above the quality of onsite talent) be willing to do the job for less.  I would hazard a yes to that because of the drastic difference in savings rate in low CoL areas.  E.g. would be willing to make 30% less to live in a CoL area where your CoL is 40% less?  If the delta in CoL exceeds the delta in pay change, I bet this takes off.')
