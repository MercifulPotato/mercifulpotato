As far as I can tell the modern word &#x27;stoic&#x27; does not give a good idea of what Stoicism is about.\nIn regards to feelings, I believe the idea behind Stoicism is happiness can be found as a result of not letting ourselves suffer from &#x27;unreasonable&#x27; thoughts.<p>To quote wikipedia: &quot;... the Stoics held that unhappiness and evil are the results of human ignorance of the reason in nature. If someone is unkind, it is because they are unaware of their own universal reason, which leads to the conclusion of unkindness.
