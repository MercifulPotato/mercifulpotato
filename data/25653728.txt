They couldn&#x27;t hope to occupy any such territory. Ergo - they can only materially be used for defence. Besides - anything else and the entire world (including the US) would turn on them.<p>Israel&#x27;s nukes has not caused others to seek nukes really - that&#x27;s far flung. Iran is not threatened in any way by Israel.<p>Ironically - the opposite is true: Iran&#x27;s nukes will destabilize the entire region and cause major problems. Saudi has access to nuke tech from Pakistan, and if Iran ever for a moment brandishes such a weapon, they will magically appear in Saudi very quickly.<p>Other players are likely to be able to overcome the geopolitical pressure to avoid them, but the fact is &#x27;they would want to have them&#x27;.<p>Nobody is afraid of Israel, but almost everyone around Iran is afraid of Iran.<p>The &#x27;conflict&#x27; in the ME is no longer Israel vs. Egypt an everyone else, now, it&#x27;s Iran vs. Saudi and everyone else.')
