I could try to guess what you&#x27;re referring to, but I don&#x27;t want to put words into your mouth.<p>(An uncharitable interpretation of what you said would lead me to believe that you&#x27;re objecting not to &quot;virtue signaling&quot; but to virtue itself, which is not a helpful assumption for me to make).')
