Item(by='gravitas', descendants=None, kids=[24758977], score=None, time=1602532547, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24748522, text='I wasn&#x27;t stating my question clearly, apologies - I&#x27;m on board with the reasons and the theories (and do not argue), but here&#x27;s where my brain is having a problem - why not invest in the index fund <i>until</i> you&#x27;re 65 and then roll it over into a TDF at 65? You get more bang for the buck even paying the capital gains tax after 15 years and taking the money you earned and have more TDF buying power. You (me) do not need the benefits of the TDF until I actually retire (well I won&#x27;t, am I common?).<p>Parameters for my math: already-income-taxed dollars; $1200 one-time investment in 2006 (no re-investments of dividends, etc.) and capital gains of 15% (middle tier). Just to make the math round nicely and account for gains tax for a rollover and forum comment. :)<p><pre><code>    2006 - buy\n    VFINX @ 120 == 10 shares\n    VTWNX @  20 == 60 shares\n\n    2020 - sell\n    VFINX @ 325 == (325*10)*.85 == 2762.50\n    VTWNX @  35 == ( 35*60)*.85 == 1785.00\n</code></pre>\nSo if our sample 45yo person had placed their $1200 into VFINX in 2006, they could have sold it in 2020, paid 15% in gains tax and purchased ...eh, let&#x27;s say 78 shares of VTWNX, a +16 share gain over just buy-and-hold of 60x VTWNX until 2020. In 2020 this sample person is now 60 and eligible to withdraw without penalty (thinking a Roth IRA here, my model). Remember that this target date is marketed at and intended for people who retire on or close to that year, so our sample person who buys it in 2006 is 45yo (the target audience). It is not expected this fund would have been purchased by a 20yo in 2006, logically.<p>This is where I&#x27;m not following why it was better for this person to buy and hold VTWNX for 15y instead of increasing gains with VFINX first, then rolling it over into that more &quot;bond-like&quot; scenario later. Feels like I&#x27;m leaving money on the table as 40 years of market data shows the index @8.25% just keeps going up over time (even when you lose like in 2009 with a low of $68, the loss is still higher than 1995 value of $55 without inflation adjustments).')
