Just look at Busy Beaver function to appreciate how quickly this grows with amount of available memory: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Busy_beaver" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Busy_beaver</a><p>Basically, Busy Beaver function tells how long a program, given an amount of memory, can execute and still terminate.<p>This fantastic function is my favorite function if we ever play a game of &quot;who can think a function that grows faster&quot;.<p>As a corollary, since every real life program has finite memory, it is not possible to construct a non-terminating program that will not repeat its output. Knowing this you just construct a simple program that looks for cycle in the program state.')
