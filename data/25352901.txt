Being stuck in a chair all day isn&#x27;t good, but there&#x27;s no need to change your thinking about exercise. They seem to be two independent things.<p>From what I&#x27;ve read (I&#x27;m no kind of expert, so don&#x27;t just trust my interpretation), is that sitting can interfere with your blood circulation. It constricts blood flow to your legs, and when you&#x27;re sitting you aren&#x27;t contracting your leg muscles which is part of what helps move blood around your lower body. It&#x27;s not so much that sitting itself is bad for you; it&#x27;s sitting for so long without moving.<p>So just... move around. I love having a sit&#x2F;stand desk but if that isn&#x27;t something you can do then just get in the habit of frequently getting up from your desk and walking around a bit. If you need to think about something, do it while you walk. Pretend you have a smoking habit and you need to get up for a cigarette every 20 or 30 minutes. Once you get used to frequently moving around you&#x27;ll start to become sensitive to sitting down for too long. I can&#x27;t sit through a movie at a movie theater anymore because I get this overwhelming urge to get up and move around.')
