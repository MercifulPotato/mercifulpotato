If they think that differently, then they wouldn&#x27;t even think twice about using said power to censor.<p>In this case, Twitter et al. thought a LOT about what to do, as they did very little for 4 year&#x27;s of Trump&#x27;s presidency, and only decided to act after Trump incited a literal self-coup and insurrection with the goal of illegitimately keeping himself in power.<p>If in the future &quot;those who think completely differently from me&quot; are going to think liberal ideas are so dangerous to be removed, it won&#x27;t matter what &quot;standard&quot; we set today. It seems even with the highest standard of &quot;don&#x27;t support open coups&quot;, you still think I will be judged the <i>exact</i> same.<p>Censorship is bad. But insurrections against legitimate governments are worse.')
