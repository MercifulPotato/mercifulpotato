Yes, this would be the correct response from Russia. But it&#x27;s quite likely the US would find that a much easier thing to deal with than the ICBMs (and SLBMs) were for the last 60 years.<p>1. Hypersonic weapons. They don&#x27;t have enough range. The Russian officials claim the Kh-101 missile has a range of 4500km, but it&#x27;s more likely it&#x27;s about 1500 km. That&#x27;s quite bad, but defenses can be set up\n2. 100 MT TNT autonomous submersible drones. To have their purported devastating effect, they need to blow up close to the shore, otherwise they don&#x27;t create a huge tsunami. It&#x27;s not a slam dunk that the Russians are able to sneak in such a drone close to the US shores.\n3. Nuclear powered cruise missiles. They do have the range, and they appear quite scary. If Russia makes advances in this, it would be a benefit for humankind, as this technology could be used in space exploration. The MAD doctrine could be alive and well, but we&#x27;d end up with a powerful new tool in our toolbox for exploring the Solar system. Elon Musk would not be very upset.')
