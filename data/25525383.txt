I would also hijack interrupt 9 (I think) to capture keyboard so that I would pop up a small text mode window to display the current state&#x2F;status when you clicked the magic key combo (ctrl+shift+9 for example). The dialog would vanish and background restored as soon as the keys were let go. Miss that time. The size of my binary was a little over 1K (written in assembler).')
