I spent the entire &quot;vacation&quot; in pain, weakness, and&#x2F;or headaches, but now they are gone (as is the money spent on treatment). I need to check if this has anything to do with my shitty home chair and couch or just being in the office. It would be very nice if the problem was in the furniture.<p>Upd: no, itâ€™s not <i>that</i> virus (tested). And I had the same problem in March when everyone went to &quot;holidays&quot; for a month. Hell, as I write this I get more and more of it... Thank you, thread.')
