And the content was quite good.<p>By this same metric, the Switch is also plagued with &quot;mobile titles&quot; given it&#x27;s Android base and Tegra X1 mobile GPU. But most folks DON&#x27;T think of it like that, and for good reason: the Switch can keep up just fine in it&#x27;s own market.<p>And if the Quest 2 has improved specs in every area over the Quest 1, then it&#x27;s completely FINE for what it is.<p>It&#x27;s just the company behind it fucked up a good thing.')
