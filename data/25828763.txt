Now I have an extremely powerful tool in my belt that solves problems that most dynamic languages cannot solve [adequately].<p>But I&#x27;m not going to learn yet another dynamic language if that won&#x27;t make me any money or expose me to a new way of thinking, no. Nor will I relearn C++.<p>Furthermore, if I make a comeback to JS then I&#x27;ll prefer to learn TypeScript and pick the most productive tools for it (Parcel struck me as mostly getting out of the way).<p>I get the overall sentiment of the article even if it expresses it rather poorly.<p>It has a good point, though; many of us the programmers are rather capricious and spoiled and get distracted by new shinies -- as opposed to learning several skills deeply and be then very useful to the business we&#x27;re serving.<p>We easily forget that we do what we do for money.')
