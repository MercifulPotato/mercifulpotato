It seems to be one camp or the other, blind fear or blind approval, with little room for thought.<p>I honestly hate anti-vaxxers with incredible intensity now.  Before they were an annoyance, now they have destroyed all intelligent discourse on this current topic.<p>For logical concerns, another example is an earlier, mouse brain derived Japanese encephalitis vaccine.  Pulled, due to suspected prions causing brain swelling, and death.   It should be noted that these effects were not seen until  <i>years</i> after a peron received vaccination.<p>It does not matter that current vaccine $x does not &quot;work that way&quot;, instead, it is well known that some vaccines will be troublesome.<p>This is not anti-vaxxer, I have all standard vaccinations, for they are tested, years of use behind them, safer than the alterative.<p>Yet it is so hard to find accurate info, everything is filled with crazy, emotionally based screaming and decision making, it&#x27;s infuriating.')
