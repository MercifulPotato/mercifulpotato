First, while most describe the Enlightenment as novel, almost noone describes it arising <i>ex nihilo</i> rather than as a product of preexisting social forces, both building on and reacting against things present in its immediate context.<p>Second, while obviously it arose in a largely Christian context, there were significant non-Christian influences, and particularly the repopularization of pre-Christian influence (in part from interaction with contemporary non-Christian cultures) played a significant role in the Renaissance which itself set the stage for the Enlightenment.<p>&gt; For example, the idea of universal human worth, human rights, and subsequently democracy (in the sense of every human being, not the Ancient Greek kind), is absolutely rooted in a Christian context.<p>Much of our idea of human rights is a reaction <i>against</i> the practices on all sides of the divides within Western Christendom.<p>&gt; Had a different society had the industrial revolution first, things might be very different.<p>Sure, social evolution is path dependent. And if we adopted a cladistic taxonomy of belief systems, those stemming from the Enlightenment might usefully described as being subsets of &quot;Christianity&quot; because of their origin. But while cladistic taxonomy makes some sense for biological life, it really doesn&#x27;t make sense for social movements.<p>&gt; Or to ask a different question: if your values and actions indicate you as a group of X, but you vehemently deny (only with words) being a member of X, what does that mean?<p>It probably means that you and the people who think your &quot;values and actions&quot; make you part of X have radically different definitions of &quot;X&quot;, and are essentially speaking different languages on that point.')
