Item(by='EricE', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609563708, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25606339, text='&gt;The primary lesson I learnt is that it doesn&#x27;t matter if you work hard. Nobody notices, and even if they do you will likely not get anything out of it. Do your job, but don&#x27;t kill yourself over it. Work-life balance is king.<p>I dunno - I worked hard, especially early in my career and people noticing lead to four new jobs, two of which included substantial pay&#x2F;benefit raises.  Then again more than a bit of that hard work was on cross-organizational teams; I wasn&#x27;t acting solely in my direct organizational unit.<p>So hard work can pay off if you are doing it somewhere it is visible by others.  Getting involved in working groups outside of your company, even if you have to do it after hours, is a great way to network and help others notice your work ethic.<p>I see far too many people who burrow into their current organization and then just bitch about it without doing something about it.  If people can&#x27;t see you they won&#x27;t be able to recognize your work.<p>This isn&#x27;t directed at you but just a general observation - if you don&#x27;t like your current organization, get proactive and do something about it.  I have little sympathy for people who just complain without doing anything.')
