But either (1) pardoning; or (2) failing to pursue within USA; is a tall order.<p>It licences the principle that intelligence can be leaked without legal consequence &quot;by the conscience&quot; of the leaker.<p>Is that really how intelligence should be conducted? Most people are idiots; and do not know the ramifications of what they do.<p>It is perfectly reasonable for something to be both moral and illegal, and remain punishable. Ie., it is Good that these leaks occured, but nevertheless, we require the leakers to pay some cost for it.<p>If that cost is &quot;in practice&quot; merely exile from the country, that seems a reasonable compromise.')
