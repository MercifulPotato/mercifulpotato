While desktop and web support is still in dev&#x2F;beta state, I successfully use it in production already and it&#x27;s total game changer in terms of productivity and fun to code.<p>SRS app like yours will work on all 6 platforms with near-native performance (web might be a bit slower, but will produce pixel-by-pixel same UI as mobile&#x2F;desktop) and I don&#x27;t see any obstacles.<p>It&#x27;s not like my backlog is not overloaded, but I would love to join a project if there is a chance to contribute. I want great SRS too badly for too long :)')
