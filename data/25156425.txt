You don&#x27;t have to use features you believe are &quot;so complicated&quot;. Just don&#x27;t use them. You said you love typescript, and everything you love about typescript remains intact to your satisfaction. It&#x27;s not as if these features emerge spontaneously from a vacuum, the typescript team is working with the community to address specific needs. You didn&#x27;t even offer any specific criticisms, just a vague dismissal. Just don&#x27;t use it.')
