I do like it in this context :)<p>- as I have to get off&amp;on the bus and 2 trains, I just keep it on all the time while commuting. The recommendations are not to touch the mask&#x27;s external surface (and not to indirectly get in contact with it), keeping it on all the time seems to be the least dangerous option.<p>- wearing glasses while wearing as well a mask can be very challenging (fogging); once I finally manage to make everything work (dozens of tiny adjustments) I &quot;freeze&quot; my setup and keep it like that until I know that I won&#x27;t need the mask anymore.<p>Therefore, nothing extreme going on if you see me driving or walking alone with the mask on - just being practical :)')
