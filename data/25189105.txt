If it works on the machines the company needs, then it&#x27;s good enough. I get that some of the heavy weight libraries offer not only the speed of immediate working availability with &quot;battle&quot; tested compatibility (thinking web&#x2F;javascript libraries specifically). However, I like learning. I like understanding why things work, or more importantly why something didn&#x27;t work. If that means I have to re-learn something others already know, then so be it (that&#x27;s what learning is).')
