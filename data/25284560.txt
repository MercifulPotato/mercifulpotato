Every company I&#x27;ve ever worked had some wiggle room with salary and equity, but when it came to the legal terms, they were not negotiable. I tried the cute &quot;redlining&quot; thing a few times, and without exception it always ended up with a stern letter from Legal: &quot;Sign it unmodified or GTFO!&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know who all these Captains Of Industry are who claim to be able to actually negotiate any of these terms with their company&#x27;s legal department. Unless you are some kind of unicorn super-star or exec, I don&#x27;t see any company wanting to deal with the hassle of negotiating a special snowflake contract for you.')
