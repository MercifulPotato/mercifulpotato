Their &quot;Fall economic update&quot; explains why there is no budget. Their deficit is $381 billion. Yet they are talking about socialized childcare?<p>To be clear, Canada&#x27;s total debt that built up since the 1980s is ~$750 billion. In 2020 alone the deficit of an equivalent of 20-30 years of government debt.<p>Who is to pay for all this spending? Well it&#x27;s simple. We can look to our largest industries. Mining&#x2F;Oil&#x2F;Gas is actively being harmed and can&#x27;t even afford themselves. Manufacturing was destroyed by christia freeland. Government taxes destroyed bombardier which is now being sold off. Little to airbus, little to alstom.<p>So we know exactly who is left in Canada to pay the bills. FIRE. Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate.<p>Finance are the ones who get to handle and manage the debt. So let&#x27;s be realistic, Insurance and real estate left. Oh right, record low interest rates, possibly going negative. Real estate is being propped up by the government trying to prevent explosion.<p>I guess Insurance will be the one holding the entire debt?')
