And I do not snack at all.  I only have 3 meals a day.  And I try hard to get a lighter dinner (dinners here are generally too big for me).<p>I don&#x27;t like to go to parties with an empty stomach, because of the poor choice of food there (chips, salsa, cake, cookies, etc.).  If I go with an empty stomach, I know I would not resist, and I would feel sick and bloated later, high on sugar &amp; salt, and dehydrated with alcohol.<p>Just don&#x27;t snack.')
