Living in the south this was quite apparent to me. This is structural in nature, and quite distinct from normal majority&#x2F;minority dynamics.<p>But I don&#x27;t perceive any similar &quot;white privilege.&quot; To go to your resume example, I&#x27;ve got a last name that&#x27;s definitely Muslim, but I&#x27;ve never perceived any sort of difference in response on that basis. (And in myriad areas, from income policing to health, statistically I&#x27;m likely to enjoy advantages compared to white people.) I think the concept of &quot;white privilege&quot; is actually a conceptual error that comes from generalizing Black-white racial dynamics to a multi-ethnic society.<p>Also, to address your point about the KKK member, the left uses &quot;racism&quot; to mean a lot more than just that. Based on that expansive definition of &quot;racism&quot; I&#x27;d qualify use of phrases like &quot;unbearable whiteness&quot; as &quot;racism&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vanityfair.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;the-unbearable-whiteness-of-storming-the-capitol" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vanityfair.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;the-unbearable-white...</a>')
