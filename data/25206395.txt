What Apple is delivering in the M1 continues to be 2 generations ahead of the Qualcomm&#x27;s best in terms of performance an the +10% uplift on the usual +20% generational increase isn&#x27;t changing that - Apple has been doing that level of improvement consistently every generation so Qualcomm can&#x27;t &quot;catch up&quot; by doing the same in some generations.<p>I&#x27;m generally not a fan of Apple as a company and own no Apple products but I&#x27;ve long acknowledged what they&#x27;ve been doing in mobile hardware has been miles better than what the competition has been doing - this isn&#x27;t some sudden upset and entrance just a on-pace continuation of what has been going on for years.
