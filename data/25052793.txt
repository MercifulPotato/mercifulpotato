Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605046625, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25052458, text='&gt; my above source is (probably) using exit poll data, which we should be a bit suspicious about.<p>Normally, exit polling aren&#x27;t too problematic, but exit polls in <i>this</i> election when &quot;vote in person&quot; vs. &quot;vote by mail&quot; has been a matter itself of intense partisan division, well... There&#x27;s a fairly obvious built-in bias compared to the electorate at large.<p>&gt; I was reading an analysis today that suggested Dems may continue to lose these groups - and they will be losing them to the Republicans ( [2] but note the source and that&#x27;s it opinion and give the appropriate grain of salt). Given how uncomfortably close 2020 has been for the Dems, I would not rest on my laurels and assume we&#x27;ll just continue to come out ahead in these groups.<p>I&#x27;m not sure there is a grain of salt large enough for &quot;analysis&quot; from the Editor-in-Chief of the Washington Examiner which rests on no apparent actual data. That said, I think complacency is never good, and I think the Democratic Party should be active asking how it can serve all kind of communities better, including black, hispanic, and other racial&#x2F;ethnic minorities (and the working class generally, and...)<p>But there&#x27;s a difference between that and believing that there is clear (or even strongly suggestive) evidence of a particular problem with certain particular communities (I think there is, but more with the working class than race&#x2F;ethnic minorities, right now; but I think that means we need greater additional effort in the &quot;working class&quot; area, not an absence of it in the others.)')
