Twitter and social media would explode with rage.<p>Can people on HN explain why this double standard exists in America?<p>It&#x27;s okay to punch up but not punch down. Doesn&#x27;t that already say a lot about the racial hierarchy in America? Doesn&#x27;t this suggest that society considers blacks to be at the bottom of socioeconomic order and need to be &quot;protected&quot; at a politically correct level but refuse to offer the same vigilance when it comes to their economic well being?')
