The idea is that the absolute lowest levels of firmware remain signed and controlled, while giving the option of loading unsigned code on top.<p>So in theory, you get the best of both worlds. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything really stopping Apple from doing this, but as many others have said, it&#x27;s not really their jam ;)')
