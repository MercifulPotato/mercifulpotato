Even small companies can raise a ton of funding if investors think they have the potential to become very big. Some of this money trickles down to the engineers.<p>It&#x27;s a lot easier for US companies to become large because the domestic market is huge and there is a common language and regulatory framework. The EU does have a common market but there are still more language&#x2F;regulatory barriers to expansion than in the US. The EU is also much poorer than the US. France has a lower GDP per capita than Alabama, and they are one of the wealthier EU states. This means it&#x27;s harder to make money selling to European consumers.')
