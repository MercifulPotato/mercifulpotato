It seems like what you&#x27;re saying may be true, but on the other hand you have cars like the White Zombie.  (I know it&#x27;s builder, John Wayland; he&#x27;s giving me advice in my own more modest conversion.)  The car started out as about a 1500 pound 70&#x27;s Datsun, and with a dual-motor setup and some expensive batteries it can supposedly do 0-60 in about 1.7 seconds or so.  If the Leaf is already at the point where adding more power doesn&#x27;t help because you&#x27;d just spin the tires, how do cars like the White Zombie get around that?<p>The Leaf is front wheel drive I believe whereas the White Zombie is rear wheel drive.  That probably accounts for some of it.  Maybe the WZ also has a limited slip differential and some kind of high-traction tires?  I don&#x27;t know; drag racing is pretty far outside my area of expertise.<p>(Another random anecdote about the White Zombie: according to John, he always wanted to have a transmission, but they kept breaking whenever he tried to use one, so eventually he just settled on direct drive.)')
