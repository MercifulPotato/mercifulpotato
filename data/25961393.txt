We&#x27;re trying for a specific kind of conversation here: thoughtful, curious, respectful. That requires avoiding flamebait.<p>Re HN: I think you might be falling prey to the notice-dislike bias, which is a variation of sample bias where the comments we hate start to feel like they dominate the site. They don&#x27;t dominate the siteâ€”HN is divided much as society (all over the world) is divided. But it <i>feels</i> like they do, because painful data points land harder and make deeper impressions than the things one likes or agrees with. The people who have opposite views to yours see HN as dominated by <i>their</i> opposite side (which is to say, your side), because of exactly the same mechanism.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=notice%20dislike%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=notice%20dislike%20by:dang&amp;dat...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=demons%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=demons%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23308098" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23308098</a>')
