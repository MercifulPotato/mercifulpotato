Some things didn’t work like randomly opening the laptop and nothing appears on the screen.<p>It was ok, but I missed critical apps like, iTerm2, Tableplus, Nice email client like Mac Mail etc. (Today might be different to when I tried this 3 years ago)<p>Then WSL 1 came out and I thought i’ll try windows again, purchased a surface, but the UNIX features just wasn’t compatible with what I needed.<p>In the end I purchased a new Macbook Pro again.<p>WSL 2 might change things and I might end up back on Windows one day, but I really wish I could simply just use a Linux distro as a desktop daily driver, that’s my ultimate desire.<p>For now I use a Mac. For two reasons, It 99% of the time just works and great app support and it’s unix subsystem.')
