In addition to notes, I do software planning and cost estimating.  I prefer this to a &quot;real&quot; spreadsheet application, because they are mostly text, with a few important numbers.  Those numbers can still easily be added to computations.<p>Also, stubbornly, I prefer my comfortable emacs environment to the clicky unfamiliar interface of something like Google Sheets &#x2F; Excel.  Finally, org-export is fairly infinite in potential.  I actually sync these notes to GitHub, which displays the org file as Github-Flavored Markdown -&gt; HTML without even needing to export.  The tables export very nicely, and are easily consumable in a read-only fashion by those who asked for them.')
