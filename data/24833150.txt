It&#x27;s supposed to be killing me and it&#x27;s supposed to cost up to a quarter of a million dollars annually to treat under conventional medical approaches.<p>There&#x27;s no reward for being poor. My poverty hasn&#x27;t grown. I used to be homeless. I&#x27;ve gotten myself off the street.<p>I&#x27;ve saved an estimated $9.5 million over the last 19 years in terms of what should have been spent on medical care for me and my oldest son but wasn&#x27;t because of the diet and lifestyle based approach we have pursued.<p>I would like to get support for what I&#x27;m doing via Patreon. I face credibility challenges and sexism is a factor and yadda.<p>I would appreciate it if you would leave me alone. Someone who claims to be familiar with my writing and can reference something I said in 2009 but has zero understanding of the reasons I remain poor and then asks questions like this that amount to victim blaming isn&#x27;t something I need in my life at all.')
