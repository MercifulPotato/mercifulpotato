Then legit users can create an ID once and use it indefinitely, but also create as many as they like and replace them as often as they like for a relatively low price.<p>Meanwhile spammers pay $5 for an ID that only lasts ten seconds before it gets banned and has all its messages retroactively deleted, so they go out of business.')
