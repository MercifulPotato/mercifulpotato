By 6 years they&#x27;re rotten and not economically viable, but still contribute to fires - this was a problem in 2020.<p>3) Generally scheduled, controlled burns only quickly burn the forest floor (detritis like branches, deadfalls, etc.) and some outside bark, which trees evolved to tolerate, and not the inner core of trees, so doesn&#x27;t affect logging.<p>When you wait too long, trees actually heat and explode, setting the canopy on fire far and wide. If you make charcoal, that&#x27;s a more persistent fire.<p>Source: very lucky to have grown up outside a national park, which makes one a hard-core ecologist.')
