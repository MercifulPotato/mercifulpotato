Item(by='gruez', descendants=None, kids=[25414802], score=None, time=1607919880, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25413474, text='&gt;Since there were big headlines ~2010 about food in plastic heated in microwaves, I&#x27;ve switched to using glass containers for leftovers. Does that decrease the amount described in this article?<p>AFAIK that&#x27;s for BPA? I don&#x27;t think microplastics are generated just by having the food being in contact with the plastic, so I doubt that makes a difference. If you read the study[1], it looks like most of the plastic comes from the drinking water, not through food.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dropbox.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;nxvyl3v5s9d0a1v&#x2F;PLASTIC%20INGESTION%20Web%20spreads.pdf?dl=0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dropbox.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;nxvyl3v5s9d0a1v&#x2F;PLASTIC%20INGESTIO...</a>')
