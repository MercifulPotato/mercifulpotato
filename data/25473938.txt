The market went into consolidation around Wintel and later Linux on the server side.<p>The market today is orders of magnitude larger and supports multiple ecosystems at different tiers - mobile, laptops, workstation, servers.<p>Platforms which will not adopt complete vertical integration all the way into their hardware will lag behind.<p>The other thing is that now, binary compatibility is pretty much preserved and lots of software parts are shared across these platforms. It’s not fragmentation like DEC vs IBM vs Sun vs SGI.')
