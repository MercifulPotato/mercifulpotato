Also, many entrepreneurs fail multiple times before succeeding at a business.<p>Indeed, sometimes luck is against you.  COVID was probably not on most people&#x27;s risk models, so who would know it was a bad time to start most businesses?<p>And while sunk cost fallacy is a real problem, I suspect that some terminations with that excuse might have been successes if pursued further.  But having a family and children is a significant priority conflict with being an entrepreneur, so I certainly don&#x27;t judge the TFA.  But likewise I don&#x27;t think I would use the sunk cost expression.')
