We didn&#x27;t know that Starship, New Glenn and Falcon Heavy were coming down the pipe.  We decided that the US &amp; NASA needed super-heavy lift capability.   Previous attempts to design a heavy lift vehicle were lost to political regime change and congress in-fighting.   Previous attempts to design a single-stage-to-orbit vehicle were cancelled due to its virtual impossibility.<p>So NASA &amp; Congress designed a program that was unkillable.   It greased too many wheels and lined too many pockets to make it easy to kill.   It was also designed ultra-conservatively using mostly existing designs so there was no technical risk.<p>So now when we complain that it&#x27;s a pork-filled boondoggle that&#x27;s impossible to kill, that was the plan, and there was a certain logic behind it.   It makes no sense in a world with Falcon Heavy, Starship &amp; New Glenn, but who would have predicted that with confidence in 2010?')
