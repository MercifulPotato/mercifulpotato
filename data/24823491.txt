The warranty service, plus discounts on gear and free tune ups, will be worth about as much as the discount on a DTC bike.<p>Giant is a good value brand. They make a lot of components in house, so you get cheaper, &quot;good enough&quot; handlebars etc.<p>In that brand, I&#x27;d recommend a used trance 29 or a new trance x 29, depending on your budget. I&#x27;m happy to talk about bikes for days!<p>Trek, Norco, Rocky mountain are also good value. Just about any modern trail bike is excellent.')
