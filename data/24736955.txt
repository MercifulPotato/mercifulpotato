The assets could be seized, and the employees could be jailed or worse.<p>In a country with a strong tradition of rights and due process, hopefully this goes through the court system and follows the rule of law.  If the system&#x27;s operating correctly, there are only a fairly limited category of things the government can make you do, and only fairly limited ways they can punish you if you don&#x27;t comply.<p>In China, if you&#x27;ve left the country and say something the Chinese government doesn&#x27;t like from free soil where they can&#x27;t get at you directly, it&#x27;s standard practice for the Chinese government to tell you that you need to commit suicide or come to China to be jailed, or any family you have in China will pay the price in your place [1].<p>That&#x27;s the kind of pressure they apply to overseas expats who merely say things the government doesn&#x27;t like.  If you&#x27;re on Chinese soil and not just saying bad things, but actively defying a government order, I don&#x27;t want to imagine the gruesome consequences they&#x27;d impose.<p>How exactly is any company that has its headquarters in China supposed to resist this kind of pressure?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-china-wray&#x2F;fbi-chief-says-china-threatens-families-to-coerce-overseas-critics-to-return-to-china-idUSKBN24825V" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-china-wray&#x2F;fbi-chief-...</a>')
