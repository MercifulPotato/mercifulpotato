But I think your question is still meaningful, since news organizations can either try to recognize and correct for their biases or lean into them.<p>It seems like the NYT&#x27;s decision to print Senator Cotton&#x27;s conservative opinion piece was a poorly executed attempt to compensate for their prevailing liberal bias. It&#x27;s a good idea, but I think they should solicit articles that might actually be convincing to the paper&#x27;s reader base rather than easily-attacked incendiary pieces with glaring factual errors.<p>Opinion pieces are a special case, though. For non-opinion articles, I&#x27;d prefer that papers strive to lay out the facts as objectively as they can and leave the conclusions to the readers. Their bias will still show up in which stories they choose to promote, which is why I think it&#x27;s important to get news from at least a few different sources with different biases. I use the opinion section as a rough guide to identifying a paper&#x27;s editorial biases. Although it may contain articles that diverge from the paper&#x27;s views, there is usually a clear trend.')
