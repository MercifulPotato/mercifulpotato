Item(by='boomboomsubban', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611227278, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25855044, text='&gt; First, there are far more than a few murders in large cities.<p>From the chart apparently linked in one of the sources, half the cities listed had under a hundred. Only two had one a day, Chicago and Philadelphia. That&#x27;s &quot;a few&quot; in this kind of statistics.<p>&gt;Second, murders rising in ALL large cities by a large percentage is unlikely.<p>When ~10 events can constitute a large percentage, it&#x27;s not that unlikely.<p>I won&#x27;t say there wasn&#x27;t something that was worse this year compared to most, I put forward my guess as to a primary cause in my first post. Using metrics like &quot;percentage change&quot; hide the actual events that happened, and makes the problem sound more terrifying than it actually is.')
