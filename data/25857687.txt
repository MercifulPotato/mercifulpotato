However, you can get pretty far with those lifts without efficiently activating those muscles. Physical therapy or Pilates type exercises can be necessary to develop the ability to activate them properly, but these kinds of exercises aren&#x27;t usually included in this kind of database, and can be much more particular about technique, or be part of a sequence or group of complementary exercises.')
