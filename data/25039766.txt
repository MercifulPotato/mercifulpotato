Rather, it&#x27;s making the innards of a computer understandable. The way that he did it here, he could easily explain when and how the CPU had control of the bus and when the video card did _and_ he had a picture that he could point at to visually explain what was happening.<p>I&#x27;ve also noticed that he&#x27;ll start simple and then layer on more complex things as the series progresses. No idea if he&#x27;s planning on doing that here, but a good example was with the 6502 computer where he implemented it out of the gate with no RAM so that the video could focus on getting things up and running.')
