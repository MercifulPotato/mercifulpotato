I read news stories every day that fail to include basic pieces of information. How many news stories have you read that say &quot;The Republicans proposed X dollars and the Democrats proposed Y dollars&quot; that don&#x27;t make any sort of historical or international comparison? It seems to me that &quot;serious news gathering and reporting&quot; would include comparing the amount of money to similar situations in the past or to similar situations in other countries, and yet, I almost never see that. The word &quot;stenographers&quot; has become more and more common for a reason - news stories, particularly political news stories, increasingly include quotes from the few active actors on the topic today, but no serious research or serious context outside of the people who literally called the reporter.')
