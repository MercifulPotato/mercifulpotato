Date of publication is different from the date when the code ran and there is no guarantee that the researcher ran the latest version of every dependency that was available to them anyway. In fact that&#x27;s very unlikely considering that some their libraries might require older versions. It might not even be possible to take the latest version of every package and use them in the same environment.')
