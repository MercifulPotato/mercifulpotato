Item(by='rkangel', descendants=None, kids=[25342514], score=None, time=1607375315, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25334807, text='I actually think that the MS Teams implementation of threads is the best.<p>The problem with the Slack implementation is that it&#x27;s not the default. You have to understand it to use it, and you have to have an organisational culture that pushes people to use it. Otherwise you end up only occasional threads, and mostly you&#x27;re back in in the classic Slack &#x27;200 messages since you last visited, only 10 of them are of interest, but you have to read everything to find them&#x27; situation.<p>I like the Zulip version, it is automatically threaded but personally I had a slightly silly problem - you had to think of a topic name. It&#x27;s a bit like the subject line of an email, except that you don&#x27;t want it to be as long. This increases the friction slightly and you inevitably end up with a lot of messages going in one topic called something like &#x27;general&#x27; when people can&#x27;t think of a suitable topic name. I haven&#x27;t used Zulip as intensively as the other two though, so maybe that problem goes away (or maybe it gets worse).<p>Teams is a lot like Zulip. Everything is in a thread automatically, but you don&#x27;t have to name it, you just start a new &#x27;conversation&#x27;. It works pretty organically, and it works by default without any &#x27;culture&#x27; needed. You can give a thread a title if you want, but you don&#x27;t have to. A bonus of the structure of Teams is that private messages (as supposed to Team channels) are just are a normal sequence of messages like Slack or anything else, because that&#x27;s what you want. Teams is a memory hog and sluggish to use, but I do think they got that bit of the user experience right. Like many companies we had enforced, hurried massive increase in usage of Teams in March, and it has worked pretty seamlessly.')
