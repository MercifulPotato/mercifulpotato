But as an Indian American living in the United States for 20 years, I can tell you that I have never seen&#x2F;experienced&#x2F;practiced it here in the US and I will not let anyone do it either on my team (I run a company) or personal family&#x2F;friends. Having said that, it is a very common joke among a group of Indians when they get together about the whole &quot;vegetarian&quot; vs &quot;non vegetarian&quot; thing. You can argue that it is bad to joke about this topic but it has nothing to do with caste or religion. That&#x27;s what I am saying.')
