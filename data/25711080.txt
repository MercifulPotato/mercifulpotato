It might be your moral right to fan the flames of this fire, but I wish you wouldn&#x27;t.<p>The solution to bad speech is more speech, not less.<p>EDIT: And let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re right, that there&#x27;s large amounts of open unironic sedition in the US. I doubt forcing it onto Gab or elsewhere is really a net win.<p>Revolutions happen when people believe they do not have a voice. It&#x27;s mindboggling to think that removing people&#x27;s ability to speak is going to make people less violent.<p><i>You&#x27;re taking away their peaceable recourse and leaving them with unpeaceable options.</i> What do you think is going to happen??<p>That just so backwards from what should be the goal. Proponents of free-speech intuitively realize this.<p>---<p>WHAT WAS WORSE: The Reichstag fire, or the reaction to it?')
