Obviously the lens still makes a notable difference, and for certain forms, like wildlife photography, the lens requirements are inescapable. The new models out in the past few years have absolutely incredible low-light performance that completely change the lens landscape, even; you can now ditch the requirement of carrying a hefty f&#x2F;2.8 400mm lens around and swap it out for a lightweight f&#x2F;4 with a camera that more than compensates for the light loss.<p>But with the capabilities of modern cameras the production requirements for them are high and the challenge to make something that works for a variety of consumers even higher. I can&#x27;t even look at a camera that isn&#x27;t &quot;weather-proofed&quot; as I live in a place with a 90% chance of rain at any moment, for example. And a lot of these advancements are designed to work in combination with the lenses, such as in-body and in-lens stabilisation working together, weather seals that line up, etc. I think it&#x27;s pretty important to maintain the same manufacturing quality between the two areas. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s possible when moving production to Thailand, but I expect it will take time for them to iron out their processes.<p>My personal experience of Canon vs Nikon is that I prefer the software of Canon, and historically I preferred the physical ergonomics of Nikon, but the newest Canon models have improved a lot there. On the lens side it was always Canon for me, although I do have a lot of love for Sigma: my 150-600mm Sigma lens has a USB dock where I can actually manually configure the autofocus, among other things, which appeals to my gadget side (and honestly their quality has jumped up massively in the past decade).')
