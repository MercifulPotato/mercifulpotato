We are a team of three founders on a mission to accelerate innovation in fintech, initially by helping companies make sense of their customers&#x27; bank transaction data to generate insights and power features.<p>As the first hire outside of the three co-founders, this role is as close to being a founder of a company as you can get without starting one yourself! Your role will be to define and deliver features, fully own parts of our stack, and ultimately do whatever is needed to help our customers be happy.<p>This role is based in London - working from home is generally possible for some part of the week, and potentially mandatory for the immediate future. As the first employee, you will receive substantial equity compensation.<p>You should:<p>- Have experience writing and shipping production-grade code that makes a real impact. We don&#x27;t mind where you got the experience, but having some is crucial.<p>- Be comfortable working across the stack and be curious about new technologies. We would prefer if in addition to this versatility and curiosity, you have deep experience or specialisation in one of front-end, back-end, infrastructure or NLP&#x2F;ML.<p>- Be entrepreneurial. This means finding problems without being told about them, thinking independently about issues and clearly advocating your position, and taking full ownership of your work, even if things go wrong.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, contact us directly at hello@herondata.io!')
