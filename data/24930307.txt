Item(by='ls65536', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603978653, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24929586, text='&gt; Do you think your kids will want to read their ancestorsâ€™ books?<p>Maybe they will and maybe they won&#x27;t, but how are we to know that with certainty today? The whole point is that if the opportunity is taken away now, then that guarantees that they won&#x27;t be able to in the future. Beyond that, they would also lose the possibility of otherwise sharing them with someone else who might be interested in reading them, and I think that would be a loss as well.')
