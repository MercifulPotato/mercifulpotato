Item(by='yellowapple', descendants=None, kids=[25286367], score=None, time=1606977410, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25282507, text='So I&#x27;m a bit confused with how this is measuring the number of NANDs; for example, with the first adder problem, I solved it with exactly two gates, neither of which were NAND, and yet while it&#x27;s recognized as the lowest number of gates, it insists that it can be done with fewer NANDs (than zero, apparently).  Is it counting the NANDs that may or may not be used to implement those two gates?  And if so, is that based on how I solved the previous problems?  Or is it based on the lowest possible number of NANDs that would be required to solve those problems &#x2F; produce those gates?<p>If it is indeed counting the NANDs used to make the gates I actually used, it&#x27;d be useful to have a clear indication of exactly how many NANDs each gate uses so I can chase after a game of NAND Golf.<p>In any case, this is fun :)')
