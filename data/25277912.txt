Anything substantial? Or is this a &#x27;GMO BAD&#x27; type argument? Does enriched rice count as artificial? Modern bananas? Modern corn? Modern cows and pigs? Do vegan meat substitutes count as artificial food?<p>All these things listed above are very viable and healthy options for people to eat.
