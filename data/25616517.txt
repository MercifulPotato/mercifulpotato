Rarely is it based in logic and consideration, since adjusting one&#x27;s worldview takes a lot of energy.&quot;<p>I disagree that most opposition to conspiracy theories comes from fear of having to adjust one&#x27;s worldview, or that logic and consideration are rare. This statement makes critics of conspiracy theories out to be closed-minded and unreasonable, which is a common argument made by proponents of conspiracy theories to justify not having their worldview threatened by criticism.<p>Rather, logic and consideration are the reason most conspiracy theories are rejected, because most such theories are not rational, nor do they present compelling evidence.<p>&quot;My advice is to foster a worldview in which you accept that the world is poorly understood and many things are possible, and then you won&#x27;t have to do significant reorganization (or denial and attack) every time an interesting new idea comes your way.&quot;<p>Speaking of something obvious that goes without saying, most people already accept that the world is poorly understood and many things are possible. I believe that. That has <i>nothing to do</i> with the credibility of any particular conspiracy theory, and it does seem as if you&#x27;re arguing against either accepting or rejecting any particular one under the implication that because the world is poorly understood, anything could be possible.<p>The most charitable interpretation I can make is that you&#x27;re just arguing against rejecting conspiracy theories for purely emotional reasons... but my reply to you didn&#x27;t contradict that premise at all, yet you and everyone else here assumes I&#x27;m simply closed minded and irrational.<p>I believe your point of view contributes to the problem. Even if that&#x27;s not your intent, that is the result.')
