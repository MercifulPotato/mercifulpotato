They&#x27;re incredibly useful for small volume niche use cases and to give an example from my industry, becoming popular in space applications. The reason is hardware qualification&#x2F;verification is extremely expensive but a change to FPGA fabric is not.<p>My point is Xilinx have already proven ARM CPU+FPGA on one die and I think AMD CPU+FPGA is very likely to be a success.<p>Between this, ARM adoption, Apple Silicon and similar offerings (which kind of skipped ARM+FPGA for ARM+ASIC), RISC-V, it&#x27;s like 1992 again with exciting architectures. Only this time software abstraction is much better so there is not a huge pressure to converge on only 1-2 architectures.')
