That&#x27;s okay.<p>Threading is much more prolific today than it was 15 years ago.  Multicore processors are the norm today and there are plenty of great libraries out there which make threading easier, and less error prone than it used to be.  It is common today for language libraries to keep thread pools available for executing small concurrent operations.  In such a case, knowing what thread was consuming resources probably wouldn&#x27;t help much in tracking down the issue.<p>So yeah, I agree with your suggestions.  I think they make a lot of sense today.  In fact, I bet of the original author were creating htop in 2020, they would make these changes.')
