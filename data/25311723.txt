It varies significantly between populations, to the point where you can&#x27;t make claims about it without controlling for the population you&#x27;re studying.<p>For instance, we could say that the heritability of intelligence among the children of suburban Chicago families in a particular income bracket is 70%, but not that the heritability of intelligence in general is 70%.')
