If I cannot live in a country where a politician, of any background, cannot call on their supporters to protest<p>Calling on your supporters to protest is fine. Calling on your supporters to protest, with a pattern of all the protests becoming violent is less fine. At some point you become complicit in not enforcing the value of peace strongly enough. And when trump rewards violent people, and celebrates them, and encourages them, and then things turn violent, people see through the indirection.<p>And I&#x27;ll note that the left doesn&#x27;t have a pattern of a leader whose calls for protest reliably all turn violent. People protest outside Mitch mcconnell&#x27;s house weekly, and they&#x27;ve never been violent. They don&#x27;t give him peace, but they are peaceful. That&#x27;s what democratic politicians encourage, and what they show they value, and so that&#x27;s what happens.<p>&gt; Unlike all the politicians I mentioned above, the moment Trump heard about the violent breakins,<p>Reports from wh sources indicate that he had to be forced to include statements like &quot;stay peaceful&quot; and &quot;go home&quot; in his tweets.')
