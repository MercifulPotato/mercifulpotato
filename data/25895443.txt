I don&#x27;t buy it at all after the decade-long experience. Your favorite followers <i>will</i> fight to each other no matter you&#x27;ve carefully chosen them. No amount of filter solves your timeline being messed.<p>All social networks do not work, federated or not. I&#x27;m going back to the good ol&#x27; IRC or whatever it follows.')
