I wish compensation in government jobs were more in-line with private sector.<p>(Yes, I realize that Dr. Fauci et. al. probably have other streams of income from things like books and speaking tours. That&#x27;s not the point. The point is that someone with as big a pair of shoes to fill as he has should be compensated to match this responsibility. Neurosurgeons out of residency make more than Fauci. That&#x27;s not right, in my opinion. (To be clear, I&#x27;m not saying that neurosurgeons get paid too much!)')
