Especially software designers and low-level programmers.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of software (esp. low level libraries, scientific applications, etc.) which is optimized (sometimes hand-optimized) for a specific architecture. Not every software is released with &quot;compile -&gt; test -&gt; release&quot; cycle.<p>Some resources on a CPU is extremely limited (e.g. dividers) and using them is expensive. Alternative architectures changing these balances or being more efficient in some workloads is game-changing. This is what GPUs did for AI, ML, Simulation and Maths domains.<p>e.g.: Eigen&#x27;s speed increases 300% when compiled with optimizations enabled. Especially its solvers show this performance shift.<p>So, if ARM can change these balances and be more efficient under some workloads, it can carve a space for itself besides x86 and GPUs. This is why Apple&#x27;s efforts and M1 is so important.<p>When there&#x27;s only one architecture (x86, CUDA, etc.), innovation stagnates, people&#x27;s imagination shrinks.')
