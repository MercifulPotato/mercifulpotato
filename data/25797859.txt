Item(by='Technically', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610752433, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25797025, text='&gt; Rust seems to encourage a single global allocator strategy, which is not suitable for many use-cases such as OS development and high-performance game development.<p>I&#x27;d really love to hear them expound on this as I&#x27;m pretty sure rust has both OSes written in it and access to custom allocators. I just used `TypedArena` for managing memory in a real-time (DSP) event loop yesterday. Hell, you can just spew `unsafe` everywhere and manually manage memory like zig&#x2F;c&#x27;s strategy seems to be, although I&#x27;m not sure what the benefit would be.<p>But hey, this isn&#x27;t a knockâ€”I&#x27;ve just been traumatized by years of completely avoidable segfaults and do everything in my power to avoid the experience.')
