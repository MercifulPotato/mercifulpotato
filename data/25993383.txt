Furthermore, it does not make me spaced out or zombie like, nor does it make me strung out. It simply calms my brain down so I can actually focus on the problem at hand, rather than the opposite of that, with my brain flitting back and forth with other thoughts.<p>I don’t take it on a day when I’m being creative or brainstorming, because the lateral thinking required does that is actually something ADD <i>helps</i>, but I take it when I <i>have to get something done</i>.<p>Take it from a guy who has had ample coping mechanisms, got a CS degree from MIT, founded and sold a security startup, etc.; all of those coping mechanisms worked, but got much easier once I accepted the ADD and found the right meds. It only made me more productive and a better contributing member of the team.<p>YMMV, but I suspect your assumptions about how it affects people are very wrong.')
