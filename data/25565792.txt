About a week after I started, they pivoted and fired almost everyone except me and another recently hired contractor. Junior devs and most marketing&#x2F;biz dev folks were offloaded. They were w-2 employees not contractors like me and my buddy.<p>Many of the folks there had been recently hired as the company was spinning up for a product release. They had been grinding for weeks to get ready for a trade show demo.<p>I found out about the pivot and layoffs when I heard some of my office neighbors crying.<p>I lined up another gig and left soon after.')
