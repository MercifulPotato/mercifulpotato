It’s not just a minority that’s richer and more comfortable: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;global&#x2F;2017&#x2F;04&#x2F;24&#x2F;middle-class-fortunes-in-western-europe&#x2F;st_2017-04-24_western-europe-middle-class_2-03&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;global&#x2F;2017&#x2F;04&#x2F;24&#x2F;middle-class-f...</a><p>A middle income household in the US has $15,000-25,000 more per year in disposable income than a middle income household in France, Germany, Spain, Italy, or the UK (comprising 70% of the EU population).<p>You can say that some of that goes to employee-paid premiums and things like that, which are excluded from the OECD analysis. But for households with employer-paid health insurance (which is the vast majority of middle income households), the typical out of pocket costs for those things is a fraction of the income differential: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.commonwealthfund.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;2019-05&#x2F;Hayes_households_employer_ins_spend_premiums_OOP_Tables.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.commonwealthfund.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;2019-05...</a><p>The median spending on premiums and out of pocket costs in the US is $3,700. And note that European countries also have out of pocket expenses of $500-1,000: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oecd.org&#x2F;health&#x2F;health-systems&#x2F;OECD-Focus-on-Out-of-Pocket-Spending-April-2019.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oecd.org&#x2F;health&#x2F;health-systems&#x2F;OECD-Focus-on-Out...</a>.<p>So at the end of the day, a middle income American household with employer-paid health insurance has $12,000-22,000 more in their pocket each year. (You could adjust for other social services, but those tend to be a drop in the bucket by comparison. For example, the average student, of the minority of Americans that graduates college, is $30,000. Thats a one-time debt, compared to a lifetime of earning thousands of dollars more.)<p>Fox News manipulating people into “voting against their interests” is mostly a myth. The poorest people do in fact vote Democrat. If you look at profiles of Trump voters, they tend to be non-college-educated people who are doing well in places with low cost of living. In my county, the guys that own a little contracting or construction company vote for Trump. <i>This is entirely in their interest.</i> They would not be personally better off paying a lot more taxes to get marginally more benefits. I spent several weeks in East Texas last year. This is Trump country. It’s also quite prosperous. The men work in the oil industry and the women work in healthcare. They have big trucks and big houses and shiny new stores and restaurants.')
