Based on the field survey by Russell Oâ€™Connor, no major crypto project or server project has been affected. The only security victim is a RC4-HMAC implementation for Kerberos 5, which has very limited uses - for Windows 2000, and deprecated since a long time ago.<p>The only possible explanation would be either,<p>1. A long-term time bomb, intended to hit a big fish in the future, in a random, non-specific way.<p>2. Targeted attack (which doesn&#x27;t make much sense, if you have enough exploitation capabilities to launch many types of targeted attacks already, why bother to leave a public record in GCC?).')
