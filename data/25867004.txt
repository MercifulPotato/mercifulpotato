I appreciate the discussion.<p>This has been an interesting rabbit hole. I just took a look at democracy ratings, comparing different countries over time. I&#x27;m still reading about Switzerland, how it works, the pros and cons, etc.<p>Back to the original post in this thread, implying that governments were being totalitarian with lockdowns, and the reply saying that these governments were democracies... I would now say that being a democracy doesn&#x27;t mean leaders couldn&#x27;t implement totalitarian measures (using the term loosely), but it should be easier for a population to change course in a democracy than otherwise.')
