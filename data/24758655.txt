These cars are built to give you a fun ride for a few hours at the weekend (at best) or just to look good (at worst). Inbetween stints, they need lots of care. It’s like F1 cars: they’re built to go around very-well-maintained circuits a few weekends a year, but they wouldn’t survive two days on the average city street.<p>If you want something that never gives you trouble, buy a VW or a Toyota. You’ll never see a garage if you don’t want to, but they will never give you the same experience as a supercar.')
