Item(by='RcouF1uZ4gsC', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604989232, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25042546, text='&gt;Oddly, I now find it easier to reason about lock free algorithms than mutex based code<p>That is because lock free code composes. Mutex based code does not compose. With lock free code, I can freely call another function, knowing I cannot deadlock. With mutex based code, I have to be really careful about the state of my mutexes and think if the code I am calling will attempt to lock one of the mutexes I am holding, thereby causing a deadlock.')
