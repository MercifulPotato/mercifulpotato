Item(by='pgt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604161661, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24950470, text='Timezones were a Bad Idea™. Swatch tried to push Swatch Internet Time [^1] but it could never take of with the hubris of the Swatch brand and repartitioning the day into 1000 &quot;beats&quot;. Base 2, 8, 64 or 256 would have been more useful, but 60 divides evenly into 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30.<p>Perhaps an Internet Time Zone (ITZ), Earth Time Zone (ETZ) or Digital Time Zone (DTZ) could have gotten more traction?<p>Please can we abolish timezones. I am totally fine describing my working hours as 03:00–11:00. We have computers now, we can update text in contracts, time-based rules and laws.<p>[^1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Swatch_Internet_Time" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Swatch_Internet_Time</a>')
