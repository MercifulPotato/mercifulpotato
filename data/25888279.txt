I do want to point out that rural isn&#x27;t just about trucks.<p>Distances are greater (Costco is an hour away), the need for ground clearance, real AWD or 4x4 and lack of a local service center - those are real limiting factors. EVs don&#x27;t have to replace a truck, just an Outback.<p>Off the topic a bit, but you got me thinking - I drive WAY less now than I did from the suburbs. Sure Costco is an hour away, but when you only go once a month it doesn&#x27;t add up to much.')
