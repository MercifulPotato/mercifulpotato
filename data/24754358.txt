Imperative programming and natural writing have an overlap I think is under-appreciated -- the amount of people that could grok computer programming if programs became essays, functions became paragraphs and such is large I reckon.<p>Has anyone seen anything like this before? This submission seems like it could be a first step, but it&#x27;s not the authors&#x27; goal.<p>Somewhat more on-topic, learnxinyminutes[0] is fantastic for jogging my memory on languages I use rarely.<p>[EDIT] - Oh also, I think that this kind of project could have some enterprise viability -- having private instances sharable by tech teams could make it much easier to on-board and share code snippets&#x2F;best practices with team-members and keep tech-debt knowledge fresh.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learnxinyminutes.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learnxinyminutes.com</a>')
