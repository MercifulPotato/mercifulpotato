The preinstalled OS is a fork of OpenWRT that comes bundled with Wireguard, Samba, and several other useful programs, but the package repository doesn’t have the variety of the OpenWRT repository.<p>The hardware is fully supported by the OpenWRT project, so installing plain OpenWRT is easy.<p>But it’s still a relatively slow device (650 MHz MIPS 24Kc) with throughput well below 100 Mbps when encrypting. The faster GL-AR750S is still well below 100 Mbps when encrypting. That’s the tradeoff of a small and cheap device that can be powered by a USB 5V power adapter.<p>The more annoying part is that the 5 GHz WiFi has not been certified for DFS, and therefore DFS channels are disabled.')
