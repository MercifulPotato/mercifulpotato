Not like how it is now where corporations do this and that, but much worse. Rich individuals were just deducting everything they buy from their taxes.<p>The Reagan &quot;tax cuts&quot; did two things. One, they closed a lot of those loopholes. Two, they significantly lowered nominal rates. The two things basically canceled out. There was never any meaningful reduction in government revenue.')
