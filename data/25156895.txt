Item(by='gamblor956', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605840404, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25156269, text='This is a good resource about WFH in general. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.upcounsel.com&#x2F;work-for-hire" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.upcounsel.com&#x2F;work-for-hire</a><p>Generally, a novelization of a preexisting script (such as all of the novels that ADF is complaining about) is a &quot;commissioned&quot; work, meaning that it is a WFH under American law. As a WFH, the commissioning employer would own the copyrights, and an author would not be entitled to royalties because they aren&#x27;t licensing a copyright from them. To the extent the author might receive any ongoing payments, those would generally be &quot;performance bonuses&quot; for reaching milestone sales. It is extremely rare for commissioned works to be subject to royalties, and that generally involves novelizations.<p>Interestingly, ADF is claiming that the payments are royalties. (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;19&#x2F;21578621&#x2F;disney-alan-dean-foster-royalties-copyright-law" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;19&#x2F;21578621&#x2F;disney-alan-dea...</a>) Given Fox&#x27;s history of non-standard&#x2F;talent-friendly legal practices during the era in question (see, e.g., letting Lucas keep the rights to Star Wars), that sounds like something that 80&#x27;s era <i>Fox</i> would have done...with respect to the Aliens novelizations.<p>Something is off with how both sides are characterizing the agreements. Disney claims it didn&#x27;t acquire any liabilites--but both the Fox and Lucasfilm acquisitions were <i>stock</i> acquisitions, meaning that acquired companies inclusive of all assets and liabilities. And ADF is claiming that WFH agreements included royalties, which is extremely rare.<p>Ultimately, unless someone coughs up a contract, there&#x27;s no way to be sure who&#x27;s right here.')
