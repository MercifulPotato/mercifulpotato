Item(by='panta', descendants=None, kids=[25713749], score=None, time=1610275143, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25713017, text='People can be sexist or unwelcoming. An image is just an image, it&#x27;s an inanimate object, it doesn&#x27;t have opinions of its own. It&#x27;s the meaning one attaches to it that can be sexist or not - so it&#x27;s in the eye of the observer.\nTo me, women and men have the same dignity, conferred by being a human being, so I don&#x27;t see a picture of a woman as sexist (in the same way that I don&#x27;t see a picture of a man as sexist). Even nude art images are not sexist.\nOf course there have been people seeing, even using, images in a sexist way. But this should lead us to condemn those behaviours and those perpetrators.\nOtherwise it would be akin to saying that kitchen knives are evil because sometimes they have been used to kill people. No, kitchen knives don&#x27;t have any moral connotation, it&#x27;s behaviours and people that can be evil (and usually even then, the same person is not pure evil all the time).<p>EDIT: having said this, if an image is making some people uncomfortable, we can use a different one. But in my view this seems just avoidance, a quick way out, which is going to make the original problem worse in the long term, because sexist people will remain sexist, only less discernible, in &quot;stealth mode&quot;.')
