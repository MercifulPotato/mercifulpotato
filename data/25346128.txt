Item(by='j1elo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607440144, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25345568, text='When I worked with Qt we built a product on top of Qt 4.8.4. Not 4.8.3, not 4.8.5. This was due to some very technical details, and the product was standalone and offline so updating wasn&#x27;t a concern.<p>Why would we have to pay multiple times for the exact same piece of software, lines of code?<p>Also given that software is by default sold with defects (as it is &quot;impossible&quot; to write perfect software), it makes sense that the selling price includes, at least, future minor patches. I would consider them as the vendor covering for its own manufacturing defects (because that&#x27;s what bugs are).<p>I agree however with charging for new features. That&#x27;s fine and makes sense.')
