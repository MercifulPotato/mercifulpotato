I suffer due to targeted advertising? I&#x27;m better off watching ads for trucks and heartburn meds?<p>I don&#x27;t think a newspaper has a God given right to a certain percentage of all the ad dollars, and I don&#x27;t see how Google&#x27;s business model amounts to a tax. What &quot;costs&quot; are they even referring to? How is a search engine supposed to collect revenue for the services rendered? Google connects users with information, and content providers with eyeballs, and does a better job of it than anyone else. The world before Google was a worse world, where these connections didn&#x27;t happen.<p>This argument is so specious and just full of unsubstantiated use of buzzwords. IANAL but if it doesn&#x27;t pass the common sense test I can&#x27;t see it getting far in court.')
