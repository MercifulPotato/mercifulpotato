If you have a zip+4 of &quot;05555-0444&quot; in two fields that each lose leading zeroes, and then concatenate to &quot;5555444&quot; you can&#x27;t reconstruct it with certainty (00555-5444 or 05555-0444 or 55554-0044).<p>I had a package get seriously delayed one time because it kept being sent to a city whose 5 digit zip code was equal to [my 5 digit zip code, less its leading 0, and the first digit of my +4].
