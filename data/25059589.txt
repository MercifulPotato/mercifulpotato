I agree with the article that the left is much too focused on the &quot;white supremacy&quot; narrative around Donald Trump. I used to buy into this hardcore, but Trump <i>increased</i> his votes among both blacks and hispanics in 2020 compared to 2016. Ignore that fact at your own risk.<p>2. I don&#x27;t have much hope that the Democrats are going to do much to meaningfully reach out to the working and rural classes. One of the first things I saw that Biden is pushing is climate change goals with various federal agencies. While these are noble goals that I agree with, let&#x27;s be clear: the working and rural classes (generally) don&#x27;t give 2 shits about climate change. In many of these places oil jobs are the only good jobs left (I firmly believe this is why Biden did so poorly with South Texas hispanics), and without messaging how we&#x27;ll invest in these communities, climate change rhetoric will fall on deaf ears.<p>My prediction: Democrats will get <i>killed</i> in the midterms and will lose in 2024, to everyone&#x27;s detriment as the US continues a degradation of democratic ideals and moves closer to authoritarianism.')
