I don&#x27;t say Flatpack is failed because it is &quot;lacking&quot; these capabilities. Quite the contrary. I mean we need Flatpack or something alike because that&#x27;s what they offer. BUT Flatpack and Snap (and some other alike, I can&#x27;t remember, there were 2 more) seem failed because everybody around seem hating them. There are just so many negative comments around. Therefore we probably need something like Flatpack but way better so people wouldn&#x27;t be dissatisfied.')
