That is what is very hard to deal with without representing signals as I&#x2F;Q. The audio world just doesn&#x27;t care. Radio does. This is why most textbook audio equalizers (including those used in professional DAWs) have nonlinear phase by default (minimum-phase) unless you opt for a FIR or FFT based mode. That would never fly in radio.')
