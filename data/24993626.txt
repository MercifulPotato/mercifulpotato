I didn&#x27;t have TV or video games back then so most of my after school time turned into thumbing through the book. I had alot of it memorized within a year it seemed.<p>From then on, any family trip to a new territory, I could name any birds that I hadn&#x27;t seen in person before, or if nothing else, could quickly look it up.')
