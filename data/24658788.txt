The best part of Newsblur for me, is its intelligence trainer.<p>Suppose you want feeds from website A, but don&#x27;t want certain stories tagged with &quot;mice&quot;, or titles containing &quot;epistemology&quot;, and you only want to see articles published by an author named &quot;Joyce Smith&quot;, you can do that.<p>It&#x27;s pretty great. Reading RSS feeds has become so much more pleasurable. The articles that do make it past the training filters are almost always what I do like to read.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newsblur.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newsblur.com</a>')
