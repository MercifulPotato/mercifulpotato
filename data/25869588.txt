Item(by='waterhouse', descendants=None, kids=[25886795, 25886435], score=None, time=1611303695, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25868337, text='&gt; The notion that everyone is entitled to cooperative anonymity is a message board meme, not an actual norm of society ... I am allergic to the argument that, because something is a norm on HN or Reddit, that norm binds on the rest of the world.<p>Well, luckily, neither Scott nor any of the ancestor comments uses &quot;it&#x27;s a norm on message boards&quot; as the sole justification for their position.  Or, indeed, as justification at all, from what I can see—that seems to be an argument you brought in.<p>Instead, they talk about the expected negative impacts of name-publishing: death threats, loss of professional opportunities (citing examples of what&#x27;s happened to other people and to Scott himself in his earlier career), etc., while also saying there&#x27;s no positive impact to name-publishing.  In other words, they argue for the norm on its own merits.<p>The NYT is free to say &quot;Yeah, we&#x27;ll cheerfully do this unnecessary net-negative-impact thing for no good reason we&#x27;ve been able to articulate&quot;, but they should suffer reputational costs for that.  Even if—or especially if—that thing is standard operating procedure for them.')
