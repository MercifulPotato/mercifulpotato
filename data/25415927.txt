How many of these points can be achieved, and to what relative quality, with greenhouses?<p>2. Given sunlight is ~1 gigawatt per square kilometre, and given the light level plants need, to the extent that this allows winter production of:<p>(a) staple crops such as wheat, rice, potatoes: this will need implementation of all the improvements to the global power grid that eco-optimists like me call for and which eco-pessimists claim will never be sufficient, and because the energy has to come from elsewhere in winter they will be lacking exactly the same sort of independence they have now with food imports. (I don’t count this as “not independent” because if I did then no city would be, no apartment would be, no non-farmer would be).<p>(b) high-value non-staple foods such as lettuce, kale, peppers: it doesn’t provide enough calories for food-independence.<p>While absolutely you could put a small unit the size of a shipping crate in every village and have the local shops stock it’s lettuce output on their shelves, I see this as a fantastic solution to e.g. greening the Sahara [0] and terraforming the Moon&#x2F;Mars, but mainly only a cash-crop thing in industrialised nations on Earth.<p>[0] unlike this surprise I found on Google satellite view:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;maps&#x2F;EjD4CNCkQB3aziR97" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;maps&#x2F;EjD4CNCkQB3aziR97</a>')
