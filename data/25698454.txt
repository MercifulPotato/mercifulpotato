Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610178405, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25691957, text='&gt; I find it somewhat implausible that half the population is dumb, racist and all those other labels.<p>The GOP is only 29% of the electorate by party ID, 31% by share of eligible population voting for their 2020 Presidential nominee. Not “half of the population”.<p>But whether the members of the GOP are “dumb, racist, and all those other labels” kind of has nothing to do with what you quoted, which is about whether lawsuits filed by a narrow segment of the party in this cycle are  overwhelmingly legally without merit or are somehow being systematically reject by rampant conspiracy or bias against the President in both state and federal judiciaries, which in the relevant states and the Federal system lean significantly Republican, and where many of the specific decisions have been handed down by Republican judges (some appointed by this Administration.)<p>That&#x27;s not a question about whether the GOP membership as a whole racist, stupid, or whatever else, but whether a present President and his allies are filing lawsuits in bad faith as part of propaganda campaign to publicly discredit their defeat in the election.')
