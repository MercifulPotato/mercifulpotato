You are technically right: the FSF calls this the Service as a Software Substitute (SaaSS) problem[1].  But Facebook can run an AGPL3 project and, as long as they are careful, will not need to expose any changes they make to it.<p>In practice, Facebook and other big corporations are extremely unlikely to do this.  If they get it <i>wrong</i>, they&#x27;ve inadvertently accepted a license they didn&#x27;t mean to, which could open them up to liability or worse – relicensing things.  To prevent this you get a set of approved permissive licenses that are always kosher.  If you want to stray off the path there is a set of massive flaming hoops you have to jump through (VP approval?  legal review?  just the beginning of your fun!) that are designed to convince you that you should chose <i>a different path</i> that involve more permissively licensed software.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;philosophy&#x2F;who-does-that-server-really-serve.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;philosophy&#x2F;who-does-that-server-really-s...</a>')
