He says &quot;Whatever can go wrong, will go wrong,&quot; then uses this argument to cite the need to use UBI as &quot;fault tolerance&quot; and cites examples of planes and safety systems.<p>The irony here is that his statement of whatever &quot;will go wrong&quot; applies to fault tolerant systems as well. You can&#x27;t deploy redundant safety features without testing that it works.<p>Is UBI tested to a degree of verifiability that it will always work? No.<p>Also &quot;testing&quot; and &quot;making arguments&quot; is not strictly the case of engineering. These two things are the domain of science and while engineering can in many cases use &quot;science&quot; this is not what&#x27;s going on in this article.<p>Engineering is mostly about using what we already know about in science and mathematics to solve problems.<p>This article neither uses Engineering, math or science to say anything. It&#x27;s just a qualitative argument demonstrating an arbitrary point using a bunch of analogies to cast an illusion that this is an &quot;engineering argument.&quot;<p>You need to run a scientific experiment with a control group or observe real world examples to make this argument at all &quot;scientific&quot; or &quot;engineering&quot; related. Until then it&#x27;s just an opinion.<p>Whatever your political stance on this policy is... nothing substantial was said here. Just a regurgitation of things we all already know that may or may not be true.')
