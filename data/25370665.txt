Item(by='davesque', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607583431, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25361684, text='&gt; Regardless of what you believe to be &#x27;The Truth&#x27;, has suppression or censorship ever worked to quench dissonance or convince skeptical people, again, whether right or wrong, that there really is &#x27;nothing to see here&#x27;.<p>I suppose that depends on if that dissonance was based in factual accounts of reality.  If so, then yeah censorship probably wouldn&#x27;t work.  That&#x27;s because opinions based in fact are consistent with the rest of the world and that tends to keep them in circulation.  On the other hand, completely false and baseless lies don&#x27;t last long without someone pouring energy into them.  That&#x27;s because they&#x27;re in conflict with details that are readily observed.  They might catch people&#x27;s attention as a kind of entertainment.  But, beyond that, they don&#x27;t provide much practical value.  When they&#x27;re squelched, they&#x27;ll just fall out of fashion like a cancelled Netflix series.')
