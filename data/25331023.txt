That point is sound.<p>Japan seems to have evolved a work culture very similar to strongly unionised societies but without unions. Japanese salaryman culture is famously a culture of employment for life with unusually strong loyalty between employee and employer, hence weird things like &quot;banishment rooms&quot; that you don&#x27;t find elsewhere. If it&#x27;s the end results that matter and not the means, Japan might not be a good counter example.<p>I think French strike law sounds tighter than Italian strike law? The French are famous for striking but strikes must still be a collective decision and related to a specific set of issues, whereas Italian strike law really does sound incredibly broad and vague.<p>With respect to Pakistan, that&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t mean anything, poor countries always have very high GDP growth. It&#x27;s easy to grow something small and backwards by a lot because you can get a lot of relative growth just by copying what other countries do, and less absolute improvement is needed to get a percentage point of growth to begin with. You can only compare GDP growth rates between countries of a similar level of wealth.')
