The left is scrappy neighborhood groups of activists that run soup kitchens and lie down in front of oil pipelines and collect signatures for ballot referendums.  They gather in coffee shop bookstores to have book clubs on malatesta.  They’re flat broke and half of them are homeless and based on what I’m hearing they’re pretty much convinced that they’re next on the censorship list.  I mean you can’t really look at those kids and Jeff Bezos and say, hmm, looks the same to me.')
