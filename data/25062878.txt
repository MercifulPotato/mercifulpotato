My father is from Mainz, and I still have family there (I&#x27;m Canadian). I&#x27;ve been over many times, last time for my Oma&#x27;s funeral. My Opa worked for the city for decades, helped with post-war reconstruction, I believe the title was Baudirektor at some point, not clear. When I was 19 I went over for the first time and over several days he took me through the whole core of the city, building by building telling me the history of what was there before the war, what was there now, things he was involved in, where he went to school, his grandparents, their parents, and so on. Made a huge impression on me.<p>It&#x27;s a lovely city.')
