I don&#x27;t think this docs page even mentions that the previewDevice modifier <i>exists</i>, let alone how to put any of these pieces together to configure and display a preview.<p>You can find how to do this in tutorials elsewhere on Apple&#x27;s site. But you can&#x27;t find it in their documentation for Previews, because it&#x27;s a bunch of automatically generated pages of function signatures with no explanation.')
