To be honest I was presenting the &quot;Standard Model&quot; the way a professor would explain it to a student, who is trying to explain QFT using the conventional beliefs held by most of the Physics community.<p>I agree with everything you said, actually, except for this one sentence which you stated which I know is some kind of typo, because I doubt you think it&#x27;s true: &quot;Before a measurement takes place, the movement of electrons is predicted by a deterministic equation, there is no probability.&quot; That sentence goes against conventional wisdom so I doubt you meant it litterally.<p>Anyway, if you want my own personal unproven belief (theory) here it is: (or a few aspects of it)<p>I think our universe is a 3D (excluding time) manifold that is an event horizon in a larger higher dimensional space and what we call &quot;Wave Collapse&quot; is actually the point where an actual existing real particle does travel across our manifold. That is, anything that we can assign a position to in spacetime coordinates is also &quot;on&quot; this manifold. You can also call this manifold our &quot;universe&quot;.<p>So when something exists in what we call &quot;Probability Wave&quot; state that just means we haven&#x27;t yet done something to pinpoint a particle &quot;on&quot; this (our) event horizon. Unless someone is a very good geometry mathematician they cannot really comprehend how our entire universe can be a &quot;surface&quot; in some a higher-dimensional space, and since it&#x27;s unproven I generally don&#x27;t bring it up on HN. I also believe all N-Dimensional spaces contain (N-1)-Dimensional constructs inside them. The example in our unsivers is &#x27;black holes&#x27;. We see 2D (i.e (3-1)D) constructs where our physics fails and even have proven their informational content is proportional to surface area (Hawking+Susskind). Most people think black holes are 3D spheres, but they&#x27;re really 2D surfaces to their &quot;inhabitants&quot;. Similarly the higher dimensional universe in which our 3D space is embedded would see our universe similarly as some kind of construct where their own physics breaks down, and they are unable to &quot;look&quot; inside possibly, just like we can&#x27;t see inside black holes.<p>Also if we are an event horizon it disproves the big bang theory. The inhabitants of a black hole would notice their &quot;universe&quot; is expanding, and therefore conclude they came &quot;from&quot; some center point, but in reality BHs form from outside in, not inside out. So our universe came from outside itself not inside itself. It doesn&#x27;t solve the &#x27;first mover&#x27; problem, it just inverts it, but it does simplify it.<p>All that to say, I appreciated your response and you&#x27;re right I was putting the &quot;professor hat&quot; on when I described most of what I said on this thread, but the paragraph above should prove I&#x27;m capable of as much quackery as the next guy. lol.')
