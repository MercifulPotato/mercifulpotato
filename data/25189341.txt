Without making causal guesses, the stats clearly show that demand stopped absorbing increasing supply, the Keynesian feedback loop was broken, and everything went to shit since.<p>The causes seem numerous and intricate but a few observations:<p>- As pointed out in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phenomenalworld.org&#x2F;interviews&#x2F;trade-wars-are-class-wars" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phenomenalworld.org&#x2F;interviews&#x2F;trade-wars-are-class-...</a>, everyone trying to be exporters in general leads to a glut.
