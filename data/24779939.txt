There  are some really nice things about it: Many individual zones, no forced-air, put your towel on the floor before getting in the shower, and have a nice warm towel when you get out :)<p>But, all of those lines feeding different zones end up heating other zones along the way. I feel that it is often too hot in many parts of the house. The boiler is in a separate room in the basement. And that room gets very hot and ultimately the entire basement is too warm.<p>Its a neat system, but ultimately, and for all of its promises and nice parts, it doesn&#x27;t actually seem like the most effective system.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the answer is, but I know that I would love to have multiple, separately-controlled zones in my house. Even if the method is not the most advanced or efficient, it seems better than needlessly heating parts of a home that don&#x27;t need it or overheating some parts to ensure others get warm enough.')
