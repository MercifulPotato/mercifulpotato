Item(by='excubiarum', descendants=6, kids=[25190628, 25190317, 25190238], score=2, time=1606156436, title='Microwaves and the Internet', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I&#x27;ve known for a while that Microwaves can cause interference for Wi-Fi&#x2F;Radio but I have a stubborn client that doesn&#x27;t believe it is also interfering with the cable modem.  The microwave in question is from the early 90&#x27;s so it is extremely powerful.  In the office, they decided to put this microwave in the supply closet because it is pretty big and it just so happens that there is a coax splitter in this same supply closet. One of the legs off of this splitter eventually terminates at the office modem and the other heads apparently to another office in the building.  The cable management is nice and I can tell the COMCAST contractor who does this building takes pride in their work and I&#x27;m not sure it is feasible to move the splitter they have in place since they seem to have that dialed in pretty good and I don&#x27;t want to mess with their signal attenuation.  My theory is that the splitter and cables are picking up the microwave and then disrupting the modems, I say modems because I finally asked the other businesses in the building if they had been dropping internet at the same time.  Turns out usually around 7:50-8:00 AM the internet drops and then from 12:00-13:00, the internet will typically drop which coincides with people using the microwave.<p>I’ve been searching the internet for some good documentation I can show the business owner and building owners in regards to microwaves and things like LED’s so my questions are:\n1.-Has anyone had a similar experience and if so is there some good documentation somewhere I can get?  Can include paying for academic journals, I don’t mind doing that.\n2.-Is there an off the shelf solution that would be good for this? I know I can “Shield” it but would rather be able to buy a product from a small business.\n3.-Aside from microwaves, copiers, and the standard suspects, what have you come across that cause interference that was unexpected or random?')
