The idea is to put an upper limit on funding from mom and pop to reduce the potential harm - think the ICO bubble of 2018. During the bubble, it was almost impossible to invest in a SEC compliant ICO as an unaccredited US investor and a lot of that was due to this limit existing and putting an upper limit ($1M) on money invested by the less financially savvy. Overseas, ICOs boomed due to the lack of international regulation and there were a lot of outright scams and pump and dumps happening which US investors were pretty much barred from investing in due to SEC regulations.')
