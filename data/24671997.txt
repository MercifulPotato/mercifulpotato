If something is long-term popular, that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s really good, it means it hit the average taste pretty well. The average taste is very bland, because it&#x27;s, well, average. You can&#x27;t really deviate too far from the lowest common denominator if you want to hit the average taste and be super popular.')
