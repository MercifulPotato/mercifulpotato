You don&#x27;t need to understand exactly how a nuclear bomb works to understand its impact.</i><p>Sure, but critique is the easy part of anything (including philosophy). You <i>do</i> need to understand how a nuclear bomb works in order to eg design an effective monitoring program. And not just how it works, but how it is built.<p>BTW, you <i>also</i> don&#x27;t exactly need a professional philosopher to explain the dangers of a WMD or the pitfalls of facial recognition. Broad critique is the easy part. Specific critique is what leads to solutions, and specificity requires expertise.<p><i>&gt; We&#x27;ve let scientists&#x2F;engineers&#x2F;practitioners control the steering wheel for decades</i><p>But we haven&#x27;t!!!<p>How many POTUSes have been STEM people?<p>How many representatives?<p>How many senators?<p>How many governors?<p>How many federal judges?<p>How many CEOs?<p>Very, very precious few people who control the actual machines of power in our society have any amount of STEM training.<p>So, no, technologists have not been at the healm of the United States. On the contrary, non-technical people -- lawyers and business people, mostly -- have been managing a highly technical world for decades. That&#x27;s why we had no economic policy to manage the impact of automation in the 1990s. It&#x27;s why we still have no climate policy. And it&#x27;s why we had a complete dearth of privacy regulation in the early 2000s.')
