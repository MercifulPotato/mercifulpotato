And it seems like a great culture.<p>But the CEO&#x27;s &quot;progress studies&quot; thing repels me because it reeks of the Kochs&#x27; efforts to implant conservatism into education. I don&#x27;t want to enable that. It sucks.<p>BTW, I am one of the people who had their YC app reviewed by patio11 and it was a great experience.
