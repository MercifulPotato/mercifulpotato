My outdoor activity levels are way down. I used to hit 2-3 miles a day just going to work, lunch, the grocery store, meetings, etc which I don’t get anymore.<p>It’s not that I don’t have the Time to make it up, but there’s a lot of days where I only left the house because I had somewhere to go (cold, rainy, busy, etc).
