The only one I have is a couple of decades old, and I don&#x27;t run fasteners with it, not least because it lacks both torque limiting and speed control. I&#x27;d expect a modern corded drill to live in the high-power contractor tool niche, like how a rotary hammer compares with a handheld hammer drill.<p>Ikea, perhaps unsurprisingly, sells a cheap cordless driver ($20 US) with a torque limiter.')
