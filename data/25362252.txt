The delivery usually arrives sooner, but at least you know what the worst case scenario is. They also recently added &quot;priority delivery&quot; which lets you ensure the driver won&#x27;t make any other stops between the restaurant and your house for a few extra bucks--this seems to drastically improve predictability and is well worth it imo.<p>I&#x27;d love to see DoorDash copy both of those (assuming they haven&#x27;t already--it&#x27;s been awhile since I&#x27;ve used it). I&#x27;ve had many similar frustrations with them. Being hungry and waiting on food that is already 45 minutes late, with no indication of whether it will arrive sooner, later, or <i>ever</i> as the driver zig zags all over creation on the map is a special version of first world hell.')
