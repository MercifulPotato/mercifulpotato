The Facebook boycott was noticeable for brands that don&#x27;t do well from that channel (ie the big winner in Facebook is Walmart - because facebook puts effort into tracking of a advert for an item results in that phone walking into a store and buying that item)<p>So unless &quot;influencers&quot; can drive sales (and show they can) we will see more of this :-)<p>Just imagine a world where you only see an advert that you are extremely likely to buy.
