The most sought after tech companies among CS majors at my top school were not Google or Facebook, but hot late stage startups like Robinhood, Stripe, Coinbase or Samsara. These companies have all the upside (in terms of pay, security) as G&#x2F;F, in addition to being seen as &quot;off the beaten path&quot; or slightly more adventurous.')
