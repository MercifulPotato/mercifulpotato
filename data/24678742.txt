The pseudo-empowerment of Jasmin in the live action Alladin was particularly egregious. She is a strong character in the original with nuance and agency. In the remake she sings a song about female empowerment where she tells everyone off, but it turns out to be a dream sequence. Sigh.<p>Having said all that, the live action Cinderella remake was really something special. I can’t recommend it enough. After seeing it, I great hopes for the rest. I’ve since been disappointed.')
