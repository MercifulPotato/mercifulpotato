Among other things, it has longjmp support built in so you can do cooperative multitasking in single-threaded systems. That and some aggressive work to assert that there is sufficient free memory to run zlib properly, makes the code a bit more novel. I don&#x27;t think you or I would write the code that way, so it&#x27;s implausible that someone would accidentally replicate the code, in this scenario or any other.')
