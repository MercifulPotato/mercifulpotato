The best compromise will be Gyrocopter or Autogyro since it is both energy efficient and flexible. It can also easily fly at sustain high speed wind of more than 50 knots.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Autogyro" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Autogyro</a>')
