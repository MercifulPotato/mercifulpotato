Enforcement is overwhelmingly targeted at foreign companies, and primarily from the US and EU. I guess you can be the judge of whether it’s a just coincidence that those are the countries that the EU has the most contentious trade relationships with. Aside from China of course, which I’d say you have correctly observed would simply not tolerate the EU trying to enforce its laws extraterritorially.')
