Item(by='luckylion', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601707576, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24669128, text='&gt; Then what happens if we make ransom illegal, and we have the police watching the bank accounts of kidnapped kids&#x27; families like hawks so usually even if parents try to flout the law, the police can successfully freeze a transfer before the funds get to the kidnappers?<p>Pretty obvious: the parents will not involve the police, say &quot;no, Timmy is on a holiday with his uncle&quot; when somebody asks where their son is, and do whatever they need to get their child back.<p>And it&#x27;s not certain that fewer children would get kidnapped if returning them for profit wasn&#x27;t an option. The kidnappers might just switch to human trafficking and sell the children into slavery. Since the hand-over and payment for that business is probably much lower risk than getting a ransom payment and returning a child, they might find that it&#x27;s a much more efficient system and increase their kidnapping frequency.')
