I rarely if ever see advertisements for cars, unless you consider TV shows like Top Gear&#x2F;Grand Tour to be advertisements for cars.<p>I think the difference is that I live in a different country. I don&#x27;t consume much local media and even if I did there are few enough local products that you would&#x27;ve heard of all of them by word of mouth. Take the soda as an example. I&#x27;ve certainly seen Coke and Pepsi ads, but I&#x27;ve not seen (or at least can&#x27;t remember) ads for about half the sodas in my local supermarket. Even when Coke released Coke Zero the first time I found out about it was seeing it on a shelf in a store.<p>But let&#x27;s say that all of what you&#x27;re saying is true. The effect from it seems quite small. I&#x27;d estimate that I spend at least 5 minutes a day seeing ads.')
