Breaking that norm then feels uncomfortable, and people who are already biased against Christians will seize the opportunity to say that Merry Christmas is insensitive.<p>You can only say that the messaging for &quot;Bring Back Merry Christmas&quot; is more aggressive - the tactics on the Happy Holidays side are certainly ruthless, because there&#x27;s a profit motive behind it.')
