If that experiment reveals some truth then it should be repeatable. If it isn&#x27;t repeatable it isn&#x27;t going to be considered always true and has no particular value. Videos like this are made all the time for marketing, media, entertainment purposes. Anti-science propagandists make videos like this all the time - but they aren&#x27;t accepted because they aren&#x27;t typically repeatable or filled with flaws.<p>We trust the process because the process bears fruit - computers, cars, power, electricity, cell phones, cures of disease, antibiotics, etc. We experience all of these things daily. Now black holes and hawking radiation? Perhaps these things are a bit harder and require leaps of faith - but that is reality in a specialized modern society.<p>You trust the car mechanic to know what&#x27;s wrong, although sometimes you encounter a fraud who will lie to make more money. That doesn&#x27;t make all mechanics bad.')
