I guess I&#x27;m arguing how we should go about addressing the underlying problem and I don&#x27;t agree that classifying someone racist and crucifying them, in the systemic context, is the way to go about making positive change.<p>I don&#x27;t think labeling people purely ignorant of these side effects in a directly negative and confrontational way is productive at all, it might instead insight resentment and further entrench these stereotypes.<p>When you observe an example that was stated above where a hiring person said they &quot;don&#x27;t look like an engineer&quot; or something to that effect, you may instead ask them to clarify what they mean--force them (politely) to ponder what <i>are</i> those attributes that make someone look like an engineer? What is the stereotyped biased picture they hold in their mind.<p>Chances are that person just picked up or borrowed a pattern they saw and have nothing consciously against black people or some other race. By pushing someone to consciously identify and  quantify those characteristics you bring their biases to light and hopefully a connection quickly clicks and that person now realizes &quot;holy crap, was I stereotyping against that person and not trying to look at it objectively? Did I just unknowingly discriminate against that person based on purely on race?&quot; I&#x27;ve seen this happen many time when people are made aware of their biases and I&#x27;ve seen people genuinely try to change as a result.<p>Some people may require a bit more directed questioning to make these observations and surfacing the stereotype alone won&#x27;t get you all the way there.<p>This is how you stamp out these biases: you make people consciously aware of their biases. Once they&#x27;re aware of the bias, it becomes a conscious act of deciding if they want to reject that bias or continue to adopt it. If they reject the bias, they&#x27;re probably not what I would call a racist. If they accept the bias, then that&#x27;s a racist. We&#x27;re all surrounded by bias and I&#x27;d argue there are biases deeply embedded in humans previously used as survival shortcuts that no longer apply or run counter to modern cultures and rules of societies. What matters is how we consciously identify such biases and how we then act on those observations and work to improve ourselves to become less biased, especially when the bias harms others for no good reason.')
