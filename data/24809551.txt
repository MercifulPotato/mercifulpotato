Who was online then and now, for example.<p>Instagram &amp; facebook are a global scale economic mammoth that subsist on promoting the dynamics you are lamenting don&#x27;t exist.<p>Maybe people have a lazy tendency. They can use that to build structure. Once it exists, it also becomes true that if you want people to read your post, it needs to be on instagram, fb or whatnot. If you want people to see your video, it needs to be released on youtube.<p>Even if people were willing to host their own video, youtube has all the viewers.
