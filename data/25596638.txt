Each int would actually be an object, which is huge and inefficient to reference (they are something like 24+ bytes each).<p>PyPy on the other hand, works as expected.<p>I think the more important point is that PyPy when written like C code, can actually get within 2x of the performance of C code. If it&#x27;s any slower, python won&#x27;t be a viable language in competitive programming at all.<p>(CPython is sometimes still used on other platforms like atcoder.jp, but only because they allow third party libraries like numba and numpy which can fill the same role pypy does)')
