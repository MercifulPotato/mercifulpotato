Item(by='rakoo', descendants=None, kids=[25828349, 25828380], score=None, time=1611013800, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25824334, text='More than that, &quot;I have nothing to hide&quot; is the finest misdirection ever used. There are 2 kinds of things you may want to hide: legal things and illegal things.<p>When the police or the government says &quot;if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear&quot;, they&#x27;re technically talking about the illegal things, but 99% of people haven&#x27;t done illegal things, so it actually is fine to say &quot;I have nothing to hide&quot;. What those 99% of people mean is &quot;I have nothing illegal to hide&quot;. But by reinforcing the idea that there&#x27;s nothing to hide, people have now conflated both and now also believe that &quot;I have nothing legal to hide&quot;. Which is completely wrong of course: private life is private, it has no business being shown to anyone.<p>Not only do people not understand the difference between the two, they are also not realizing that our analog lives are private by default, but by using tools like Facebook our digital lives become public by default; the switch is invisible, it feels like nothing has changed so we don&#x27;t really care. I still don&#x27;t know how to make people understand the boundaries that their data really has once it&#x27;s stored on someone else&#x27;s server.')
