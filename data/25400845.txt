Some people are happy in their IDEs and see no reason to move to the lower-level of abstraction in their tooling. I don&#x27;t see why we should fault or shame them for that.<p>Personally, I see shell as a poorly-designed, very error-prone language and I think we should move past it, onto far better tools.')
