It was not. And over the years, we have heard repeatedly that this confusion persists. NOT OK.&quot;<p>This just means their CTO was sloppy, Amazon legal department would have never allowed that tweet.<p>&gt; &quot;So imagine our surprise when Amazon launched their service in 2015 based on Elasticsearch and called it Amazon Elasticsearch Service. We consider this to be a pretty obvious trademark violation. NOT OK.&quot;<p>This is a trademark violation indeed though IANAL, it doesn&#x27;t require a change to the license to attack them for that. Definitely an abuse of power by Amazon though, completely not ok as they don&#x27;t care about paying a fine for that, they have all the money in the world. But again, not related to the license thing.<p>&gt; &quot;When Amazon announced their Open Distro for Elasticsearch fork, they used code that we believe was copied by a third party from our commercial code and provided it as part of the Open Distro project. We believe this further divided our community and drove additional confusion. &quot;<p>Elastic was known to mix proprietary and open source code and it got to a point where few people knew what was open source and what was not. Many people were not happy with this situation and elastic.co was abusing the situation to charge paid licenses as people were scared of using proprietary code without knowing. The work amazon did to remove all proprietary code from they fork was actually welcomed by the community though I&#x27;m not surprised they missed some as it was really hard to tell.')
