Am I correct that:<p>125g would be roughly .3 liters or 1.25 cups of a pasta like spaghetti (i.e. one that isn&#x27;t hollow so it fills up most of the available space)<p>25g of cheese would be just enough to melt and form a thin layer over the top of the pasta<p>I think that I would want some meatballs or cubed chicken (or a vegetarian equivalent) to feel satisfied. However, I also probably wouldn&#x27;t add the cheese so maybe it equals out somewhat.')
