Item(by='wenc', descendants=None, kids=[24858661], score=None, time=1603374313, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24856077, text='I was experiencing muscle knots between my shoulder blades and back of my neck since March (working from home), so I decided to get an ergonomic chair to replace my IKEA chair.<p>My chair at work was a Herman Miller Celle, which was decent, but I kept hearing good things about the Herman Miller Aeron -- the so-called dotcom boom chair -- and supposedly the most ergonomic chair ever invented. I started doing my research.<p>Buying one was a more complicated matter. New ones cost north of $1000, which is ok for VC-funded startups but entirely too much for an individual to spend on a chair. Fortunately there are refurbs on Craigslist and such, usually for $400-$600 (avg price is $450). You have to be careful to get the right one though -- there are 3 sizes (picking the right size for your body&#x2F;height matters), various levels of accessories, generations, etc.  (see this video).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=x-aeDaHIEbY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=x-aeDaHIEbY</a><p>I looked for a while and in the process learned that a tricked out used&#x2F;refurb Aeron was rarer and more expensive than I thought. On Reddit however, folks were talking about an alternative -- the Steelcase Leap V2 -- so I pivoted and went to my local office furniture refurbishers, sat on a few, and decided to get a Leap V2 ($300). I&#x27;ve had mine since July, and paired with a footrest (Amazon), I felt a palpable improvement in my back within days.<p>My understanding is that the Leap V2 is likely not the most ergonomic Steelcase chair out there (I believe the Gesture is), but I will say it is a great chair at its price point.<p>I would advise you try out as many chairs as you can before buying -- body shapes are such that the best chair for someone else might not be the best for you. That said, you probably can&#x27;t go wrong with either Herman Miller or Steelcase.')
