Item(by='tomc1985', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609316062, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25578982, text='GTA V has a fairly detailed torture sequence as part of the main plot, and IIRC it was the first AAA game to simulate a first-person lapdance<p>Star Wars the Old Republic (the KOTOR MMO) gets pretty dark if you roll dark side. There&#x27;s also torture, shooting innocents into the void of space, and a few of the class stories let you kill a lot of people for no reason other than that they&#x27;re no longer useful to you. It&#x27;s a bit campier than GTA but I can&#x27;t think of any other RPGs that model being an real asshole quite so well. SWTOR is actually kind of an interesting example because it has EA and Disney behind it, even if the latter joined on after-the-fact and invalidated the canon the game is based on.<p>Spoiler alert, but one of Far Cry 3&#x27;s endings sees you murdered after climaxing during sex, all in first person.<p>Hardly chaste, if you ask me.')
