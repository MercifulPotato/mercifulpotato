Their implementation engineers will take time to understand all of the new design rules, quirks and best optimisation strategies that come with an entirely new library (given this is an entirely different fab there could be significant differences).<p>I suspect that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re going for Core i3 first, they can get away without lots of detailed work and optimisation to really push the process. A straight-forward (ish) port what you&#x27;ve got and see how it goes will be good enough and will give their implementation engineers experience with the new library that they can then use to work on the higher end.')
