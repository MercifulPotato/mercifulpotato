So there was no resignation to accept.<p>Second, even though characterizing it initially as accepting her resignation, Google in the termination notice then immediately turned around and identified that she was being terminated immediately for conduct separate from the resignation.<p>Thirdly, the fundamental dispute leading up to the whole “resignation&#x2F;firing” end game was conduct that, from the descriptions throughout Google AI that have come out in response to the management story, is quite arguably the kind of targeted campaign of hostile treatment that defines constructive termination, which would make even an explicit resignation at the end still a firing for many legal purposes.')
