But if your software can handle surprise failures then it can handle them, and in that case I don&#x27;t see the value of the prediction. The only valuable thing I can see is if a system could predict that you were going to have widespread, coordinated failure of so many drives that your ability to reconstruct a stripe was at elevated risk. But such a thing is science fiction (as the article demonstrates) and you can approximate it quite well by assuming that all drives of the same make and model with the same in-service date will fail at the same moment.')
