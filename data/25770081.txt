But it looks like Scala is slightly losing (not to Clojure), mainly to Kotlin:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snyk.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;kotlin-overtakes-scala-and-clojure-to-become-the-2nd-most-popular-language-on-the-jvm&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snyk.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;kotlin-overtakes-scala-and-clojure-to-b...</a><p>Note that I&#x27;m not bashing or defending any of the PLs mentioned. It is merely the fact - today, Clojure is the most popular FP language being utilized in the industry. Check the number of podcasts dedicated to Clojure <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fpcasts.com;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fpcasts.com;</a> the number of conferences: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;purelyfunctional.tv&#x2F;functional-programming-conferences;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;purelyfunctional.tv&#x2F;functional-programming-conferenc...</a> list of companies using it, job listings, etc.<p>It doesn&#x27;t mean that this all makes the language better or worse. Also, the overall share of languages with strong FP semantics is still way too small compared to the use of imperative PLs. That fact doesn&#x27;t make OOP better than FP and vice-versa.')
