Check out some example spaces in our gallery: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matterport.com&#x2F;gallery" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matterport.com&#x2F;gallery</a><p>Some interesting facts about us:<p>* We host over 4,000,000 highly detailed 3D models of real places captured by our cameras, amounting to over 4PB of data.<p>* We serve over 90 million 3D views every month, which amounts to over 45 billion requests and 2PB of data.<p>The WebGL team makes our 3D viewing and editing applications for the web and VR. Core technologies include Typescript, THREE.js, WebGL and Preact. The team sits at the very end of our 3D pipeline: 3D data gets uploaded from our cameras, processed by our vision pipeline in C++, Python, and TensorFlow, before REST APIs serve the data to the WebGL and VR applications, which is what the end user sees.<p>If you have worked with 3D engines before, or if already know &quot;normal&quot; web development well, and want to take the next step into the world of 3D and WebGL, send me a note at hakon (at) matterport (dot) com.')
