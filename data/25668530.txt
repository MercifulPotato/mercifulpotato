It&#x27;s more bulky than the FluxEngine adaptor though!<p>The full route from Internet to Mac SE 800k floppies was: WiFi -&gt; MacBook Pro 2014 -&gt; USB-PATA hard drive -&gt; PowerBook G3 Wallstreet (screwdrivers) -&gt; SCSI HDI-30 to DB-25 adaptor -&gt; SCSI hard drive -&gt; Mac LC -&gt; 800k floppy -&gt; Mac SE.<p>The SCSI drive had to be formatted Mac OS Standard (HFS) not Mac OS Extended (HFS+) if I remember right. Copying data each way took half an hour, so the FluxEngine would be a lot smaller and quicker.')
