Remember their phone fiasco? (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fire_Phone" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fire_Phone</a>)<p>Overall I think Amazon’s products offer mediocre design and execution <i>except</i> for the convenience factor - their successful products manage to be much more convenient than competitor’s. Especially when the end product can leverage the stronger aspects of Amazon’s business model. Take Kindle for example — Kindle has mediocre UX compared to eg iPad, but is much much cheaper (leveraging that supply chain), and has a more convenient store (again leveraging the OG book business).<p>When it comes to video games, there’s very little convenience advantage on Amazon’s side, and very little way to leverage Amazon’s existing business to improve the product experience for end user.<p>Like in other areas, I’m sure if Amazon keeps plowing billions into video games they’ll eventually build an expertise — I just wonder if the company has the patience, or if this area will go the way of the Fire Phone.')
