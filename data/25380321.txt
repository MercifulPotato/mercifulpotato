If this was just about security there would be a way to verify secure 3rd party payment processing methods - I trust Stripe as much as I trust Apple for example. And you wouldn&#x27;t be forced to offer the same price on other platforms either.<p>I don&#x27;t mind personally I see the value they offer - they make products that are better overall for a large majority of consumers and their ecosystem just works for many use cases - it doesn&#x27;t fit me particularly well but I see the value proposition.<p>Pretending that these store policies are driven by security is nonsense, those kinds of arguments tick me off.')
