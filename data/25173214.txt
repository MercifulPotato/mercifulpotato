It&#x27;s brutal.<p>That may be true but also is due to applications often having very sequential IO patterns even when they don&#x27;t need to be.<p>I hope we&#x27;ll get some convenience wrappers around io_uring that make batching of many small IO calls in a synchronous manner simple and easy for cases where you don&#x27;t want to deal with async runtimes. E.g. bulk_statx() or fsync_many() would be prime candidates for batching.')
