Honestly when I wrote this, I found that a lot of people feel like technical writing and technical copywriting are the same thing (I think this occurs because in most orgs, they are normally 1 person). I usually use this (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spacebarpress.com&#x2F;what-is-a-technical-copywriter&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spacebarpress.com&#x2F;what-is-a-technical-copywriter&#x2F;</a>) when illustrating the difference.<p>I wanted to only speak about technical copywriting and not technical writing (if you feel like that distinction wasn&#x27;t clear I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts!). However, I feel like most engineers do use technical writing in their website as technical copy and wanted to use Apple as an example how it can be done properly.')
