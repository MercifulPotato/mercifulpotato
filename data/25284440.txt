Starlink seems a great fit.<p>This is only based on what we know the system is capable of. Going on the realm of speculation, it is not difficult to imagine how a system, at low altitude, that cover the whole planet, can be used to eavesdrop communication from other countries.<p>Also, the satellites are made to have a right turnover, they can be always updated with the latest technology.<p>Lets not forget that the Arecibo Observatory (that collapsed this week) was made to listen for russian radio waves reflected from the moon. Maybe Starlink is the Arecibo 2.0<p>In summary, I think the Starlink is a military project subsided with paying customer. I wasn&#x27;t made to make profit, it was made to make SpaceX a viable company in the long run.')
