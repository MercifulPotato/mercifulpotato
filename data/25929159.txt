And funny enough Netflix was never mentioned in it, because it was produced by them (Even though binge watching is a thing). It also felt like it dived into conspiracy theories without a lot of backing.<p>The funniest part for the entire thing is that they spent a lot of time of how do we solve this problem of social media. There was a lot of just weird things brought up in the documentary itself. But the real answer was actually in the interviews in the credit, which is where it just says to get off of social media.<p>It did not feel like we&#x27;re trying to be honest, rather they wanted to be controversial.')
