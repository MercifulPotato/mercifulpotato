The sums of  criminal money involved in the housing market are non-trivial and have been estimated to account for upwards of 5% of housing valuation in some cities.<p>Construction costs do not enter into this at all.<p>If you want to address housing affordability, only three things will make a difference: get rid of NIMBY vetoes on new construction, require all properties that are not owner-occupied to be tenanted, and severely crack down on money laundering through the real estate market.')
