There&#x27;s a line where one of the characters is horrified that the government knows she&#x27;s traveling with someone else.  &quot;How can they know we&#x27;re together?!&quot; she shrieks.<p>Today you just ask Google or Facebook, and it will tell you who&#x27;s together, where, and for how long.   And with a straight face they tell you it&#x27;s a feature, not a bug.')
