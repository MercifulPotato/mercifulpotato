Coupled to the protection of freedom of religion in the US is both the interpretation of the First Amendment and the political custom that there be a &quot;high wall&quot; between religion and politics. In practice, this isn&#x27;t always true, but the principle serves as a counterweight to people&#x27;s faith not being formally, structurally questionable.<p>For obvious reasons, no such high wall can exist between people&#x27;s politics and politics, so making political affiliation a protected class risks giving protection of the law to things that society will greatly suffer under if they are protected (imagine if he SPLC couldn&#x27;t fire a staffer who&#x27;s an active Klansman).')
