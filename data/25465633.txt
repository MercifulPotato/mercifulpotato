I immediately got hooked on that extremely simplyness &amp; quickness!<p>It was one-off project for dedicated purpose, not a desktop replacement, but I will probably build another one and see if it&#x27;s any usable as an actual workstation, because I merely need anything else than browser &amp; terminals. (Well, probably also a dedicated headless server running docker for heavier stuff.)<p>(Context: I&#x27;ve been a die-hard Mac user since 2006, when I ditched Linux desktop, which I had used exclusively since 1998.)')
