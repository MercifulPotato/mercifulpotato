In my opinion, it should be at least a day (24 hours) or cover more than one’s average sleep duration so that any messages sent in haste can be removed once better senses prevail. Considering time zone variances across the people involved in chats, I think something more than 12 hours would be good.<p>We all have a need to amend our messages after ruminating on them for sometime. The three hour limit doesn’t gel well with how humans work (on this matter, even the HN edit limit duration is very short).')
