Now I upgraded to 4000 UI daily hoping to get to the lower part of the normal range.<p>I talked to the doctor and she told me that among blood tests she ordered most people have slightly&#x2F;moderately deficient levels, very few low normal, and over the years only one person tested high normal (i.e. when taking supplement would be detrimental).<p>Moral of the story - do a blood test, but if you live in high-ish lattitudes, most likely you have vitamin D deficiency.')
