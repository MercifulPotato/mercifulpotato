Independent research used to be much more common (with pretty great results), and I think especially with the internet and remote work, there’s no reason it can’t make a comeback. To that end, I’ve been working on a platform to connect independent AI researchers to independent backers who can provide ongoing funding on a monthly basis (similar to a Substack or Patreon model). This is definitely a platform I’ll be interested in using myself, but I’m curious to see if others would be as well or to hear any feedback.')
