The article is about an as-yet unpublished and un-peer reviewed paper that describes a general type of spacetime configuration which _might_ go faster than the speed of light. That is cool, but not really something we didn&#x27;t have before.<p>Also, any article that ends with a phrase like &quot;while it may look now like you canâ€™t do superluminal warp drives, this is only correct if General Relativity is correct&quot; does not bode well for practical applications of the subject matter. There is also the logical fallacy that it might be the case that GR is incorrect and you still can&#x27;t do superluminal speeds.')
