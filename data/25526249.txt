AirDrop is really useful when you&#x27;re out and about somewhere and you want to send someone a file. In those cases there&#x27;s possibly not a WiFi available or in the case of visitors to your home; only you are on the network, not your friend. So I would not see the point of using this instead of AirDrop unless you have to send a file to someone using Android.')
