From the scrypt paper (which keep in mind is assuming hardware from 2002, and isn&#x27;t assuming an attacker is using ASICs which have been developed since then), the estimated cost of hardware to brute force guess an 8 char password in 1 year is $4.8 million with our chosen parameters. [1]<p>Ultimately we strongly recommend that developers using the end-to-end encryption mode of Userbase recommend their users use a password manager, since losing their password means losing their data (and we try to make this extremely clear to any developers using Userbase via the admin panel and docs). A password manager randomly generating passwords makes this a non-issue.<p>But alas, we do recognize not everyone will, which is where scrypt comes in to play.<p>[1](pg. 14): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tarsnap.com&#x2F;scrypt&#x2F;scrypt.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tarsnap.com&#x2F;scrypt&#x2F;scrypt.pdf</a>')
