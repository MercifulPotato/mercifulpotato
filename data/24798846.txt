Item(by='otikik', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602837459, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24798379, text='&gt; I would generally trust it if it persists after the actual pill wears off.<p>The problem I see with that is that the thing that you are using to &quot;trust it&quot; may have been altered by the pill itself, to make you &quot;trust&quot; whatever changes it made. It could be like Ken Thompson&#x27;s Hack[1], but for brains.<p>On the other hand, that&#x27;s how our brains work, regularly. We experience reality and our brains&#x27; chemistry changes.<p>A similar situation I can think of is: I have an accident and and I lose part of my brain mass as a result. The present me would definitively not &quot;trust&quot; whatever person results from that. But &quot;me without those brain parts&quot; might, or even like it. It has been observed that brain injuries can produce severe personality changes[2]<p>I must point out that a brain injury might feel more &quot;drastic&quot;; more similar to a &quot;hardware change&quot; in a computer than the pill one, which could feel like a &quot;software update&quot;, of sorts. But a pill could very well kill a huge part of a brain (consider that cyanide could kill 100% of it).<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.c2.com&#x2F;?TheKenThompsonHack" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.c2.com&#x2F;?TheKenThompsonHack</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Phineas_Gage" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Phineas_Gage</a>')
