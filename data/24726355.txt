IMO it&#x27;s a gamble. I&#x27;ve seen it happen with my company when being a latecomer to containerization.<p>When it came to picking a container management tool, it was a tossup between k8s, Nomad, or just saying to hell with and running those containers ourselves on EC2 instances. Having run our stack on bare metal for year = we were really pretty good at it. There was a surprising amount of automation that could be ported over.<p>Eventually we picked k8s, and coincidentally, our usage grew more in 6 months than it had in the last 2ish years. So all in all, the gamble paid off.<p>... but I like to think there&#x27;s another world where we picked the &#x27;its familiar option&#x27; and things still worked out. If our traffic hadn&#x27;t grown the way it did, we would never have felt the pain of having to manually scale out our systems - or basically write an in-house version of Kubernetes.<p>So in that sense, I&#x27;d guess that maybe some teams have the bad habit of playing the same side of the coin everytime. It may be prudent to stay conservative when picking a Datastore, maybe it&#x27;s would be smart to pick a risky technology for your app servers? (and vice-versa)')
