You used the exact same title as the McKinley&#x27;s article, the same Maslow&#x27;s pyramid visualization as their presentation, and went through their basic points in the same order.<p>This meant there was a major feeling of deja vu, it didn&#x27;t feel like a particularly original take on the subject. Maybe the feeling would not have been there if it had been more obvious. I.e. titled something like &quot;My take on &#x27;Choose Boring Technology&#x27;&quot;, the link moved to the opening paragraph, and explicitly stating that you were reframing that original article in terms of your own experience.<p>(But to to repeat, I&#x27;m not claiming that anything untoward happened here).')
