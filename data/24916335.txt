Item(by='ThePhysicist', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603871932, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24914501, text='After reading the article I&#x27;m still a bit doubtful about the claims of the seller. I&#x27;m not saying that Amazon is in the right here or that he&#x27;s lying about the merchandise being genuine, but some aspects of the story seem rather sketchy. He seems to have been in contact with Amazon for several months, and still he says he was unable to ask them to send his merchandise back to him? If he really ordered his merchandise from the brands directly, how was he not able to simply ask them for a confirmation or proper invoice copy and provide that to Amazon?<p>Fake merchandise seems to be rampant on Amazon, and clothes&#x2F;apparel is a great target because the products are &quot;low-tech&quot; and it&#x27;s hard for a regular customer to tell a genuine article apart from a fake one, so I can see why Amazon is very picky about these things here. Personally I try to never buy such brand items from third-party sellers on Amazon, as my trust in the items being original is quite low.')
