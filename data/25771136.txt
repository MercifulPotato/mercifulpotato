I&#x27;m an existing subscriber for many years and will be dropping off when my subscription runs out in May. For an app that does one thing and one thing only, they sure are sloooooow in developing something. Case in point: Dropbox is still not native on ARM Mac. For god sake even Microsoft Office is and Adobe Lightroom. Not exactly small apps from small companies.<p>There&#x27;s so much that could be done with storage. I have 50GB of images taken over the last 20 years. Do I really have to upload them to Dropbox file sync (I like to keep original files) AND to Apple&#x2F;Google Photos just in order to be able to see them nicely on a mobile device. Yea the dropbox app kind of allows it, but it&#x27;s a mediocre experience and not very fast either. \nDropbox dropped the end customer, but also didn&#x27;t really get big in Enterprises (who often run a homogenous ecosystem, e.g. based on Microsoft or Google and thus just upgrade to Onedrive&#x2F;Google Drive). So then... who is the core audience? Is it big enough? Is it served well with existing offerings?')
