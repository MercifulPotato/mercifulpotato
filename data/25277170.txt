DigitalOcean asks $60 for this (2 vCPU; 8GB RAM) and includes 4TB of traffic out of the box for the reference, Hetzner asks â‚¬25. Note that even a second host for a DBMS is not included in this, let alone DBMS with replication. You will also have to host Redis (or alternative) on its own server if you need to scale your frontend beyond one server. Either I am seriously missing something or our definition of serious&#x2F;prod env differs quite a lot.')
