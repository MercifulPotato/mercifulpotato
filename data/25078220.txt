Tasmania (Australia) electrical supply is served primarily by hydro, solar, wind, and an undersea HVDC cable [1], and they still keep two gas turbines available [2] (one combined cycle, one open cycle) for meeting energy and ancillary service needs (but their run time is fairly low, if you look at the OpenNEM graphs).<p>Check out South Australia as well on those OpenNEM links below; they’re also close to meeting all of their electrical demand with renewables and battery storage (should be there in another year or two, rooftop solar uptake rate has blown away everyone’s expectations, to the point where the grid operator nervously expects there to be occasions where they might see zero grid demand [3]).<p>A rapid transition to exclusively renewables doesn’t mean a loss in grid reliability, simply a different grid configuration, occasional curtailment of renewables, and storage (hydro where available, battery everywhere else).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opennem.org.au&#x2F;energy&#x2F;tas1&#x2F;?range=7d&amp;interval=30m" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opennem.org.au&#x2F;energy&#x2F;tas1&#x2F;?range=7d&amp;interval=30m</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opennem.org.au&#x2F;facilities&#x2F;tas1&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opennem.org.au&#x2F;facilities&#x2F;tas1&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reneweconomy.com.au&#x2F;south-australia-the-first-big-grid-where-rooftop-solar-could-eliminate-all-demand-73229&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reneweconomy.com.au&#x2F;south-australia-the-first-big-gr...</a>')
