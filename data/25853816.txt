Item(by='terwey', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611189160, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25848857, text='Threading to keep the brand&#x2F;type the same.<p>I have a Panasonic GX85 &#x2F; GX80 (depends on the market) which is a model inbetween the GX7 and GX8.<p>I started out with a GX1, loved it and eventually upgraded to this model. I have a Panasonic Leica 25mm f1.4 which is an absolute dream to use. Also got a Panasonic 20mm f1.7 pancake which is great for travel.<p>I&#x27;ve considered a FF with a fixed 50mm lens as it&#x27;s the focal length I use the most but... I&#x27;m so happy with the combo that I don&#x27;t really see a reason to change.<p>Before I had a Canon 500D with an EF 27-80 f2.8 USM however the weight was actually insane (it was around 1.7kg) especially compared to what I have now. Yeah I could&#x27;ve put a prime lens, but the bulk would not have been worth it. Currently at 505gram for the body + 200gram for the lens.')
