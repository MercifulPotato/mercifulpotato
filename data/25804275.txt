I download the PDF and never go back the website. How would I know about the retraction? 2) Changes to the text can require another round of review (possibly adds two months?). 3) Authors are generally against issuing corrections post-publication since the box that&#x27;s added to the top of the paper looks similar to a retraction [0]. 4) Authors are busy or lazy.<p>&gt;&gt; Given that no editor or reviewer caught the problem, she said, “I plan to discuss with the staff incorporating such screening into manuscript processing.”<p>Shouldn&#x27;t it be the responsibility of the publisher to add a notification to papers that cited a retracted paper?

Why not make the retraction notification a bright red box?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;ncomms&#x2F;about&#x2F;article-processing-charges" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;ncomms&#x2F;about&#x2F;article-processing-charg...</a>')
