I had an obscure field selection issue on their web view and pinged the support email. It was fixed a few days later and they updated me on it.<p>I switched to 1Password from KeePass after 5 or so years because I just got tired of maintaining the data locally and keeping it in sync on my devices that I need the passwords on. I just backup the 1Password database locally now to calm some paranoia.')
