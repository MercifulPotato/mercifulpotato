So you are buying a new Fiat Punto and compare it to the latest spec of a Koenigsegg? What are you even doing?<p>under any other circumstance i’d agree with you. i think we can agree this is not the assertion apple are trying to push in their marketing of the M1.<p>if Fiat are going to claim their entry level punto is, in real world terms, faster that 98% of all cars sold in the last year, they’re inviting a lot of (fair) comparison.<p>the 1050 is a budget chip from 3 generations ago. even in the GPU space, nvidia are claiming that their mid range GPU (RTX3080) is outpacing their previous generation top-end GPU (RTX2080ti).<p>the parent comment has a fair point.')
