I had been holding out for Apple to announce their latest lineup of MacBook Pros, but I&#x27;ve been disappointed for numerous reasons.<p>I&#x27;m now beginning to look at other options other than Apple. I quite like the look of the Microsoft 13.5&quot; Surface Laptop as well as the Dell XPS 13, but does HN have any recommendations so far as non Apple laptops go?<p>Ideally I&#x27;m looking for something with SSD storage, 16GB-32GB RAM and ideally a core i7, but all recommendations are welcome.')
