In this position they can freely and arbitrarily govern what is and is not acceptable iOS software as well as how much it costs to produce and distribute iOS software with absolutely no competition that could benefit participants in this market. Allowing Apple to continue exercising absolute power over iOS software distribution does nothing but bolster Apple&#x27;s revenue and hurt iOS software consumers and producers by limiting options and driving up costs.')
