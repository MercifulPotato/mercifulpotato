Toward what end?</i><p>In the case of the Nazis, the answers are <i>1. Executed.  2. Justice.</i>  For Facebook, I think executions should be off the table, but the second answer is the same.<p>Facebook&#x27;s engineers aren&#x27;t gods, I get that.  Knowing their engineers aren&#x27;t gods, Facebook proceeded to use them to create imperfect but profitable systems anyway.  Systems <i>they knew or should have known</i> would harm society while enriching their shareholders.  This is facebook&#x27;s crime.  If they couldn&#x27;t create moderation systems that operate well at a massive scale, they never should have operated at that scale in the first place.  They couldn&#x27;t, should have known they couldn&#x27;t, but tried anyway.')
