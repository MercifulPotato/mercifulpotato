There is some research under the umbrella of “robust JPEG steganography” which aims to persist the covert message among compression. But I don’t know how well this actually works. LSB steganography was just the most straight forward way for me to implement.<p>Thanks for pointing out the security issue - I certainly wouldn’t have noticed it!')
