How was it?<p>&gt; MVPs are my specialization, both full time and freelance. However, besides my own startup, most MVPs become a death march and few survive marketing.<p>Which site did you use? Is fiver any good for something like this?<p>&gt; Fiverr is terrible for this. Upwork is okay, if you have experience with project development and management. I would recommend something like Toptal.<p>How do you protect your idea from being stolen?<p>&gt; You&#x27;ll have to sign some kind of agreement that the created product is yours. Consult a lawyer. Copyright covers code and is nearly free. Patents are more work, more cost, but should protect the idea. Generally, it&#x27;s not worth protecting if you have an advantage.<p>Outsourcing is something you do when you have a lot of money and want to convert that into code. Like a hundred thousand dollars lying around and no idea where to put it.<p>Your product will cost you more than you expect and be much longer. One hint of a startup being doomed is when they have profile pics or Facebook login where it&#x27;s unnecessary. There&#x27;s a substantial cost to front end, back end, hosting, maintenance. You want to brutally cut out all unnecessary features. Assume that every button will cost you $50-$200. Rounding the images will cost you $50-$200. When you do something, there&#x27;s the design, development, testing, iteration, project management cost.')
