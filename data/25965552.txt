LISP, like traditional stored-program machine languages and unlike most high-level languages, conceptually stores programs and data in the same way and explicitly allows programs to be manipulated as data, and so is a suitable basis for a stored-program computer architecture. LISP differs from traditional machine languages in that the program&#x2F;data storage is conceptually an unordered set of linked record structures of various sizes, rather than an ordered, indexable vector of integers or bit fields of fixed size. An instruction set can be designed for programs expressed as trees of record structures. A processor can interpret these program trees in a recursive fashion and provide automatic storage management for the record structures. We discuss a small-scale prototype VLSI microprocessor which has been designed and fabricated, containing a sufficiently complete instruction interpreter to execute small programs and a rudimentary storage allocator.<p>Here&#x27;s a map of the projects on that chip, and a list of the people who made them and what they did:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ai.eecs.umich.edu&#x2F;people&#x2F;conway&#x2F;VLSI&#x2F;MPCAdv&#x2F;SU-BK1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ai.eecs.umich.edu&#x2F;people&#x2F;conway&#x2F;VLSI&#x2F;MPCAdv&#x2F;SU-BK1.jp...</a><p>1.

Many of these worked as planned, and the overall activity was a great success. I&#x27;ll now project photos of several interesting MPC79 projects. First is one of the multiproject chips produced by students and faculty researchers at Stanford University (Fig. 5). Among these is the first prototype of the &quot;Geometry Engine&quot;, a high performance computer graphics image-generation system, designed by Jim Clark. That project has since evolved into a very interesting architectural exploration and development project.[9]<p>Figure 5.

Design environments evolved from primitive CIF editors and CIF plotting software on to include all sorts of advanced symbolic layout generators and analysis aids. Some new architectural paradigms have begun to similarly evolve. An example is the series of designs produced by the OM project here at Caltech. At MIT there has been the work on evolving the LISP microprocessors [3,10]. At Stanford, Jim Clark&#x27;s prototype geometry engine, done as a project for MPC79, has gone on to become the basis of a very powerful graphics processing system architecture [9], involving a later iteration of his prototype plus new work by Marc Hannah on an image memory processor [20].<p>[...]<p>For example, the early circuit extractor work done by Clark Baker [16] at MIT became very widely known because Clark made access to the program available to a number of people in the network community. From Clark&#x27;s viewpoint, this further tested the program and validated the concepts involved. But Clark&#x27;s use of the network made many, many people aware of what the concept was about. The extractor proved so useful that knowledge about it propagated very rapidly through the community. (Another factor may have been the clever and often bizarre error-messages that Clark&#x27;s program generated when it found an error in a user&#x27;s design!)<p>9. J.
