Resources are everywhere.  You&#x27;re probably not building anything large enough to activate most of Javascripts negatives (generally related to concurrency and building in the large)<p>B) Micropython -- a lot of people with scientific background can throw together a couple dozen lines of Python and connect to something in their lab.  Lots of resources and help available.<p><i>MY</i> problem is that I would like something like one of these languages but that runs in &lt;4K RAM and &lt;16K FLASH.  I want an <i>actual</i> small language that runs in something smaller than an Apple IIe, thanks.')
