I didn&#x27;t even own a TV by that point, nor would have understood much of what was being said! A German explained to me once that the forced payment by non-watchers is justified as it benefits society as a whole. I must say, I&#x27;ve now found some of the programming on the publicly funded TV stations is actually pretty good.')
