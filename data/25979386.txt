TeaVM has a bunch of annotations for js interior, as well as the ability to deal with js code as just strings. But I can&#x27;t see that it clearly solves the issues I find most annoying about scala.js or kotlin js. Is this only a great fit if you&#x27;re in a polyglot jvm team that also wants to run that code in the browser?')
