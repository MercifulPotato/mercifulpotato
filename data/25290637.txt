An individual web request runs in a single PHP thread.<p>Erlang&#x2F;Elixir (or any BEAM language) runs every request in a separate <i>green thread</i> which scales much better than OS threads since most of those green threads can be generously multiplexed on just 4-8 CPU cores due to 90% of the time being spent waiting on a database.<p>One OS thread per request is such a... strange thing to brag about in 2020.')
