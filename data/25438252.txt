If there was ever a time where you could reliably establish a meaningful distribution platform by personally emailing individual webmasters, surely it was a time where there was an extremely small number of regular web visitors. In fact, I would be willing to bet that, right now, the world of independent webmasters using traditional hyperlinks and eschewing the current megaplatforms is <i>vastly</i> larger than it was in the time you&#x27;re recalling. Which is to say, you can probably reach a larger audience <i>today</i> using those distribution techniques than you could in the time you&#x27;re recalling. You just will obviously have a much much smaller <i>portion</i> of today&#x27;s web visitors.')
