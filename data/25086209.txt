Unless there is something I have missed about doordash raising the prices, it’s the restaurants who are raising their delivery prices to stay profitable right now. Where I work every menu item has a .50$ to 1.50$ markup for delivery to make up for the some of what delivery services take from the restaurant.<p>I wish I could be more specific but I’m just working here while in school.
