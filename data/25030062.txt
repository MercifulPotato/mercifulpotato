Item(by='gambiting', descendants=None, kids=[25030250], score=None, time=1604878055, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25029614, text='Because, like I said:<p>&gt;&gt;Well, one of the(but definitely not the main) reasons<p>I made a list of reasons - like, I&#x27;d like a car that uses less fuel. Car that doesn&#x27;t wake up the neighberhood when I start it. Car that can actually take some shopping from IKEA. These were the main reasons for a swap. But obviously, there is a secondary list to this - car that doesn&#x27;t have a shit audio system. Car that has comfortable seats.<p>Somwhere on that list is a <i>car that has android auto support</i>.<p>All of this has contributed to me swapping. But logically thinking, there was nothing wrong with the car - I could have just paid it off and kept it. It&#x27;s very specifically <i>not</i> a lease so I don&#x27;t <i>have to</i> hand the car back after 4 years, keeping it(either by paying it off or refinancing) is actually an option.<p>I think what I am saying is that the lack of something like android auto(in a scenario where it cannot be easily retroffited) can and does contribute to a decision to change the entire car - it&#x27;s not just a stupid tech gimmick that no one cares about as some much earlier comments were trying to suggest.')
