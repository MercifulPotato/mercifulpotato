I have an older Gigabyte GA-J3455N-D3H with 4 SATA ports and two gigabit network controllers that cost in the same ballpark as GP&#x27;s model.<p>RAM is accounted for in GP&#x27;s description.<p>Regarding the boot drive, you can either boot from the data disks (say via a common ZFS pool or a common raid + lvm) or if you&#x27;re happy with a SD card for the PI, I suppose a small USB drive would do the trick.<p>Regarding the PSU, but you&#x27;d need a beefy adapter anyway for running 4 drives, which isn&#x27;t cheap, and there are cheap pico-atx PSUs available. I bought a compact case + PSU for my board for 50 euros around two years ago [1] that&#x27;s still going strong (although I&#x27;m only running a single SSD in it), so the PSU alone should be less than that.<p>There&#x27;s of course the power efficiency question and I presume this setup would be somewhat more power hungry than an RPI. The Intel specs for the J3455 give it at 10W TDP. I have no idea how much RAM consumes, but it&#x27;s likely a few more watts.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gigabyte.com&#x2F;Motherboard&#x2F;GA-J3455N-D3H-rev-10#ov" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gigabyte.com&#x2F;Motherboard&#x2F;GA-J3455N-D3H-rev-10#ov</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inter-tech.de&#x2F;en&#x2F;products&#x2F;case&#x2F;mini-itx-nuc&#x2F;itx-601" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inter-tech.de&#x2F;en&#x2F;products&#x2F;case&#x2F;mini-itx-nuc&#x2F;itx-...</a>')
