Things can get even crazier with world music styles like Samba, and let&#x27;s not even get started with classical rubato.<p>And yet notating any of that information in every bar as, say, three-quarters to one-and-a-half hemidemisemiquavers early or late to each offbeat defeats the purpose of having a readable score.<p>The score is a reduction that&#x27;s intentionally lacking tons of information that defines the essence of a performance.
