Masks are now triggers to the extremists on both sides and it&#x27;s impossible to act reasonably and please either group as I&#x27;m either seen as a fascist anti-masker or a recruit in the red army. It seems the loud minority on both sides can only think in a Hitler&#x2F;Stalin dichotomy with zero nuance. I choose to ignore the unreasonable and do what I think is good and reasonable and above all charitable, despite the discomfort.')
