Y&#x2F;N.&quot; Collect sales tax if Y. Remit taxes, keep records, and you&#x27;re good on compliance. The rate would be based on your company&#x27;s Texas address, so you&#x27;d charge the same sales tax rate to every Texas customer. If you were a California company, you&#x27;d charge no sales tax to anyone.<p>But now you&#x27;re collecting for a variety of states that you have no presence in, and some will be crazy complicated. For example, Louisiana says out-of-state sellers have to identify the <i>exact address</i> for every buyer and match it to a huge database of tax districts to figure out which rate to charge that customer. It&#x27;s crazy! A non-US SaaS company selling into the US would have a huge competitive advantage from not having to figure out this mess.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;d love to hear from you SaaS guys about your compliance strategies!')
