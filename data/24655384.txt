The same people who talk about &quot;small government&quot; simultaneously use the federal government to bludgeon states into submissions on issues such as legalized marijuana. It&#x27;s usually something that&#x27;s used to justify a specific political position and not an overall sentiment of allowing actual freedom.<p>On the contrary, many Americans support policies that are against many ideas of freedom such as the disenfranchisement of felons.<p>For example, someone might use an example of being able to deny a LGBTQ person a service as &quot;having freedoms&quot; but ignore the fact that by denying them that service, that person is also simultaneously less free.')
