Item(by='eigenket', descendants=None, kids=[25644687], score=None, time=1609848296, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25644582, text='Gleason&#x27;s theorem also makes a big assumption when you require that the measurement outcomes are associated with POVM elements (or projection operators if you don&#x27;t like POVMs). I lumped that in with &quot;assuming something equivalent to it&quot; since Gleason&#x27;s theorem (at least by my understanding) is exactly the statement that assuming non-contextuality+POVMs&#x2F;POMs is equivalent to assuming Born&#x27;s rule.<p>Although its really cool I don&#x27;t think Gleason helps you tie any particular interpretation to the Born rule, since you still have to make a jump to tie your measurement outcome to a POM&#x2F;POVM element.<p>As far as your last sentence goes, this is sort of what I was trying to argue in my comment above. The &quot;part that is difficult&quot; that you identify as being unresolved by MWI is also completely unresolved by pilot wave theory, or qbism or consistent histories or any other interpretation (as far as I am aware).')
