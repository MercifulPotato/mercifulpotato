The burden of acquiring the certification reduces the available labor pool.<p>My suggestion is to figure out which professions your state regulates, see which of those is best to become certified in, and get that certification. It depends on the state, but some professions have a very favorable time&#x2F;pay payoff and others have a horrible payoff. In my state, it&#x27;s easier to become a real estate agent (~250 hours) than it is to become a certified barber&#x2F;hairdresser (1000+ mandatory training hours!!)<p>Assuming you pick something good, if you&#x27;re smart and can pass an exam, it should be no problem. The best candidates where I live are starting your own car dealership, insurance sales, or maybe real estate, although those aren&#x27;t manual work.<p>If you want something easier that&#x27;s hands-on, where I live it&#x27;s bartending, which requires a license here. My state pays the full minimum wage for tipped employees, so bartending ends up being roughly a ~$20&#x2F;hour at worst ($15&#x2F;hour minimum wage + ~$5 in tips per hour as a low estimate). If you bartend at a better place, you can easily make a lot more, although maybe this is not the best career choice during the pandemic.')
