Also, look at some of these hedge funds and their leverage—-a $3B fund with 10x leverage is going to be able to “manipulate” a stock price with big orders in almost any way they choose, and they do it in secret!<p>Now I don’t personally think GME is worth $300&#x2F;share, but the people buying it think they will be able to sell it for more, and that is their right. They aren’t being “tricked” with deliberate misinformation, there are indeed a lot of shorts still out there that will eventually need to cover.')
