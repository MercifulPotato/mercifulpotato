Note that, despite the editorialized title of the HN submission here (<i>Measuring &quot;efficiency&quot; in document prepration: Microsoft Word vs. LaTex</i>), what the link contains is primarily a criticism of a paper that <i>did</i> compare the (what you called) “not comparable tools”, but did so very poorly. The criticism is sound, so whether LaTeX is in fact better along some dimension than Word is secondary, IMO. And if (as you say) comparing them is nonsensical in the first place, then that would only strengthen criticism of the paper.')
