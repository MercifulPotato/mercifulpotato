At a middle school age, I was _hounded_ into playing basketball (until they realised I had no talent whatsoever, or any inkling that I wanted to attempt to improve that). There&#x27;s definitely a selection bias in who gets started playing basketball in the first place.<p>This has had a bigger impact than you&#x27;d imagine :-) For example quite a few tall football players have been nudged when they were kids to play basketball. But luckily some more open minded coaches let them play and found out that they were actually good. The best example is Jan Koller: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jan_Koller" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jan_Koller</a><p>2.02 (6&#x27;8), so definitely towering above most other people :-)<p>But the things is, genes do matter at a certain level. I really think you can&#x27;t be an NBA player if you&#x27;re 1.50 (I think that would be about 4&#x27;8). No matter how fast or resilient you are. You&#x27;ll just be outmuscled, dunking will probably be almost physically impossible.')
