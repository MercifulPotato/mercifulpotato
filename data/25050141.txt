Like editing video for example. Anything where you need only shorter bursts of power won&#x27;t make as big of a difference.<p>But better thermals will probably mean they can run the CPU in the Pro at higher base clock speed anyway, so it will probably be faster than the air all around - we&#x27;ll have to wait for benchmarks to know for sure though.')
