The warehouse was also likely filled with partially combusted gases from the tyres, fireworks or other burning material.<p>So the explosion that did occur was not just the Ammonium Nitrate, but a mixture.<p>As other writers have discussed, the blast would not have fully involved all the material either - some would be lost and some would remain unburnt.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aljazeera.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;8&#x2F;5&#x2F;lebanon-blast-ammonium-nitrate-behind-many-industrial-accidents" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aljazeera.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;8&#x2F;5&#x2F;lebanon-blast-ammoni...</a>')
