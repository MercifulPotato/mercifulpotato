It generally uses huge memory and compute and generates a model.<p>Inference will use that generated model to recognize the pattern in new data.  It uses significantly fewer resources and can run either very fast or on a smaller system.<p>I believe the speed of inference may be affected by the resources available during training, where more speed&#x2F;memory for training can produce better models.')
