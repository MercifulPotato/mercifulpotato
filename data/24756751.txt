Guts are very powerful but GUI is more minimal and less mature (as of now).<p>Tailscale is a Wireguard configurator and P2P hole puncher with IAM integrations and a nice GUI. Runs at layer 3 so it can&#x27;t do some things that ZeroTier can do, but most stuff runs over IP so only some segments of the market care.<p>BeyondCorp is more of a concept. Google has their own implementation of it and so do many others.<p>I too have trouble wrapping my head around this technically speaking. I get the sense that it&#x27;s basically something that puts your WAN over Cloudflare&#x27;s network and lets you do access control everywhere in the cloud, which would make it closer to the now-defunct Pertino or some cloud-backhaul-based SD-WAN solutions... but that&#x27;s probably only a part of it. &quot;One&quot; here seems to refer to &quot;one&quot; bundle of a whole bunch of things.')
