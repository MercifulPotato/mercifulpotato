It&#x27;s the unions that were pushing this, so they can collect union dues and grow their revenues.<p>The $200 million being discussed feels relevant to this claim. Didn&#x27;t some companies even spread their take to their &quot;employees&quot; through their job apps and other direct communication? I bet even the &quot;blame the union&quot; came from information those companies paid for.')
