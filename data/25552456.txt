Create artificial demand for ditches to be dug, and then hire people to dig those ditches. The fundamental question is not how to generate artificial demand, but how to generate artificial demand <i>that succeeds at generating useful value.</i><p>Now, that spectrum has a range of answers. Sometimes you don&#x27;t really care about value, or you take value on faith, e.g. when constructing public infrastructure works. They put people to work, get people spending, and everyone agrees that the country is in dire need of infrastructure improvements right now. There are, however, two non-infrastructure extremes: a) spending money on strong companies that will become stronger (instead of failing due to temporary unavoidable circumstances), but if anyone knew for sure which companies these were, the government wouldn&#x27;t need to spend any money at all, investors would step in and pocket the profits. Then there&#x27;s b) spending money on weak companies that would&#x27;ve failed in a year or two anyway, and emergency bailouts only forestalls the inevitable, wasting money and time and creative potential for nothing.<p>Now most companies are on a spectrum, which means that the strategy of such wide-spectrum spending is to offset the losses of boosting weak companies with the gains made by strong companies, overall.<p>Will it work at generating (net) useful value? Maybe. If so, then the currency is tied up in the extra value generated, and we&#x27;ll avoid inflation. If not, then we have far more currency in circulation for the same amount of value, and prices will go up in tandem. Jury&#x27;s still out.')
