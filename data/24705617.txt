The nature of his victory is highly suspicious and he did not secure a majority vote. I don&#x27;t know how much you know about our politics but there is a lot of nuance that you are glossing over.<p>Additionally, his popular support is at an all-time low. Election polls for 2020 show him lagging considerably behind Biden. At this point he is very likely to be one of the few presidents that will not be elected to a second-term; the first in 28 years.<p>Whatever propaganda you are reading or seeing or hearing about us, you would do well to question it')
