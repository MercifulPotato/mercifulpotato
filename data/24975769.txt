Even the petrol (gas) station across the road (highway) from my flat (apartment) sells generic white, generic red, new, Charlotte, sweet (yams?), and Maris Piper. Maybe one of jersey royal &amp; king Edward too, I&#x27;m not sure.<p>Potatoes are shockingly cheap too, for some reason I suddenly &#x27;noticed&#x27; that at the weekend, around 40p&#x2F;kg, (uh.. 25c&#x2F;lb ish) that&#x27;s crackers (cookies for cheese) isn&#x27;t it?<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s other things you have or have variety in that we don&#x27;t, but I wouldn&#x27;t fancy not having a choice of potatoes. Though I almost always get Maris Piper to be honest, so it&#x27;s not even really about choice as such, just knowing what I like and what I&#x27;m getting, I only buy &#x27;white&#x27; if there&#x27;s nothing specific (and more appropriate) available.<p>Sometimes &#x27;white&#x27; will tell you what the actually are (this batch) on the date&#x2F;producer label bit, or what they might be a mix of, which is nice.<p>Well, that&#x27;s more than I&#x27;ve previously written or thought about potatoes...')
