People on UBI are not just going to take money stop working. This is one of the biggest counter argument for UBI - people are lazy and be drain on society.<p>2. People are still productive and if given UBI they have space to take risk and become entrepreneurs. A lot of people might have a idea&#x2F;dream to start a business but due to mortgage, low income etc they cannot risk the well being of their families.<p>3. If UBI doesn&#x27;t reduce productivity then you are injecting money into local economies via local people. This is literally supporting businesses that local people want to have around.<p>4. The whole social welfare department can be largely disbanded.<p>5. There was some crazy percentage of people that has no more then $1000 in account (left then month of spending). UBI would help people cope with emergencies. There is known effect of people in crisis falling into a hole due to the fight or flight mechanism. They literally cannot think straight and are being preyed upon by quick payday loan vulchers.<p>6. Jobs that are awful will have to be paid more to be done. I am not sure if thats good or bad. Depends who you are.<p>7. Young people would not be rushed to find job, or be fast track into school-uni-work thread. It would give people chance to find out what they like to do in life rather than roll dice and be stuck in career they don&#x27;t like. Personally i believe you should have a few year gap between high school and university to get a taste for the different jobs.<p>Hows that for a list?')
