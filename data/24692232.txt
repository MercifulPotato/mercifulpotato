They just keep employees busy and create more jobs.\nI blame the Federal Reserve Bank&#x27;s money printing. One of the Fed&#x27;s 2 mandates is &#x27;job creation&#x27; but people severely underestimate how damn good the Fed is at achieving its targets in that regard.<p>The Fed will keep printing more and more money and jobs will become increasingly useless. It terrifies me to think that the situation could get worse than this and most people still won&#x27;t notice.<p>If it continues down this path, in the future, we&#x27;ll have people whose entire career will be to sit at a desk and stare at a wall from 9am to 5pm and their employers will seriously believe that this activity adds value to the economy.\nWe&#x27;ll have consultancies which specialize in wall staring. Some will specialize in staring at white concrete walls, others at wooden walls, etc...<p>It might sound like I&#x27;m joking, but I&#x27;m very serious.')
