People&#x27;s lives and careers are ruined by the social justice mob, sometimes deservingly, sometimes not.<p>I realize arguing against free speech is deeply unpopular, particularly on this forum. And I also realize it&#x27;s inherently hypocritical. And, generally, I agree that the cure for &quot;wrong&quot; speech is more speech. Free speech is sacred to me as well.<p>But, I&#x27;ve also learned that, when shit hits the fan, you gotta slaughter some sacred cows, including those you never thought you could. The counterexamples you bring up are terrific. Is there a way, one that isn&#x27;t just individual whim, to judge and moderate speech, in a way that is socially productive? I would bet there is, one that we haven&#x27;t discovered yet.<p>After all, peer reviewed science hasn&#x27;t always existed. I think the parallels there are rich. Modern scientists do operate as high priests of truth and knowledge. Who performs that function for speech? The woke left? The conservative right? FANG tech? None of those sound reasonable to me, but that doesn&#x27;t mean a reasonable plan doesn&#x27;t exist.')
