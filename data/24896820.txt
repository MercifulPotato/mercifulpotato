For example, when using OCaml (which incidentally does have a REPL, but I don&#x27;t use it often), I get a lot of value from the type system and the module system.<p>Even Java has advantages in terms of tooling, and from Java 8 on, you can write code using some Clojurish idioms with streams. Though for immutable data, you need something like Lombok + pcollections.<p>JavaScript, on the other hand, really doesn&#x27;t offer <i>anything</i> over Clojure, so I can see why you&#x27;d struggle going back to it. It&#x27;s just a downgrade.')
