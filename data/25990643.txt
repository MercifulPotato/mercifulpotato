As part of the settlement, they weren&#x27;t allowed to add any new features to it, and it quietly faded into obscurity, along with its CLR counterpart J#, the latter having finally left even extended support in 2017.<p>C# was developed independently of J++ and J# (though J# was based on J++ to provide a transition path for J++ developers), and although Anders Hejlsberg (original lead architect of C#) did also work on J++, he also worked on Turbo Pascal and Delphi before coming to Microsoft, and I&#x27;d suspect that those influenced C# more (more conceptually than syntactically, of course).')
