We do know how it is distributed, so we make a guess and err a couple standard deviations on the side of caution. However, we know precisely when a certificate will expire. The standard deviation for a certificate expiring (ignoring clockskew) is 0. If we gave 5 standard deviations of warning time on a certificate, it would still be 0 warning.')
