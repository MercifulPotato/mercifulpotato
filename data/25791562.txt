It&#x27;s extremely vague. Moreover, it&#x27;s clear that not everyone helped since abject poverty and hunger are a thing, regardless of where you live.<p>You might be conflating &quot;helping people&quot; with &quot;convenience&quot; whereas what you truly want to say that &quot;market economy&quot; has made products&#x2F;services &quot;affordable&quot;. But, that&#x27;s, again, not an inclusive statement. Markets only offer access to goods&#x2F;services to the extent that actors are able to afford them. And clearly not everyone can afford to buy enough sustenance on a daily basis to not go hungry.<p>The same is true for being able to afford to attain equitable prices as a seller. If you can&#x27;t bring enough leverage to the table, you will have to accept price levels as they are determined by bigger players who dominate market supply. It might mean that you get out priced, and that your business  proposition - no matter how good the idea was - simply won&#x27;t generate revenue because someone else can provide the same thing for less then peanuts.<p>Both cryptocurrency and food are the epitomes of that.<p>Massive amounts of food are being produced to the extent that there&#x27;s massive amounts of waste across the entire supply chain. None of that happens out of charitable or altruistic intentions. It&#x27;s not even produced for your personal convenience as a customer.<p>Flooding markets with massive amounts of supply is a strategy aimed to drive the prices down to a point where competitors have to call it quits. The aim&#x2F;risk is to generate a razor thin margin which is still worth the investment. At the scale of global markets, that&#x27;s still billions of dollars  worth in profits.<p>The same is true for cryptocurrency. The price on cryptomarkets isn&#x27;t determined by the many hands who hold fractions, it&#x27;s determined by those who have invested the largest amounts of leverage. And they will use that to influence the prices if the incentive for scalping profit and&#x2F;or acquiring&#x2F;controlling a larger share of a scarce&#x2F;finite resource becomes too enticing.<p>&quot;Market economy&quot; only helps certain groups in certain circumstances. It&#x27;s definitely not an equitable way of &quot;helping people&quot;. On the contrary.')
