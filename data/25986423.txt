It&#x27;s unlikely the current shortage will take that long, and it only started at the end of last year. In Summer 2020 buying a gpu was not a problem. Then the RTX 3000 series launched with basically no cards actually being available, and all following releases were like that from both vendors.<p>But both the RTX 2000 series and the Radeon RX 5000 cards have been easily available back then (okay, iirc the USA had some supply issues, but that was domestic Covid and not production related), so there was no reason for them to ramp up production for now during the last 3 or 4 years.')
