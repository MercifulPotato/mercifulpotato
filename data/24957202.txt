They think that computer hardware has a single one-dimensional property called &quot;speed&quot; and that if their software performs badly, it&#x27;s because their computer is too slow, not because the software is bloated.<p>My daily driver has 4GB of RAM, and it&#x27;s possible only usable because I&#x27;m extremely frugal with my software choices. I run Debian with XFCE and pipe memory usage to my panel so I can always see whether I&#x27;m in danger of swapping. I use a Firefox extension that prevents me from opening too many tabs. I stick to the terminal for as many tasks as possible. I categorically refuse to use electron apps. And despite all that, I still ending up OOMing and having to hard reset every few days. For a normal person who doesn&#x27;t know what RAM is and has an antivirus constantly running the background, the 4GB are going to be used up almost immediately, their machine will start swapping, and then they&#x27;ll get the impression that their 4GB machine is &quot;slow,&quot; despite being faster than high-end computers people used to do exactly the same things ten years ago.')
