Drivers need pretty much perpetual maintenance for all but the simplest blinkenlights.<p>Third, even &quot;desktop&quot; drivers are run through their places in server environments, through e.g. workloads like Stadia.<p>Fourth, proprietary drivers are not subject to any scrutiny whatsoever, whereas you won&#x27;t get past the gatekeepers if you don&#x27;t pull your shit together for the open source kernels.<p>Popularity does not fix unmaintained code. Giving even just one annoyed and skilled person the ability to change the code does. And sometimes, external companies like Collabora will decide to overhaul things, which they again can&#x27;t do for a proprietary driver.')
