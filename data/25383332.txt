Item(by='lowbloodsugar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607672145, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25376809, text='There are many purchase options if you want a new phone. One of those options, and not the largest selling option, is a product from Apple that requires that you use their app store, and follow certain rules. If you do not like this product, then there are literally far more non-apple products to choose from. There are both for more non-apple options, and there are far more of those sold worldwide. The demand you are making is already addressed by the market. The majority of phone manufacturers, the majority of phones available to purchase, and the majority of phones actually sold world-wide all work the way you want. But, no, it must be all of them for you to be satisfied!<p>You are on the one hand saying that Apple is bad because it 100% insists on doing what it wants, and yet you are the one demanding that 100% of phone manufacturers do what you want. \nWell that&#x27;s not ok. Go buy one of the alternatives please, and leave us with our intolerable, despotic iphones.')
