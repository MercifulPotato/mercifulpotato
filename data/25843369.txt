The ccTLDs are in fact almost exactly the ISO 3166 alpha-2 list, thereby leaving both the hard problems of deciding what a &quot;country&quot; is and what its code should be to ISO and thus in turn its members (who are of course national standards organisations). This sort of buck passing should be a model to us all on fraught political questions.')
