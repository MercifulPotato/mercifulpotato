Season 1 of Barry on HBO was basically a perfect story.  Season 2 wasn&#x27;t terrible, but it was stretched and didn&#x27;t really add to what had been a perfect capsule.  Patriot on Amazon, was also a brilliantly plotted two season arc, and though I love the characters I admit to push it to another season would be to take away from it not to add.')
