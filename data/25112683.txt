Keeping someone with a severe case of Corona (I think 5% of cases are this?) from dying requires a lot of care. I know that in my country (the Netherlands) this has caused significant delays to other forms of care.<p>Hence, even if people who get Corona get out without any long-term damage, their en-masse admission to hospitals still has long-term health effects. Just not on them, but on others that were denied care.')
