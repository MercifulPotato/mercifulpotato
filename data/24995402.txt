They can be from ANY authorized agent of the copyright holder, like a lawyer, or ... the rights-enforcement association to which the copyright holder belongs.<p>ETA: And yes, if you submitted a DMCA takedown which has any reasonable chance (from the recipient&#x2F;provider&#x27;s perspective) of being valid, it would get taken down. Otherwise, the provider takes on their customer&#x27;s liability. Very few (and zero free) providers are willing to do so.')
