When I bought my PowerBook in 2003, Mac OS (10.3, 10.4) was fantastic in this regard, being able to boot off a FireWire drive, with OpenFirmware a much more powerful boot loader compared to the archaic pre-UEFI PC BIOS. You could also just use another Mac&#x27;s boot disk.<p>Today (well, for years now), Mac OS can only be upgraded with Apple&#x27;s installer. Went to an Apple reseller to buy a hard-disk with Mac OS (Mojave or earlier) to test-upgrade my old Mac Mini and whether my somewhat involved builds still work, only to find out that the old Mac Mini&#x27;s firmware can&#x27;t boot from APFS, and a firmware upgrade for APFS isn&#x27;t a separate download like it used to be but comes only as part of Apple&#x27;s monolithic online install.<p>This is very significant for delivering&#x2F;testing Mac OS apps on newer OSes, and in particular to F&#x2F;OSS developers who can&#x27;t always go with the program and buy new hardware all the time. It&#x27;s also relevant with audio and video professionals who need their driver- and timing-sensitive rig to work rather than going through yearly upgrade treadmills.')
