Then there&#x27;s no way for software to check the device names against a list of VM tools, since it always matches real, physical hardware.<p>At that point, it seems to me that there isn&#x27;t much left to distinguish the virtual machine from the physical. Behavioral properties of the CPU?  Anyway, that&#x27;s what I meant when I said it seems like after a certain point, it becomes impossible to tell the difference.<p>EDIT: based on the link above, it looks like current state-of-the-art doesn&#x27;t go far beyond making sure names and common virtualbox performance shortcuts aren&#x27;t present. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hfiref0x&#x2F;VBoxHardenedLoader&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;Binary&#x2F;howto.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hfiref0x&#x2F;VBoxHardenedLoader&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;B...</a>')
