If you have a brick and mortar store, you&#x27;re going to have to use it to drive value in ways that an online business can&#x27;t. If your business model doesn&#x27;t really support your expenses, it&#x27;s a problem for your business model, not for anything else.<p>Other stores solve this problem by using the brick and mortar locations as warehouses that can ship as fast or faster than amazon at a competitive price. This also enables same day pickup at a lot of stores, which amazon struggles to do.<p>Stores that don&#x27;t have the volume or margins (like guitar center) to support the physical locations are in for some hard times.')
