And yet I just can&#x27;t come up with a single example of something like that.<p>In fact I don&#x27;t believe I even think of myself in categories such as &quot;weak&quot; or &quot;strong&quot;. I know I&#x27;m extremely averse to conflict, which, I guess, would be considered &quot;weak&quot;. I&#x27;ll let you have your way (within reason), but then that&#x27;s the last time you&#x27;ll see me, which is probably not the outcome someone trying to exploit you is hoping for.')
