I don&#x27;t change jobs frequently.<p>&gt; Grow up, focus on your life<p>Considering I was married and raised a kid, I think that covers the growing up part.\nThe therapy part covers focusing on my life.<p>&gt; The first thing you should do is work extra hours to make up for the slacking<p>That&#x27;ll just be extra hours of not doing anything productive. I&#x27;ve tried it multiple times over the past months.<p>&gt; A proper diet and exercise is extremely important.<p>Check and check. Already taken care of. Not making a difference. Sleep is also fine.<p>&gt; After that, get a wholesome hobby you can pour yourself into.<p>That used to be my sport. I&#x27;ve picked up a few things that interest me and they&#x27;re fine. They don&#x27;t make a difference wrt job situation.<p>The main issue right now is that my life is falling apart around me (there&#x27;s even more to what I wrote in my post but I don&#x27;t feel like sharing everything) and I have a job that demands that I care too much about things. It&#x27;s very hard to care about a handful of online services that bear no impact on my life, when almost everything else is falling to pieces.<p>I need a less demanding job for my present situation. One that doesn&#x27;t require emotional involvement in what I do. Something task-oriented: do it, call it a day, do the next thing, call it a day... collect paycheck. Repeat. I&#x27;m just not in a position to decide what&#x27;s the best tech out of five options to build our next service AND mentor two junior devs AND review code from seven different people making sure it&#x27;s all coherent with the existing code base. Too much going on in life to care that much about things at work.')
