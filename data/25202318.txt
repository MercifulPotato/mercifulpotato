You can fell the tree, gassify it, and get a steady stream of fuel and pure carbon. The process is exothermic and produces enough energy to be self sustaining and produce excess fuel.<p>Bury the carbon and use the gas to produce energy and you have a forest that is a net reducer of carbon and a net positive energy producer.')
