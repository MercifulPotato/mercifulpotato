The prices I get are significantly cheaper because of the patent issue on that 2000 year old drug. For uncontrolled legacy drugs affected by patent issues this is probably viable for the tech savvy (and for those who can afford to wait quite a while). It would be nice if it could be done on an industrial scale instead of as an individual.')
