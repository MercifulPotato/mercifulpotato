I&#x27;m originally from Greece and can say that they&#x27;re a very nice opportunity because they usually offer nice relocation packages and are looking for International candidates.<p>Also depending on the product, it is possible to move to US positions if you&#x27;d like, so there&#x27;s that.<p>One of the best pros of working in a FAANG in Europe though is that for some countries, the companies inherit the culture. In my case, the country has an excellent work life balance culture. This has caused quite a few employees who moved to a US based product and then returned here, escaping the much worse working conditions in comparison. The only takeaway is that the compensation is much lower than the US, but this is largely due to the extremely higher taxes.')
