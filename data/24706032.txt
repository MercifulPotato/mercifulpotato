In parts of Sweden there is good access to clean power and the cool climate makes these centers relatively energy efficient.<p>Opponents claim that, excluding the temporary build phase, very few jobs are created. Since power isn&#x27;t limitless and these centers use a lot there is now no space left for other industries that create a magnitude more jobs per MWh. These centers also pay low taxes on the electricity so their overall contribution to society is minuscule compared to the resources they consume.')
