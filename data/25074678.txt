And there are cases it is ambiguous, for example they may have recovered from Covid (negative PCR) but died later from complications.<p>You will never have precise statistics, however, excess mortality for all causes more or less matches Covid deaths, so the numbers are roughly correct.<p>Worth noting that there are indirect effects. For instance because of the overworked health system, some completely unrelated diseases may not be treated as well, causing extra deaths. On the other hand, lockdowns may lower the risk of accident, transmission of other diseases, and even the nasty effect of pollution.<p>But the general idea is that these deaths are real.')
