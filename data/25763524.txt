Adobe don&#x27;t appear to sell consumer versions anymore, it&#x27;s only pro subscriptions now. Magix is sold at a &quot;vacation video friendly&quot; price, but doesn&#x27;t mention Intel in their marketing material.<p>I just don&#x27;t think the market for home devices is thinking about their video encoding time when they buy a laptop, but I do think they&#x27;ll use an M1 Mac and find it surprisingly fast, or hear from a friend or family member that they are really good.<p>Intel just haven&#x27;t been optimising for the main user experience seen by these people, or those writing &quot;normal&quot; server software either. They&#x27;ve been pushing AVX512 instead, which looks good for video or things like that, but not for regular use-cases.<p>Another good example is how fast the M1 chips (and the A chips in iPhones) perform at Javascript benchmarks. Those benchmarks look a lot more like what most people are doing most of the time than video encoding benchmarks.')
