I got two pull requests on one of my otherwise inactive repos last night.  The first one just tweaked one thing in the README pointlessly.  Seemed odd, but benign.  Then a second one came later; another small silly tweak.  Good to know the reason now.<p>Luckily that repo isn&#x27;t terribly important and was only two pieces of &quot;spam&quot;.  But I can&#x27;t imagine the shitstorm real open source projects are going to experience.  Either they have to weather the storm or, what, disable PRs for a month?  Yikes.')
