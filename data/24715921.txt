To avoid this tax they must also meet transparency guidelines for how inbound waste of this sort is disposed of.<p>This way the &quot;how do we deal with the waste?&quot; problem is handled by the same people who decide what materials to use in the first place.<p>We use the tax money to set up municipal recycling facilities that use the bar codes on the waste to sort it based on who made it, and instead of shipping it to third world countries they ship it there instead.')
