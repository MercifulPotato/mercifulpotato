Whenever I see a dweet I don&#x27;t yet understand, I can&#x27;t resist immediately pulling it to pieces - because I know the ceiling of time required to understand it is very low. Remixing is also a nice concept built into Dwitter that tempts you into golfing other people&#x27;s code further and creating interesting derivatives - both are good motivators to thoroughly understand all of the techniques packed into a dweet.<p>Once you get a bit more comfortable I would resist the urge to immediately publish, you will be surprised just how much work you can put into 140 characters. Don&#x27;t publish until you feel like you can&#x27;t remove another single character and have the best possible combination... then sleep on it, you will be surprised at the sudden revelations that happen and give you more road to play with... this will happen so long as you are not overly precious about anything - you can&#x27;t have everything - making frequent sacrifices is what leads you to more interesting combinations.<p>After building up a stash of unfinished ideas, you will also sometimes notice some synergy between them and can combine them into something more impressive. In the same vein... making tiny code is as much about exploration as experimentation... I <i>discovered</i> this combination that looks like a Stargate - i.e the skill is in <i>finding</i> things, rather than forcing your will upon a canvas.')
