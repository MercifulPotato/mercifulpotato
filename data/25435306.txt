That they may be average&#x2F;below average at many things, but they have spent a great deal of time to become well above average at, say, understanding how to manipulate people (which I stress may not be a conscious decision to be a bad person), rather than having, say, expert knowledge of automobile mechanics? I mean it&#x27;s a shitty thing, but it&#x27;s not really about &quot;worth&quot; per se, it&#x27;s about skill, and that skill doesn&#x27;t have to be ethically positive&#x2F;neutral')
