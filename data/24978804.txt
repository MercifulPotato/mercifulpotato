It heats our homes, it cooks our food, it runs our cars and our industry and lets us travel quickly from one place to another.  So let&#x27;s get rid of all fire departments and all forest control services, and let fire be as efficient as it can be.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s obviously a stupid position to take.  Fire is neither good nor bad; it&#x27;s a force that can be incredibly powerful when harnessed for good, and incredibly destructive when allowed to run rampant.   And there are times when it&#x27;s simply not the right tool for the job.<p>Markets are the same way.  Talking about the &quot;free market&quot; is a bit silly: All markets have constraints, either natural or artificial, and they optimize based on those constraints.  When appropriately channeled, they can be a powerful force for allocation of resources and experimentation.  When not appropriately controlled, they can destroy environments and harm society.  And sometimes it&#x27;s simply not the right tool for the job.')
