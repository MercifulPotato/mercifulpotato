There is the petty crime too, which I hear is becoming widespread in some problematic areas of big cities in Western Europe. There are social tensions, there are protests with occasional deaths and property damage, there is the radicalization of politics which may lead to all sorts of &quot;interesting&quot; things down the line. There is the &quot;reasonable&quot; restrictions on freedom of speech to counter the former, and yeah, it seems we are now talking about restricting privacy in the name of war on terror, which guarantees further increase in tensions and may enable a slide into totalitarianism in the future.<p>Remember that when Stalin started, he didn&#x27;t intend to kill millions of people for fun, he just wanted social justice. The terror &quot;happened&quot; along the way.')
