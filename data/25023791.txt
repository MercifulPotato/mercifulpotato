For one prediction, two predictions, no problem. They fall somewhere in this range with probability distribution (usually a Bell curve around the mean). But for hundreds, if not thousands, of polls to be so <i>systematically</i> off, it is not &quot;within the margin of error&quot; or a statistical fluke. If it was, you would expect a normal distribution around the mean of the polls. The mean was completely off.<p>Put simply, it was sampling bias. Pollsters screwed up. They either sampled the wrong voters, the wrong areas, mispredicted who would turn out, or voters did not accurately report who they planned to vote for. Garbage in, garbage out.<p>You can try to correct for sampling bias, but if you are blind to it, as your comment pushes more people to be, then you will fail.')
