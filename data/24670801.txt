I like Go, so I searched for a Hugo-template I liked and build some documentation for my project. Then I took a break from the project and when I wanted to update the documentation a few months later (minor changes), I spend about 2 days just bringing my content in sync with the updated template. What a horrible experience.<p>Maybe I was doing something wrong or the template author, but actually I am thinking about my best options currently, because I am 100% sure, I don&#x27;t want to go through that mess again. Even building plain HTML pages by hand would have been a lot easier for me than finding out why the updated template didn&#x27;t compile anymore.')
