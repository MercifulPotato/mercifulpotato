Thats still a lot of people if we hit Millions of infections\n2. you can also see that the death rate was much higher at the beginning: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;mortality-risk-covid" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;mortality-risk-covid</a>\n3. we are still not trying to get everyone from the street so they are not dying, we are getting them from the street that if they are dying, they are not dying because of full hospitals.<p>And of course doctors are getting better every day fighting it and learning more about it.<p>I personally absolutly don&#x27;t mind sitting around for a year to wait this out. I only have one live and i don&#x27;t want to have covid right now nor any long term issues from it.<p>Covid showed something quite interesting to me: You are better of in dooms day scenarios if you can sit it out a little bit.')
