All they had to do was &quot;encourage&quot; oculus owners to use facebook via various dark patterns, network effect or incentives. I bet they could have gotten 90% of oculus owners to use facebook accounts without much effort. Was that other 10% so important that they were willing to risk regulatory action? Was it greed? Hubris? Though I guess you could argue that VR is still in its infancy and there is no reason for any antitrust action. But why risk it?')
