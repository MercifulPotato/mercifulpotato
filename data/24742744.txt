Textbooks will skip crucial steps in their proofs. Math professors will be too lazy to update their course notes based on frustrated student feedback. Courses will lack tutorials and other ways to discuss problems. I shouldn&#x27;t have any reason to be watching youtube videos or khan academy to fill the gaps. But me, and thousands of others, are forced to do exactly that.')
