Item(by='long_warmup', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610301387, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25716462, text='&gt; If you run a social network, you need to decide what posts to allow on your platform. Every platform needs some moderation, lest they be overrun with spam and porn and scams.<p>Agree, spam&#x2F;porn&#x2F;scams are problem on this kind of platforms. But social media is only tiny part of tech in general, and also spam&#x2F;porn&#x2F;scams is not really political. And I guess, if in example somebody posted hateful content or content that is bringing damage then this is what our juridical system should handle?<p>&gt; If you develop artificial intelligence, you need to determine what applications of the technology are ethical. Is it okay to sell to authoritarian governments? What about the US military? What about individual police departments?<p>Most of the times I - as an engineer - have no say when it comes to those issues - from my experience these are business issues, not technical. And I guess these issues are probably influenced by politics, to some degree.<p>&gt; If you develop hardware, or run servers, you need to consider your impact on the planet.<p>I&#x27;d say same as above - it&#x27;s business to decide what to do about those issues. We as engineers think about efficiency - and had been thinking for decades, as far as my experience goes. I was always taught to build things that consume least amount of electricity, things that get from A to B with least effort. And Mr X or Mr Y being a president had no influence at those principles.')
