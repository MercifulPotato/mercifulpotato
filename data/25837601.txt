I don&#x27;t think I would&#x27;ve made it through another year of in-office work in a city I don&#x27;t have connection to. Meanwhile, thanks to pandemics, I&#x27;m back to my home town, where I have friends and family, I don&#x27;t have to go to the office and spend time with people I&#x27;m at best indifferent to, I don&#x27;t have to prepare clothes, worry about how I look etc., I can work in better conditions and thus am less tired at the end of the day.

I can see myself continuing in this career for some more time, while previously I was close to ready to just dropping it altogether.<p>Oh and BTW I&#x27;m not from US, so the political situation in your country doesn&#x27;t affect me (at least not directly).
