While you <i>can</i> find Intel flash in some third-party drives, it&#x27;s not particularly common. And even when Intel and Micron were still partnered for NAND, it was Micron that wanted to make smaller-capacity dies for use in things like smartphones and memory cards. Intel&#x27;s been all about big dies for big drives. This is really evident if you look at their market share in terms of SSD units shipped and in terms of SSD bytes shipped. Intel&#x27;s average drive capacity in Q2 was almost three times that of Hynix.')
