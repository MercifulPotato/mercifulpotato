It&#x27;s just the timing that matters. Domestic electricity demand during off-peak overnight hours is as little as 1&#x2F;3 as it is at peak time. If all those houses can run 4 kW of air conditioning, or heating, or electric ovens at 6PM, then there is 4 kW to spare at 2AM.<p>This issue has actually been studied in some detail by the UK&#x27;s National Grid. The conclusion was that additional demand from millions of electric vehicles <i>would</i> cause issues if they all were charged at peak times. But, provided demand can be managed, existing grid infrastructure can cope with an entirely electric vehicle fleet with modest investments in the coming years&#x2F;decades.<p>Fun fact: UK grid demand used to be significantly higher than it is today. It peaked at 62 GW in 2002, but it now rarely gets above 45 GW, despite significant population growth! Much of this reduction in demand is due to improved energy efficiency.<p>If we could handle 62 GW in 2002, then there&#x27;s no reason that we can&#x27;t handle 62 GW again in, say, 2042.')
