However it does make it more difficult to find and fix real problems, eg in France no one knows what exactly is going on.<p>I too agree that the US racial buckets are terrible. People from MENA countries like Saudi are white, and all Japanese&#x2F;Bangladesh&#x2F;Mongolian&#x2F;Indonesians are &quot;Asian&quot;, but somehow Pacific Islands got their own bucket. Makes no sense.<p>Plus now nearly everyone is heading towards mixed. My daughters friends are a bunch of Chinese&#x2F;Jamaican, Russian&#x2F;Indian, White&#x2F;Asian, White American&#x2F;African. Everyone is going to be just multiple buckets in a few generations.')
