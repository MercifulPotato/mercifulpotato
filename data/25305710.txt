It took like 30-60 seconds, during which it completely froze the (cooperatively-multitasked) OS. Of course it ate up a big chunk of memory at a time when our Mac had 16-24 MB of RAM total. And Netscape 3 was unstable enough that in a decent browsing session you&#x27;d have to relaunch it 2-3 times (each time unloading the  JVM). Lowering the available memory of course worsened the  stability.<p>The applets themselves performed alright. They took a few seconds to initialize but we were used to waiting for JPEGs and hover effects to load over a 14.4 modem so that wasn&#x27;t too bad relatively.')
