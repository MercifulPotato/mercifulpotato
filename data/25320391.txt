Manning did not know what was on the cables, and turns out, there was nothing damming in them.<p>The other leak at the time - the video showing the deaths of freelance journalists probably isn&#x27;t &#x27;evidence&#x27; either. It&#x27;s a shocking video, but the military misidentifying armed, unknown, unregistered individuals in a war-zone, moving towards friendly forces ... is a tragedy but probably not a crime. Though that leak is more contentious.<p>There are a lot of confused people in the world, who misconstrue their ideology for the more commonly agreed upon versions of what is right and wrong, and vast numbers of individuals in the press who are as much suited to narrative as they are to truth.<p>If you hop onto OAN right now, you&#x27;ll see a delightfully despicable and shocking number of individual &#x27;whistleblowers&#x27; who have &#x27;evidence&#x27; that the election was &#x27;stolen&#x27; by nefarious parties, and millions of people reading it believing that it&#x27;s true.<p>Their incentive is clicks, Rudy Giuliani&#x27;s is his pardon, or $20K&#x2F;day. Which is why I implied &#x27;crazy&#x27; incentives ...')
