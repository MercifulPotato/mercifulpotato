Our engineering productivity has fallen through the floor since COVID despite everyone working longer and harder; I fundamentally do not think remote teams can ever be as productive as in-person teams.<p>So far I haven&#x27;t found this to be the case. Somewhat the opposite in fact, although here I&#x27;d credit our move from scrum&#x2F;scrumban to Shape Up as much as working from home.<p>It&#x27;s not perfect though. We see evidence of low-lying morale and mental health issues. Nobody&#x27;s losing their minds, exactly, but plenty of people aren&#x27;t really happy. Of course, there are many wider reasons why that might be the case. E.g., lockdown in particular seems to turn every day into a sort of mundane Groundhog Day, especially for people who live alone.<p>The balance point will be different for different people but, certainly, for me, 100% WFH is not the perfect balance (but then neither is 100% office). At least I know I can adapt to 100% WFH well enough when I have to though (unlike 100% office).')
