It reports a mismatch in the length of the cigar notation and the actual read inside a BAM file. Lately I have become 99% sure that this sometimes happens in files that did not show this error before (we reprocess a lot of data from time to time). I suspect it is bit flips because I think bit flips can easily go unnoticed, but not in this case, because the cigar notation is a shorter description of the actual read and they should thus match. The mismatch signals a change in the file that occurred without us touching it.')
