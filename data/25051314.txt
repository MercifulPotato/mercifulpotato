It&#x27;s similar to the treasonous NSA - discussing it is simply outside of the mainstream Overton window, primary candidates who dare touch it are branded &quot;unelectable&quot; etc.<p>Speech gets swamped by mass propaganda. I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s possible to look at say the run up to the Iraq war and think that antiwar had a meaningful voice. When it comes down to it, the warmongers are just better funded, better connected, and take advantage of basic human nature.<p>Since it seems impossible to prevent the military from being used for elective wars, or even to simply downsize it, discouraging general support for the military makes sense (when <i>voice</i> fails, try <i>exit</i>). I&#x27;m not asking you to agree with my arguments above, but you don&#x27;t get to make a unilateral call that this isn&#x27;t a political viewpoint.')
