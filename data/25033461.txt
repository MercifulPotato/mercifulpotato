In fact, I recently restored my old NTC keyboard from the 80s. But having tried to use it, I just can&#x27;t get over the fact that these keyboards were seriously lacking modifier keys.<p>I need at least Ctrl, Alt and Command to work comfortably, and ideally also have Fn and Super. You can get away with remapping right-side modifiers to do something else, but you can&#x27;t add a key that isn&#x27;t physically there — so if the left side of the spacebar does not have at least three modifier keys, the keyboard is not very useful for me…<p>Also, having gotten used to the UHK (Ultimate Hacking Keyboard), I find that the huge space bar is a waste: I only ever hit the space key with the right thumb, and I&#x27;d much rather have an entire row of modifiers than a huge spacebar key, which mostly goes unused.')
