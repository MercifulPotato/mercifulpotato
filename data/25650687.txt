Everyone can dare to walk on it.<p>- Now the beam gets lifted up between two skyscrapers.<p>- Now almost no sane person would walk across it.<p>- If it starts burning in the building, at some point one will cross, if necessary by sitting and sliding yourself across: embarrassing but better than the alternative.<p>- If however there was a reliable safety net right underneath the beam a good number of us would enjoy crossing between even if there was no fire.<p>I think this example speaks volumes about how to get oneself and others to get past certain fears by making sure there are known, reliable safety nets.<p>FWIW: I found out a while ago that the example with the beam (or rather a plank) probably comes from Cou√©.
