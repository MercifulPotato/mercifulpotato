Psychological warfare is a well known military doctrine, if you want to see the sciences behind it, use the filetype:pdf tag on google with the terms psychoacoustics, psychographics, psychovisuals.  They teach these techniques when going for marketing degree&#x27;s and there are well documented studies on how the use of these techniques have ridiculosuly boosted profits e.g. supermarkets playing calm music and building their store like a maze to force customers to listen to calming music for a sufficiently long enough period of time to cause the autonomic and limbic nervous systems to relax thus increasing susceptability to other signals and triggers on packaging.  This specific technique has been linked to a 30-50% increase in revenue.<p>There is a strong argument these adversaries have built domestic terrorist cells who have been running around in gangs threatening people, razing buildings, and engaging in nonsensical political discussions about disposing with government services, and they are using a social media company owned by a foreign state with stated military objectives to organize.  Whether you want to view Antifa or Trump supporters as the terrorists, or TikTok, Twitter or Facebook as domesitic or foreign companies is a matter of perspective.<p>The fact is weapons of psychologcial warfare do not differentiate between targets and may yet proove to be as deadly as any WMD.<p>The reason Section 230 is under attack by the current regime is that astroturfing exercises on boards like this one to force perspective change and create sounding boards for corporate political policies has become a well documented business model as the recent deposition of FB and Twitter&#x27;s CEO infront of congress showed.<p>The real insanity is that any CEO would ever think messing with people&#x27;s brain chemistry without knowing what you are doing in order to make a buck was ever a good idea.<p>E2E solves none of the above.<p>Welcome to 2020.')
