Release the emails if they&#x27;re real so they can be verified. But also, isn&#x27;t it the same thing with Trump&#x27;s tax returns? All I&#x27;ve found so far is that the New York Times obtained copies, but they haven&#x27;t actually released them to the public to be verified. If anyone can find the actual copies I&#x27;d like to see.<p>We need to take all of the press releases about &quot;leaks&quot; with a grain of salt, because I keep seeing &quot;leaks&quot; without actual content or verification. It&#x27;s bullshit and why places that provide the actual contents of leaks are so important. Yes, certain publications are more trustworthy than others historically, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they get an indefinite pass on providing verified information.')
