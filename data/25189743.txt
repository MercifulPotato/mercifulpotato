See below where you wrote:<p>&gt;because otherwise people would stop becoming musicians<p>It&#x27;s about as cleanly supply and demand as you can get.  The supply of musicians willing to work for $x decreases, since they now have the option to do other work that is more preferred than being a musician for $x.  Therefore, you now have to pay more than $x to continue incentivizing a musician to be a musician.<p>Going back to your string quartet example, which I do not know if it&#x27;s true or not, but let&#x27;s suppose it is:<p>&gt;The reason a string quartet costs more now isn&#x27;t because there are fewer people who can play instruments, it&#x27;s because other things pay better.<p>The reason a string quartet costs more now is because there are fewer people who can play instruments (relative to demand, since price is where the supply and demand curves intersect).  Because other things pay better, fewer people (again, relative to demand) might choose to play instruments, causing less supply (relative to demand), causing prices to rise.<p>My point is that it&#x27;s all still just simple supply and demand curves.  If the demand for corn skyrockets, causing the price of corn to increase, and farmers choose to plant corn instead of wheat, then causing a decrease in the supply of wheat, then causing the price of wheat to increase, is that anything other than supply and demand?')
