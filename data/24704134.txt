Congratulations, you&#x27;ve just &quot;proven&quot; that you can&#x27;t find an American worker to do this job, so you bring the H1B worker over as basically an indentured servant.  In reality, there were plenty of American workers who could have and would have taken the role if it was represented properly and actually paid a competitive market salary.')
