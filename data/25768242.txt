The UK has a whole suite of these and London is number one in EU (out of now) for tech startups<p>* Similarly non-tax pro-entrepreneur reforms and help: bankruptcy protections (the US does this very well, the UK very badly); access to mortgages &#x2F; leases and credit for the self employed; better management of taxes and benefits; reform of regulation for smaller businesses; and media campaigns to make starting (and failing at) a new company more acceptable socially. The UK does great at some of these (starting a business is easy), badly at others (bankruptcy is a nightmare here).<p>* Legal reforms around freedom: so you can break non-competes (the UK does ok at this and the EU too I think); so it&#x27;s harder to enforce IP that isn&#x27;t being actively used; to prevent large established companies from bullying smaller ones (less of a problem already because the rest of the world doesn&#x27;t follow the &quot;American Rule&quot; for court cost...)<p>* there are a bunch of smaller initiatives that can assist too: government buy-local and buy-small policies; entrepreneur training and projects in schools and universities, requiring graduate programs to accept delayed&#x2F;older entries (so you can take a year off between uni and SafeCorp without worrying you&#x27;ll never get back on the ladder), encouraging contracting over employment.<p>All of that should drive entrepreneurship. That will hopefully build an eco system (suppliers, capital providers etc.) and it can grow organically from there.<p>I&#x27;m not sure it will ever be Silicon Valley in London or Amsterdam or Berlin. Partly there are established industries that soak up talent tech workers (finance in the UK) but also because software is a &quot;winner take all&quot; market most of the time. Even hardware can be that way too. And that&#x27;s just not the European culture.')
