Companies like Disney are making record profits. Instead of relying on taxes and fees to make government-approved entertainment why not simply... make content people want to watch?<p>Well, it&#x27;s a question of which devil you want.<p>In the case of Disney, much of their profits are driven by an entire <i>lifestyle</i> that they are selling. There&#x27;s the Media itself, but then all the toys, the amusement parks, etc. And all of the advertising that goes with those, and all of the social impacts it has as a result (see next point for more)<p>If you go for an advertising based model, You wind up with 2nd or 3rd order social impacts. Even in the 80s, the decade of &#x27;greed is good&#x27;, the FTC put limitations on advertising in children&#x27;s programming due to the psychological impacts it had. (I&#x27;d be curious to see another good look taken today, but regulators are even more toothless now than they were then.)<p>In both cases, however, you are at the end of the day going to be beholden to either your advertisers, or your corporate overlords for your content. And if they don&#x27;t like that content, it will not see the light of day in any meaningful form, regardless of the public interest.<p>I feel all approaches have their place, but perhaps the advertising model could use a bit more modernization in it&#x27;s regulation, with what we now understand about behavioral psychology.')
