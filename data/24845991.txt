I don&#x27;t think it works with the `trash` module you&#x27;re using from npm.<p>A few other ideas&#x2F;improvements I&#x27;ve had:<p>- Do not immediately delete metadata if a file is removed. For example, if the hub contains multiple sources, some which may not always be mounted (external drives or cloud drives), deleting metadata may mean that it needs to be re-analyzed when the drive is present again. Maybe a soft-delete of this metadata would be better, so the video is hidden from the library, and then you could have an option to purge historical data periodically &#x2F; on-demand.\n- Option to show the full file-path in one of the gallery views<p>Thanks!! If I ever get around to it I&#x27;ll get in touch on gh.')
