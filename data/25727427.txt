If I have to record what people said in a meeting, accurately because I want to quote rather than summarise them, joined up writing is invaluable.<p>&gt; ... not easier to read<p>This is the downside. At the end of a meeting where I was responsible for taking minutes, I&#x27;d usually check back through my note book to make sure I could actually interpret what I&#x27;d written.<p>And in case people say - Why didn&#x27;t I just record the meeting - there are still places where electronic recording devices are disallowed for security reasons.')
