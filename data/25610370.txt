Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609561459, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25607550, text='&gt; That is a common but very shallow take on Steve Jobs management. Yes, there are instances of him being abrasive, but he led some very successful tech development efforts which involved getting people to come together around difficult goals.<p>He might have had other talents that compensated (at a corporate level) for the damage from his asshole behaviors, but it seems pretty clear that he was, in fact, an asshole.  Not all those stories are from the workplace, that second link is all about how he treated his daughter.<p>The issue here is how does having an asshole like that at the top affect the rest of the company&#x27;s culture and the behavior of the <i>other</i> managers?')
