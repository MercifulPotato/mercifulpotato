Item(by='akalsz', descendants=None, kids=[25006431, 25006432, 25006111, 25009156, 25008662], score=None, time=1604651322, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25004476, text='&gt; reCAPTCHA<p>&gt; anonymous<p>Pick one. reCAPTCHA is based on tracking users in countless unknown ways, which is why it&#x27;s basically unusable with any kind of known proxy (i.e. Google usually classifies Tor users or users from 3rd world countries as bots by default). It may be stopping &quot;dark web hackers&quot;, exactly because it&#x27;s unsolvable by anyone Google decides to be a potential threat, and that also includes bots.<p>Honestly, I feel like everyone would be better off if instead of reCAPTCHA, websites just used some service that automatically blocks proxies. That way you aren&#x27;t getting Google to track legit users, and still forbidding potential users from joining who would otherwise be blocked by reCAPTCHA. And maybe if Google isn&#x27;t watching me on your website, perhaps I&#x27;ll be more inclined to visit you from my actual IP.<p>Or just use something that is actually solvable by humans, like hCaptcha. Cloudflare did that and it&#x27;s wonderful (well, compared to reCAPTCHA), I can solve it in a few seconds, unlike reCAPTCHA which I can keep clicking on for countless minutes only to get told that &quot;my network is sending too many requests&quot; or something.')
