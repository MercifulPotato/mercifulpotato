One of my classmates signed to me killing himself with a finger gun to his head when he was partnered with that guy. People thought he was weird and avoided him. He&#x27;d talk about how his therapist mentioned he should be more open with others, how he was struggling with personal issues. Clearly he was oversharing. But I fucking adored listening to that guy. It was like looking in a mirror. I still think about him now and then. If he was in a support group for depressed people I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;d have been a hit. In another context it would not have been oversharing. Very friendly guy. Sadly I never bothered to even say hello, something I really regret.<p>I went to a bar last week for a burger to bring home. The lady behind the bar pointed out how my hands were trembling, even more than hers normally do. I told her I drink too much caffeine and sometimes forget to eat. She told me she gets that. I went back next week, hoping to eat in instead and make some small talk with her but the bar was too busy. I&#x27;m interested in getting to know more about her, she might have struggled with the same things as me. Found it interesting that she mentioned and related to my trembling hands somehow, most people never mention it. She might enjoy listening to my personal struggles as much as I enjoyed listening to that guy back in university. Or maybe she just wants better tips. I&#x27;ll have to play around in a conversation and try to feel it out. Most likely this will go absolutely nowhere. I&#x27;ve had similar encounters throughout this year and usually the person is just trying to be nice but you never know. The food is good at least.<p>I&#x27;ve been paying someone for about half a year to teach me an instrument. He really enjoys music. He mentioned teaching some Christmas music around December. I talked a bit about the music I listened to during Christmas growing up. How when I was young I once dressed up in a traditional costume and sung traditional songs with other kids. I asked about how he celebrated Christmas when he was younger. He seemed to enjoy hearing how music has played a role in my life, I enjoyed listening to how it played a role in his.<p>A janitor stopped me last week at my workplace. Told me a funny anecdote from his life about an escalator, a lady and his son. I didn&#x27;t really care about the personal aspects since I&#x27;m younger and don&#x27;t have a family but I enjoyed the laugh. I&#x27;ve been trying to think of a joke from my life that I could share with him next time I run across the guy. He probably won&#x27;t care about my depression unless there&#x27;s a laugh there. But that&#x27;s ok, I don&#x27;t care about whatever struggles he may have had while raising his son. I can&#x27;t relate to that part of him.<p>These are three people that I currently genuinely look forward to seeing again. Hoping to share aspects of my life with them whether it&#x27;s about a struggle, a song or a laugh. It has been so many years since I looked forward to talking to someone. I&#x27;m finding that if you&#x27;re vulnerable and open about things the other person can relate to they tend to find it endearing. If you&#x27;re vulnerable and open about things other person can&#x27;t relate to, or worse looks down on, then you&#x27;re tending towards oversharing.<p>Once covid is over and larger gatherings are safer I will go around the city going to where the musicians go. Whether it&#x27;s a jam at a park or a live show in a dark dingy room. There&#x27;s plenty of songs written by horribly depressed people, sometimes it feels like my soul vibrates listening to that kind of music. I&#x27;m sure someone out there feels like that too. I will go looking for them, I will find them and we will make beautiful sounds well into a warm summer night. That&#x27;s my goal for this year.<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to use the pot as a tool to play therapist and act on changes I feel need to be made. I&#x27;ve had a bad experience with a therapist in the past and it&#x27;s one of the reasons I don&#x27;t want to go back. It would probably be much easier if I wasn&#x27;t doing this alone. A good therapist will be able to help you find ways of not just being more open and forthcoming but doing so appropriately and comfortably. You should feel excited and happy to share things with people you know, it shouldn&#x27;t make you feel stressed or anxious.<p>edit:\n&quot;Part of the problem seems to be that I can&#x27;t help but feel like the people that I think of as good friends see me as more of an acquaintance.&quot;<p>Personally I try not to label my relationships with people, I&#x27;d struggle with it as well. Instead I try to let our interactions dictate our relationship rather than my expectations&#x2F;desires. I met some people last year that were into video games &#x2F; board games. We seemed to get along, were friendly with each other. I work on video games so I love talking about them. When I tried to organize something we could do together I got crickets. It is what it is.')
