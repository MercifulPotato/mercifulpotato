Can also work in a swarm of two or three machines for more effective material handling. All controlled by a remote operator whose sole job is to hit the stop button if he spots anything on the camera that shouldn&#x27;t be there, e.g. an underground power line that wasn&#x27;t mapped. Was a fun project to work on.')
