Why not?<p>That&#x27;s not a counter question. A file system is an abstraction over the physical layout of your hard drives. An accounting system is an abstraction above your accounts.<p>In the same way, you don&#x27;t need one hard drive per folder, you don&#x27;t need a separate bank account per bookkeeping account.<p>My take away from the closure of Simple and some commenters laments is that personnal accounting still suck.')
