His article reads like an Apple keynote transcript, everything is magical and amazing, a marvel and mindbogglingly great. No wonder they throw him so many exclusives ;)<p>Yes M1 is great. But it&#x27;s a closed system (no booting Linux or Windows at this time) and even under macOS you&#x27;re having even less access to the system&#x27;s internals than before. Also, Apple performs many tricks to get such long battery life, such as putting apps to sleep when you&#x27;re not looking at them (app nap). I find this extremely irritating when working with my Mac but I can&#x27;t turn it off completely even though I have a mini and thus battery life is not a factor at all. My work MacBook spends it entire life docked with the screen closed too.<p>M1 is a solid platform for sure, better for laptops than intel&#x2F;amd&#x27;s offerings. I agree. But I&#x27;m getting enough of Apple&#x27;s (and Gruber&#x27;s) hypey marketing. It&#x27;s not magic, just good engineering. I stopped watching their keynotes for the same reason.')
