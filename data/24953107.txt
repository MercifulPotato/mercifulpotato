Quite honestly an objective AI that also has faster reaction times is likely to be a better driver than any human, it’s just a matter of training data.<p>Note: I’m not going to say Tesla isn’t being at least moderately reckless with its rollout of self-driving features, just that I firmly believe even a less than ideal AI with good enough training and sensor data can trounce the safety record of human drivers.')
