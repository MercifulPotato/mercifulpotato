Concepts are a convention, there&#x27;s no insight that the compiler has into any of it, and the compiler error messages that you get are very hard to comprehend.<p>Resist the urge to write this kind of code, at least for now. It is not worth it. Being generic isn&#x27;t valuable when it slows you down because of longer compile times and because you can&#x27;t make sense of some trivial error that is obfuscated by several pages of template error messages.<p>Furthermore, even if the error messages weren&#x27;t that awful, even if compile times didn&#x27;t blow up, writing this kind of code is likely not a productive use of your time. More likely, it&#x27;s masturbation, and C++ already has more than enough of that.')
