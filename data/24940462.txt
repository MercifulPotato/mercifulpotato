But making grand pronouncements about people (&quot;everyone else&quot;) and their problems as you see them (&quot;without doing any critical thinking or experimentation of their own&quot;) and teachers too - and apparently based solely upon your personal experience \nin school and your thoughts on one church that just happens to be physically nearby you - isn&#x27;t gonna convince anyone. Your comment is ignorant and offensive to teachers.')
