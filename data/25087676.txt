You don&#x27;t need to hack if you have insiders do the bidding for you. But let us keep conspiracies aside for a minute. The issue is not even someone attacking the system. The system is weak in and itself. Why? There have been many &quot;software glitches&quot; that switch votes from one candidate to another literally overturning the election result. Be it Antrim County or Oakland County. These &quot;glitches&quot; or in some cases &quot;human errors&quot; show the elections are not secure. How can you call something &quot;secure&quot; when you have 6000 votes switching from one candidate to another? You don&#x27;t even need a foreign actor to destabilize the elections when the system is so poorly designed that it can screw up on its own!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freep.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;michigan&#x2F;oakland&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;06&#x2F;oakland-county-election-2020-race-results&#x2F;6184186002&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freep.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;michigan&#x2F;oakland&#x2F;2020...</a><p>Quoting:<p>“Apparently, there was a technical glitch in Rochester Hills. And so I actually ended up winning by a little over 1,100 votes,” said a chuckling Kochenderfer.<p>The margin was 1,127 votes, to be exact. That gave him a 51.67% share of the total (with 48.23% going to his opponent, Hartman).<p>The fresh result buoyed the incumbent’s spirits but also had him worried about how to prevent future election errors, he said.<p>“I’m very grateful to the officials who caught the error, but we need to ensure that we catch these issues, or prevent them entirely,” Kochenderfer said.<p>&quot;People are acting like fixing our elections is a partisan thing when it shouldn&#x27;t be partisan,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;we do have a very, very good clerk in Rochester Hills.&quot;<p>“A computer issue in Rochester Hills caused them to send us results for seven precincts as both precinct votes and absentee votes. They should only have been sent to us as absentee votes,” Rozell said in a text message.')
