Item(by='HourglassFR', descendants=None, kids=[24755030], score=None, time=1602513852, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24754333, text='&gt; To dismiss all evidence of UAP&#x27;s out of hand as &quot;illogical&quot; is just as unscientific as to accept them as being proof of ET visitation.<p>I think it&#x27;s pretty disingenuous to present those two takes as being equally bad. Yes we don&#x27;t know everything and leaving room for extraordinary things to happen is healthy, but I have yet to see evidences that aliens have cause a UAP. On the other hand we have good empirical evidence that sighting of unusal phenomenas with perfectly mundane explanations can, and do, create testimonies of so called &quot;alien visitations&quot;. We even have pretty good psycho-sociological explanations for why this happens.<p>So without even looking at the specific details of a particular UAP sighting, coming at it from the angle of &quot;people probably saw weird stuff and their brains filled the gap&quot; is the right approach in my opinion. That doesn&#x27;t mean we have to stop here of course, but it is a sensible default position.')
