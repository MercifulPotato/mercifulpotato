This grinds my gears so bad. Wherever this trend started (and I&#x27;ve seen it in many games -- I think RDR2 and Witcher 3 most recently for me), it should really stop. Do developers think it&#x27;s some sort of positive surprise when you get to see how they paraphrased (at best) the menu option into dialogue? Or is it just laziness&#x2F;sloppiness around keeping the menus and dialogue in sync?<p>If I was to develop a game, I&#x27;d make it an invariant in the game engine that the wording on the menu option is what your character will say next, full stop.')
