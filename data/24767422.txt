When someone made a mistake or didn&#x27;t find the best answer, it&#x27;s great to explain why and supply correct information, but please avoid mixing in putdowns, and if your comment is <i>just</i> a putdown, please don&#x27;t post.<p>Otherwise we end up with basically this: Person 1: &quot;I am very smart.&quot; Person 2:&quot; Rubbish. It is <i>I</i> who am very smart.&quot; That is not interesting, regardless of who is smarter. Worse, it all-too-easily turns a community like HN into an unfriendly place.<p>When in doubt, simply remember that the intended spirit is <i>curious</i> conversation, and then your comments will naturally contain interesting details and insights without the other stuff.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>')
