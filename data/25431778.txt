If you&#x27;ve cultivated your ability to learn, if you believe based on prior history that you can master things over time, and and if you&#x27;ve developed the patience to give yourself time, you get a virtuous cycle, and self-esteem is one of the outcomes, imposter syndrome be damned. If you have a falsely confident sense of your own capabilities borne from not being able to truly assess yourself, self-esteem happens to be one of the results, but it&#x27;s emotionally fragile.<p>I think control and self-discipline is a repeatable path to competence and self-esteem based on what you are actually capable of.')
