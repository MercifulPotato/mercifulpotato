That makes a good barometer of the economy as it can describe if job losses are accelerating or not.&quot;<p>I think this is a perceptive statement; U-3 is most like the derivative of unemployment, so it&#x27;s sensitive to changes, but not to steady-state issues.<p>We should probably look at U-6 to help understand where we stand long-term, and U-3 to get a glimpse of whether things are getting better or worse. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think many people want to think about these issues separately, so they&#x27;ll only want one number.')
