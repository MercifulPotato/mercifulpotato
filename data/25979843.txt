Total body workout for 45 minutes - you need a good yoga mat to protect your knee&#x2F;back -&gt; youtube, pick 2-3 different videos from different &quot;instructors&quot;.<p>&gt; If it has to be something like pushups it at least has to be a routine simple enough so I don&#x27;t have to watch some fitness dude or gal on youtube and follow them. I&#x27;d rather watch or listen to something interesting in that time.<p>I tried doing fitness and have my mind somewhere else: didn&#x27;t work well. Don&#x27;t fight it, listen to what they say, focus 100% do it right so you can learn what muscle is targeted for which exercise and to avoid injury as well.<p>&gt; any science based plan on how or what I should train?<p>Most trainings are science based.<p>Get a dumbbell (buy 1 pair) or kettlebell (buy 1 piece), expand your total body workout to include a little bit of strength training.<p>2. Run 5k&#x2F;10k - you need good running shoes<p>Yes, it&#x27;s boring, but the journey from couch to 5k then figured out how to reach 10k, has been a great challenge + journey + accomplishment. Learn how to run correctly. Learn how to reduce toll on your body via different training methods.<p>3. Cycling - yeah, it takes time; time well spent in my case<p>Sign up with strava. Track your metrics. See if you can climb higher elevation. See if you can bike longer&#x2F;further. Plan your route. If you can do 50k with some hills, can you plan 70k without hills? All these planning is fun for me.<p>Personally exercise takes my mind off from routine works (regardless if you&#x27;re doing R&amp;D or CRUD app: they&#x27;re the same, there&#x27;s a pattern and routine even in &quot;exciting ML research&quot;).<p>I feel relieved&#x2F;recharged after a 5-10k run session or a long bike ride.<p>I enjoy the process c25k (couch to 5k). I enjoy the process to move the goalposts to hit 10k. I love that feeling of achievement too.<p>I realized that running 5-10k regularly requires me to take care of my body: sleep + nutritions + muscle building (this is why I do total body workout + strength training).<p>I acquired new sets of skills&#x2F;ways of thinking from all these exercise.<p>Just like software has technical debt. Our body needs to be maintained as well.<p>I love&#x2F;enjoy the journey from not knowing about fitness in general to where I am today. Fitness becomes my hobby aside from software development and I&#x27;m happy that I chose to invest in myself.')
