He was immunocompromised, worried about COVID, and said he hated Trump&#x27;s character.<p>And yet, he said he was voting for Trump. Why? Because Joe Biden was a <i>pedophile</i> whose son <i>f~~ked underage Chinese children</i> and took money from a <i>Ukranian dictator</i> to influence US policy.<p>He saw Biden as <i>more</i> amoral than Trump. I think this is a significant demographic block that&#x27;s been ignored, because the media class doesn&#x27;t really meet with people of these sort. He was extremely convinced, and I&#x27;m sure he really believed it. He really seemed upset about the moral quandary of voting for Trump vs. voting for a pedophile.')
