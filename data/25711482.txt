Which hopefully provides you enough room to move forward with the discussion.<p>-------<p>I wouldn&#x27;t sweat it. I don&#x27;t think your argument is &quot;lazy&quot;. If anything, you&#x27;re posting in too many threads simultaneously.<p>If I were in your boat, I&#x27;d start cutting out the threads which are least helpful, and start focusing on the discussion threads which are most promising.<p>Not all discussions are fruitful. If you have fewer discussions, you&#x27;ll find that you&#x27;ll naturally result in higher-quality discussions. You shouldn&#x27;t feel the need to respond to everyone.')
