I started telling them how wikipedia is a digital version of encyclopedias, which many of us used to have in our home, came in ~20 book sets and had articles about almost everything you could want to know about. My younger daughter&#x27;s response to the idea of having a 20 book set about all sorts of different topics was &quot;Why would you do that?&quot; Not only are things like Encarta and Encyclopedias foreign to kids growing up, the logic on why one would need something like that is lost on them. It&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing (wikipedia is awesome in its own right), but it is interesting.')
