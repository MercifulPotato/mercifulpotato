I am thinking C.S. Lewis specifically. Many of his works he knew the philosophical themes that would be present before writing them, but none of the come off as preachy (though some of his children books are basic) because they are such good stories.<p>On the whole though I do think a lot of discovery and learning takes place well writing. Though I have never written a novel so I do not really know.')
