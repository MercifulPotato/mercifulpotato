I don&#x27;t know, maybe, but the capital can certainly make a two-sigma (.95) founder competitive, and a three-sigma (.997) founder without capital is probably f&#x27;ed. Or maybe a two-sigma founder with access to capital is the definition of a four-sigma founder, because how could you be recognized as that without having the capital.')
