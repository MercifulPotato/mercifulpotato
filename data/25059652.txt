Item(by='api', descendants=None, kids=[25068747], score=None, time=1605111881, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25059292, text='My biggest concern about Biden is that he will return to the status quo with China. Pushing back on China is literally the only thing I agreed with the Trumpists about, but it&#x27;s a big thing and I did at times wonder if Trump was worth it to break the Chinese liberalization delusion. Chemotherapy is literal poison and makes you sick, but sometimes it&#x27;s what is needed.<p>It is <i>impossible</i> for American companies that must operate under American EPA and OSHA rules to compete with Chinese companies that can completely disregard the environment and employ borderline (or even literal, see Uyghur &quot;work programs&quot;) slave labor. This is doubly true when the state is subsidizing these industries to &quot;dump&quot; on the market and drive competitors out of business and is employing its state intelligence agencies to conduct industrial espionage on their behalf. Private companies cannot compete with governments because governments can do things private actors fundamentally cannot.<p>A similar unfair trade issue exists with other countries, but China is <i>by far</i> the largest.<p>If we return to treating China like a developing nation (it isn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s a superpower) or a liberal democracy (it isn&#x27;t), we will continue to see a collapse of the working class in the West. If that trend continues we will see a much smarter, slicker, and more ruthless totalitarian come to power in 2024 or 2028. Whether this future dictator of America is hard-left or hard-right mostly depends on which side fields the most compelling demagogue. Ultimately the working class won&#x27;t care if a Lenin&#x2F;Stalin or a Hitler is handing out the pitchforks.<p>A defense of the (minority) rioting wing of BLM and other recent protestors I&#x27;ve heard is &quot;a riot is the voice of the powerless.&quot; I sympathize with this view a bit, but people need to understand that Trump was in part a political riot of the working class. An actual quote I heard in 2016: &quot;I can&#x27;t throw a Molotov cocktail through the window of the White House, but I can throw a Trump.&quot; If trends continue another riot is guaranteed and this one may be much more destructive.')
