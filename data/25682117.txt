It’s <i>calling a function.</i><p>Calling a function can be easily, and incorrectly, modeled by representing the arguments as variables stored at a fixed position in memory. (As function calls used to work.) Once you introduce recursion, this model breaks down and you are forced to think in terms of activation records&#x2F;stackframes.<p>Probably those people learnt function calls in the former way first, meaning that recursion represented a conceptual leap for them.')
