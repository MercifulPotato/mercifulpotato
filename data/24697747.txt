Then you spend a few more hours investigating why you now have fungus gnats all over the house, and start looking into alternative soil media, hydro, and semi-hydro, and you start filling up the odd corners of your house with various liquid fertilizers, and you spend a few hundred on grow lights because you live an an apartment with no balcony and your windows don&#x27;t get enough light.<p>Source: started growing herbs over the summer<p>Still a fun hobby though! I wouldn&#x27;t give it up for anything, but if I valued my gardening time at a pay rate equal to my work time, I&#x27;ve spent thousands upon thousands of dollars for probably &lt; $100 worth of food')
