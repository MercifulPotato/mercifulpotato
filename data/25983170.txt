Bitcoin can be an asset like gold, of which users keep a portion of their networth to protect from economic uncertainty.<p>Seems improbable, as it is far less stable than Gold.

The main indicator for me is that Bitcoin is always measured in Dollars (or some other fiat currency), instead of having some value that it taken to be it&#x27;s own. Have you ever heard someone say &quot;This bike cost me 0.63 Bitcoin&quot;?')
