I use it as an appliance with a steam client and a browser.  Do most users actually need more than that?<p>It&#x27;s arguably easier to use than windows and macOS because it doesn&#x27;t require a bunch of separate sign-ins to do things.<p>I think the only &quot;hard part&quot; for the average user is getting into the boot settings to actually install ubuntu.  For a developer I think it&#x27;s a non-issue.')
