All of these are largely responsible for the deregulation that allowed these financial instruments to become legal. We need consequences or this system will remain broken, I think. Fraud is a crime that many lower class people consistently go to prison for. It&#x27;s times like these that I personally realize that MLK was right when he said the system we have in place is not justice, it makes a mockery of justice. These people&#x2F;institutions continue to get richer without repercussions, and ready to benefit during the recovery from every crash meanwhile poor people get shafted.')
