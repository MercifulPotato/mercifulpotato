It doesn&#x27;t have decades of history, so there&#x27;s less of a situation of having a bunch of legacy ways to do things with various footguns. Cargo makes it easy to pull in crates and build things with them. Some of it&#x27;s parts, like Serde, are really slick. Others, like async support, are still a little tricky.<p>On the other hand, there&#x27;s no denying that C++ has a massive library of integrations with all sorts of things, and supports way more hardware, due to it&#x27;s immensely long history. It&#x27;s the preferred way to interact with most of the native GUI libraries out there. There&#x27;s a zillion libraries you can connect to your C++ code. It&#x27;s probably a little more complex than the best Rust integrations, but better a well-tested natively supported integration than trying to build a new Rust integration around it, or rely on a half-finished open-source project that nobody cares enough about to support.<p>If any of those C++ reasons sound like something important to you or that you might want to work with in the future, then go with C++.')
