Many people come here because of their technical or product development background&#x2F;interests, and the way they show expertise is by second-guessing technical, user interface, and other issues.<p>As a result of this combination of constraint and desire, we get a bunch of comments where HNers talk about how they&#x27;d make Signal (as well as every other product) better&#x2F;more useful.<p>[1] From Deborah Tannen&#x27;s works')
