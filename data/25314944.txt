What I want is an easy way to publish my projects and for other people to contribute, I need something more like email (independent, self-hosted servers with a well defined protocol to communicate between them) than Facebook.<p>I don&#x27;t care about the governance of my git remote, or getting money out of it. I care about it being reliable, fast and simple. If I&#x27;m unhappy with it I want to be easily able to switch to a different host, or create my own.<p>Frankly I would be perfectly fine with the current situation where you have a bunch of effectively centralized code hosting solutions (github, gitlab, bitbucket etc...) if you could trivially move your project from one to an other. For the code it&#x27;s easy, git is built that way. For issues, PRs and the like it&#x27;s trickier.<p>For me that&#x27;s the problem that needs solving, I don&#x27;t need an ultra complicated blockchain-powered solution where people can vote for the font of the UI with cryptotokens.<p>At a glance, and if I understand it correctly, Radicle seems more pragmatic in that way. Cryptocurrency is used for donation and securing entries in the global namespace in a decentralized way, the rest is just a bunch of standalone servers. Then you can decide to host your code on an existing instance or spawn your own. A bit like how Mastodon works for instance.')
