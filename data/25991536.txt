This still seems to be a <i>pretty</i> good track record, all things considered. (There&#x27;s a pretty huge CPU jump between the 3rd generation and 4th generation, including a move from 32-bit to 64-bit.)<p>Unrelatedly, though,<p>&gt; I want a dumb TV with good HDMI and other specs, to which I can connect whatever display device I want (or many).<p>I would have loved to have found one of those that also met the 4K HDR requirement I&#x27;d set to upgrade from my blissfully dumb plasma set. I&#x27;m not unhappy with my my LG OLED by any stretch, but it would be really damn nice if there was a &quot;turn all of WebOS off and just be a TV set&quot; feature.')
