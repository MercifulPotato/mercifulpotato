And nothing has changed, it still looks Java. It is still heavy, although start up speed are now better. But generally speaking an Electron Apps ( VS Code ) looks and works better than that.<p>Eclipse is still better look wise, as it was 10+ years ago. That was basically the reason why I choose SWT back then. But it is still not perfect.<p>So I decide to check out another consumer Desktop App from similar era, Vuze, or used to be called Azureus. And it is the same, Desktop Java Apps. And yes that was the reason why no many were using Consumer Desktop Java Apps. They dont look good, heavy on resources, need JDK etc....<p>As if nothing has changed in the past 15 years. I remember I was trying to use GCJ and SWT for Desktop Apps then, it was just too hard. I gave up. And it seems no one cares about decent, java desktop apps.')
