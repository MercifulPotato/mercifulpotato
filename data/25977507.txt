If you&#x27;re doing this, then you&#x27;re likely using docker incorrectly. Your container should be run from images that are automatically deployed. If there&#x27;s an issue, fix local and deploy image.<p>2. I agree, that sounds dreadful. We use pyenv and poetry for local development and docker for deployments. That would address your issue. We of course do not use pyenv or poetry inside the docker image. Hopefully that helps clarify potential real world use.<p>3. Your should not be debugging a live deployment. Debugging local container is straight forward in VSCode.<p>4. This shouldn&#x27;t be an issue. Prune weekly, and aim for smallest images where possible, e.g., 60MB for python microservice.<p>The value is in the simplicity of deployment. Need to host a well-known software? Can be up or down no time.')
