Most people can&#x27;t afford it. This means we&#x27;d end up with significantly fewer written works<p>You cant monitor and control what people read nor should you want to. The desired goal imho is to make available to the reader as much material as possible. Readers have finite funds (if any) You could similarly argue that if some 4% ends up with the writers most can&#x27;t afford to write.<p>&gt; James Patterson-type formulaic crap...<p>I don&#x27;t dare have an opinion.

I liked how Prince put it: Finally people can make music for the sake of making music.')
