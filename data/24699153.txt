If you get tested to soon or too late your antibody level will not be high enough to trigger a positive result.  If your family got them at varied times after infection, or if you got more than one test, it would be very unlikely you hadn&#x27;t gotten a positive result.<p>Conventional wisdom is that it peaks ~3 weeks after infection, and is highest for 1-2 weeks around that time.  In practice everyone reacts differently and it can be hard to predict.  I was infected in March and I&#x27;m still testing positive every 1-2 weeks.  That&#x27;s because I had a fairly rough go round, and developed a very heavy immune response.  Asymptomatic[1] people may mount a very limited response and never test positive for antigens at all.<p>&gt; Since then, I&#x27;ve had a persistent &quot;throat-clearing&quot; thing. Lots of &quot;harUMPHf.&quot; My sense of taste never fully recovered, either (that was the weirdest part of it. I&#x27;ve never had that happen before).<p>It took me an inhaler and 4+ months to clear out my lungs.  Constantly coughing up thick sludge.  That inhaler was a godsend during the worst part of it- helped me move stuff around when I needed air most.  I still have breathing issues (damage to the blood vessels), but I can fill my lungs easily now.<p>[1]: NB that due to the way lung problems work, &quot;asymptomatic&quot; cases can still inflict a lot of damage.  Since your oxygen demands and supplies are constantly changing -due to exertion, air quality, altitude etc- your body is used to quietly adjusting your heart rate and breathing rate up without you noticing.  Your lungs can go through some <i>serious</i> losses of efficiency and put a lot of strain on your heart before you notice.  This goes double for people with high anaerobic tolerance; if you run a few times a week you will just ignore co2 buildup to a much higher level than a couch potato.')
