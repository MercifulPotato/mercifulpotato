At least that wasn&#x27;t my experience in China. I personally know they bought licenses for things like Matlab and TouchDesigner and whatnot. There are no local equivalents and local brands are not very highly respected. In my very short interning experience in Japan - thing were much more insular and they like their own Japanese brands')
