Period.<p>This isn&#x27;t true at all.<p>We&#x27;ve had mail-in voting in Australia for decades, and there is no signature matching.<p>Some US states do use it at all.<p>Signature verification is error prone and becoming more-so as less people use their signatures regularly.<p>&gt; Bad ballot Rejection rate of 6% in previous election to now 0.02%, with mail in ballots.<p>Wikipedia says in the 2016 election 1% of mail ballots were rejected[1]. I&#x27;d expect that to be a lot less this year because of the increased emphasis on it and the much higher numbers, but I haven&#x27;t verified your 0.02% number. But going from 1% to 0.02% shouldn&#x27;t be surprising based on the completely different voting behavior this year.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Postal_voting_in_the_United_States#Reliability_of_postal_ballots" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Postal_voting_in_the_United_St...</a>')
