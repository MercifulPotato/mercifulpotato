There is a bank of questions but they only really get blacklisted if a bunch of candidates show up and they’ve obviously memorized an answer to it. Or if it shows up in a high-profile place. Like, if your question is the first question in a new edition of “Cracking the Coding Interview” it will probably get dropped.<p>I think individual questions that got posted would be blacklisted ten years ago. But nowadays, there are so many people doing interviews and such a large bank of questions (public and otherwise) that the blacklist isn’t so big a deal. Because there are so many vetted questions to ask, you can pick one and not worry to hard candidates may have done drills using that specific question. And if they have, you can have a second question on standby.<p>As an interviewer, I’m happy to see questions posted. You get to see people share their experiences answering it and make the question better, rephrase things to be less ambiguous or misleading, maybe tweak some wording that trips up non-native speakers, or decide that people have a bad experience answering it and you should drop the question. As an interviewer, I also ask questions from the blacklist. I’m not gonna say something arrogant like “I can tell” if you knew the question ahead of time, but my job as interviewer is to get the best information about you that I can to the hiring committee, and balancing that with the goal of giving you a pleasant enough experience during the interview that you want to accept an offer. Trying to catch cheaters is not my top priority.<p>All of this being colored by the facts that the interview process itself is a bit traumatic and people running interviews often don’t run them well.')
