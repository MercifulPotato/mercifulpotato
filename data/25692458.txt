While Nazis were thrown into Soviet concertation camps, it didn&#x27;t stop there and did not turn out &#x27;kind of fine&#x27; for many innocent people who later shared a similar fate.<p>&gt;A study published by the German government in 1974 estimated the number of German civilian victims of crimes during expulsion of Germans after World War II between 1945 and 1948 to be over 600,000, with about 400,000 deaths in the areas east of Oder and Neisse (ca. 120,000 in acts of direct violence, mostly by Soviet troops but also by Poles, 60,000 in Polish and 40,000 in Soviet concentration camps or prisons mostly from hunger and disease, and 200,000 deaths among civilian deportees to forced labor of Germans in the Soviet Union), 130,000 in Czechoslovakia (thereof 100,000 in camps) and 80,000 in Yugoslavia (thereof 15,000 to 20,000 from violence outside of and in camps and 59,000 deaths from hunger and disease in camps).<p>&gt;Some German prisoners were released soon after the war. Many others, however, remained in the GULAG long after the surrender of Nazi Germany.
