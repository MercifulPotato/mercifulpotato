Action packed.<p>- The Lottery of Babylon<p>Mystical world where a \nlottery runs everything.<p>- Three Versions of Judas<p>This is a good example of Borges combining non-fictional and fictional elements, he is doing a critical analysis on a fictional author be made up regarding the “real” role of Judas.<p>- Deutsches Requiem<p>Part of his explorations on fascism and nazism, written contemporarily (1946) so it has a bit more rawness.<p>- On Exactitude in Science<p>The title well describes this short piece.<p>- In Memoriam, JFK<p>Also short and incredibly well-written.<p>- The Zahir<p>The Zahir creates obsession, to the point of driving the obsessed insane.')
