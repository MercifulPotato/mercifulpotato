I think this is the secret sauce. I&#x27;ve never seen this before but I plan on trying it out heavily in the future. You don&#x27;t even need to wait for a 304 content not modified, there&#x27;s simply no request at all. So cool!<p>edit: It seems like Expires is a bit older than cache-control, so not as relevant as I thought.  I&#x27;m not seeing the 365 day cache control header you listed, it&#x27;s anywhere from 5 minutes to 30 minutes.<p>It&#x27;s just weird to see a browser totally trust a cache and not even verify using &quot;etag&quot; or otherwise. I&#x27;ll probably have to do a lot of trial and error to get this to happen but I really like it, because it feels so fast.')
