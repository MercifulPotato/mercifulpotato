I am not sure there is a day going by where being strong in math and computer science isn&#x27;t immensely helpful for my job.<p>The problem is: All other companies immitate Google, not only through interviews, but also by copying their &quot;scalability&quot; which is completely crazy. For instance relational databases are perfectly fine for like 99% of companies. Single servers would probably work well for another 90% of companies. Monoliths instead of micro services would work well for 90% of companies... It&#x27;s crazy.')
