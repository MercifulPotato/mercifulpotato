I&#x27;ve taken to cooking beans from dry in a pressure cooker and usually in a &quot;meal&quot; that gets cooked with it at the same time. So I can&#x27;t discard the water. The toxins in uncooked beans are real, but does the heat of cooking destroy them? It looks like the answer is yes [1], which says that &quot;No  significant  lectin  changes were observed after  soaking the  beans&quot; but that the lectin levels are undetectable in cooked beans. (I.e. cooking, not soaking is the important part.) That does leave your question in somewhat of a limbo: maybe the water hasn&#x27;t absorbed any of the lectin and so is safe?<p>Interestingly, [1] says:<p>&gt; It  appears  that  cooking  beans to  the  point  where  they might  be  considered  edible is  more  than  sufficient  to destroy  virtually  all  of  the hemagglutinating  activity  of lectins.<p>But then the authors seem somewhat puzzled as to why anyone is reported symptoms of lectin poisoning - who&#x27;s eating beans that are inedible in texture and hardness? They hypothesize raw food junkie&#x27;s in salads.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;m more skeptical now that any conclusions can be drawn from this paper. They mention leaching as an important factor at one point, so maybe heat just makes leaching happen at an appreciable rate. And your uncooked water might still have lectin at levels they couldn&#x27;t observe (since we&#x27;re looking at it indirectly by only measuring the bean&#x27;s content) and still be toxic. You only need 5 raw kidney beans to have symptoms.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1111&#x2F;j.1365-2621.1983.tb14831.x" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1111&#x2F;j.1365-2621....</a>')
