(&quot;Precision Plymouths&quot;). He was a show quality bird and absolutely stunningly beautiful, but also the guy had done some &quot;training&quot; work with him. He was very timid with people, and not aggressive at all. And he had come from a farm where he was just one of a few roosters and just seemed pleased as punch to have a few ladies of his own without any competition :-)')
