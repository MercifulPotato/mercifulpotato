But from what I&#x27;ve seen the father of the current king was loved by most -if not all- Thais and I feel most Thais supported the laws in case of the previous king.<p>But I believe it&#x27;s very important that in Thai schools there are practices, even starting at kindergarten, to teach children to kneel or bow in front of the picture of the king daily. From what I understand children also sing the Thai national anthem at the start of the school day. Every day at 2 moments (09:00 and 17:00) many people stop what they&#x27;re doing and stand in attention for a second while the national anthem plays on TV, radio in cinemas, etc... So you might understand that reference for the king is a big part of the education system here.<p>Also, most Thais just don&#x27;t have the money to travel abroad. And likely also don&#x27;t see much of other countries on television. News channels on TV might spend 95% of the news on happenings inside the country (e.g. visits of royal family to villages, etc...). As such, many Thais might not be aware that some countries operate very different from the Thai system.')
