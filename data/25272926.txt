It has such a nice piece of computer folklore:<p><i>Jurvetson relates the story of Jobs signing: &quot;Back when I was a b-school student, I had Steve Jobs over for a fireside chat to the &#x27;High-Tech Club&#x27; that I ran at the time. When I asked my childhood hero if he would sign my Apple Extended keyboard, he looked a little surprised to see Woz’s signature already there, and then he exclaimed, &#x27;This keyboard represents everything about Apple that I hate. It’s a battleship. Why does it have all these keys? Do you use this F1 key? No.&#x27; And with his car keys he pried it right off. He did this for each of the keys. Alan Deutschman reported the moment in his book, The Second Coming of Steve Jobs, culminating in Jobs&#x27; comment: &#x27;I’m changing the world, one keyboard at a time.&#x27; He signed the keyboard. I found the function keys the next day on the fireplace mantle (he had left them quietly behind), and I put them back on the keyboard.&quot;</i><p>Not sure if this is still owned by Steve Jurvetson or not. If yes, I&#x27;m surprised he&#x27;d part ways with such a nice piece of history, particularly something he was personally involved and got both Steves to sign.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rrauction.com&#x2F;preview_itemdetail.cfm?IN=6003" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rrauction.com&#x2F;preview_itemdetail.cfm?IN=6003</a>')
