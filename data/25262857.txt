Rather it is a distinct design choice for a social network to avoid spam. Another key decision instagram made was preventing shares&#x2F;retweets, with the intended effect of promoting  original content. These two consequential decisions (both made very early on in Instagram history, likely even before the fb acquisition) made original photos the focus. It’s an opinionated app and has succeeded because of it — I don’t believe either decision should be called a dark pattern.')
