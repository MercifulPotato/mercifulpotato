Even though I find a important psychological point is missed in the concept.<p>On behalf of a psychological viewpoint, every human tells 2 narratives. One to belong to a group, seeking an image he wants to be seen as, and, an inner one, reflecting on behaviours with utmost honesty to one self in order to mature\\grow.<p>Sharing personal insights while knowing anyone could read your thoughts later on, twists your notes in a misleading direction, I find. This kept me from journaling 20 years in fear someone could neglect myself on behalf of my notes\\points\\feelings\\ideas written down.<p>In this high speed, working environment today, we rarely take time to reflect, and when we do, taking notes, shouldn&#x27;t be a privacy lost way to do that.\n---\nSome months ago I started with 2 friends regular and self-honest check&#x27;ins. Every one does daily journaling for him\\herself and only presents insights about themselves, not to proof anything to the group, nor getting something out, bit to have the courage to speak out to oneselfs with courage what new viewpoint has been gathered lately on one selfs behaviour.<p>Start that with that.\nPick beloved ones nearby, ask them if they are interested in having such an interview, encouraging oneself and others and you start maturing (I find myself). No online social network needed.')
