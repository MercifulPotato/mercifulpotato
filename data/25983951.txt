At that scale the limitation isn&#x27;t having to maintain some technology but rather decoupling interfaces so communication and bureaucracy doesn&#x27;t block engineers from getting work done. You can use Postgres but then getting access, schemas, resource management, coupling, and so on become the limiting factors on usage. Paying for 5 more engineers to maintain Kafka and unblocking 50 in the process is a net gain.')
