When I read books&#x2F;articles or listen to podcasts, I often want to write things down. I’ve tried everything from mind maps to a fashionable Cornell Note-Taking System. But all of it proved ineffective for better thinking.<p>Our brain is a beehive of associations, but we are taught to think linearly. Thus, our knowledge doesn’t accrete to help us discover original thinking.<p>Totallib lets you achieve better, more creative thinking through connected note-taking.<p>How is it different from the other apps?<p>— Undistracted writing. Modern apps try to do too much. In Totallib, you open a note and write — just like on paper. Simplicity is the new luxury.<p>— ⌘ Connected thoughts &amp; notes. Hierarchy kills creativity. Totallib lets link notes between each other, so you can build new ideas on top of them.<p>—  Writing augmented by AI. Writing is a phenomenal tool for thought. However, many people never start writing. Whenever you are stuck on a sentence for hours, an AI writing assistant helps you get through it. Just select the text passage you want to develop, click the button, and explore a novel train of thought. No more writer&#x27;s block or blank page syndrome.<p>The product is live and we launched on PH today https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;totallib<p>You can request access on our website - http:&#x2F;&#x2F;totallib.com&#x2F;<p>I’m excited to hear what you all think!')
