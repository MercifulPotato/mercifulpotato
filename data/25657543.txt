It can be hard to work through :)<p>I&#x27;d say my one topic is actually: &quot;teaching web developers&quot;.  I happen to talk a lot about React, but I also talk about JS in general, and Rails sometimes too.<p>That seems to be fine - your topic CAN be something very specific like &quot;React performance improvements&quot;, and you&#x27;ll do well, or it can be something like &quot;How to be a more effective web developer&quot;, and that will be ok too - just don&#x27;t switch between topics like web development, then cooking, then politics, then your dog, then a little more web development, etc.<p>Sharing some of your life (like your dog, hobbies, etc) is good and is part of you being a &quot;real person&quot;, as long as say, 90% of your content follows your major topic.')
