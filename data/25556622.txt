Then the panic point was 10%, then 30%, then 50%.<p>Now the FUD has switched to &quot;you&#x27;re not taking into account the cost of backup fossil fuels.&quot;  Well turns out that coal is being shut down everywhere, because it can&#x27;t even compete. We don&#x27;t need them. There&#x27;s a chance that we might need natural gas a few weeks a year in 2040.  The statement should be &quot;how are natural gas plants going to shift payment schemes so they can survive in this world,&quot; not &quot;you&#x27;re not taking into account the cost.&quot;<p>We have storage alternatives that will make natural gas obsolete at the next spike in fuel prices. Storage deploys quick. The fossil fuel guys had better get their lobbying straight if they want a piece of the pie in 15 years, or they will be engineered around.')
