Genesis doesn’t mention the creation of earth, stars get created after there’s land and water on earth, there’s light <i>with days and nights</i> before stars, the sun and moon are equally old, fruit-bearing plants are created before sea life, and water plants aren’t mentioned at all.<p>I think it’s about you can expect from randomly picking fragments, and throwing away variants that do not hold up to simple scrutiny such as “but what do these animals eat?” or “if there’s no water yet, where do these fish live?”.<p>About the only thing it gets truly right is the creation of water life before land life.')
