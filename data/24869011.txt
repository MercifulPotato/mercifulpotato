When they introduced the Kindle they retired the Adobe DRM servers, and since they did not alert me as to this happening (despite the ebook being registered to an email address), my copy turned into a pumpkin.<p>It took me a few back-and-forths with Amazon&#x27;s customer support to get them to even acknowledge that this had happened.  Most of the reps I communicated with weren&#x27;t even aware that Amazon had sold ebooks before the Kindle.  They wanted to just give me the Kindle version of the regular eBook, but grudgingly gave me a refund instead, because I insisted on either the full annotated version in any form or a refund (I already own two copies of the regular book in paper form).')
