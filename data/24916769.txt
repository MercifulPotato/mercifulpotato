When I worked as a consultant, I billed $x per year, is that how much value I generated? No. How much of that value did sales generate? How much did the secretary generate? How much did the cleaner generate? How much of my colleagues value did I generate by referring clients to them when I was at capacity? Or by helping them with their work when they needed it? Or vice versa?...<p>I think you’ve made a bigger over sight here though:<p>&gt; In a mainly remote programmer labor market, that we seem to be entering, all employers in the entire US are in your local labor market, so that should work out fine.<p>What you would expect from this is a new equilibrium prices that is a) lower than the current highest paid region, and b) higher than the current lowest paid region. Which is a situation that doesn’t benefit anybody currently working in the large metros.<p>A worse (but likely inevitable) outcome would be if wages started trending towards a price somewhere in between San Francisco and Manila.')
