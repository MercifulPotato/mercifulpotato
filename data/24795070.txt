Now, it&#x27;s easier than ever to second-guess your doctor and any other expert (and I know because I&#x27;ve done this, and even been right on occasion).<p>For example, every time someone worries about their health, they can sort through all possible diagnoses online, and convince themselves they have a certain sickness just because the symptoms match. A doctor will use Bayesian reasoning and conclude the problem is really a very common infection or something, but when the untrained mind is overwhelmed with information, Occam&#x27;s Razor doesn&#x27;t hold.<p>The same goes for everything else. Information is dangerous for those who don&#x27;t know how to reason about it carefully and properly, which is most of us, in most fields.')
