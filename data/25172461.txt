The Indians are presented as racists and judging people on superficial characteristics. That&#x27;s probably the author&#x27;s feelings being projected onto the subjects of his story. Yes, it makes it wrong if it&#x27;s more historical imagination.<p>I guess I&#x27;m coming from a foreigner&#x27;s perspective where I never read any of that writing from the pilgrim&#x27;s perspective. All I see about Indians presents them as noble savages.')
