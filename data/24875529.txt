The final results were essentially a tie with Trump winning the tie breaking coin toss.  So 50&#x2F;50 is right in hind sight.   Te systemic error could just have been as easily in Clinton&#x27;s favour as Trump&#x27;s, so the number should have been smaller than 50% for Trump.   Maybe not as small as 28%, but they weren&#x27;t far off, IMO.')
