I even pay them $5 each month, not because I make any money from the site or particularly like their content, but because their writing tools are really amazing - makes writing very enjoyable.<p>In addition, their SEO abilities are great, one of my articles on formatting Lisp code is now the highest ranked post on Google :)<p>(Link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.medium.com&#x2F;NbSWkq4hJcb )<p>However, Medium has some issues:<p>- No syntax highlighting on code (big issue for programming blogs)\n- No color options (would like an accent colour)\n- No Mathjax or Latex support (this is a bit too niche for most blogs)<p>Running my own website has a lot of pluses and I’m well versed in creating static websites for free (particularly like vanilla html &#x2F; css &#x2F; JavaScript on GitHub Pages), but I will never get the SEO rankings or audience that Medium can give me.<p>I honestly can’t find much alternatives. I basically want Medium with a syntax highlighter but I don’t see any blog platform that does this?<p>What do you guys recommend? Not just for my use case but in general for programming blogs.<p>Substack looks like an option, but it requires you to bring your own audience, which, if I had, I would just do it via my own website since I have the technical skills for it (but for other writers, substack can be great as it packages up a mailing list + hosting very well).')
