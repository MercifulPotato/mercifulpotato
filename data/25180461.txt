I&#x27;m sure there are a lot of different approaches that could work.<p>For my own projects, I like to keep client-side code separated from the server-side code. The static site (with compiled JavaScript) gets deployed to S3&#x2F;CloudFront, while the Sinatra API is packaged as a Docker image and deployed to ECS (or any container service)[1]. This means that Sinatra is <i>only</i> handling the API requests, and all of the markup, JavaScript, and other assets are served from a CDN.<p>[1] For this to work, you&#x27;ll likely need to set up CORS on the server side, but that&#x27;s well-supported now and fairly simple to set up.')
