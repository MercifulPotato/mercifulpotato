Then the same problems started plaguing that project in terms of major breaking changes so we hopped ship again.<p>Now, we are on top of Blazor using server-side rendering. Our hopes are that by taking up allegiance with Microsoft that we can ward off horrific breaking changes for a few years and actually build something valuable during that time. Blazor is particularly appealing to use because we were able to completely define our UI state machines in C# classes that can be tested in perfect isolation from any client&#x2F;browser interaction. We can also directly inject &amp; reuse our existing business services without needing to develop any JSON APIs or other wasteful boilerplate.')
