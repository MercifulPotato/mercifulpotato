That’s your argument?<p>I think you have zero interest in Free Software.  You want “Free Software except in the ways I don’t like”.<p>AGPL was about ensuring user freedom by requiring server hosted source code modifications to be contributed back to the community.<p>SSPL isn’t about that.  SSPL removes freedoms from using the software for no principled reason other than to allow a copyright holder to make more money by selling you a less restrictive proprietary license.  It isn’t copyleft, it isn’t free, it isn’t open.')
