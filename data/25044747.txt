Item(by='loopz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605007435, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25026794, text='Ditto.<p>* The first red flag was all the empty, but fully equipped desks. Several floors almost vacant.<p>* The second red flag was leadership being away 80% of the time &quot;on training&quot;, &quot;seminars&quot; and whatever else BS, instead of facilitating work.<p>* The third red flag was being tasked by a remote PM, to install extra equipment. I later learned it was because VMs were overbooked.<p>* The fourth red flag was my boss got fired, without hearing any reason.<p>On and on it went. Since this was tempwork, I just felt pain for those with steady work in such conditions and did what I could. Without support though, there was nothing I could do but leave in the end, with leadership wanting me to stay (I was probably the only one resembling some sanity in that place).<p>With experience and hard work, such places can be turned around. But not in times when top leadership and owners destroy a place. You&#x27;ll be seen as an idiot and insane, in a world where leadership has turned everyone against eachother behind their backs.')
