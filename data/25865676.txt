In fact, they couldn&#x27;t have been p-hacked because their novelty did not rely on any statistical analysis, or they were preregistered with the journal.<p>I did have a run-in with 1 publication that I suspected involved academic misconduct (fabrication of experimental results), but it was a thesis so it did not go through the peer review process.')
