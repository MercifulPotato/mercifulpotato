That’s all that’s happening with Parler.<p>As to why the left doesn’t feel the same need, they are not censored as much on the major platforms as the major platforms are left leaning.<p>The catalyst for the recent Parler traffic was the Hunter Biden emails in which the New York Times were locked out of their Twitter for over a week for publishing a story. A lot of people viewed that as outright censorship that crossed the line so they went looking for somewhere where they could talk about it. That kind of censorship just doesn’t happen to the left because the right generally is more libertarian regarding free speech and permissive of speech in general.')
