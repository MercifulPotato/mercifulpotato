Just like I&#x27;ve met highly effective developers, who were trying to get promoted. That&#x27;s orthogonal to making a good product.<p>They wanted to get promoted because they wanted to be able to be more effective; everything they had control of went very, very well (we were empowered to make decisions, he helped us navigate organizational obstacles, and was the sacrificial lamb for useless meetings). All the issues we ran into were from outside his circle of influence; product had its own reporting hierarchy and they were a mess. Integrations with the rest of the org were more bureaucratic and less capable, and getting them to do anything required getting VP level support on our side, etc. Had he had more sway, we could have executed faster. We directly benefited when he got a title bump.<p>I think what you mean are those who are putting individual success over team success, and yes, those managers are either evil or incompetent.')
