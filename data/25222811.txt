Dirty diesel has for a long while polluted city air, while car makers claimed they where &quot;clean&quot;. The only clean part about diesels where lower co2 emissions, diesels pollute a lot of small particles which are bad for humans to breathe. Modern hybrid cars has as low fuel consumption as diesels but pollutes a lot less particles in cities.')
