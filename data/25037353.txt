It&#x27;s been a little bit of a boondoggle, behind schedule and over budget, like most of these kind of projects tend to be I guess.  It&#x27;s been just within the last quarter that Fort Collins is finally getting the number of paying customers into the thousands which should help the financials some.  They pulled the fiber throughout my neighborhood a couple of months ago but then it seemed to stall.  Occasionally I see a work truck doing something at one of the boxes, but we haven&#x27;t heard anything as far as being able to get hooked up yet.  Our cost is $59.95&#x2F;month for gigabit up and down so there are many of us chomping at the bit.  For anyone interested in the rollout of a municipal broadband program, the quarterly financial reports Fort Collins has been releasing during their rollout are kind of interesting:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fcgov.com&#x2F;connexion&#x2F;quarterly-reports" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fcgov.com&#x2F;connexion&#x2F;quarterly-reports</a>')
