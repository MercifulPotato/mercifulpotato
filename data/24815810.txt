If Angela Merkel tomorrow tries to use those laws to attack her political opponents everyone will declare her mad, she won&#x27;t be relected, and probably sued. That&#x27;s why rules can exist in a state of law, because you can&#x27;t just do random crap with them<p>This  absurdist logic doesn&#x27;t just apply to speech. Why have laws against riots? Obviously every protest can be declared a riot. Why have a police at all, they can be tyrannical etc.. This is no argument')
