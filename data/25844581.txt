Even then, I would bet that it&#x27;s cheaper to discard the tailscale&#x2F;wireguard packets that you don&#x27;t trust &#x2F; aren&#x27;t authenticated than it is for minecraft.jar to either fail to authn a client with mojang&#x27;s servers or authenticate a client and then see that it&#x27;s not in the allow list.')
