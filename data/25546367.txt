Streamline all possibilities and probabilities, all needs, problem-solving, into a single vocabulary, library, &quot;framework&quot;. Make it a self-censoring effort, that opens up addressing the use-case of code: addressing problems in the real world, what can be called science, data-mining, AI, ...what frees the mind to the utmost, into what is possible. Do work that does not result in coder farms (thousands a la google), complexity and derivative overflow. Learn once, learn well, and be able to express your needs, in a language that does not change from tool to tool, from coder-critter to the next one. Cut the archane-ry, the brabbling, the proprietary obfuscation, the phishing for a &quot;job&quot; as an atom of some entity that redistributes the wealth to few and singular no-effort individuals, those who herd the energy of the workhorses and leave them empty hulls, spent consumers of their own making.')
