Sure, it would be, but then the purely speculative case you just made up doesn&#x27;t reflect reality, so who cares?<p>And even then, as I mentioned, there is still an entire universe of broadcasting and publishing outside of social media, and the internet itself. So even if all social media sites and Apple and Microsoft and Amazon suddenly decided they weren&#x27;t competitors and collaborated to ban the same content, that content still isn&#x27;t memory holed or erased from history.<p>&gt;And before you say it, &quot;muh private platform&quot; is not an acceptable argument. This is dangerous to our society.<p>Yeah... you should take your brilliant intellectual riposte to 4chan where it would be best appreciated.
