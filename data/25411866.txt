I currently do my own thing but I would love to work on projects that go far due to the amount of talent involved... but at the end of the day I&#x27;m just concerned with &quot;office politics&quot; I get the vibe that you have to &quot;pick sides&quot; which might just be an availability bias due to the news stories.  I guess just relatively speaking, when talking with Amazon I get a different feeling.  Recruiters probably aren&#x27;t the best way to judge a company though, so figured I&#x27;d ask.')
