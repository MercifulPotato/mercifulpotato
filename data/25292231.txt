(If they aren&#x27;t amnestied for past violence, that probably happens to the cartels anyway; if they are, they are faced with a choice of peace and trying to monopolize the market from an initially-advantaged position peacefully and waging war on the competition which inevitably becomes a return to war with the government, but now with the competition&#x27;s profits funding the government effort rather than the competition facing the same suppression and dividing government resources.)')
