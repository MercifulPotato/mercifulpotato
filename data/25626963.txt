Repository author wrote an Angular module based on competing framework, what seemed to be interesting for me.<p>Than he wrote in the description of the module more or less, no one uses Angular, that it is complicated and literally a joke.<p>With all these, and other claims being utterly false, it just does not make sense to me at all what is the purpose of this repository.<p>Is it an Angular ecosystem contribution, or is it an attempt to smear Angular as a way to advertise featured  competing frameworks?')
