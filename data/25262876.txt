Item(by='cjohnson318', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606803359, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25257467, text='This was a graduate level class and the teacher did not believe in partial credit. Someone had missed a sign and thought their B was unfair.<p>I agree, kids should be treated fairly and taught to treat others fairly. However, I think it is just as important to teach children resilience in the face of unavoidable adversity. It’s important to feel feelings, but to not let them poison you. Learning to get over a breakup, or an injury come to mind. I’d like to stress <i>unavoidable</i> adversity, in contrast to crimes like discrimination, battery, fraud, etc.<p>So, my harping on “life isn’t fair” is an indirect and misleading way of saying, “it’s important to be resilient”. I apologize for posting my comment without more context.')
