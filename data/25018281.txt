Item(by='kortilla', descendants=None, kids=[25021691, 25018351], score=None, time=1604778220, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25018012, text='&gt; Trump saying &quot;I WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!&quot; [1] is clearly equivalent to shouting &quot;FIRE&quot;.<p>No, it’s not equivalent at all because it doesn’t present any immediate danger. The reason yelling “fire” is a problem is not because it’s a lie, it’s because it requires immediate and possibly dangerous behavior (evacuate as quickly as possible).')
