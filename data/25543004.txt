Space faring civilizations probably don&#x27;t live on planets the same way we no longer live in caves and mud huts, they build modern houses and cities out in space near to their preferred energy sources and transportation networks. It&#x27;s a lot harder to hit something smaller and more mobile than a planet and even if you do it doesn&#x27;t have the same consequences that it would on the ground. i.e. more likely to just punch a big hole rather than convert all its energy to heat, no pressure wave, your neighbours are further away, etc.<p>2.
