If they&#x27;re on solid footing, agreed.  But if they&#x27;re 100 feet up on a highwire with no safety net, not so secure.<p>&gt; From what I can tell, Trump has not stopped the sabre rattling and foreign military interventions.<p>It&#x27;s a subjective call, but the only sabre rattling I&#x27;ve heard much from is Trump.  It&#x27;s when the media starts acting in unison (like when Trump suggested pulling troops from the middle east), that&#x27;s when my ears perk up.<p>&gt; How are things better by not even paying lip service?<p>I believe Trump in all he does demonstrates how illusory our political system is, and how closely it is joined at the hip with the media.  He&#x27;s managed to get plenty of serious people to say very silly things, intentional or not, and I think <i>a lot</i> of people are starting to catch on that there is a curtain on the stage, and that there are in fact things going on behind that curtain.  This is a <i>stark</i> contrast to Obama, who was an absolutely brilliant performer, like the David Blaine of politicians.<p>&gt; He may call them for what they are, but his own reality distortion field prevents him from gaining any high ground....<p>Here I completely agree.  Very often I cannot help wondering if he truly is as incompetent as people say, because sometimes it sure seems like it (covid, particularly opposing masks!!!??, the debates...all sorts of examples).  <i>At the very least</i>, he is highly inconsistent.  I imagine he is hyped up on amphetamines most of the time as well, which likely takes its toll some days, so perhaps that helps explain his truly incompetent days.<p>&gt; But IMO Trump looks like yet another conspiracy red herring rather than a productive path forward.<p>Sometimes for a new forest to grow, you have to burn the old one down.  Mother nature operates in mysterious ways.<p>But even if Trump can successfully derail the system, he is in no way a man with a vision for a new one that serves everyone&#x27;s interests - &quot;Make America Great Again&quot; minus the bad stuff would be a huge improvement over now, but it is still fundamentally flawed, and I don&#x27;t see a lot of people lined up with better stories.')
