Item(by='Arnavion', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611947573, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25960675, text='&gt;I wish they were smaller and single-lane.<p>Smaller and single-lane as in individual half-width belts that can be placed independently? I think it would be more of a pain to play with, because now only would you now have separate left- and right- belt items, but also have more complex rotations to be able to convert one belt into another at a corner. Eg to convert a right-belt going east into a left-belt going south, you need to rotate just the tip of the right-belt, not the whole right-belt.<p>---<p>&gt;I need resources to be on the other lane of a belt<p>A single splitter and a little space around it can swap a belt around if you need to. Or better yet, find the place where you&#x27;re mixing the two items on the same belt and make the change there.<p><pre><code>    A ╗\n      ╠══ A&#x2F;B\n    B ╝\n\n    A ══╗\n      ╔═╬═ B&#x2F;A\n      ╚═╣\n    B ══╝\n</code></pre>\n(The ╬ in the second diagram is a crossing of belt and underground belt.)<p>For single-item belts where everything&#x27;s on one side and you want everything to be on the other side, it&#x27;s even simpler.<p><pre><code>        ═╦╗\n    A&#x2F;- ═╝╚═ -&#x2F;A\n\n    -&#x2F;A ═╗╔═ A&#x2F;-\n        ═╩╝\n</code></pre>\nThe ╦ and ╩ are a vertical belt feeding into the side of a horizontal belt. Because the horizontal belt has another horizontal belt to its left, the point where the vertical belt touches it does not make a corner.')
