There are REX prefix bytes required everywhere to access all 16 registers. Modern instructions that are used all the time are hidden away behind prefix bytes.<p>64bit ARM is a complete redesign of the ARM instruction encoding, and they put a lot of thought into using the instruction space optimally. 32bit ARM also wasted a lot of it&#x27;s instruction encoding space, but 64bit ARM is a massive improvement. Despite requiring roughly 10% extra instructions on average, the average arm64 is around the same size as the average x86 binary.<p>Immediates aren&#x27;t a huge problem. All 32bit immediates and many 64bit immediates can be encoded in 1-2 instructions. Anything that can&#x27;t should probably just use a PC relative load.<p>IMO, the much simpler instruction decoding massively outweighs the need for slightly more load bandwidth.')
