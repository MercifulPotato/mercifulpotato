We are solving an incredibly complex problem and need the customer interface to be beautiful and usable. This involves building both a highly performant frontend application and a mesh of backend services which abstract the complex country specific elements and surface the required data to the frontend.<p>You would be joining a small team of Senior engineers, who work cross-functionally with Product and Design to build the OmniPlatform and support our customers&#x27; needs. We write our tests first, and know that delivering quickly requires excellent tooling and ongoing attention to the health of the codebase<p>Feature development, technical improvements and tooling are all first class citizens when we prioritize. Our engineers have an active voice in planning work, make smart trade-offs between short and long term value, and can demonstrate how the work they want to do will benefit our customers later.<p>Apply online at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apply.workable.com&#x2F;omnipresent-group&#x2F;j&#x2F;3278B968B8&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apply.workable.com&#x2F;omnipresent-group&#x2F;j&#x2F;3278B968B8&#x2F;</a>, or email me for more information at mattb at omnipresent dot com, and tell us you&#x27;re coming from Hacker News')
