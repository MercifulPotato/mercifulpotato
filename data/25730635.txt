This falsehood comes up pretty often because the extreme cases of &quot;late by half a decade&quot; have been parroted incessantly by antinuclear folks. When one actually looks at the numbers, on average the time to build a nuclear plant is 5 years and nowhere near the cost of the late colleagues.<p>Nuclear plants also operate *efficiently* for decades whereas solar panels only for a few years to a decade. That means replacement has to come more often for panels. They also require more land to generate the same amount of energy (I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s taken into account in the calculations).<p>And of course energy has to be retrieved from other sources when solar won&#x27;t operate which might be more expensive than solar.<p>While the price of solar is dropping of course, so is the price of nuclear as new reactors are being developed and prototyped: can&#x27;t remember the name right now but one was funded by Bill Gates and is built in arrays from multiple mass producible units. That allows building smaller, localized reactors at a lower price.')
