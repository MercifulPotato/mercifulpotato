I need the benefits (and to be able to pay for them, even in retirement, which gets complicated if you have cancer or a rare disease, both of which are common) more than I need the actual income. Itâ€™s sad but true.<p>I could also lose them in a split second if I became too ill to keep up the hectic long hours.<p>I am fortunate to be a dual US|EU citizen, but if I was not, I would try to become a citizen of (Republic of) Ireland, which is part of the EU, so you are also conferred EU citizenship in addition to being an Irish citizen. This gives you the right to live&#x2F;work&#x2F;retire in over 30 countries, including all of the EU and EEA countries. Additionally, if you have citizenship from the Republic of Ireland, you are allowed to live&#x2F;work&#x2F;retire in the UK, due to a longstanding common agreement. If you are of Irish descent and are a direct blood relative (even great-great-great grandparent) of someone born in Ireland, you can become an Irish citizen in 3 years of living there if you provide the birth records. Also, if you are under 30(?) Americans can get a 1 year working holiday visa. Tech workers can get a job easily through the Irish skills shortage list.')
