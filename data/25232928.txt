Moore&#x27;s Law has made SQLite pretty much the only database I ever use. It&#x27;s always been relatively fast, but with today&#x27;s CPUs and SSDs, it&#x27;s fast enough for anything I need.<p>A decade or so ago, I might have installed MySQL or Postgres to do some log processing or something. I never bother any more. SQLite is just the perfect data tool. You can load it up with gigs of data and it flies.<p>I still discover little tweaks and features I didn&#x27;t realize it had as well. It&#x27;s just a really well done project.')
