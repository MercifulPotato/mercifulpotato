Item(by='shimonabi', descendants=None, kids=[25759961, 25733195], score=None, time=1610385973, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25728453, text='I recently bought a 50€ electric chainsaw at an Aldi discount store in Europe (against my better judgement).<p>After a few uses, the chain tightening bolt broke into two pieces.<p>I begged them to send me just the bolt, but NO. They said I&#x27;m not entitled to repair it. I was even willing to pay for it, but I couldn&#x27;t find it below 15€ on the internet.<p>So I sent the whole chainsaw to the repair service on their dime and they sent me a brand new one. They probably tossed the perfectly fine old chainsaw into the dumpster. Because of a 0.10€ bolt.<p>The corporate throwaway culture is incredible.')
