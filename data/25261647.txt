Signal Protocol has:<p>* A &quot;double ratcheting&quot; forward secrecy system, where message round-trips establish new DH keys, and message transmissions establish new symmetric keys.<p>* An authenticated key exchange --- &quot;Triple Diffie Hellman&quot; --- that provides deniability without having to publish spent keys, and works without needing a signature algorithm.<p>* A cryptosystem locked exclusively into modern misuse-resistant curves and AEAD cryptography.<p>By contrast, OpenPGP:<p>* Provides no forward secrecy (applications built on OpenPGP have to invent their own forward secrecy designs, which in practice nobody does).<p>* Relies on long-term keys.<p>* Uses a hodgepodge of algorithms, including outmoded cryptography from the 1990s; moreover, the compatible subset of PGP implementations depends on its nightmarish &quot;MDC&quot; hack, which was an attempt to retrofit message authentication into the standard.<p>Some of PGP&#x27;s problems are due to the fact that Signal was designed at a time when we had far better understanding of cryptography, and, frankly, designed by better subject matter experts. But more of the problems are simply due to the fact that PGP isn&#x27;t purpose-built for messaging; it&#x27;s a general-purpose encryption tool, the &quot;Awk&quot; of cryptography, and one thing we&#x27;re rapidly forming a consensus on is that you don&#x27;t want Awk-like tools in cryptography engineering.')
