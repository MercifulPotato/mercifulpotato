That Frama or some other code can come up with loop invariants by itself from the code? Even if this is true and doable, it&#x27;s bad. The question always was: does the code satisfy the spec, not whether we can derive a spec from the code and prove the spec is valid. In the other case - no - it&#x27;s just what I wrote above.')
