At first, I was semi-skeptical too, but not anymore. I&#x27;ve managed to wrap a few C++ libraries (GLM, Filament, PhysX). Not without a manual intervention (claw is still evolving and adapting to C++ edge cases), but those libraries pretty much work now. I&#x27;m not sure I would be able to cover all C++ idiosyncrasies, but huge parts are already in.<p>That said, claw&#x27;s C++ support is still in the works and I don&#x27;t recommend diving into that mess yet. Stay tuned for Q1 2021 semi-usable alpha release. Or not. C++ is such a pile of shinies, I&#x27;m pretty sure I lost a few screws during :claw development.')
