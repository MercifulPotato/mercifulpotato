It&#x27;s the kind of comment that should be in the grey.  Comments that amount to pile-ons and smug dismissals—like the one above—are far more welcome here than they used to be.<p>&gt; Spolsky&#x27;s CityDesk. It was a Windows GUI that would FTP HTML and images to a static server!<p>Among the things that Microsoft first started pushing to GitHub around the time that they formed the .NET Foundation was Live Writer. &lt;<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;openlivewriter.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;openlivewriter.com</a>&gt;  Dave Winer&#x27;s Frontier is open source, too, but has also rotted.  Brent Simmons, the creator of NetNewsWire, set out within the last couple of years to recreate it as a modern Mac app, but dropped the project last summer.<p>&gt;  Although his blog also rotted due to CityDesk rotting! It&#x27;s a hard problem.<p>I&#x27;m convinced that we&#x27;ve missed the obvious and have been doing it all wrong, due to predilection for certain systems and ways of working.  If you have a personal homepage, you should have among the stuff hosted there a document that describes how your site is updated.  This document should be less of a blog post than an SOP.  But now make sure it&#x27;s specified with enough rigor that you can feed the same document into a machine that can perform those steps automatically.  The reason the &quot;WordPress setup from 2004&quot; works and &quot;old-ass blogger.com site&quot; work is because they&#x27;re closer to this ideal than Jekyll or Hugo or the others are.  The caveat is that the hosted services make it really hard to actually look over the procedures that the machine will run, and if they let you, then you&#x27;d find that they were spread out over multiple &quot;documents&quot;.<p>Whatever the case, the thing <i>not</i> to do is to have this sort of thing live out-of-band elsewhere as a tool that requires its own configuration and setup (with both the tool and the configuration being subject to rot) accompanied (if at all) by a terse README.  (Otherwise, if you&#x27;re keeping that sort of thing elsewhere, then your homepage is not really a true digital home, is it?  It&#x27;s a Potemkin palace, and the place where those other things live is your real home.)')
