The episode right before the interview discusses Greek manuscripts during the Byzantine Empire and how they were copied and such, and various other historical aspects of manuscript design. Two of the more interesting episodes in a podcast filled with interesting things. Episodes 317 (manuscripts) and 318 (interview with Primavesi).')
