My personal opinion is that it&#x27;s best in class. The thing Git has going for it (over BitKeeper or really anything else) is GitHub.<p>If we had something like BitHub that were widely used instead, I don&#x27;t think I would bother with Git for anything except contributions to projects using it, despite being a fairly advanced Git user through necessity.')
