It is only ~4 times slower than Rust and only a bit slower than Go or Java (compiled GC languages) in the benchmarks. Compare that with Python 3, also interpreted but  ~30 times slower than Rust.<p>I know that Python 3 can do some runtime stuff that Nodejs can&#x27;t, but I wonder whether that&#x27;s worth so much performance. Maybe if the answer is that you would include C modules in Python if you need the speed, but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a good answer to the problem.')
