Trying it will make the plan blow up. So you have to split it into one commit, plan&#x2F;apply it, and then do another. If you tear down the entire system with a Terraform destroy, and try it from the ground up - it will fail. This makes testing with something like Terratest nearly impossible, as it will require multiple plan&#x2F;applies in a row to get the environment up - and it&#x27;s hard to determine what failures are retryable and aren&#x27;t.<p>This sounds far from optimal to me.')
