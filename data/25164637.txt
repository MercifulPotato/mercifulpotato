(I may be wrong about this! It a supposition based on my experiences and what I&#x27;ve heard from others.)<p>&gt; as a child who broke every firewall used to control my browsing habits, who engaged routinely with people 10+ years older, I have experienced more creeps in real life than online and most small communities I&#x27;ve been a part of would shut that stuff down immediately.<p>Same situation and I was groomed repeatedly (luckily mostly, though not entirely, ineptly). Perhaps not a coincidence that I&#x27;m a girl...<p>&gt; I knew to report, block and move on.<p>Or that girls are often sexually precocious and may _want_ pseudo-romantic attention from older men, while being too naive to see the risks to them. That was certainly my case.<p>Overall I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as simple or easy as you&#x27;re making it out to be.')
