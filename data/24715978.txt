Economies with weaker currencies by no means have upper hand on every trade. Like the example I gave before: corn exports. Economies could be subsidized by regular interventions like how China blocks international companies competition in its local market, devaluating currency to make their products cheaper on global marketplaces. Such a market is far from &quot;free market&quot;. Right now for those reasons they are embroiled in a trade war!<p>&gt; First, you are absolutely taking the side of ..<p>I can&#x27;t help you see fine distinction.<p>&gt; Second, of course the companies say they need it<p>Can you please point me to one source where that says majority STEM students are Americans? Let&#x27;s just get the percentages and see whether they are high enough for unemployment to so high that needs immediate short-term intervention.<p>I have not come across one respectable peer-reviewed publication that actually argues that position. Are you really saying the companies are discriminating job applications by country against favoring Americans?<p>&gt; Third, let incentives do the work.<p>No they don&#x27;t! LOL.<p>&gt; Fourth, very very few H1B are contributing to &quot;state of the art&quot; anything,<p>I don&#x27;t know what you consider state of the art. But take any STEM peer-reviewed research conference or journal and scan through the number of Americans publishing as first author in comparison to others. I know the numbers but since you are not convinced, I suggest you do the homework.<p>--<p>The current administration is like -- We didn&#x27;t solve the problem, but let&#x27;s just move pieces here and there in a broken system to make our voters feel good. We need votes in 3 months.. probably the right time to register illusions in their minds.<p>--<p>I don&#x27;t think you fully appreciate the complexity of entanglements in international relations. How they effect science and technology markets.')
