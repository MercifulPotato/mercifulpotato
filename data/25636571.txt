Wikileaks made a request to the US government that it had to know the US government would refuse (for the reason I gave in my other post in response to you upthread). It did that so it could disingenuously claim that it gave the US government a chance to protect people&#x27;s names and the US government refused, making it seem like it&#x27;s the US government&#x27;s fault, not Wikileaks&#x27;s fault, that the names got published. That&#x27;s not &quot;responsible journalism&quot;; it&#x27;s Wikileaks playing power politics just like governments and the media do.<p><i>&gt; published vital information to inform the public that the government is committing war crimes of foreign soil in their name</i><p>Wikileaks could have published that information without publishing anyone&#x27;s name. They chose not to do it that way.')
