There is some accountant math that goes into those types of decisions. If that car made it all the way to the buy off ride and into manufacturing with those components and it was found later that they failed faster than expected or didn&#x27;t always work quite right. They are not going to hold those cars back unless it causes a catastrophic and probably fatal, to the occupants, failure.<p>Otherwise they will hope it will fail outside of warranty and charge your for it.')
