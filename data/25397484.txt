But the window has always been a weak metaphor. Windows are nothing like the thing outside the computer. Nobody understands them to be metaphors to physical windows. They are much closer to the computational object they represent (an area of i&#x2F;o) than they are to a real window. Files on the other hand, are like their physical non computer counterparts. They are in fact much closer to real files than they are to a filesystem that&#x27;s divided up into sectors or whatnot and distributed in the disk.<p>Does that mean from this definition, cli&#x27;s are the metaphors and window systems are the abstraction?')
