Peer tube instances had serious upload limits, and it’s been a while since I looked but there were some major missing features like descriptions or editing or something. I actually really like pornhub’s monetization options but there is no audience there for the videos I make. Lbry struck a balance between features and not a porn site.<p>I make computer security videos so there is a non negligible chance my YouTube will get deleted.')
