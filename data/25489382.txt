It covers natural capital and social capital too.</i><p>&gt; <i>To refine my initial point: there will be many horrific costs to this mess. Some poor sod will end up paying the cost. If owners think they can escape full liability, they will continue to take risks because they can privatize the profit and socialize the costs.</i><p>Thank you for elaborating, I entirely concur with the sentiment of the above, even if we differ on terminology.<p>To refine my original my point too, please consider it a comment on the unfortunate connotations of using the term &#x27;balance sheet&#x27; for this concept - without further information, it&#x27;s unclear if it&#x27;s being used in a purely business financial context or not.')
