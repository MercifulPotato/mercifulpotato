A mildly overweight doctor, sure. But obese?<p>I think it would depend on the specialty.  I wouldn&#x27;t really care if my radiologist is obese.  He can read and interpret my scans just fine.  Same for pathology, endo and renal docs.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d want an obese ER doc as CPR is pretty tiring, same with my anesthesiologist- don&#x27;t want them sweaty and out of breath while trying to put in an airway.')
