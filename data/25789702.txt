It is a simple starter kit that includes:<p><pre><code>  • Subscriptions &amp; Payments via Stripe\n  • Invoices\n  • Multiple payment methods\n  • TailwindCSS &amp; FontAwesome integration\n  • Dashboard layout\n  • Settings page\n  • Test coverage\n  • Docker &amp; Docker Compose setup\n  • Kubernetes &amp; Helm\n  • GitLab CI&#x2F;CD\n</code></pre>\nThanks to these, one can go from unzipping the source to automated live deployments in less than 15 mins, including fully functioning payments. I aim to improve it further with more functionality out of the box, as well as additional API endpoints.<p>Hit me up with questions and feedback!')
