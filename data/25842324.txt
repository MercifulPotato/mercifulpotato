Other Libertarians believe that free market approaches are simply morally superior, since any non-free-market approach seems to necessitate the use of force&#x2F;violence to prevent people from simply trading freely as they would in the absence of said force&#x2F;violence.<p>And, of course, some Libertarians hold both beliefs - that free markets are the moral approach AND that the create better outcomes more often than not. But other than maybe a few n00bs who just discovered Libertarianism from a pamphlet or something, almost nobody is going around claiming that free markets fix everything.')
