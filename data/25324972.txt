This was funding provided by central government to make sure that council housing was energy efficient, resistant to both criminal and antisocial damage.<p>Also fixing roofs. You&#x27;d be surprised how many time roofs fail on council houses.<p>&gt;  The national government voted against banning this cladding<p>This isn&#x27;t really true. They voted against a specific amendment that demanded that rented accommodation be fit for purpose. (Local councils have had the power to condemn accommodation, but they then have to re-house the tenants. its really complex.)<p>The scandal here is in three parts:<p>1) The people that inspect building regulations are paid for by the developers, and not by councils. So there is lots of &quot;optionality&quot; in an otherwise good set of rules<p>2) The fire ratings of materials appears to not be independently vetted. I&#x27;m not sure how they are vetted, but this is a massive failure in the entire system.<p>3) The firebrigade having shit kit, also failed to learn from larkenhall.<p>&gt; ignored serious safety complaints from the residents<p>Local residents <i>always</i> complain about everything. I know because I used to be the vice chair of the Tenants and residents association. 25% of the time they are correct.<p>Grenfell has some interesting features:<p>1) it wasn&#x27;t being managed by the local council. It was owned and run by a &quot;TMO&quot; this is quite common.<p>2) they appear to have added new flats, which subsidised the works, again quite common.<p>3) leaseholders were not billed for the repairs. This is very unusual. Normally they&#x27;d be liable for a pro-rated proportion of the total bill (ie if the building has 100 flats of the same size and 10million pounds spent, they would be liable for 100k) I was stung for 50 grand, others in my estate had bills of 70k+<p>This is not the first time that a block of flats has killed people because of shoddy work. What is unusual in this case is that according to the paper work, the work was done to the correct standard.<p>I felt this tragedy closely. As a fellow council resident, I know how easily it could have happened to me. Fortunately for us, we chose our house specifically with fire in mind (larkenhall fire having happened months before) I was lucky because I had a choice. If I had been a tenant, I&#x27;d have little choice.')
