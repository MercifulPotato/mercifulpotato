That is, if you&#x27;re older, your perceived network value is a bit higher; I&#x27;m guessing the age is vaguely associated with seniority and future opportunity for the other person.)<p>However, I have the advantage that I did figure out people and developing and maintaining social links (if I want to and feel up to it), a number of years ago.  I&#x27;ve led community groups occasionally too, which is not always pleasant but very educational.<p>I still remember not knowing how to, having no active friends at times, and being very lonely and isolated.  So I empathise (a lot) with those who are stuck and unhappy with that.<p>For those people you&#x27;re talking about who have tried for years and years, if they&#x27;re really stuck, I wonder if there is some kind of coaching or training that would make a useful difference, assuming they want to change the situation.  If there isn&#x27;t, there ought to be.')
