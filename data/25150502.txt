Your internet connection might not be quite up to snuff for server hosting either, although you can test that with ping and checking the time to first byte.<p>Also, Reddit isn&#x27;t exactly fastâ€”it takes six seconds to load for me. Wikipedia and HN are better examples.<p>If you want the very lowest bound possible on latency for your internet connection, try loading <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloudflare.com&#x2F;cdn-cgi&#x2F;trace" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloudflare.com&#x2F;cdn-cgi&#x2F;trace</a>. That should load in milliseconds. From there, you can do a little more profiling work on your site.')
