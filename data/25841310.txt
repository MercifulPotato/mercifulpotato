Man you are really sold on ignoring any of the violence that happened that day, aren&#x27;t you?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;d2hxwnssq7ss7g.cloudfront.net&#x2F;x2GqSN2kAGY3_cvt.mp4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;d2hxwnssq7ss7g.cloudfront.net&#x2F;x2GqSN2kAGY3_cvt.mp4</a><p>There are a great many more videos of violence happening that day, but really you only need one video of insurrections, <i>in the capitol building after they broke in</i>, fighting as a mob against an out-numbered group of frantic police officers, to conclude the event was violent. You can&#x27;t have a group of people nearby or inside the capitol building literally beat a police officer to death and &quot;undo&quot; said violence by having a lot of people outside the building standing around outside innocently shouting, &quot;Hang Mike Pence!&quot;<p>Also, although it seemed like everybody posted every video they took that day, that probably isn&#x27;t true. It&#x27;s reasonable to believe that these people had some inhibition from posting videos in which their side obviously looked bad, which would bias the corpus of videos to be that much more &quot;friendly&quot; to the insurrectionists.')
