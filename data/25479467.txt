FB will have iOS 14 specific ad accounts due to how different everything is, and I’d expect CPA, VO, and LAL + retargeting to be neutered<p>They aren’t losing their audience for impressions, or their targeting data for FB users - unless shadow accounts won’t work as well, but I’m not sure how that data is gathered.<p>The removal of IDFA and shimming SKAdNetwork between the app and ad networks means the ping back of rich app usage is useless, which is what breaks more advance campaign types.<p>Traffic, app install, engagement etc will still be valid, and you should still be able to use existing FB audience details since that’s backed by FB usage data.<p>So I’d guess the impact depends on your ad type usage, and how you target users. Targeting parents in specific geos should work fine on IG and FB. FAN is going to suffer though since it doesn’t have FB account backing and relies on IDFA')
