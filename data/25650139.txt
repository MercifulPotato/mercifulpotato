PaperbackAuthor is coming along.<p>&gt; [...] I imagine you have specific templates for the specific type of writing one would use.<p>Right now I&#x27;m shooting for the absolute minimum viable product, so on day one it will be a super simple editor that can export to ePub and PDF.<p>But I&#x27;ve got lots of idea of features I want to roll out, including support for different types of writing. My theory is that what makes most editing software problematic is they try to create one approach to writing many types of things, so they fail to be particularly good at any one of them. With PaperbackAuthor, I&#x27;m building the editor I&#x27;ve always wanted for the purpose of writing novels and novellas.<p>Later, I might roll out support for, say, screenplays. Or graphic novels. Or text books. Or illustrated books. Etc. Each format deserves its own dedicated editor.<p>&gt; What would be cool would be able to denote where the archs and acts are as you&#x27;re writing to be able to go back to after long pauses.<p>I&#x27;ve got some ideas around this, too. But, I need to make sure they&#x27;re genuinely useful. Some of my ideas, in hindsight, amount to little more than &quot;Trello-like cards in a sidebar&quot;, which isn&#x27;t much of an improvement over simply keeping Trello in a separate tab or window.')
