Whereas selfishness is the natural human condition and people who conform to your expectations regarding masks are also behaving selfishly according to their different selfish desires (not catching the virus, appearing to be socially responsible, appearing to conform to expectations of people they respect).<p>&gt; If these people were actually interested in doing the right thing or the best thing, they might take some steps to figure out what that is instead of swallowing whatever lines the few in power have made up about mask wearing<p>Plenty of people research this topic and still disagree about which object-level conclusions are supported by evidence. Its been less than a year since the official guidance of the US CDC recommended against mask wearing. Your willingness to dismiss evidence that contradicts your perspective is exactly the same cognitive behavior they are engaging in.<p>&gt; But they are too interested instead in winning whatever the fucking game we&#x27;re playing is now.<p>Do you think that people who push epidemiologically ineffectual yet economically damaging lockdowns are also more concerned with winning than with public health?<p>How do you respond to criticisms that the people who publicly support lockdowns are themselves still employed or collecting paychecks during the lockdowns and so they are willing to advocate for measures that benefit themselves to the detriment of others?')
