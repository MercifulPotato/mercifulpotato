They have been <i>requested</i> to take it down, but this request arguably has no force under the DMCA because the RIAA is not the copyright holder of the material requested to be take down.  Even if youtube-dl could be considered &quot;circumvention technology&quot; the DMCA safe harbour provision does not apply to that.<p>It may not be surprising or even &quot;evil&quot;, but at best it is excessively cautious for a company who profess to serve the open source community and want&#x2F;need the goodwill thereof.  Clearly this is the corporate owner (Microsoft) behind Github showing its hand.<p>Time to move to other platforms.')
