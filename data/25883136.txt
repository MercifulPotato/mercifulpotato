Very, very, few people understood what a ratchet was, let alone read the code. We trusted founders Jan and Brian of WhatsApp  I think because they wrote t-filez. Security is in many ways cultural and aesthetic as it is technical. SILC was a thing  for people legitimately being spied on by their governments in the pre-occupy anti-globalization movement - and then suddenly it wasn&#x27;t.<p>I want a product like this to succeed, so why snark about these perfectly nice seeming people&#x27;s new tool? Because security has serious consequences. We don&#x27;t need to tell anyone what we need privacy for, but I think we&#x27;re still lacking a clear &quot;for what,&quot; to evaluate privacy technologies against.<p>The threat we need to build privacy tools against is essentially suburban-bourgeois and mob governance. When you look at old &quot;alternative&quot; culture, or why people still go to things like burning man today, it&#x27;s to engage in what are essentially aesthetic communities of desire and to be free of political oversight and surveillance. The criteria I would propose for a secure messenger is that it can create a private perimeter to facilitate the freedom of something like burning man for a community of users. If it isn&#x27;t designed to create that kind of growth, it&#x27;s a reaction with a limited horizon and just bargaining with the inevitable.<p>Personally I think a privacy product that is for everyone is necessarily for no one. Maybe this is the one that gets used by the next burner-level community to emerge, but the conversation about what-for will be the thing that drives the adoption of it.')
