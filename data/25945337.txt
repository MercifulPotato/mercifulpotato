Quoting from a typical motion to deny a temporary injunction:<p>&gt; As courts have repeatedly emphasized, an injunction represents an “extraordinary remedy” that is never awarded as a matter of right. See Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008). For a preliminary injunction to issue, the moving party has the burden of demonstrating all four of the following elements: (1) that it is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) that it is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) that the balance of equities tips in its favor; and (4) that an injunction serves the public interest. Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.<p>How is there any irreparable harm here? The worst that a customer would face is that they lose money--which is the <i>most</i> reparable harm.')
