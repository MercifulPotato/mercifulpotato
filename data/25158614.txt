You can use it as your editor. But you can also launch X11 programs and manage them as you do with text buffers. Kill a program, kill a buffer. Same thing.<p>But you can, of course, launch a graphical Emacs within EXWM. There you get a second Emacs thread.<p>One can also put X11 buffers in char-mode to pass through keybinds directly to that window. That way you don&#x27;t have to do weird sequences to pass through emacs keybinds to another Emacs.')
