The software tool chains are somewhere between 20 and 30 years behind the state of the art for software development.<p>Also, FPGAs can&#x27;t be reasonably context-switched. Flashing them takes a significant amount of time, so forget about time-multiplexing access to the FPGA among different applications.')
