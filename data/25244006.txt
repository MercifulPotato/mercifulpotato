According to the interview with him on the &quot;Rundschau&quot; (unfortunately in Swiss German), he hasn&#x27;t known about anything and was certain himself that Omnisec didn&#x27;t have anything to do with the NSA. However, I still struggle to see what exactly his involvement was with them - he was a &quot;Berater&quot; (consultant), but says that he didn&#x27;t really have any insight into the algorithms etc. and couldn&#x27;t have possibly known about their issues; so what exactly did he do for them, just sell his name?<p>I really appreciated him as a prof (even though he was known to be a complete hard ass when it came to exams with high bars to pass) and would be surprised if anything turned up that would question his integrity further; still, it does leave a bit of a bad taste after all his preaching...<p>And as a Swiss, this is a complete fiasco. That the issue with Crypto AG didn&#x27;t send a few heads in the NDB rolling was an absolute disgrace, they didn&#x27;t even pretend to be humbled by this or anything of that sort. And now another such story emerges, and while I do hope that we finally see some action now, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if nothing happened again.')
