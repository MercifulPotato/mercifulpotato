Item(by='banana_giraffe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610311256, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25717310, text='One thing I&#x27;d add to this:  Get used to the idea that removing one item from the list is acceptable.  For me, the only way I could trick my brain into that is set the the start date for all but one task that doesn&#x27;t need to be done today for tomorrow at the start of the day.  Thus when I finished the items for today, the task list is empty and I feel &quot;done&quot;.  I can still look at future tasks if I&#x27;m feeling productive, but knowing I finished my to-do list for today is refreshing.<p>I know it&#x27;s an illusion, but it works surprisingly well for me.')
