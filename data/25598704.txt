The dark ages have their name for a reason. We simply did not have a societal model that rewarded improving ourselves. We were simply stuck in the status quo. The Renaissance was purely about changing this mode of thinking on a societal level and capitalism is the most effective way of rewarding growth. Communism tends to fall behind because the system is built around people willing to accept their current life as is. If we for some reason end up in a situation where we have done everything that is possible capitalism will cease to provide growth beyond inflation.')
