Even now on 18.04 the package version of thunderbird is version 68.<p>To a certain degree the same nonsense happens with Firefox. The version of Firefox provided by apt lags behind for security releases.<p>In contrast, the snap version is now released almost the same day for ubuntu 16.04, 18.04, 20.04 and 20.10.<p>I&#x27;m glad to be using snaps and Ubuntu. Finally I can now get an easy installation for getting the latest version of intellij, vscode, firefox, thunderbird with no additional repos or faffle.')
