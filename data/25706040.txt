There are a lot of people who are invested in being right for various reasons rather than trying to find the truth, and many of these websites are biased.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I am a physician who prescribed HCQ to patients in March (with appropriate informed consent from pts&#x2F;families) when he had no other idea of treatment options based on the original study which purported to show decreased viral load.  It became obvious that it didn&#x27;t matter whether patients got it or not in my experience (some got better and some died whether or not they got it), numerous studies then confirmed this.  Most if not all hospitals were trying it with the first wave back in Jan-March and then we stopped using it when data came out that it didn&#x27;t change anything. Then, things got crazy because it became promoted by certain politicians (this happened when any physician with experience had already realized it was a placebo) AND then there was a big scandal where a paper was published showing increased mortality that based on falsified data and later retracted.')
