They are a long existing standard and very practical for that environment. However, most AP classes do allow the use of the TI-Nspire which is a much more capable platform than the TI-8x series. And even in that series, the TI-84 and variants are much more popular now.<p>At the college level, at least for engineering programs, at my school there was a pretty big emphasis on doing a lot by hand besides trivial stuff like addition and multiplication. The extent that we would utilize calculators seemed very minimal. Most of the degree programs including teaching students one or more of Mathematica, matlab, octave, and R. But I would say it sounds like the depth you had for the TI-83 doesn&#x27;t really exist in the modern education, rather it is a more broad use of multiple platforms.')
