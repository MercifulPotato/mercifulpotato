Limes are <i>lim√≥nes</i> and lemons are <i>limas</i>.  So <i>sopa de lima</i> is chicken soup with lemons, not limes.  However, this is how they map those terms to the varieties present in America.  The actual <i>lima</i> is a citron x lemon variety that is not widely cultivated, and is maybe best substituted by Key limes.  Which explains why the Mexican stores around me seem to always carry Key limes in addition to the Persian limes!')
