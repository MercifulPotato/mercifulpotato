What you&#x27;ve provided was evidence of protests - some violent, some not - in the name of various causes.<p>What you&#x27;ve now basically claimed, is that none of these protests have any legitimacy - violent or not.  What you&#x27;ve explicitly claimed is the notion that police don&#x27;t disproportionately act violently towards minorities.  Why do you say BLM is built on disinformation?<p>Edit: there is just footage of the Paris protests thrown in there for good measure?  Do you even know why people are protesting in Paris right now?  Come on, man, I&#x27;m willing to look over your sources but don&#x27;t just throw someone&#x27;s twitter profile at me, shrug and go: &quot;If you don&#x27;t believe this then clearly nothing will convince you.&quot;')
