(Rather which job)<p>If you are doing research into designing advanced transistors with new geometry or new materials (which is what I did my graduate research in), you would be using something like DFT (Density functional theory) for equilibrium analysis and NEGF, Huckel theory etc. for simulating current. These methods only realistically work on ~500-1000 atom systems, beyond which the simulation takes too long to run even on supercomputers (which is what i was using). I think GPUs here would be very useful, but there weren&#x27;t any tools at the time that were seriously optimized for GPU. The codes I was using were SIESTA&#x2F;TransSIESTA, Atomistix, QuantumEspresso and others.<p>For simulating multiple transistors, or transistors with a large geometry (for example 14nm gate length), you would use TCAD simulators that use FEM + measured parameters to simulate the transistors. The equations behind these are traditional semiconductor equations with a bunch of heuristics and curve fitting. The main tool I used was Sentaurus TCAD.<p>For simulating larger circuits, say a low-noise amplifier or maybe a small DAC, you would use tools like Cadence Virtuoso + the provided PDK from your foundry. The equations here are simpler than the ones used in Sentaurus and they are also calibrated to measurement.')
