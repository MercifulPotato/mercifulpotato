Somehow, after years of gatekeeping of all kinds in media, deleting some 140 character headline level information is a crisis.<p>My guess is that there is a kind of entitlement at work here. The rise of social media was predated by lots of techno-optimism regarding what the internet would do for humanity. And the rise of social media itself was wreathed in a kind of &quot;victory for democracy&quot; zeitgeist that these companies often played into themselves.<p>But in reality, Twitter is a big corporate media business just like any other. And what&#x27;s happening here is people are realizing the hard way that business is largely unaccountable.<p>Personally, I am not opposed to restructuring the relationship of the individual to big corporate businesses. But at the same time we have to be honest about the fact that this isn&#x27;t really something all that special. And if we want do this kind of restructuring to social media, we should consider those changes within an entire landscape of companies that reap all kinds of benefit from society and externalize all kinds of costs onto it.')
