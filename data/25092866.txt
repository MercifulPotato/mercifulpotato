But the issue with the GSF is that you can&#x27;t just use it when needed, it&#x27;s either nothing or everything. Additionally, modifying the firmware to install microG can lead to Safety Net failing, which may also lead to some other apps failing. I use Android without GSF &amp; microG and it&#x27;s fine for my needs, but that really depends on what types of apps you use.')
