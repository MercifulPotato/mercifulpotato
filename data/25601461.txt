Koopa, or クッパ (kuppa), is named for the Japanese pronunciation of a Korean soup , 국밥 (gukbap).<p>In the West, Koopas were retroactively changed to be the name of the turtle species  with Bowser as their king.<p>They didn’t make all the enemy names sound like Goombah, just one, Goomba. Koopas having a similar sounding name is coincidence.<p>The actual name of the Goomba species, however, is likely to be, as you say, a reference to Italians. In Japan, they are called クリボー (kuribo) in reference to their chestnut (栗, kuri) appearance — this is supported by the even more chestnut-like appearance of the subspecies Galoombas (クリボン, kuribon) from Super Mario World.')
