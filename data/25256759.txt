Candidates in America, even those considered to the left of their party (e.g. Sanders) aren&#x27;t really radical socialists.<p>Sanders wasn&#x27;t getting on the stage demanding we nationalize all our businesses. I never heard him mention a &#x27;vanguard party&#x27;. I don&#x27;t think I heard him say, &quot;Businesses need to be run by worker councils, exclusively&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s one thing to say, &quot;I don&#x27;t like the idea of democratic socialism&#x2F;social democracies&quot;, but those ideas are hardly &#x27;radical socialism&#x27; or &#x27;full socialism&#x27;.')
