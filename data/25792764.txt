No you can&#x27;t publish it elsewhere.<p>You are just embarrassing yourself here.<p>&gt; “Make of the story Greenwald wrote what you will. There&#x27;s been plenty of opportunity to falsify it and discredit it.“<p>It has already been widely discredited by every major news room, including the Republican-leaning Wall Street Journal.<p>At this point, there is utterly no sense in which a person can believe the unsubstantiated allegations against Hunter Biden or the completely ridiculous found laptop story, other than literally supporting a fascist presidential regime.<p>What you’re suggesting is a deeply radical and extreme point of view that has been overwhelmingly dismissed by every credible news source. You’re taking a stance on both the Greenwald story and the Hunter Biden story that is wildly and ridiculously decoupled from reality, in a seriously extreme manner that deserves to be called out as totally debunked and inappropriate.')
