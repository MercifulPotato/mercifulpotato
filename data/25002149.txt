Off topic but it&#x27;s very similar to a package I implemented in Django like 6 years ago or so (and happened to name it the exact same thing, too) --- sadly was for work in a proprietary setting, although I&#x27;m off-and-on working on remaking it now for a different project where I can open source it.')
