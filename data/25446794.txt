Item(by='johnyzee', descendants=None, kids=[25448105], score=None, time=1608145094, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25445063, text='The world wants and needs a medium of exchange, otherwise we are back to bartering fish for sheep skins. All the medium of exchange needs, is to be scarce - people have used conch shells when it served the purpose.<p>Right now, bitcoin is the best medium of exchange for the modern world. It beats physical stuff like gold, because it can be transferred digitally, across physical boundaries. It beats sovereign currencies, because you don&#x27;t have to depend on the policies of arbitrary governments.<p>Bitcoin&#x27;s scarcity is artificial, but that is a red herring. Bitcoin has the value that it has because the scarcity is real and believable. No one in a position to manipulate the network or protocol (a position that it is doubtful anyone could ever achieve at this point) would stand to gain from &#x27;hacking&#x27; it, since that would instantly destroy it.<p>All that said, yeah, the price rises are probably driven to a large extent by greed and ignorance. But so is a lot of the stock market and other investment vehicles.')
