So instead of the gym you take up mountain biking, and instead of the bus you bike commute. That&#x27;s potentially two bikes just for one person. Once you start though, you realize the required number of bikes is N+1 where N is the number you already have.<p>I was a mountain biker before the pandemic, but this spring I realized &quot;I&#x27;m going to have a LOT of time to mountain bike this summer, so I&#x27;ll get that $3k bike I&#x27;ve been thinking of getting for years now&quot;. I was super lucky to get my hands on one in 2020, and I had to go up to a more expensive $3.5k bike to even find one at all.')
