If you were unable to find it, then either you did not try whatsoever, or you are disingenuously pretending like there is some other potential way to interpret Timnit’s email that miraculously causes it to not refer to the explicit labor tasks of the Google employees she sent it to.<p>The direct quote (which can be read in the link [0]) is:<p>&gt; “What I want to say is stop writing your documents because it doesn’t make a difference.”<p>This is a direct, explicit, unequivocal reference to researchers and ethicists employed by Google to write research and policy documents on fairness, DE&amp;I, and bias, within machine learning, staffing and hiring, and other areas.<p>The phrase, “stop writing your documents because it doesn’t make a difference,” cannot be falsely made to apply to any context other than actively encouraging coworkers to specifically stop performing their direct job responsibilities.<p>My suspicion is that you would try to falsely misrepresent Timnit’s imploring to stop work as instead being about some type of non-work related activities or optional &#x2F; extra-curricular activities that Google wouldn’t have a formal labor productivity stake in - and if that is in fact what your response would be, it is completely and wholly false and wrong.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.platformer.news&#x2F;p&#x2F;the-withering-email-that-got-an-ethical" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.platformer.news&#x2F;p&#x2F;the-withering-email-that-got-a...</a>')
