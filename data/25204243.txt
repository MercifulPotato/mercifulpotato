This is fundamentally insensitive to cost (which annoys economists) and only moderately responsive  to technology --- efficiency limits are real (which annoys technologists), meaning the real questions  become what new sources can be deployed (as they become economical --- economists are not entirely useless), and how much can demand-side be reduced (ditto technologists).<p>The sources are solar and  wind (MacCay is addressing the UK).  There is little untapped or available hydro or geothermal potential (exceptions exist elsewhere), tide and wave are effectively negligible and extraordinarily capital intensive, and biofuels are impractical (the UK cannot even feed itself, as it shall soon rediscover post-Brexit, let alone its automobiles, furnaces, and ovens).<p>Nuclear is the wildcard, but is as much a problem child as ever.  (MacCay was a quiet proponent.)')
