You need trucks to deliver stuff (food etc) if you want to live in a city.<p>The correct way of looking at this isn’t by asking “what’s fair” but instead “what we want to incentivise”. People moving out of cities? Ramp up city property taxes. People moving into cities (more efficient)? Subsidise transport of goods. More green energy? Tax CO2 &#x2F; fuel, subsidise (clean) electricity. Less trucks, more railways? Tax trucks more, <i>but</i> this hardly makes sense <i>unless</i> rail a viable alternative (i.e. there’s enough railways leading to the city).')
