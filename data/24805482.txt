They always sounded trite, clich√©. Now I recognize them for what they are - pointers to experiences. Pointers in the programming sense. You just won&#x27;t <i>get</i> a piece of folk wisdom until you&#x27;ve lived through a situation to which it applies, and then thought about it and perhaps did some introspection. But after that, that proverb becomes a concise and convenient way to communicate to others who also get it, &quot;hey, the situation will likely evolve this way&quot;, or &quot;consider applying this pattern of reasoning to the situation&quot;.<p>The best proverbs are phrased in such a way to at least point you in the right direction if you don&#x27;t understand them. But in the end, you can&#x27;t skip experiencing the subject of the proverb yourself.')
