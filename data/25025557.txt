The writer says this:<p>&gt;    … the math behind ECC is so complicated that very few people feel confident enough to actually implement it. In other words, it intimidates people into using libraries built by cryptographers who know what they’re doing. RSA on the other hand is so simple that it can be (poorly) implemented in an hour.<p>In other words; the ECC encryption method is superior because it is significantly more complex than RSA. That is at the end of an article that talks about how hard RSA is to get right. This is not a compelling argument.')
