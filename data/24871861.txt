Item(by='rektide', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603474485, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24868495, text='&gt; You can have your personal opinion and can share them from your personal email address&#x2F;social networking site. But expressing his political opinion from official email&#x2F;business is plain wrong.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about this Expensify situation. I don&#x27;t immediately see that there is a line that was crossed, that it was &quot;plain wrong&quot;. It seems convenient, perhaps, to insist on moral silence from the world, but I&#x27;m not sure that this (imo absolutely tiny as can be) inconvenience is wrong, or something we shouldn&#x27;t do? Why do you think it is?<p>You ask &quot;Am I missing something?!&quot; but I have taken a big strong bold position of denial, of refusal, &amp; I don&#x27;t understand what or why you feel that way? Especially so strongly?<p>&gt; I think this company is going to be in lot of trouble for forcing thier view on all of their customers and dropping emails to their offical mailboxes<p>Oh I hope some customers try to react a ruckus. Some people are going to be loud, going to be obnoxious, going to trumpet loudly that they demand their safe, neutral spaces.<p>Alas, those people live on planet earth, with other people, and short of going off into the woods, I don&#x27;t think they should nor will get the emotional isolation they seem to be demanding of the world from it. They have been thrown into the world, &amp; they have choices about what kind of person they want to be as they meet the world.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is &quot;forcing their views&quot;. This is sharing, this is communication. It&#x27;s a human activity. It&#x27;s why the tribes of humanity rose above the animals, because we shared, because we communicated, because we created sense &amp; values where there were none. This is modest, this is reasonable. This is small.<p>&gt; This is total invasion of privacy.<p>It absolutely is not in any way at all an invasion of privacy. You have your private world to yourself still. That you have had to glimpse some of the real world is a different matter.')
