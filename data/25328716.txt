That was 1964-1968 (the sweater is probably from near the end of that span).<p>Recently my wife complemented me on another sweater she didn&#x27;t remember seeing (we&#x27;ve been married about seven years).  I told her I bought it in 1976.  It&#x27;s a bit odd looking (and I think she was being polite), but warm.<p>Otoh, I have worn through the knee of a number of jeans, and they either get turned into shorts or donated (and probably turned into rags).  Recently I was quickly wearing out the left elbow of long sleeve shirts, but this stopped with covid.  Either I was wearing it out on my office desk (it&#x27;s L-shaped, with the arm part of the L on my left) or on my car door (as in most of the world, the driver&#x27;s side of my car is on the left).')
