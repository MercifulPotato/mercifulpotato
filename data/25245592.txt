I hold my breath walking past Lush shops.<p>Sometimes I have to use the fairly fancy department store in Copenhagen (Magasin).  I often walk all the way round, so I can enter inâ€¦ handbags or something, I don&#x27;t know, I just know it doesn&#x27;t smell. The more convenient entrance is to the perfume section, which makes me gag.<p>I have no problem with person-quantity perfume.  I found the signs in California about a &quot;scent-free workplace&quot; a bit strange.  Some shops just have enough perfume to knock out a horse.<p>(Many years ago, I had a job working in a chocolate factory for the summer.  I couldn&#x27;t eat chocolate for the whole summer, after the 8 hour exposure every day, but it wasn&#x27;t unpleasant. I bet there are food industry jobs where the smell really is unpleasant.)')
