I have similar experiences: I’ll dread and stress a social experience until it comes, drain myself during it, then wake to find something full that was running low, something I may not have even been keeping track of.<p>There’s also a concept of mixed introvert&#x2F;extrovert, and more to my liking a concept of introversion not being antisocial but craving certain intimate kinds of social experiences.<p>I thrive on a very small, somewhat malleable but always close social world. All other social demands are conditional on my ability and comfort. But my close social world can come call or (metaphorically during pandemic) hug or snuggle any time')
