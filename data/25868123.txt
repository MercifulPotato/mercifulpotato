Google, for example, bans the use of any AGPL software. It&#x27;s too vague for the legal team to confidently understand the &quot;bounds&quot; of the copyleft license.<p>Permissive licenses like MIT&#x2F;Apache have historically been what companies prefer to have when evaluating free software. And, generally, it hasn&#x27;t been a problem for companies like Elastic because companies like Amazon didn&#x27;t &quot;take&quot; profits from Elastic (and others).<p>What has shifted is that, where before, there was a &quot;code of honor&quot; that companies could use FOSS software and Elastic would benefit from the uptick in adoption via support contracts, community building libs + writing docs, and encouraging &quot;network effects&quot; for them.<p>The &quot;cost&quot; of being a FOSS company was lower than the &quot;reaped&quot; benefits of the network effects.<p>That has shifted with &quot;predatory&quot; behavior from companies like Amazon. That abuse of the &quot;vulnerability&quot; in the FOSS ecosystem is a tragedy of the commons. It means that companies have to be more cautious about what they choose to open source.<p>This is just my opinion, of course. As a founder of a software company though, I see this as a real struggle. I would prefer have <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;refinery.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;refinery.io</a> be an entirely open source tool and we make money via supporting the ecosystem.<p>Unfortunately, it just isn&#x27;t clear cut. The best option that I see today is a model like what MongoDB and CockroachDB have with licenses like BSL. But, they&#x27;re not truly &quot;open source&quot;. And that sucks.<p>We are living in a time where there are no good answers in the face of exploitative behavior by companies like Amazon. It means companies like mine have to maintain a proprietary platform in order to make money.<p>As a developer, it hurts my ideals. As a business owner, it&#x27;s a risk I can&#x27;t afford to take. That&#x27;s why this behavior is a problem for FOSS.')
