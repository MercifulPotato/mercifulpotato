When selling their houses for their estates the realtors both said &quot;you can skip the disclosure part&quot; because I didn&#x27;t own the house myself.<p>I did happen to know that my mom had had asbestos removed from the kitchen in her 1972 home.  It was required when she remodeled.  But I had never been to my aunt&#x27;s home (1000 miles away) until she had died.  It was built the same year and I bet it did have asbestos in it because it had never been remodeled.')
