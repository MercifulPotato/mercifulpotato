Had various models of synology for nearly 10 years now and it’s the ideal solution for stopping to think and worry about it (combined with UPS). Running VMs, etc, I’d rather do that on a different box. You need to reboot frequently, make some experimental changes, modify the hardware, etc. Better to do that away from your data.')
