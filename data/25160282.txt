Maybe it spontaneously grows spikes and punctures your insides.<p>Additionally, you also have, as an individual, the option to just stand further back in the line. You don&#x27;t have to get in immediate contact with the enemy, you can just go to the back of the army and wait for some time until the experimental armor is battle tested.<p>What sounds like the more rational choice (from an individual standpoint) now?<p>EDIT: not sure why this is getting downvotes. I do agree that the risk equation does seem leaning towards taking the vaccine. Tests have been conducted with &gt;30.000 people, and so far it seems safe. There still exists of course a probability of that not being the case, but compared to the (known, and very real) side effects of covid, taking the vaccine asap even if it&#x27;s version 1.0 seems like the sensible choice.<p>Still, parents analogy seemed flawed so I tried to extend it.')
