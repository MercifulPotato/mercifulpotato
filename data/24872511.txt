I’m saying the SQL query is more accessible to non-Spark users (e.g. a DBA who might need to approve your code) and as-is can be thrown into Hive&#x2F;Presto or any RDBMS pretty easily.  The DataFrame version is definitely more extensible, but in my experience Spark is more often used to inform the design of a larger data pipeline versus serve as the pipeline year after year.  Appreciate there are places where the opposite is true.')
