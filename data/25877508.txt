I suppose my beliefs are more nuanced than what I specified in my post.<p>&gt; You should use the UI elements that make sense. It doesn&#x27;t make sense for Maya or Blender or Photoshop to constrain themselves to whatever Microsoft picked out for them to use.<p>The nuance in my beliefs is that if UI elements aren&#x27;t available for the function, then apps should absolutely build custom UI. I agree with you there.<p>It&#x27;s when you have a basic app that can entirely use native controls and chooses to forego them to do everything custom that I have a problem with.<p>For my particular example, we were building a cryptocurrency wallet for a new blockchain. It was simple enough to use entirely native controls but definitely didn&#x27;t need a custom UI.')
