A lot of the ring-leaders of these mobs openly embrace their mental illness as a personality trait (ie: listing it in their Twitter bios).<p>It leads to this bizarre environment where their reactions are, medically speaking, insane (ie: the reaction of someone in bipolar mania, the reaction of someone suffering from paranoia or extreme anxiety.) But there are so many insane reactions, that it becomes normalized.<p>And then people who don&#x27;t struggle with mental illness start to mimic the insane behavior, because hey, everyone else is doing it! And it&#x27;s now the best way to get internet points, collect followers, and get some profitable attention to your own books.')
