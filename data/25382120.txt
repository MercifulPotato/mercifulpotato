Quality is often left to UI teams, when service teams need to step up and perform more due diligence of their own. Until then, Cypress is the tool for the job. Been using it for 6+ months. I&#x27;m not crazy about it, but I have no known superior alternatives, so I am grateful for this open source tech.')
