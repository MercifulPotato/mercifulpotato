Opinions are my own.<p>AWS has more than enough learnings to avoid these &quot;events&quot;. The problem is the whole culture is focused on delivering new stuff instead of preventing problems and improving existing systems.<p>Some folks made these decisions with best intentions. I&#x27;m pretty sure they all got promoted and then moved on. Now, people who inherited these systems have no incentive to fix these, because at most you&#x27;ll receive a pat in the back. I&#x27;m also pretty sure that those teams talked about the shortcomings of the current architecture. TODOs must be present somewhere in the backlog.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is an AWS specific problem, but we have to start treating people who prevent problems like the heroes they are. Everyone congratulates when you put out a fire. No one gives a damn if you prevent the fire in the first place.')
