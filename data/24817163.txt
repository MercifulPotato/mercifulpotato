In Sweden nobody puts actual <i>butter</i> on bread, we have loads of different butter-based &quot;spreads&quot; for that. Bregott (literally &quot;spread good&#x2F;well&#x2F;tasty&quot;) is probably the most common and engineered to be spreadable straight from the fridge.<p>Proper butter is for cooking but primarily for baking.<p>I am 45, have been interested in cooking for 20+ years, read many cookbooks and so on.
