Trust me, the reason I know is that I used to be that guy who thought Excel was a great tool.<p>I built derivatives spreadsheets, backoffice spreadsheets, trading systems with realtime data, all sorts of crap in Excel.<p>Really, it&#x27;s Stockholm Syndrome. People who previously had zero computing power at their disposal think they&#x27;ve found the hammer that solves all problems when they&#x27;re introduced to Excel, because now they can calculate lots of numbers.<p>They just get blinded by the revelation that they can now calculate &quot;anything&quot; and are happy to pay whatever the cost is in terms of future maintenance, ease of understanding, etc.<p>&gt; Excel not being idiot-proof doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not usable.<p>This is absolutely true, I&#x27;d be able to do much better with Excel now than earlier. The problem is Dunning Krueger. There are too many people who think they can code once they&#x27;re able to get a bit of Excel going, and they don&#x27;t know that they can&#x27;t. Not trying to be condescending, I&#x27;ve been there myself. It&#x27;s just that you get a lot of &quot;coding is a thing I have to do in order to get to some target&quot;, and so people think that once they&#x27;ve finally bashed out their spreadsheet, they&#x27;ve figured it all out.')
