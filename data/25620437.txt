Would try contacting them via e-mail or the like if unsure, however, I use it offline on my android, can add it to homescreen and it apparently doesn&#x27;t need a connection. If they can get the things you mentioned in order, may be an interesting alternative.<p>I did look at the sources tab, to check out why my laptop was using so much cpu during the decryption phase, and there are some argon2 webworkers that pop up, so some combo of that, and it clearly seems deterministic, since both my phone and laptop produce matching passes, when all params match.')
