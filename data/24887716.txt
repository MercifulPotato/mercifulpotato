Things don&#x27;t change overnight, and never by themselves. Advocating for a more walkable city is probably a good idea. Might require political action of some sort. Or maybe it just needs a critical mass of frequent walkers.<p>For the record, I live in a walkable city now, and grew up in a tiny, walkable villagle. Wouldn&#x27;t even consider moving somewhere that wasn&#x27;t walkable.<p>Addendum: a city that isn&#x27;t designed for people probably shouldn&#x27;t be considered a city. I&#x27;m trying to think of a better name, but I&#x27;m stuck on expletives.')
