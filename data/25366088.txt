They only last about 10 years. Before you get bored of it and buy a new one. Or before it breaks down so often, that you must buy a new car.<p>Software, like Microsoft Office, is also consumable, in the sense that your computer burns out, or Microsoft makes its operating system end-of-life after 5 years. This forces you to buy a new license.<p>So if Toyota makes $3,000 in profit per car. And you replace your car in 10 years, then this is $300&#x2F;year. Or about $25&#x2F;month in profits to Toyota.<p>If it’s $7,000, then the monthly profits goes up to $58&#x2F;month for Toyota.<p>So it’s the equivalent to a Netflix or Cable TV subscription for Toyota. But with the entrenched benefit that being a car manufacturer is big business, and there aren’t that many players in it.<p>What Toyota did was to make perfect, their vehicles, that they have such a loyal following. That their customers go back to them for every new car, decade after decade.<p>And plus, they make more money from their luxury brand, Lexus, and from their trucks.')
