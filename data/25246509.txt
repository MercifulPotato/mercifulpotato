If some people want to be in the rat race until 65 they&#x27;re free to do so. I personally have better things to do with my limited time on this earth.<p>&gt; Rather than just sitting back and enjoying the life&#x2F;work balance and less working hours<p>What&#x27;s wrong with enjoying life once your needs are met ? If I&#x27;m happy working 35 hours a week why would I work 42 hours a week ? If I don&#x27;t want to buy the next new shinny toy why would I bust my ass for extra money that I won&#x27;t need ?')
