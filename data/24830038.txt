It&#x27;s <i>really dang hard</i>, on their biggest, fanciest chips, to pump the DSPs at their advertised clock speeds.  Maybe if I was smarter, I could do an asynchronous design that would somehow avoid clocking issues, but I suspect that doing async between mismatched clock regions would effectively halve the clock.<p>The only consolation for me is that I&#x2F;O over PCI ends up being my ultimate bottleneck.  If AMD did a full-on integration with their infinity fabric, it could actually be a game changer.  For me, and my weirdo niche.')
