The classic disruptive chart shows two technologies improving in parallel, but the performance customers demand doesn&#x27;t increase as fast, so eventually the disruptive technology is &quot;good enough&quot; for those customers (even though the incumbent technology is better still: it &quot;overshoots&quot;) and has other desired qualities (like battery efficiency), so customers all switch to it.<p>Here, of course, Apple is unlikely to sell its chips to other manufacturers... so any disruption will be at the product level: affecting wintel laptops, desktops... and eventually perhaps game consoles and linux servers. Everything.<p>BTW I really enjoy his theories, but let us note that Christensen himself assessed the iphone as non-disruptive.')
