Even harder if you&#x27;re on a work visa which is linked to your specialization. This is the primary method to keep salaries down in competitive markets.<p>Not a lawyer but sometimes I wonder if they are even constitutionally valid, considering you are restricting someone&#x27;s freedom to do something in the future.')
