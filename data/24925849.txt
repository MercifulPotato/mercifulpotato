He&#x27;s entertaining, and has a good sense of humor.\nIf someone was to deprive me of the opportunity to listen to him, I&#x27;d be ticked off, and I don&#x27;t agree with the guy (at least when I can understand what he&#x27;s saying hahaha).<p>I can only imagine how people that do agree with his more unconventional views view those doing the deplatforming, but they&#x27;re definitely not helping them by doing it. You&#x27;re just insulating them from opposing views and making them angry at you.\nIt feels to me like its vindictive, coming from a place of genuine hate. Thats not good no matter what the stated intentions are.')
