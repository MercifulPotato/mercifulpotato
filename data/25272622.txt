That&#x27;s its function. Specific triplets of bases along the chain correspond to specific amino acids, so a DNA strand ultimately results in production of a specific protein molecule. In turn, protein molecules do most of the specialized work in a cell, including controlling the intake and expulsion of small non-protein molecules from the surrounding medium.<p>In turn, it&#x27;s mainly the shape of protein molecules that makes them behave differently. And some proteins change shape under changing conditions within the cell, thus being able to function in a regulatory fashion.')
