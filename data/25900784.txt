Apparently this was the old way DL used to be taught, and even in 2016 the professor insisted everyone had to do it this way.<p>I didn&#x27;t study ML in general so what I gained from the course was a deep understanding of the fundamentals &amp; math behind it, but since I didn&#x27;t get to familiarize myself with any of the existing libraries (Tensorflow&#x2F;Keras back then) I  had a hard time convincing anyone in industry of my skills in the field :&#x2F;<p>Also: Why does the book only cover Deep Q-Network on Reinforcement Learning? Sure it is the most notable <i>deep learning</i> step in the field but, there are some relevant versions such as Actor-Critic &amp; Maximum Entropy RL that can be very relevant too. If one includes YOLO, ResNet and newer architectures for Computer Vision application, I don&#x27;t know why same things are not on RL.')
