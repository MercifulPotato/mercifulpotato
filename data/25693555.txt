The videos are shocking and disgusting.<p>This was 1000% a failure from the top, there are lots of videos of these poor uniformed officers on the outer lines outnumbered 1000 &#x2F; 1 with no gear, no tear gas or other riot weapons, fighting back but just getting trampled, shot with tear gas, hit with bat things, etc. It looks like instead of refusing to respond they didn&#x27;t have the equipment to.<p>While the many were brave, there are definitely still some sympathizers and participants for instance WaPo has quotes that there were off duty officers of the law flashing their badges to get in.<p>i think good chance we&#x27;ll see the evidence it was intentional negligence denying support&#x2F;materials&#x2F;gear and intentionally delaying a response on the part of Trump&#x27;s DOJ etc.<p>Send out the subpoenas, and interview this weekend -&gt; vote Monday.<p>these and so many more, but this focuses on the outer &#x27;rings&#x27;\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ElijahSchaffer&#x2F;status&#x2F;1346966514990149639?s=20" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ElijahSchaffer&#x2F;status&#x2F;134696651499014963...</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=cJOgGsC0G9U" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=cJOgGsC0G9U</a>')
