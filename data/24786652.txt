VR has some inherent flaws that will probably hinder itself from ever getting to anything except niches (like gaming).<p>AR, on the other hand, MIGHT get some traction, but I&#x27;m not sure how. AR currently adds another layer of abstraction ... that&#x27;s one layer too much. There should be something where it adds more use than the additional layer of interaction takes. I personally like the IKEA App where you can visually place furniture into your AR room, that&#x27;s pretty need and helpful. Other than that (and gaming of course) i don&#x27;t see any applications for the web<i>.<p></i>Applications for other things like &quot;way finding&quot; or &quot;place something in AR (like an electrician virtually places the markers where to install outlets) might come if there is more benefits than &quot;the old way&quot;.')
