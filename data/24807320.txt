Item(by='55555', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602906219, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24806996, text='The open relationship thing didn&#x27;t&#x2F;doesn&#x27;t work for me, but I&#x27;m upvoting you because I think it&#x27;s a little unfair you&#x27;re being downvoted for your personal experience. I think some people may be downvoting you, though, because you seem to present yourself as &quot;open&quot; and yet it reads a bit as though your open relationships are more open for yourself than the women involved. No judgement from me, though: I also find that sort of &#x27;open&#x27; arrangement easier to deal with. Probably all men do.<p>&gt; Not in my face if it&#x27;s with a dude, don&#x27;t get pregnant, or diseases, and I don&#x27;t care.<p>(I didn&#x27;t miss this.) You may be very equally open; it&#x27;s hard to tell from your comment. Congrats on having such an unusually low level of jealousy.')
