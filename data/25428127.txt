There are some details that are missing in the interest of keeping the story simple.<p>1) The audio and video playback is driven by the hardware, using the audio stream as the master clock.<p>2) Ninja does fill the Android and hardware buffers and keep them full. In the pathological case, the hardware and Android buffers had emptied.<p>3) When the Android buffer isn&#x27;t full, the thread yields to Android (to be a good citizen) but asks to be invoked again right away. The 40ms &quot;background thread&quot; delay broke this behavior. The comment about &quot;changing this behavior involved deeper changes than I was prepared to make&quot; was when I explored changing this behavior (copying multiple samples per invocation) and decided it was more likely to introduce more bugs.')
