There&#x27;s always a tendency for people to ask what&#x27;s been decided in the meeting right after it ends when they weren&#x27;t present. This could be reproduced in a remote environment. Indeed, I think the minutes from the meeting should be published, even in an in-person office.<p>&gt; Culture has to adapt to the environment. Thereâ€™s nothing special about it being remote.<p>I totally agree with you. The only issue is that this adaptation may take some time. In my client&#x27;s example, this was considered a temporary thing. Most people were switched to part-time, etc. I think they merely considered the remote thing as a bump in the road, and this situation may be pretty common among companies affected by shelter in place directives.<p>I think people may be surprised by the sudden change, and they are looking for ways to adapt. In the beginning, they will try to reproduce what they were doing before, which, of course, may not work as well. Which contributes to their frustration. I don&#x27;t think that if they were forced to stay remote for a long time (some six months to a year at least) they would continue trying to fit the square peg in a hole that&#x27;s become round. Maybe some would, but I&#x27;m hopeful that a sufficient number of people would try to adapt so as the change the surrounding culture.')
