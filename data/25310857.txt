It was totally positive sum with no harmed third party. A very large proportion of transactions (plastic surgery, sports cars, entertainment, holidays, restaurants, personal trainer, Netflix, etc) are of this nature where the rebuttal that &quot;it&#x27;s not really voluntary&quot; doesn&#x27;t apply in the least.')
