(Hypothetically. This is just a possibility and has to be researched, but this is exactly why I am enthusiastic.)<p>Also, contrary to steroidal treatment, vitamin D bolsters a part of the immunity (lymphocytes T), even if it dampens an other part. So, it would restore a balance which is lost in case of defective aquiered immunity.')
