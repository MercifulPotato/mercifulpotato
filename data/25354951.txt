Open sourcing the shim&#x2F;adapter you use to orchestrate running the unmodified software doesn&#x27;t even seem to be an issue, because usually what&#x27;s stopping competitors is <i>not</i> simply development difficulty. Then the question becomes how far past the orchestration does the virality go -- I think it&#x27;s pretty hard to make a case that your customer frontend (which is where the money gets made) that calls out to the orchestration software (maybe it doesn&#x27;t even, maybe it just puts a message on a queue) is now a work derived from the Program.<p>Here&#x27;s a more concrete example. If I want to run a hosted mongo service, I can take mongodb&#x27;s own k8s operator[0] and build using that. For this to be damaging to the business, the virality of AGPL would have to extend all the way to whatever software I use to check out customers, but even that seems like it would be fine if that software was open source too (imagine some self-hostable saas project that takes your stripe key as an ENV variable).<p>Here&#x27;s another thing worth considering -- who is going to sue companies that violate? Some random group of developers? The EFF&#x2F;FSF + a developer? when are they going to sue you? By the time that you&#x27;re a giant company off of the software, even if a competitor got the complete source code to one, two or all services that run on your platform, could they really replicate it? Wouldn&#x27;t they still have to get that source from a customer (user) that requested the source?<p>It seems that if you really want to stop this from happening, something like the Business Source License[1] (or some equivalent license) or bust.<p>Aside from all this, it really feels like AGPL is the best license for all software -- it really hits the &quot;don&#x27;t use this if you will improve it but not contribute back&quot; intention perfectly -- if you make your derived work public (such that your modified version <i>becomes</i> the unmodified version) it seems like there are little to no issues running a business on it.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mongodb&#x2F;mongodb-kubernetes-operator" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mongodb&#x2F;mongodb-kubernetes-operator</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mariadb.com&#x2F;bsl11" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mariadb.com&#x2F;bsl11</a>')
