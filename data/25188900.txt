I am not affiliated with DO in any way.<p>The downtime issues with DOKS are directly related to the resources allocated to the control plane, which is <i>not</i> set up in a HA capacity. The resources assigned are directly related to the size&#x2F;number of nodes you use. API-heavy applications can very easy knock out the control plane, and in that situation is takes it a (relatively) long time to recover on it&#x27;s own (I would typically see ~4hr before it became responsive again).<p>Their support team is able to modify the master resources for a given cluster (to assist with recovery), but the turn-around time on that shouldn&#x27;t be considered &quot;production ready&quot;.<p>At this point my advice for DOKS would be:<p>- Are you using very basic, out-of-the-box Kubernetes to host &quot;apps&quot;? You will probably be fine, but be sure to have a back-up.<p>- Are you planning to use Operators, or anything that heavily interacts with the kube-api? I would recommend not using it, or over-provisioning your cluster (which would very quickly offset the advantage of the &quot;free&quot; managed masters).<p>I know that they are working on fixing some of these reliability issues and I have hopes that it will be more stable shortly.<p>At this time I have a &quot;stable&quot; cluster which (unless their support lied to me) had master resources manually increased by their support team after the 3rd incident of it dying. I haven&#x27;t had an issue since then.')
