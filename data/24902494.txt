If some are OK with it and some are not, then it suggests it has legitimate purpose (though you need to go a lot deeper).<p>Note, I&#x27;m not arguing copying small-label stuff is OK, I&#x27;m rather more OK with copying RIAA stuff.<p>AFAICT, if a DRM prohibits fair use, breaking it is legal. In some jurisdictions. Or at least it should be. That should be enough of a reason for youtube-dl to exist.')
