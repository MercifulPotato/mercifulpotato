As an interviewer myself I find that just talking to the person as a human being and asking them about their current work, previous work, and interests tends to expose nearly everything I need to know.  I initially just want to see if the person is likely to be a good fit for the company.  This can be triggered by attitude, arrogance, etc.<p>Engineering-wise I can focus on any one thing they bring up and ask them to explain in more depth, this then becomes a dialogue, which is vital I think, because they&#x27;re interviewing me and my company as much as I am interviewing them.  I intentionally don&#x27;t try to catch them out, in fact the opposite, a candidate at ease is the one that opens up more and will give you more insight into who they are and what they are about than any whiteboard exercise.<p>I&#x27;ll then talk about the requirements for the role they&#x27;re applying for and try to see if their knowledge covers what we need.  Again, just a dialogue.<p>If that first interview goes well, then I will ask for examples of code they have written, or set them a test to do in their own time if they have nothing of their own to show.  Granted that takes some of their time, but it only happens if they&#x27;re being seriously considered, and importantly (I think) allows them to use their own tools, in their own time, in their own way, this gives them a chance to shine.<p>This might not work at FAANG scale, I dunno, I find the idea of working at any organisation like that a pretty miserable one.  But talking to someone in a respectful way, rather than putting them in an uncomfortable situation that bears no resemblance to what their day-to-day would be, shouldn&#x27;t be hard to scale.<p>Although, I suspect much of these issues come about because of the inadequacies of the interviewers rather than the candidates, they&#x27;re hiding behind tricks, gotchas, and memory tests, because possibly they don&#x27;t have the range themselves to extract something meaningful from the candidate in order to rank them.')
