I have Logitech C910 and it does 1080p60 flawlessly. I wonder if it is not actually 2.0 but USB 1.1 which made sense since the transfer rate is abysmally low (1.1 does up to 12 Mbps, 2.0 is up to 480 Mbps).<p>But again, computers does have their quirks and can do weird &amp; strange things that seem impossible but it is possible.')
