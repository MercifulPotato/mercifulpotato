I&#x27;m not touching GME with my money, but I&#x27;m happy to stand on the sidelines and cheer the memers on.<p>You need to define your terms. You don&#x27;t get charged and go to prison for &quot;pump and dump&quot;, you get charged and go to prison for &quot;securities fraud&quot;.<p>Right now, people are saying it&#x27;s worth burning a lot of money just to stick it to Wall Street. As in, if you do this, you&#x27;re probably gonna lose a lot of money, but you should do it anyway, because it&#x27;s the right thing to do. (note: I&#x27;m not arguing the merits of this argument, I&#x27;m just stating what I interpret the argument to be.)<p>The thing that&#x27;s illegal that will put you in prison for securities fraud is to claim that if you buy GME and hold it, you will make a lot of money. This isn&#x27;t illegal because it&#x27;s fucking over Wall Street, this is illegal <i>because you&#x27;re lying</i>. The crime isn&#x27;t &quot;pump and dump&quot;, the crime is &quot;securities fraud&quot;.<p>Also note that traditionally, in a pump and dump scheme, you buy first and pump later. People right now are buying and pumping at the same time. They&#x27;re not (just) pumping by telling other people to buy the stock, they&#x27;re pumping <i>by buying the stock</i>. This is a significant difference.<p>That being said, since Everything Everywhere Is Securities Fraud, I guess this is securities fraud too.
