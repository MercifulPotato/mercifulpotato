Shortly after the 8008, Intel started using Calma&#x27;s computer-aided design system that ran on a Data General minicomputer; the output masters may have stayed rubylith for a time, but other output options became available. Bell Telephone Laboratories, for example, had a high-resolution photoplotter.[3] The integrated circuit industry left rubylith for better technologies.&quot;')
