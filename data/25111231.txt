Sounds like you are trying to wage a war here to me.<p>&gt; Taking a step back: when someone corrects me on a terminology mistake<p>Here&#x27;s the problem.  You did not just stop at correcting their mistake.  You stated &quot;Democrat Party&quot; is part of a rhetorical war by the GOP.  You were trying to shame someone and slander another party for the Democratic Party&#x27;s own use of Democrats as the primary means of identification.  The GOP is not making the Democratic Party go around referring to their members as Democrats.  It certainly is not preventing Democrats from using Democratic &lt;whatever&gt; in their communications which the average person is exposed to.')
