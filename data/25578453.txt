Clearly Microsoft then considered it &quot;not Windows&quot;, IIRC especially on Xbox 360. It&#x27;s not that a VMM that reside parallel to the Xbox kernel makes it not Windows or not. Sometimes they said it&#x27;s &quot;built with technologies from Windows&quot; or sometimes it was &quot;built specifically for Xbox&quot; but they maintained it&#x27;s not Windows.')
