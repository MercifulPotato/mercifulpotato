Most database free tiers come with very tricky conditions like wiping all content every now and then, having to redeploy regularly, etc. - this makes them not really usable in production. And the paid tiers jump easily from 0 to $50&#x2F;mo which is not feasible for free pet project.<p>I am talking about nothing fancy, a few megabytes of Postgres with negligible traffic. How do you folks go about this? Thank you.')
