The fact that one tax-shirking abusive anticompetitive monopoly replaces another with depressing regularity (IBM, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, ...) isn&#x27;t a sign of progress but of pathology.  And  old monopolies often prove impressively durable.<p>What&#x27;s become clear to me in the decades since we first decried Microsoft&#x27;s FUD, embrace-extend-extinguish, and unholy business practice methods is that every case of a monopoly I&#x27;ve encountered has 1) been describable as an extensive network (physical or virtual), where 2) that network structure is fundamental to its monopoly nature, with 3) a privately held central point of control.<p>If you can describe a firm in terms of nodes and links, and it holds key control points, you&#x27;re looking at a very likely monopoly:  transport (people, cargo, pipelenes, ...), energy, water, utilities, communications, information, standards &amp; protocols, APIs, marketing relationships and contracts, logistics, retail and wholesale networks, knowledge, education and certification, finance, insurance (access, underwriting, risk), social networks, reputation and ratings systems, just for starters.<p>Understanding of these points are hugely distorted in large part through  the direct and self-serving efforts of the Chicago School (Aaron Director, Milton Friedman, Robert Bork, Richard Posner, ...).  It&#x27;s only with recent revival in antitrust concerns, rejection of the Bork-Posner antitrust doctrine (in part by Posner himself), and work of people such as Lina Khan, Matt Stoller Tim Wu, Cry Doctorow, and Shoshana Zubboff, as well as the recognition of the intrinsic network-monopoly relationship, that this is beginning to change.<p>That said, the Refutation is excellent.')
