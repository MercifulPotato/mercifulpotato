Item(by='arcticbull', descendants=None, kids=[24651812, 24652411], score=None, time=1601565002, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24651683, text='&gt; I&#x27;m not so sure I agree with the analysis. If you want to pack an additional leisure traveller onto your 1-stop, make it $10, maybe $20, cheaper and &quot;mission accomplished&quot;.<p>This has to do with segmentation. Not all business travelers are allowed to fly in a premium cabin, and reducing all economy tickets to $10 wouldn&#x27;t allow them to obtain maximum revenue.<p>This is why historically airlines have priced flights cheaper earlier on (catering to leisure travelers) and raised the prices as the departure time approaches (catering to business travelers). They literally do make flights $10-20 in advance, in an attempt to snag more leisure travelers. Segmentation has gotten a lot more advanced, since, too.<p>I agree there are some cases where companies allow free choice, although any midsize and large company I&#x27;ve worked at, I&#x27;ve been pretty strongly guided towards the companies&#x27; contracted airline -- if not mandated. For many business travelers, they&#x27;re not the ones making the decision. These earning rate decisions are made for everyone, not for individuals or groups.')
