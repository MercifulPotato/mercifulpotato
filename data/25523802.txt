I am nor arguing it had to effect, I am arguing it&#x27;s not like we&#x27;d all be a moral vacuum without it.<p>I am very surprised you are claiming the old testament is somehow not part of Christianity or should now be considered- am I misunderstanding you? I am not a religious scholar, but that&#x27;s not a view my local priest would support.<p>Also I fail to see how bringing up Stalin is relevant, you can&#x27;t even find a communist these days that thinks he was morally upright.')
