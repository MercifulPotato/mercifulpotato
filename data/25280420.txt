Chinese use &quot;invoice&quot; for &quot;receipt&quot; because they use the same official form for actual invoices, I think, as a way of cracking down on tax avoidance. China has one of the highest sales tax at the retail level, including VAT and various fees; so high in fact the actual rate is a state secret. You can imagine the pressure on retailers, particularly, small shop owners, to avoid paying it. The government therefore introduced a system of official invoices that everybody including all retailers must use, and from carbon copy of invoices tax collectors can calculate sales amount and thereby tax owed.<p>That is my understanding, anyway. I have been out of the country for so long, it must have changed a lot. Most of it must be electronic now, I imagine. I still remember a shop owner&#x27;s audible complaints when I asked for an invoice around the time the system was initially introduced.')
