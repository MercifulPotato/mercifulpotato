Item(by='potatochup', descendants=0, kids=None, score=2, time=1603939941, title='Ask HN: Desktop app for time-series data visualization (automotive)', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hi HN,<p>Approx 1-2 years ago, there was a Show HN posted that was a desktop application for viewing time-series measurement data, specifically targeted at automotive using the Measurement Data Format (MDF). I had it bookmarked, but unfortunately lost the link in a company-wide nuke of personal browsing profiles on work computers. I&#x27;ve spent a good few hours on HN search and google trying to look for it, without any luck so far. If anyone  has the link floating around I&#x27;d greatly appreciate it. Other suggestions for similar cross-platform desktop apps welcome.')
