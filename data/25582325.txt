Hence this statement is wrong:<p>&gt; Government debt have no interest<p>Also this statement is also wrong, since government bonds aren&#x27;t money in circulation:<p>&gt; National debt is simply the amount of the national currency in circulation.<p>Another proof about this statement being wrong: Sweden has currency worth just 1.26% of GDP in circulation, but about 35% of GDP in debt. If what you said was true that would be an impossibility. You are trying to spread falsehoods and even contradict yourself, that is a fact.<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Swedish_krona" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Swedish_krona</a>')
