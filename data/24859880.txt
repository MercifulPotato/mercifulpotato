All three properties have been single-family detached structures with yards, once with a pool, the works.  The few times I needed to bring something home my regular sedan couldn&#x27;t handle, I rented a truck for a couple of hours or a day.<p>Full disclosure: I loathed driving the things, too.  Pedestrians were virtually impossible to see, a staggering number of blind spots, felt like it took an entire county to bring the thing to a stop, and one refueling of the rental was about what I spent on a month of gas for my usual vehicle.')
