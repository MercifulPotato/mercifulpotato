Many tech folks turned entrepreneurs (myself included) think that if they build a great product, they&#x27;ll get usage. Doesn&#x27;t work that way.<p>But I will also say that I suspect your strategy is possibly a little naive. I hope it&#x27;s as easy as you&#x27;ve laid out, and I&#x27;m envious of the viral aspects of your proposed product. However, I suspect the &quot;top of funnel&quot; portion (hypothesis 1) won&#x27;t be enough to drive your &quot;land and expand&quot; portion (hypothesis 2). At least in my own experience currently trying to build a B2B SaaS tool [0], it&#x27;s an absolute grind. And while some of these communities you&#x27;re mentioning will engage, it&#x27;s hard to convert that to people entering your funnel in a reliable fashion. You&#x27;ve got to combine it with 19 others things like content marketing, speaking at events, etc.<p>That being said, we&#x27;re not engaging in as transparent way as you are so YMMV. I wish you the best of luck!<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kitemaker.co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kitemaker.co</a> - a crazy fast issue tracker that connects all of your other tools (GitHub, Figma, Slack, Discord) better than anything else out there')
