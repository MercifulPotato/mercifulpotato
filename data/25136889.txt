Item(by='jcun4128', descendants=None, kids=[25142742, 25137287, 25137057], score=None, time=1605708619, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25135752, text='imo I don&#x27;t agree with the &quot;buy domain name right away&quot; since it may cause you to lose motivation&#x2F;drive. Having the thought &quot;build it first then when it&#x27;s done buy a domain&quot; is my thought. As I often buy domains and end up not using them&#x2F;not finishing the project... still I can see the issue of securing a nice domain name.<p>I think that would be great to make some project that has returns even a seemingly low sum of $200&#x2F;mo. That&#x27;s like a fifth of what I need to live a month, not bad.<p>Facebook ads for market interest check is an interesting thought albeit maybe expenisve.<p>edit: the other thing stories like these(pertaining to EarlyName) seem to gloss over is the legal aspect. It is easy to throw up a payment form but who is it paid to and say you&#x27;re sued for whatever reason... does the few hundred a month justify an LLC sort of thing. That&#x27;s the part that sucks&#x2F;part of a business I guess. Some options like fastpring I think. Maybe general ToS&#x2F;Privacy is enough<p>It is funny it&#x27;s like a &quot;solve that problem when you actually have it&quot; sort of scenario. But I do wonder about creating some general LLC that can be an umbrella to random micro saas projects.')
