Having the thought &quot;build it first then when it&#x27;s done buy a domain&quot; is my thought. As I often buy domains and end up not using them&#x2F;not finishing the project... still I can see the issue of securing a nice domain name.<p>I think that would be great to make some project that has returns even a seemingly low sum of $200&#x2F;mo. That&#x27;s like a fifth of what I need to live a month, not bad.<p>Facebook ads for market interest check is an interesting thought albeit maybe expenisve.')
