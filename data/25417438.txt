If you&#x27;re e.g. in Germany or Poland, you can have it unlocked, but the car stops being road legal anywhere else.<p>Ideally, they&#x27;d just harmonize the speed limit in the EU; a majority in Germany approves of introducing a general speed limit on motorways anyways. But that&#x27;d hurt the bottom line of car manufacturers and we can&#x27;t have that.<p>Also, GPS-validated speed limits for new cars. And I don&#x27;t mean just the top speed in a country, I mean the posted speed limit on whatever road you are. Doesn&#x27;t need to be a hard limit, in case of emergencies and for maneuvering, but make something interesting happen: online registration, enable the hazard lights, I&#x27;m sure there are many good options. It&#x27;s ridiculous we&#x27;re talking about fully automated driving and we don&#x27;t even have this simple automation which would get rid of an entire class of everyday offense.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;de.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Datei:Freeway_speed_limits_europe.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;de.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Datei:Freeway_speed_limits_eur...</a>')
