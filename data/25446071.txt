In others what is poverty.<p>Moving back in with your parents so not having an income but also not having to pay rent. Alot of people I know in NYC have just chosen not to pay rent and are not being evicted so they are living in poverty but in fancy areas of brooklyn and not having to work.<p>Poverty to me is being homeless despite working and your income doesn&#x27;t or barely covers the bills.<p>In the covid case many have lost their income but they have also lost their responsibility to pay the bills.<p>I don&#x27;t say this to be mean nor do I include restaurant owners who have to pay commercial rent while the doors are closed.<p>I say this about kids who moved into their parents second vacation homes but lost income on paper.<p>I feel bad for people who have lost their jobs and have to pay rent. Not so much for people who have lost their jobs and their requirement to pay bills.')
