As a result, React is renderer-agnostic (enabling libraries like React Native, trivial SSR, even rendering to arbitrary APIs like smart TVs), and it’s simple to manipulate those data structures (allowing a variety of abstractions and optimizations that are substantially more complex and error prone when the rendered product is an HTML string or DOM tree).<p>- Quite a lot of common problems can be solved with pure functions (props in, rendered structure out), which are simple to reason about and maintain, and rarely require any advanced knowledge of anything besides HTML&#x2F;JSX.<p>- Static type checking and automated testing of JSX are well supported, and trivial to run without a heavy (eg browser) environment, out of the box.<p>- The proximity of data and rendered structure is easy to reason about, navigate, and validate.<p>I’m sure these qualities can be achieved with other UI frameworks whose default rendered product is templates, and perhaps I underestimate the extent to which they’re priorities in Vue (or Svelte, or any other library not defaulting to JSX), but since they so rarely come up in these comparisons or the other libraries’ elevator pitches, I assume they’re just not high on their priority lists.')
