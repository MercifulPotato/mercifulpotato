Item(by='matsemann', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609874878, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25649008, text='Lets say I pay $2000 each month in mortgage. Some of that is interest that I get to deduct on my taxes. So in practice I pay maybe $1700&#x2F;month, <i>and</i> most of that is really me saving by building equity in my apartment.<p>Before I bought the apartment, however, I paid <i>more</i> than that in rent. And all that was money going to someone else. If anyone deserves a tax break, it&#x27;s those not privileged enough to yet own their own home.<p>Edit: sorry, in my language &quot;rente&quot; is &quot;interest&quot;, so I mixed them up and meant to say I get to deduct the interest part of my mortgage payment in my previous post. Probably where the confusion stems from.')
