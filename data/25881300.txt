If there&#x27;s any chance I might need to leave before 7pm I want to drive my other (not electric) car.<p>On the few days where I need to leave early and can&#x27;t drive the gasoline car (because wife needs it), I spend all afternoon stressing about it and walking to the parking lot every 30 minutes to look for empty spots to get the charging started ASAP so I can get home. Not fun.')
