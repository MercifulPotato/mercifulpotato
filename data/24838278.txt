That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re working on with Retool (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;retool.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;retool.com</a>) It&#x27;s, as you say, a &quot;DB-backed&quot; (or API-backed) front-end builder that&#x27;s designed specifically for engineers. We don&#x27;t store any data, and you can customize the front-end by importing your own React components or by writing JS.<p>(I made it, so feel free to ping me if you have any feedback: david AT retool)')
