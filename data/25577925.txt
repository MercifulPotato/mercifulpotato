No used-up desk space, no ugly earmuffs on the screen, just booming sound coming from the front of this gorgeous, lickable, candy-coloured wonder.<p>We can talk about who did what first in the manner of a check list but that&#x27;s sorely missing the point. A product isn&#x27;t just what it is but how it <i>feels</i> — for <i>every</i> sense.<p>There&#x27;s a reason why Apple uses terms like &#x27;magic&#x27; and &#x27;delight&#x27;. Whilst people deride it as marketing nonsense, every other company fires up their photocopiers, it&#x27;s big enough of a deal.')
