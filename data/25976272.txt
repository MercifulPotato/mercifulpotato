It paints an amazing picture to dispel the narrative that&#x27;s prevalent in the media of Reddit et al. driving the short squeeze. Just as an example from the article, there was a single buy order for 187 million dollars. When Reddit is hailing a young trader with 50 million in assets as the next coming of Jesus (not to downplay him, great job!), it&#x27;s pretty obvious no one from WallStreetBets is capable of making that order. Though that example is only from this week, it&#x27;s evidence of big money being well into this play, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a stretch at all to say much of the short squeeze was engineered by them.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;themargins.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;game-stop" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;themargins.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;game-stop</a>')
