Facebook has her thoroughly filter bubbled, and it&#x27;s sad and worrying. I don&#x27;t know how to wean her off the Facebook brain-rot. Her ipad is Facebook, and Facebook is the internet.<p>She recently told me she wouldn&#x27;t get a flu shot this year, and I know where she got that idea. I got mad, and gave her a lecture about the insane anti-vax people, and the many ways in which their beliefs are complete bullshit.<p>But my anger wasn&#x27;t at her, but rather frustration that Facebook might indirectly cost her her life.<p>Some days I feel like null routing Facebook on her router. I won&#x27;t do that of course, because it&#x27;s not my job to interfere with her choices. But I&#x27;m becoming increasingly concerned.')
