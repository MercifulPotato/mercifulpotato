Robinhood users are executing a short squeeze on Melvin Capital, who have shorted the stock which gives them an obligation to buy the stock when their short expires at whatever price it exists at. They stock is also &quot;over-shorted&quot; (sorry I&#x27;m not wise in this domain), so they are literally obligated to buy at whatever price the stock is at.<p>The hot potato holders are those who have to cover their short position. Robinhood traders are not these users; no casual retail trader short stocks.<p>tl;dr Robinhood and others are participating in collusion and market manipulation to prevent Robinhood users from finishing a short squeeze which would extract billions from Melvin Capital, who have already received a multi-billion bailout on their ridiculous short position')
