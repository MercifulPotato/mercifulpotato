Using technical measures to artificially limit consumer choice should be illegal.<p>In Canada we have 123ink.ca.  For my Brother printer a set of genuine high yield cartridges is $520.  A completely generic set is $105.  However, they also have their own (Moustache) branded set that&#x27;s $130.<p>I suspect their branded version is just a different sticker on the generic, but I buy the branded version.  If they&#x27;re willing to stamp their name on it and stand behind it that&#x27;s worth $25 (+24%) to me.  A brand name isn&#x27;t worth $415 (+495%) though.<p>These companies have ignored the risk of cheating their customers for a long time and now that customers are getting more informed the same companies think they should be able to force customers keep buying their garbage.  No thanks.  Their downfall should be swift and spectacular (in my dreams -lol).')
