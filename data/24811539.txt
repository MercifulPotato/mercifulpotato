I hope my point still remains though that using &quot;they&quot; as a gender neutral pronoun is a perfectly easy way to be inclusive.<p>&gt; your heteronormative take on the world<p>I mean i am a (cis) gay male, so I don&#x27;t think I have a heteronormative take on the world, but you do you.<p>(acknowledging this comment seems to be puposefully trolly, like a &quot;false flag&quot; troll)')
