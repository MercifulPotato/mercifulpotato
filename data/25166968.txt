Item(by='Tainnor', descendants=None, kids=[25167086], score=None, time=1605920306, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25166519, text='I&#x27;m not arguing for moral absolutism. Both that and moral relativism are deeply flawed.<p>It&#x27;s a fact that different people have different perceptions of morality, but that alone is not a sufficient argument to shut down any debate about ethics.<p>It is our duty as moral individuals to fight for what we think is morally right. And sometimes we will have to compromise.<p>But I&#x27;m tired of having to argue for why LGBT rights are important (something that I really would have hoped would be understood by now), since that is not the point. The point is that OP gave an example of a decision that &quot;would spark an outrage&quot; and I contended that that would be the case because it would be seen by the outraged as an immoral decision.<p>You can&#x27;t take people&#x27;s rights to be morally outraged away from them. You can, at the most, try to argue with those people why the supposedly immoral thing is not actually immoral, but I haven&#x27;t seen anyone here doing that: only people defending the truism that &quot;everyone has different moral standards&quot;. Which... yeah.')
