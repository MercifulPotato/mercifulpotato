Item(by='ThrowawayR2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602394163, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24743019, text='&gt; &quot;<i>Well, their existence as a trans person does, when you reject their own identity and replace it with one you have chosen instead.</i>&quot;<p>The hole in this argument being that one can substitute anything else, no matter how outlandish, into that justification and it fits just as well.  Try substituting &quot;furry&quot; in and ask yourself whether you are willing to add accommodations for people in fursuits.  (And I&#x27;m sorry to pick on furries; the few I&#x27;ve met seem like nice people and are sincere in their identity.)  If we wish to go for a more disturbing example, there is body integrity dysphoria: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Body_integrity_dysphoria" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Body_integrity_dysphoria</a> .   These people are also sincere in their identities.<p>(And for the record, I&#x27;m a liberal and have no problem with trans people.  But the above is just not a compelling argument.)')
