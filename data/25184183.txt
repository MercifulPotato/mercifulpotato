(I too eventually wrote assembly - you had to in those days - but it wasn’t the introduction to programming for anyone I knew.)<p>This led to other things, including the robotics company I started, where we are, as I write this, running JS on an esp32 (among other things), hoping to inspire someone else to discover programming as I did - through play and fun.<p>To me, JS is kinda like basic was when I was a kid. ...the first step on a path that could surely include assembly, ML, distributed systems, robotics, computer vision, etc.<p>But what should step 1 be for kids today? I have a 6 year old, and all I know is she’s growing up in a different world than I did. ;-)')
