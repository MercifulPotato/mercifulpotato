Email is probably the best-known part of the Fediverse. ActivityPub is just a new&#x2F;upcoming technology that&#x27;s as much a part of the Web as RSS.<p>Not everything in the Fediverse is part of the Web: email, mastodon &amp; matrix are examples that exist outside of the Web (though mastodon is mostly Web-based, and there is also webmail, Element webapp, etc.).<p>And obviously, not everything in the Web is part of the Fediverse: mainly Facebook, but also most SaaS out there.')
