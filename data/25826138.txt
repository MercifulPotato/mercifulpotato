I am launching a product soon and can see the value of having a small support group.<p>I have some questions:<p>- How do you form these small groups? like what is the ratio of first time founders vs seasonal founders?<p>- I haven&#x27;t joined any paid membership group before so I would like to see more comments regarding the pricing. Is that in the low&#x2F;med&#x2F;high range?<p>- In your Mastermind Member features, you have &quot;Weekly check-in to hold you accountable for your business goals&quot; are these check-ins automated or there is someone actually doing it?<p>- Same membership, you have &quot;New motivation, ideas, and growth&quot; what does that mean?')
