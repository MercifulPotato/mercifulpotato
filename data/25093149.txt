I&#x27;ve recently started playing games on my old Nintendo 3DS again and discovered that I&#x27;ve lost my Nintendo Network ID password and closed the associated email account. That leaves me in a state where I can&#x27;t log out of the account on the console without losing the associated digital software licenses.<p>Not that that&#x27;s Nintendo&#x27;s fault but I think something like this will be the fate of every account that&#x27;s not used, closed or deleted for a long time and owning your data and software possessions would protect against it.')
