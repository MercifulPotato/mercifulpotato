But, ya know, what might be nice would be a blog post saying &quot;Yes, we&#x27;ve kinda been dicks about this whole thing for the past 10 years, and we want to put aside any differences and animosity, and not have an acrimonious relationship between the two projects. And let&#x27;s talk about what ways we might be able to collaborate despite: (see below)&quot;<p><i>They cannot offer the code of LibreOffice as the copyright to the code belongs to the individual contributors and the licenses are not compatible (in that direction).</i><p>Yes, we&#x27;re all aware. However, nothing stops individual contributors from choosing to dual license their code, and I suspect a subset of LO developers would (surely they&#x27;re not <i>all</i> completely ideologically driven) if the project as a whole made a point of seeking a congenial relationship with AOO. And even if code isn&#x27;t shared from LO to AOO, there are other ways the projects could collaborate for mutual benefit. Although, to be fair, that would have been more true 10 years ago...<p><i>Why won&#x27;t Apache point people to a more up-to-date office suite rather than continue to peddle an old legacy system?</i><p>Why does any project choose to continue to perpetuate itself? LibreOffice have, as you all have pointed out, the larger and more active development community, distro support, etc... why must the insist on this There Can Be Only One mindset where the only satisfactory outcome is the death of Apache OpenOffice?<p>I know there are historical roots behind this whole conflict, and I wasn&#x27;t around for the earliest parts of it, so maybe I&#x27;ll never understand the details. But that&#x27;s why I say, &quot;after all this time, you&#x27;d think...&quot; Surely people aren&#x27;t still bearing grudges even now, over shit that happened like a million years ago (in computer industry years).')
