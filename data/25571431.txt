The point is that it&#x27;s not about Musk. We&#x27;re talking about whether Musk &quot;deserves&quot; his billions in profit and the answer is it&#x27;s not about Musk, and it&#x27;s not about &quot;deserve&quot;. It&#x27;s about all the people who benefit because of the existence of spacex&#x2F;tesla&#x2F;etc, who wouldn&#x27;t benefit if we refuse to pay for the work of intelligent investment (by, say, seizing profits), because that would prevent their existence in the first place.<p>Certainly, if you think you can identify people who are particularly qualified to pick good ideas and make investments in them, it&#x27;s not a bad idea to give them some money (but where do you get that money? hopefully not somewhere with negative externalities such as stealing it from different random business owners). Although structurally it&#x27;s better if the billion itself is given as an investment instead of a gift, because then the person giving the billion has &quot;skin in the game&quot; themselves. Which is basically what I think VCs do, although I don&#x27;t know how effective they usually are.<p>(Yes, this whole thing assumes a regulatory framework where businesses that have negative externalities or are otherwise bad for the world <i>do not</i> make profit. Indeed, companies that use dark patterns or rent seeking tactics to make profit should be legally punished, and if such punishments make them bad investments it&#x27;s a good thing, because it means they were on net bad for the world.)')
