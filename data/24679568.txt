At least in grade school.<p>No, you can&#x27;t infer this conclusion from that paper.<p>Yes, the paper claims that there exists <i>some</i> bias towards girls (from teachers&#x27; grading). And the sentence you quote claims that without that <i>specific</i> bias, the gender gap would be in favor of boys (&quot;12.5% larger&quot;). However, we do <i>not</i> know if this figure is free of bias (IMO, fair to say probably not). Therefore, there might be other biases in STEM in favor of boys that could explain the gender gap in their favor.')
