Hitler actually won a democratic election.<p>&gt;  Just stop it. Take it seriously. This was a failed coup, but still a coup.<p>I think that&#x27;s called a &quot;coup attempt&quot;. Call it whatever you want, it is what is, not what it could have been. Either way, it couldn&#x27;t have been <i>successful</i>, unless it somehow convinced senators to not certify the election, and even then there would&#x27;ve been a <i>legal</i> process ahead.<p>&gt; Historically, failed coups (c.f. Hitler in 1923) often get repeated, successfully.<p>Trump getting legally re-elected in 2024 is of course a possibility. Maybe he&#x27;ll somehow become a real dictator then. If that happens, you&#x27;re allowed to call me &quot;Mr. Chamberlain&quot;.')
