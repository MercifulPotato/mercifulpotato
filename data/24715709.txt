That was my secondary observation regarding the overall issue.<p>Your original comment reads: \n&gt; African Americans are 13% of the US Population. Isn&#x27;t it reasonable to aspire to have at least 13% of African American staff (proportionally adjusted per state&#x2F;city populations)?<p>Your thought experiment does not apply here because it assumes the same percentage of every population desires the same career. That need not reflect what we see in the real world. What if 50% of one race and 10% of another desires a specific career, the outcomes will reflect those numbers.<p>Again, you are ignoring the statement regarding people&#x27;s interests and who they consider role models and what they consider as rewarding. In a world of equal opportunities, humans are still the variables, they will choose what they like. If there is a systemic problem that prohibits a certain race from reaching their aspirations, that is abominable and should be cut out.')
