I had a Tamagotchi which I had for a record amount of time. My niece, about 2 at the time wanted to see it so let her hold it. Within 1&#x2F;2 a second, she squeezed both buttons at the same time and crashed it.<p>My daughter managed to buy 24 hours of football pass with NowTV by pressing the same button repeatedly on the remote within about 5 seconds.<p>So a crash like this doesn&#x27;t surprise me.')
