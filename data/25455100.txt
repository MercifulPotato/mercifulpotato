As you say this infrastructure is important, but it&#x27;s too important to centralise it and put into government&#x27;s hands. If there is a government monopoly you will not be able to shop around, choose best service and will have to deal with<p>* poor service, since there will be no competition and little to no incentives to improve it<p>* lack of privacy, since law enforcements and random officials will absolutely want to have full access (and sure, Google has access to my emails, but I can use Protonmail instead and trust them way more not to abuse this access than I would trust &quot;DMV for email&quot;)<p>* even further centralisation of power - it would be much easier to apply pressure to people doing anything &quot;anti-government&quot; (I believe there are already examples of this with people being cut from all-encompassing WeChat in China, but I don&#x27;t have references at hand)<p>There is also an argument against frivolous expansion of <i>human rights</i> with anything not absolutely necessary or too specific.')
