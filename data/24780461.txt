Which is basically a wo&#x2F;man is basically recognized as the king of their castle. This is where all rights are bestowed. When one enter into public some of those rights have to wane due to nature of now you have other individuals in public. So the law did not view you as king when outside of your property. To accommodate this the concept of privilege&#x27;s arose. You have the right to own a car and to drive it, even drunk on your property. You are extended the privilege to do it via licensing in public. Privilege&#x27;s require responsibility or they can be revoked. The government recognizes the right to self defense of each individual in public or private but it extends the privilege of allowing responsible people the ability to carry a firearm to extend that right of self defense to public places. This is why revoking a CCW permit is not an infringement on your second amendment right, you still have the right to &quot;bare&quot; arms, you are just not extended the privilege of doing so in public. It is generally accepted that the 2A is applicable to small arms &#x2F; personal arms and is why a lot of restrictions on small arms get ruled unconstitutional, because they go against the right to own not the privilege to be in possession of in public.')
