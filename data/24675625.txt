Just because the end result of something is inarguably “stupid” does not mean that any of the things that went into it are “stupid.” To do the Hacker News thing and make a bad analogy to computer science topics in a totally irrelevant thread, this is how I view a lot of stuff people complain about these days (think JavaScript, or Electron apps.) Real life is hard.<p>To be a bit more concrete, consider the following: if you have a system where people are not encouraged to follow the rules as written, they will work against the <i>spirit</i> of what is written <i>as well as</i> what is actually written. If you have a system where people are discouraged from <i>not</i> following the rules, they may still engage in things that do not follow the spirit or written rules, but there is some accountability. But you can also try to work around what’s written to follow the intent as well, and I think that is where you get weird, counterintuitive, “stupid” results that can still “make sense” (as opposed to clearly corrupt cases where it is “stupid” and also does not make sense.)<p>I think people, especially literal minded as many here are, prefer concrete rules. But the knock-on effect is that its not easy to simply proclaim they’re made up any time it’s inconvenient, and it really shouldn’t be. Perhaps, in fact in my opinion, definitely, the “escape hatches“ for when rules don’t work out practically are broken, but I still do prefer having rigid standards, especially for health.<p>Hopefully, although it is probably not going to happen, organizations can have some postmortem-style reflections on what went wrong, so that hopefully next time we can be better prepared. History loves repeating though, so, you know.')
