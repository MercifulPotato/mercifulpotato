I really enjoyed using the randomised search&#x2F;result and getting some interesting things to read.<p>What was really fun though was checking out the HTML source code: check out those capital letters and tables! Damn!<p>I remember having an HTML book as a kid. My mother thought I was so smart. Now I can barely slap together the trash we call HTML, CSS and JS these days. I have to copy&#x2F;paste and fiddle and that&#x27;s the best I can do!<p>I miss how simple tables were. Maybe I&#x27;m missing something of today&#x27;s tech?')
