RT performance is mediocre, not that I mind much. Relying on L3$ doesn&#x27;t appear to have affected tail latencies, but I&#x27;ll look to more detailed reviews. Availability is a concern. The real launch is on the 25th when partners can release their cards. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll sell out quickly for 2 months.<p>Edit: I should say that I recommend Gamers Nexus for really detailed reviews, despite being mostly video these days. They are really serious about their methodology. They have detailed information about quality of life things like power draw, fan speed ramping, noise, noise-normalized thermals, etc. They go overboard with cold plate flatness and mounting pressure measurements, teardowns, and PCB VRM analysis for the electrical engineers&#x2F;overclockers out there.')
