For me, it&#x27;s not a good user experience if I have to click a button on toolbar, that opens a popup, to click through categories, and select a shape. That is too many clicks. Why aren&#x27;t they just open on the left side or somewhere, especially making it easier to select in widescreens. Keyboard shortcuts fix this, but there&#x27;s a learning curve.<p>2. If I have to create 5 different box shapes with different colors, I have to go through that process 5 times. Yes, I can create it once and duplicate it multiple times, but there should be a recently used shapes or something that makes it easier to pick. Google slides has the same issue. Keyboard shortcuts fix this, but there&#x27;s a learning curve.<p>3. When creating a shape, I like to drag it vs. click it and have it show up on the canvas. There is no drag option in Pitch.<p>4. Connecting two shapes using an arrow&#x2F;line should be possible from the shape on the canvas, and not by creating a new line&#x2F;arrow and dragging their endpoints to connect the shapes.<p>Edit: fixed typo')
