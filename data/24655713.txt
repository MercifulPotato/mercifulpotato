Its definitely tedious, but its solder-free and surprisingly reliable.<p>Its more expensive than soldering however: wire-wraps are best on header-pin posts, not on the ICs directly. So you should buy sockets-to-wirewrap posts if you plan to wire-wrap. You can wire-wrap on the IC directly, but its definitely not as reliable so I can&#x27;t recommend the practice.<p>If we&#x27;re talking about these small designs with only a dozen or two connections, wire-wrap is more than sufficient. Besides, you can still largely use a soldered Veroboard for most of your design, and just use the occasional wire-wrap for a harder to handle point-to-point connection.<p>Some beginner tutorials:<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackaday.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;12&#x2F;18&#x2F;wire-wrap-101&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackaday.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;12&#x2F;18&#x2F;wire-wrap-101&#x2F;</a><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.sparkfun.com&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;working-with-wire&#x2F;how-to-use-a-wire-wrap-tool" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.sparkfun.com&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;working-with-wire&#x2F;how-t...</a><p>I think having a few wire-wrap tools will help out a low-cost hobbyist. I&#x27;d estimate $50 in various parts (wire-wrap wire, a few dedicated wire-wrap sockets), but its largely &quot;compatible&quot; with soldering and DIP components.
