It&#x27;s also valuable in making people aware of the problems. If you feel like <i>you</i> have read enough about the problems already, congrats, you&#x27;re informed enough that you&#x27;re not the intended audience.<p>And if someone&#x27;s tiredness is, as you apparently believe, the most important criterion for whether something gets written, allow me to point out that I&#x27;m tired of the &quot;don&#x27;t bring me problems, bring me solutions&quot; routine. I associate it with bad, authoritarian managers. And I think it&#x27;s even less justifiable when the complainer a) isn&#x27;t who the article was addressed to, and b) is complaining about a problem without offering a solution.')
