We used to spend a lot on basic needs like food and shelter, 3&#x2F;4 of the average income on food, and more money on bread alone than on housing (IIRC, 19thC rich countries). As growth&#x2F;technology made these cheaper, or if you prefer, made us so rich that they can be had for a tiny fraction of our income, we spend it on other things.<p>Many of these are status competitions -- it&#x27;s the location of your house that&#x27;s expensive, not the drywall, and that&#x27;s an auction against others who also want it. Education in these graphs is arguably like that too -- what&#x27;s expensive is a top name, rare connections; the actual knowledge is very close to free.<p>Healthcare isn&#x27;t a status competition. But it does increasingly seem like it&#x27;s possible to spend an unlimited amount of money on it -- why not try a million-dollar cancer treatment if you can (somehow) afford it? None existed in Maslow&#x27;s time partly because the science hadn&#x27;t advanced, but also because there were too few potential customers. As a society, it isn&#x27;t crazy to think that this should be a growing proportion of what we buy. If you think it should be a decreasing slice of the pie, then what exactly should be increasing, over the next 50 years? (Although obviously I&#x27;m aware of the ways in which how we buy it is deeply broken.)')
