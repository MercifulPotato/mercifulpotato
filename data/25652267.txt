I’ve found both tobacco and coffee to be extremely addictive and habit-forming, as well as various other mixtures of caffeine and MAOIs (e.g. energy drinks bombed to hell and back with flavonoids).<p>Pure nicotine (ecigs) and pure caffeine, on the other hand, are much easier to keep in check or quit.<p>The craving to take a puff from an ecig is almost nonexistent compared to the massive drive to get cigarettes. I would walk miles for them just to light one up.<p>Same goes for energy drinks. They are addictive as hell, but the addiction is not caused by caffeine alone — rather, the massive interaction between monoamine oxidase inhibition and caffeine’s stimulant effects.')
