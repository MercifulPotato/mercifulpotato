It takes money from the pockets of people who would prefer to keep it. So these costs are ruthlessly optimized down to minimum. If printing or transporting bills could be made free, financial institutions would jump at it. Meanwhile, in Bitcoin, burning energy is a core part of securing the network, and it&#x27;s being periodically adjusted towards <i>more</i> waste. If mining could be made free, the network would collapse.<p>These points paint a quite different <i>trajectory over time</i> for Bitcoin&#x27;s energy use vs. fiat energy use. And it seems to pan out.')
