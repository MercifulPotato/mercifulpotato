However, you have to understand that Rust is a new language. Rails was first released in 2004 (and used in production before that) and Django in 2005. On the other hand, actix-web was first released in 2017, and the language itself went 1.0 just 5 years ago. The Rust web ecosystem is very young, and while there is a lot of work going on in this space, these things take time. Don&#x27;t be too quick to judge - it doesn&#x27;t make sense to write off Rust for mainstream web development yet.')
