I’m grateful to be living here during Covid.<p>Taiwanese people aren’t obedient. You should see how they drive.<p>They wear masks without flaking out about it as slavery or being against their will or whatever nonsense you guys are on about back home in the west.<p>Taiwanese people are couch potatoes and extremely reserved. They don’t really want to meet new people or hang out with strangers.<p>Also the government here didn’t play games in the early weeks. No wait and see business as usual lazy bullshit like in the\n US. They check tour temperature everywhere, mall entrances, restaurants, government buildings.<p>The us most certainly should copy Taiwan.')
