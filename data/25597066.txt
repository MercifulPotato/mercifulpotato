Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=[25597105, 25597120], score=None, time=1609448425, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25596972, text='<i>&gt; this person is watching his close family commit a slow-motion trainwreck, and he&#x27;s asking for ways to prevent it or mitigate it</i><p>And my point is that talking about &quot;lies&quot; <i>will not do that</i>. In order to prevent or mitigate the trainwreck, he would have to convince his family to <i>fundamentally change which sources of information they trust</i>. That&#x27;s a very, very hard thing to do, but telling people that their beliefs are &quot;lies&quot; doesn&#x27;t help at all; in fact it makes it even harder.<p><i>&gt; Imagine berating a someone who got lost in the woods and has been lost for days and is starving, for not having the right map or not following the trail, or debating the legitimacy of hiking for recreation at all, instead of feeding him or giving him water.</i><p>False analogy. The person who is lost for days and is starving <i>knows</i> he is starving and needs help; he doesn&#x27;t have to be convinced to eat. So of course there&#x27;s no need to change anything fundamental about his beliefs.<p>The family in question, however, <i>does not know they have a problem</i>. Imagine a person who has been lost for days and is starving, but <i>says they are perfectly fine and refuses to accept food or water, no matter how hard you try, and won&#x27;t even let you force food or water down their throat but violently attacks you when you try</i>. Now what do you do?')
