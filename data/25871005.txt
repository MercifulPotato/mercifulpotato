In one case, we&#x27;re trying to convert an existing project to use them, and... it&#x27;s a bit of a pain, but it&#x27;s not ULID&#x27;s fault as much as just... changing primary keys all over the place is time consuming and not simple.<p>The biggest pushback (and it&#x27;s not a terribly big one, imo)  I&#x27;ve read on ULID is that the time portion is sold as &#x27;sortable&#x27; but is &#x27;only ms-level resolution&#x27;.  Apparently the critics I was initially reading on ULID needed sub millisecond accuracy, and somehow thought this made ULIDs bad.  Seemed a non-useful criticism, as needing that level of time granularity isn&#x27;t a day to day issue for most people, but might be something to be aware of if the idea of overloading one field with multiple uses is a requirement you have.')
