They get a truck of toilet paper from the paper mill, and a truck of coffee from the roaster to the warehouse. What goes out of the warehouse is a 2 trucks to two different stores, each with half coffee, half toilet paper.<p>I&#x27;m grossly simplifying the above, but the idea should be clear. WalMart doesn&#x27;t store things in their warehouses so much as take them off of trucks and put a different mix of thing on other trucks. There is lots of room for automation, but it will look very different from Amazon.')
