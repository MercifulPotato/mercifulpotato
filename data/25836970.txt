I have cut trips short because of that.<p>It happened so often I quit using hiking trails and that I can kind of thank them for because I&#x27;d been leery of bushwhacking far off trail and getting lost.<p>I had to sharpen my mapping skills and learn how to remember how to get back to my starting point. That was actually pretty easy once I put it in practice and now with a topo map and compass I always know where I am so I can wander aimlessly in our forests for days, which are the same forests the author talks about blistering her feet.<p>I&#x27;ve been hiking here for over 30 years and never blistered my feet. And I wouldn&#x27;t consider myself to be anything but stupid if I did.<p>Had she taken the time to get off trail and explore the &quot;hills and hollers&quot; here she could have wrote about the stunning beauty everywhere you go no matter what direction you take.<p>Instead she told everyone how miserable it was but she was tough enough to take it and you should learn how to &quot;suffer&quot; too.<p>If you really want to learn how to suffer come here and hike those trails in the summer and don&#x27;t use any bug repellent. The ticks and chiggers will give you a serious lesson in suffering and it&#x27;ll last at least a couple weeks after you&#x27;ve left.')
