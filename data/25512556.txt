Is the Ethernet standard lagging, or lack of interest&#x2F;demand, or some more physical barrier?<p>10-gige is already cheap and 40-gige is coming down in price. There is just no need for it at home. I have my house wired with 10gige, and &gt; gigabit fiber internet, and literally canâ€™t notice when switching to wireless. 500 mbps should be enough for anyone.')
