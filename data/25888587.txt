It&#x27;s only too generous if there is a low-cost way to incrementally transition to 3, as is normally the case with language updates.<p>Python 2-&gt;3 was a poorly managed update that did not follow normal upgrade rules, so the &quot;normal&quot; rules don&#x27;t apply.<p>It is still often very extremely expensive to convert python2 to python3. Normally you could upgrade in small steps, maybe a file or library at a time, instead of changing everything simultaneously including all transitive dependencies. That problem continues to be denied, so python2 continues to be used. I say that as someone who has converted code from 2 to 3. Python3 is fine, it&#x27;s the huge unnecessary transition cost that is not. It&#x27;s gotten a little better, but not a lot better.<p>This makes it worse. Now it&#x27;s even harder to incrementally update, making it even harder to switch to 3.')
