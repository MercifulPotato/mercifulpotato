Depending on your exact location. This is because of how RF channels are bonded together by the CMTS operator.<p>lots of other access technologies will face significant challenges and capacity constraints if a sizeable percentage of residential broadband end users start trying to actually <i>use</i> their upstream bandwidth at a greater rate than they do now, when averaged over the traffic for hundreds or thousands of individual end point users.')
