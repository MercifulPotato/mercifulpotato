It’s a misnomer.<p>There is a 100% chance of everyone needing healthcare in the future.  US health insurance does a few things:<p>1) premiums partially serve as a tax to transfer wealth from young and healthy to old an sick<p>2) insurers healthcare recipient from the big costs (over out of pocket maximum - $7k to $13k per year), subject to in network providers<p>3) Negotiates pricing and determine appropriate level of healthcare, I.e. acts as informed agent for uninformed buyers<p>The last one is controversial, but it’s funny since people complain about high insurance premiums and then also complain about insurance companies denying what might be frivolous charges by healthcare providers.')
