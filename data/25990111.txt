I think almost all non-deprecated C stream function give you the string length (or bits received rather).<p>The reasons are multiple: its faster to use write() than printf() (and you don&#x27;t have to flush to synchronize), its way harder to exploit, and easier to move around in different buffers. And i got to wrote my own string library during my project, and that was fun.')
