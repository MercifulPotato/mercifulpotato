There are something like 50 mines supplying the entire global uranium industry [0]. And I happen to know Australia quite well, 3rd biggest uranium supplier globally with 2 active mines and one reprocessing old waste heaps. More than half our production comes from a mine that isn&#x27;t even a uranium deposit, it is really a copper mine [1]. That is a top 3 global uranium producer - a uranium mine, a copper mine and an old dump. Good luck supplying the production of a serious number of solar panels with that sort of mining setup.<p>There are no issues associated with uranium mining. The industry is too small.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_uranium_projects" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_uranium_projects</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Olympic_Dam_mine" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Olympic_Dam_mine</a>')
