Currently in day 5 of &quot;having trouble breathing&quot;. I&#x27;m going to paste my comments&#x2F;experience from a different forum below:<p>I currently have coronavirus. I&#x27;m a young male in my 20s (don&#x27;t want to divulge too much info), 6&#x27;1&quot;, 170 lbs, non-smoker, rarely drink, pretty healthy. Waiting on test results.<p>Started off about 2 weeks ago, rash on my chest, lots of night sweats and chills. Didn&#x27;t think it was covid at first. given the weird symptoms. I did not feel too sick, in general. Slight fever, slight cough and sore throat. For most of the time, it felt mild. Still have the rash, night sweats, and sore throat at the moment.<p>However, 4 days ago I started having issues breathing. I felt out of breath multiple times throughout the day, and at times it was hard to even suck in air (like my diaphragm was calcified or something). I woke up a few times at night, trying to suck in air. Today was better but the difficulty breathing is still there. I realized today, that even though it&#x27;s not as bad as the worst flu I&#x27;ve had, it involved a symptom (difficulty breathing in air) that I have never experienced. Not with strep, not with the flu. This is something to note for everyone, in my opinion.<p>I think it&#x27;s both milder AND worse than people think it is - I&#x27;m a healthy young male who exercises and eats well, and yet I&#x27;m having trouble breathing. This is a symptom that has continued for multiple days, and while it hasn&#x27;t gotten worse, it&#x27;s not getting much better. The rash is still there, my throat&#x27;s still sore. If you are part of the obese&#x2F;overweight American population (35% of us, including my family), and are a chronic smoker&#x2F;drinker, and have chronic conditions (diabetes, hypertension, mental health conditions), I think you should still be careful.<p>Unless you have a respirator, there isn&#x27;t anything you can take to resolve &quot;difficulty breathing&quot;. It&#x27;s not like fever&#x2F;sweats&#x2F;nausea - where you can just take a Nyquil and it&#x27;s all gone. Not to mention, we have antibiotics and antivirals to attack the flu&#x2F;cold&#x2F;strep infections as well. Covid&#x27;s a bit different - difficulty breathing can only currently be helped by equipment that&#x27;s located in hospitals. There isn&#x27;t some magic pill that will get your diaphragm pumping up and down again. This is something to note, in my opinion.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how much longer my symptoms will continue. The initial symptoms started 2 weeks ago, but the breathing related ones only started recently. I hope it gets resolved soon - I may provide a comment as an update.<p>Please wash your hands, avoid touching your face&#x2F;eyes with your hands, socially distance if you can, and wear a mask when in public. Having trouble breathing is no joke.')
