In that analogy, the surface of the balloon itself is the entire universe. It is a two-dimensional universe. Imagine that there is no other space except for that surface of the balloon. No emptiness inside and no space outside that it&#x27;s &quot;expanding into&quot;.<p>The entire space is the infinitesimally thin surface which is the balloon surface, yet it is still expanding. Dots on that surface that used to be X distance apart are now &gt; X distance apart in the future. That is all you would know and be able to measure.')
