The former Ocean Odyssey (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Odyssey_(launch_platform)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Odyssey_(launch_platform)</a> was used as a launch platform for a time after it was damaged by a blowout. (I had a very small part in the original drilling rig design.)<p>Semi-submersible rigs, of which this is an example, basically flood ballast tanks in lower pontoons to sink lower in the water for stability and then use typically 8 anchors to keep the rig in place. You can also use dynamic positioning although I think that was only used on drillships when I was involved.')
