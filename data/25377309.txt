Here&#x27;s the speed chart: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.jottacloud.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;articles&#x2F;3271114-reduced-upload-speed" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.jottacloud.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;articles&#x2F;3271114-reduced-uplo...</a><p>So for 24TB you would use two accounts, assuming they&#x27;re fine with that, and your uploads would run at 5Mbps per thread, with 12 threads in parallel.<p>That will let you upload 100GB every 4 hours, which should be enough.  And the total cost would be 180EUR&#x2F;year, which is pretty far from $1000.')
