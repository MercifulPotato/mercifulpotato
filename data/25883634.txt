One challenge there is that users will often get a DataFrame back (e.g. from pd.read_csv), so it requires a lot of casting to the child class.<p>Right now, a compromise I&#x27;ve been exploring is just attaching siuba&#x27;s DF functions to a pandas DataFrame, e.g. df.siu_mutate(...). This seems to be what pandas wants people to do [1]! One obstacle here is that the DataFrame has 300+ methods, which can be overwhelming to learners.<p>I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time wondering whether the piping syntax feels like too much vs chaining. It&#x27;s still an open question in my mind, so it&#x27;s really helpful to hear what feels most natural!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pandas.pydata.org&#x2F;pandas-docs&#x2F;stable&#x2F;development&#x2F;extending.html#registering-custom-accessors" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pandas.pydata.org&#x2F;pandas-docs&#x2F;stable&#x2F;development&#x2F;ext...</a>')
