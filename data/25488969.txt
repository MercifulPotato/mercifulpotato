Marbley of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio wrote that the law did not apply to Mr. Thompson, because his case concerned “objects of economic value.”<p>“The utility of Mr. Thompson’s assets as evidence is almost beside the point; it is the economic value of the treasure that the Court seeks,” Judge Marbley wrote. “Mr. Thompson was therefore not merely ordered to testify or provide information.”<p>Mr. Golden said the case had become “a personality thing between individuals.”</i>')
