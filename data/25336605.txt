UEFI boot, NVME root disk. Windows would boot the installer, but would refuse to install. Disabling UEFI would cause it to install but there were issues so I had to bite the bullet and keep trying UEFI.<p>I had to install linux(because Windows recovery is terrible and can&#x27;t do much), fiddle around with pre-creating a partition table on the format it wanted, and then eventually got it to work. Don&#x27;t ask me how, I spent hours trying every combination under the sun. Windows error messages are very cryptic and not at all helpful.')
