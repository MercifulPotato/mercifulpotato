These people have a grotesque amount of influence over everything.<p>Yes, I’m not arguing against redistribution of wealth (or power or influence or whatever you want to call it).  I’m interested in the details of how it can be accomplished.  Money is simply the most technologically advanced way we have of moving “power” around, but exactly how power gets converted to money is a big question, and one that frequently involves winners and losers.<p>&gt; As I said, even if you&#x27;d just destroy all their wealth&#x2F;power, you&#x27;d still get a better society,<p>I agree, and typically this has been accomplished with violence&#x2F;war.  I’m just trying to see if anyone has any good (and “fair”) ideas on how to accomplish it without violence.<p>I have an aunt and uncle in SF Bay Area who worked their whole life and saved for retirement, but didn’t assume that the land under their house would be worth $2.5M in their old age.  What should happen to them?  They certainly don’t have the cash flow to afford a proportionate property tax without having to move away.  I don’t know a good answer either, maybe some people just have to end up screwed.')
