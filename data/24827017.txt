Item(by='Zenst', descendants=None, kids=[24827067], score=None, time=1603119974, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24826245, text='My postulation was based upon how they dropped the 1GB model of the Pi4 as it did not sell as well as the other models and was able to furfill it&#x27;s role with lowering the price of the 2GB model, which happened about a year after the initial release.<p>It is perfectly viable for them to shift to socketed eMMC and still accommodate all available flavours.  But then how they sell will set that and if out say 99% of sales are for only 5 models and a socketed eMMC consolidate the offerings whilst still providing exact compatibility with the initial guaranteed offerings, then I still would not rule out such a change a year on, once they see what flavours do sell.<p>That was the basis of my comment - nothing more, nothing less.')
