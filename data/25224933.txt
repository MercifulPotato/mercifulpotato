There has been dramatic improvements in both the theoretical and applied elegance over the years, partly just out of implementation experience.<p>Back then, it was a bit of a “blind men and the elephant” case with some really interesting computer science constructs. Now we have a pretty pure theoretical model of the elephant, and so an elegant implementation is not the sum of what the blind men would have described. Much more capability, far fewer lines of code, albeit completely opaque to someone that doesn’t understand what they are looking at.')
