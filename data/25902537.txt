However the min&#x2F;max bars were <i>huge</i>: a badly becalmed crossing might stretch to six months (with a high risk of malnutrition en route, living off ship&#x27;s biscuit and pickled meat), while the fastest sail crossing was around 12 days (a fast clipper with a very favourable wind). 2 months was the norm, and the hull loss rate meant it wasn&#x27;t for the faint of heart: IIRC about 5% of ships never made it to port.')
