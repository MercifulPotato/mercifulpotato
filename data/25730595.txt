Item(by='usrusr', descendants=None, kids=[25731691], score=None, time=1610380559, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25729683, text='I really don&#x27;t get what they would be missing though: &quot;foreign&quot; (e.g. internet) brands would usually be rejected before that price hike anyways (unless workshop capacity is <i>desperately</i> idle) and preferred customers (qualified by bike purchase) could still be offered arbitrary service discounts. Is it really just the old bait and switch of offering to service a clunker for the price of a hamburger and then suddenly realizing that the bike is impossible to salvage if the customer happens to be not utterly wrong size for that unloved bike that has been clogging inventory for three years?')
