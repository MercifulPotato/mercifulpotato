Secondary requirement is that it should be smooth.<p>I bought Baoke gel from Amazon and while I loved it a lot, was greatly disappointed to find it was of Chinese make.<p>Am now searching for something thatâ€™s of non-Chinese origin. So far, I have zeroed in on Uni-ball impact 1.0mm gel pen, and am shortlisting their 0.7mm gel pens as well. I would also give uni-ball 1.0mm and 0.7mm ballpoint pens a try as well in case I feel gel pens get used up faster, since always carrying a backup refill can be an inconvenience.Also, TCO with gel pens is always more than ballpoint pens.<p>Does anyone have any suggestions in mind?<p>Please proffer')
