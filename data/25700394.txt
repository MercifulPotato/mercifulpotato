If he doesn&#x27;t like signal is run he should do the work of running an alternative. Do the work of building something or shut the fuckup.<p>What&#x27;s more, Moxie, created audio books of many well known anarchists texts, it&#x27;s not something an authoritarian would do.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.audioanarchy.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.audioanarchy.org&#x2F;</a><p>Moxie made signal work because he chose to ignore all the security &#x27;experts&#x27; who keep insisting on unusable software. Use briar or the fully p2p version of matrix if you don&#x27;t like signal. Or use the code Moxie has given to the public to adapt signal to your needs.  He did 99% of the work for you.')
