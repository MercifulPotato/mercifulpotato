OLEDs support full conversion to red-only light, allowing you to preserve your night vision. No other app or built in implementation except f.lux and cf.lumen allow for turning all colors off except red. This is the main reason that I jailbreak my android phone (a oneplus). Not ad blocking, not side loading apps, but because I want to not get my eyes destroyed every night when I try to go to the bathroom and use my phone as an impromptu flashlight...<p>What the fuck guys?
