However &quot;Free Speech&quot; does not entitle people to Freely Lie. As we have seen the wrong words from the right person can cause the loss of life. The police officer did not deserve to die to further the political ambitions of a few morally&#x2F;ethically bankrupt individuals.\nParler can recreate itself on another platform if they wish. Gab is still up. It is just as disgusting. The Constitution only guarantees that Congress shall pass no laws prohibiting free speech. The last time I checked Amazon or Twitter cannot pass legislation.<p>Free speech is prevented by the use of force. We held an election. The results where not what some people liked. They tried to cancel the people&#x27;s voice. That is the real speech suppression here.')
