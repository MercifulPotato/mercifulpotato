Item(by='luord', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610030662, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25646180, text='I&#x27;ve tried not to comment on political articles because I feel nothing can come off it, and also in part because I fear that anything I said, no matter how innocuous, could eventually be deliberately misinterpreted as a way to harm me. But after reading over half the comments to this post, I&#x27;m making an exception.<p>It seems like at least half of the users of HN are perfectly happy with censorship, and all the usual paternalistic justifications of it (&quot;the people just don&#x27;t know better, so &#x27;better informed people&#x27; should decide what information they have access to&quot;, &quot;giving people access to more information might push them further to extremes&quot;[1], etcetera) were used in this thread[2]. Given that this was one of the few communities in the internet I held in high regard, that realization was sobering.<p>Well, I had noticed that narrative before, but until now it seemed to be a minority. In these comments that opinion was far more prevalent.<p>[1]: This is the one I dislike the most; I think that nothing is quite as effective for causing or widening a divide between people than siloing and restricting the information they have access to; it leads people to only get information with which they already agree.<p>[2]: What&#x27;s worse, to me, is that the narrative is also defended with the usual justification that it&#x27;s not censorship that&#x27;s being argued for, and that it&#x27;s actually in defense of private corporations&#x27; free speech, because they should get to control whatever it&#x27;s posted in their platforms. But the thing about that is not only that it ignores that those private corporations control an outsized portion of public discourse, so the defense is a distinction without a meaningful difference, but also because usually the narrative in <i>other</i> issues is to criticize and want to break off those very same companies. Apparently, when it comes to this particular issue, then suddenly large corporations need HN users defending them. Ultimately, it just makes it seem like large corporations are a useful tool to promote censorship while allowing the person arguing in favor of it to say that it&#x27;s not really censorship what&#x27;s being promoted.<p>I hope I&#x27;m wrong.')
