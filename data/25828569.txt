If your business email, SCM, DNS, CDN, storage, backups, compute, CI&#x2F;CD, data warehouse&#x2F;BI, desktop compute... all come from one company (e.g. AWS, MS, or GCP), then you can lose *everything* in a flick of the pen.<p>When you do risk assessments (e.g. SOC 2), you rank all your venders by risk, and answer &quot;what could I do if I lost vendor X?&quot; These are things a business is supposed to do, which is why many intentionally have more than one vendor for the same service, run hybrid cloud, etc when the answer to that question is &quot;close my business.&quot;')
