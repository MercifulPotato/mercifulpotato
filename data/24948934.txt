I&#x27;m not trying to be rude. I&#x27;m not trying to bark at you. If I&#x27;m failing to get all the info, it&#x27;s not for lack of trying or being too lazy or disrespectful to pay attention. I&#x27;m just doing the best I can right now and the best I can isn&#x27;t that great.&quot;<p>And that&#x27;s usually not how it gets interpreted so I do a lot less of that than I used to do.')
