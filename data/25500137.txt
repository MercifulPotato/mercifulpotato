Specifically, even as a layman, it&#x27;s clear that observation and model are being conflated.<p>Cosmology is a science in the broadest sense of being a field of human knowledge, but it isn&#x27;t a science the way that, for example, physics is. It would better be described as a phenomenology[1]. I&#x27;m sure many will disagree with this factually more accurate description, because of the emotional role their ideation of science plays in their lives, but I believe it has greater intellectual utility and that a phenomenology can even be of greater value than an experimental science. This framing helps us understand that we should spend less time on trying to come up with dubious &quot;natural experiments&quot;[2] and more on the collection and publication of data in useful formats. And most of all, to be absolutely clear what the assumptions of the model are, even the most trusted ones, because they may well prove incorrect. But maybe this is just an issue in the popular press?<p>[1] &quot;A description or history of phenomena.&quot; (not the definition from what we now call philosophy)<p>[2] Which aren&#x27;t experiments at all because selection isn&#x27;t control.')
