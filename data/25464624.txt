Some missions are great as well. But now I’m not really sure if I will even finish it. It doesn’t really feel meaningful.<p>Also  even though there are some explicit sex scenes (but so few I’m not sure why they are there), it is really not edgy at all. It’s like a corporation designed the game which is everything cyberpunk is not supposed to be.<p>There are a ton of great ideas in there, but then someone realized it would take too long so they half assed everything.')
