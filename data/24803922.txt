But they&#x27;re still made of components (including radicals) arranged in horizontal and vertical orders.<p>I would have assumed that dyslexia would be just as much of a problem regarding the ordering of components <i>within</i> characters. Anyone have any idea why it&#x27;s apparently not? Or is the article wrong?')
