If you look in the xorg code base, you will find that it&#x27;s separated into components called DDX and DIX. DIX (Device-Independent X) handles protocol and server state; DDX (Device-Dependent X) does the drawing. One of the back ends in the DDX code is for Wayland; when you compile Xorg with just this back end, you get Xwayland.<p>So if Xorg gets abandoned -- oops! There goes Xwayland as well. I do believe that this was the plan all along: keep Xwayland around as a solution for &quot;legacy applications&quot; for a while, then stop supporting X altogether to make it less attractive as a back end for new applications and toolkits.')
