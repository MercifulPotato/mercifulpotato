In some ways, it makes it better, because I can be proud of what we&#x27;re doing. But it also makes it harder to take time off or set those boundaries, because I know that every day I&#x27;m not on call, somebody else has to be. Every day that I&#x27;m not doing work delays improvements and makes the rest of the team&#x27;s lives harder.<p>I try very hard to stop my normal workday at 8-9 hours and to not put in extra time on the weekends, but it&#x27;s difficult to balance my own needs with both the needs of my co-workers and also with the demands of the work we&#x27;re doing.')
