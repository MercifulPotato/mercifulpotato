It&#x27;s one that describes a particular program solving a particular task under a particular configuration. I&#x27;ve done no analysis on this myself, but I would be more than willing to believe that a CPU-bound job might be only a CPython-to-MyPy&#x27;s worth of speedup away from instead being memory- or disk-bound.<p>It can be hard to tell the difference, too, since being stalled out while waiting on the memory controller shows up as CPU activity in htop.')
