My investments grow in that way, but my expenses do not. I don&#x27;t think lifestyle inflation compounds in this way.<p>For example, if I start buying slightly nicer coffee this year.. I don&#x27;t continuously keep buying nicer and nicer coffee. I buy $7&#x2F;lb coffee now and that will definitely not compound into $22&#x2F;lb in 30 years from a 4% yearly increase.<p>A much better way to look at it is net new purchases. For example, my 2002 corolla is paid off so its nearly free to drive. If I get a raise I might justify buying a new car. Now this is a significant expense that the author should look at.')
