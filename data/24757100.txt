It works really well<p>In what way does it &quot;work&quot;? What do you actually gain by silencing those people? It seems like you&#x27;re lending them credibility. As in &quot;these things that I&#x27;m saying are so dangerous that the government wants to shut me up!&quot; You can&#x27;t control what people actually believe, you can only control whether or not <i>you</i> hear about it. Using the state to do this for you instead of a block button is dangerous and inefficient.<p>&gt;Free speech has limits.<p>No it doesn&#x27;t. Free speech with limits isn&#x27;t free speech. The simple expression of an idea w&#x2F;o the intent to cause harm to another party, and the sole intention of discourse should be protected no matter what. No matter how distasteful it is, holocaust denial falls into this category.')
