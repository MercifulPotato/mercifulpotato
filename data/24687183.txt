I too develop in feature branches, and then they&#x27;re merged into develop or main (with a merge commit, obviously). Reverting that is too only a single revert. The only problem is that sooner or late those feature branch do get deleted, and if you swashed, you lose all the non-squashed history. If you don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s still in the develop&#x2F;main branch.<p>What do I miss?')
