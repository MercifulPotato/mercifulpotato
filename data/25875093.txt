Item(by='PaulDavisThe1st', descendants=None, kids=[25875441], score=None, time=1611342949, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25874645, text='You need a mic preamp somewhere in the signal chain.<p>Sadly, many manufacturers have been pushing &quot;USB mics&quot;, which bundle the preamp and an analog-&gt;digital converter into the mic body, and they&#x27;ve been very successful at marketing&#x2F;selling these devices.<p>I say sadly because these devices violate rule #1 of digital audio: there should only be 1 sample clock. The moment you start using these mics in combination with any other digital audio stream (e.g. playback via the builtin or some other audio interface), there are now at least 2 sample clocks, creating the requirement that some software layer does resampling to keep things in sync.<p>Much better to just get a cheap &quot;proper&quot; audio interface, skip the USB mic option, and use a &quot;real&quot; (analog) mic.<p>I leave the condenser&#x2F;dynamic question for someone else.')
