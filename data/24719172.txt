Every person I&#x27;ve ever talked to who struggles with this problem is confused over the probabilities, even after we discuss the situation in great detail. They perfectly understand the game and the rules.<p>You seem to be finding flaws where there are none. You are suggesting there is subtle unspoken trickery hidden in the problem (just as in my example) but nothing about the problem suggests that should be the case.<p>What if the host lets you choose to switch every game but if you make the right choice he says you are wrong without opening the door and the game is just over? What if he says the door you chose is eliminated and the remaining door is your prize if you chose correctly? What if you win and then he says you have to play best 2 out of 3 to really win, and if you win again he says 3 out of 5, and keeps moving the goalposts until you lose?<p>Suggesting the problem is flawed because you can imagine up fringe scenarios that are not explicitly excluded does not seem like a useful criticism.')
