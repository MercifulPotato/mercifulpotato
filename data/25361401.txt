FAANG of today are becoming the IBMs and Oracles of the 2030s in my opinion; tired and uncool.<p>Bet on solo founders or small teams (under 5 people) taking non-traditional funding and carving out niches of big players like was done before. These small teams will purposefully stay sustainable (look at Gumroad purging basically their entire team). These non-traditional founders won&#x27;t be getting $10B exits but building stable ventures that have huge profit-to-employee ratios.')
