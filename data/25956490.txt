If we&#x27;re talking about UI elements inside a design system (such as material design), that is a different discussion alltogether. That&#x27;s not even where the OP is about.<p>&quot;The worst thing that there&#x27;s budget allocated for such things&quot; is just offensive and invalidates all the progress that was made in the past decades in the field of HCI.<p>Frankly it&#x27;s dissapointing to see in HN how little understanding there is in what is happening in this field and to see all these passive-aggressiveness towards UX design is frankly demotivating. UX is something that in my opinion is carried by every person that touches the product in some way, it&#x27;s about more than just putting some flows together as a designer and harrassing developers.')
