Just the other day I subbed for Retro Gamer.  It&#x27;s expensive af at $92 with a 20% discount, but worth it, imo.<p>Something about having a physical magazine that&#x27;s an unchangeable snapshot in time is so appealing to me lately.  I have no nostalgia for the Amiga (never had one growing up), but I do have an Amiga 500+ now and love discovering this thing 30 years later.  Community is incredible and the Amiga&#x27;s ongoing development makes it a really fun system to own.<p>Edit: On a side note, I still subscribe to National Geographic Magazine.  If you are interested in that type of content, Nat Geo magazine is just exquisite.  Photography is stunning and the long form articles are usually months&#x2F;years in the making and written beautifully.  It&#x27;s absolutely loaded with substance, even the ads are interesting.  I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough and I think it&#x27;s only $19&#x2F;year.  Paper quality is slightly lower than what I remember as a kid, but that&#x27;s pretty minor.')
