This eventually stabilizes at some equilibrium (likely leading to a weaker chain, if profit is the only motivator).<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that if BTC has seen enough adoption to be sustainable for the next 100 years, there are likely many many stakeholders who could&#x2F;would mine for &quot;altruistic&quot; reasons. E.g. financial institutions and other large holders have incentives to keep the network stable.<p>Hell, maybe by then they get enough people on board for a BTC 2 that&#x27;s some weird Ethereum competitor. It&#x27;s really hard to theorize on that long of a time horizon.')
