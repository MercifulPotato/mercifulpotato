Even options on very safe things like, say, MSFT&#x2F;GOOG&#x2F;AMZN&#x2F;SPY&#x2F;BAC&#x2F;VZ&#x2F;etc can lead your account down to zero, and it mostly depends on how leveraged you are.<p>Suppose you sold puts on Verizon at 55. You are on the hook to buy Verizon at 55. If you have 5500 in equity, you&#x27;re fine. You get the stock and hold it, perhaps wheel it.<p>But if all you do with $5500 in account equity is sell a single put contract, you wont make much money. So most people sell more than they have equity to support. So perhaps you sell <i>three</i> Verizon contracts. Your $5500 in account equity is now on the hook for 3*$5500. If Verizon stock goes down to 36, you are wiped out.<p>Oh, and all this while, you arent capturing any of the Verizon upside either! You only get the premium.')
