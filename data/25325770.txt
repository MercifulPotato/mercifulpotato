Years ago when I started browserless.io, I wanted to find a way to sell access to the core image of ours. Docker kinda has&#x2F;had a marketplace, where you can buy access to curated and secure images, but it didn’t get any support or news on it. Because of this we went the open-code route and just sold licenses. Too bad because I’d much rather have had a marketplace to do this instead.')
