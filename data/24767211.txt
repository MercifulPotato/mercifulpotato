But it does seem a shame that more complex &quot;nth-child&quot; selectors do not just use something more flexible&#x2F;programmable like xpath.<p>As it stands CSS keeps adding one-off selectors such as nth-child, only-child, only-of-type.  Such is the feature creep of web standards as they are, a continual addition of one-off APIs for specific use cases rather than a robust orthogonal programming platform that people can build anything on top of, like WebCrypto instead of adding integers.')
