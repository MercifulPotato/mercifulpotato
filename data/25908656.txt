As for battery life, you&#x27;re probably going to have it plugged into a dummy battery and then a converter and then into the wall. That&#x27;s kind of the funny thing with nicer cameras though, they usually require a little bit more interaction because they have so many capabilities.<p>And for capture cards, yeah the elgato camlink is all you really need- the small form  factor is a plus, too.<p>Sony&#x27;s interface on their camera is pretty awful, it can be hard to navigate and some things need a ton of button presses just to change simple things. However, this clunky interface comes with the benefit of a staggering amount of features that (in general) work better than its competitors. They just have a really good price:performance ratio, a good form factor, best in class autofocus on the a6400+, and a good selection of compatible lenses. It&#x27;s just a really solid generalist that isn&#x27;t missing any important features.<p>I would still recommend a capture card because I feel like it would reduce the potential for overheating- however, I have not tried using the Sony camera link software yet, so maybe it&#x27;s fine.<p>For lenses, it depends on what type of look you want. IMO a lens upgrade is probably the last thing to purchase since you&#x27;re usually looking at a $300+ price tag. For that amount of money, you could have your lighting down pat which will give you a more immediate bonus in quality than a nicer lens would. A basic 16-50 kit lens will perform fabulously with proper lighting, however it will lack significant background blurring and bokeh.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for bokeh and background blurring (as most people are), you want a fast lens with a wider aperture and a longer focal length. However, the more towards that end that you go, the harder it will be to focus on the subject, so you <i>must</i> pair it with good lighting and decent autofocus. For a good idea of what to look for in the mid-low range, a 50mm f1.4 (or f1.8) prime lens should do well.<p>Also a big tip for desktop setups: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7RZeivVQaiM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7RZeivVQaiM</a><p>You can slightly modify a single pole monitor mount and use it as a way to hold cameras, lighting, audio, etc. Here&#x27;s what I have at home: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;ix7xSc1.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;ix7xSc1.jpg</a><p>You can also purchase those twin VESA mount arms on Amazon for like $20, so you can mount a ton of things for relatively cheap.<p>I already have a separate boom arm for audio, but you can see there&#x27;s all sorts of good stuff like a (sort of hidden) camera ball mount and jury-rigged LED panels. I made some reflectors and diffusers in order to make sure I&#x27;m not sending tons of light out behind me, which helps exaggerate that nice background blur and makes me stand out. I also have a light behind me over my head, which lights up the hair and provides a nice effect. Something to light up my room could be useful, but I have big windows with a good amount of indirect natural light.<p>As far as what specific lighting you want- it really just depends. If you&#x27;re willing to spend a little extra time, I would probably avoid ring lights because you can achieve a better effect with LED panels and creative use of diffusers&#x2F;reflectors. Ring lights are a good plug-and-play budget solution, though.<p>-------<p>Now for choosing a specific camera- this is a good thing to google since there&#x27;s a ton of specs and most cameras are pretty similar. IMO you don&#x27;t need in-body image stabilization, so I would leave out the A6500. The A6100-A6300 are so close in price to the A6400 that I&#x27;d prefer the A6400 and say it&#x27;s a choice between the Sony A6000 and the Sony A6400. The A6000 can be had used in the $250 range and is about 85% as versatile as the A6400, so if you don&#x27;t care too much about the absolute bleeding edge fastest autofocus and some other luxuries, then the A6000 is a very solid pick. Plus, it gives you a lot more cash to spend on a lens and lighting.<p>I&#x27;d say make a choice between the A6000 and A6400, and then look up comparisons between your choice and its competitors and see which one looks more solid. I don&#x27;t have much personal experience with brands other than Sony, Canon, and Fujifilm, so most of the time I&#x27;m just googling and comparing features, sensors, etc.<p>Hope this helps!')
