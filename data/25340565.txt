So seems to be a network layer or below issue.<p>Interestingly, the incorrect ASCII chars are always 8 chars higher or lower than their counterpart, indicating that bit 3 is consistently being flipped:<p><pre><code>  flip: f|0b1100110\n  orig: n|0b1101110\n  ---\n  flip: i|0b1101001\n  orig: a|0b1100001\n  ---\n  flip: 6|0b110110\n  orig: &gt;|0b111110\n  ---\n  flip: (|0b101000\n  orig:  |0b100000\n  ---\n  flip: p|0b1110000\n  orig: x|0b1111000\n  ---\n  flip: m|0b1101101\n  orig: e|0b1100101\n</code></pre>\nEdit: Can confirm connecting to VPN (ProtonVPN in this case) solves the issue.')
