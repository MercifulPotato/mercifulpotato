Someone broken in around 12 am and attempted to come into the apartment. I jumped up and ran to the door and stopped them. They clearly had the keys some how because that was door number three to open and get through. Really sketchy.<p>Airbnb was at least cool and gave me a refund and let me move. However, two weeks later I checked and the same apartment was for rent! It&#x27;s clear someone who worked for the owner had a set of keys and was robbing the guests.')
