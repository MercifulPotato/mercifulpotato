They add VAT to everything, then transfer it to HMRC who don&#x27;t complain. I&#x27;ll work with them if we can change it later on.<p>This is my workaround for you not to have to pay VAT: I lower the price by the amount, so the full amount will stay the same for you (even though VAT is added).<p>It&#x27;s not a generic discount: I add it to all EU countries with higher VAT rates. Many of these countries have (e)books without VAT, but Gumroad still adds the VAT.')
