Search for IBS where I live, and the company called IBS here is among the top result. There are also quite different companies called IBS in several neighbouring cities, but those aren&#x27;t shown on the first page. We both know why: One of Google&#x27;s factors is geography.<p>Perhaps IBS is also a relevant abbreviation to your work, and Google can tell that you often search for that, so it&#x27;ll also boost results that pertain to that sense of IBS if you search.<p>None of this is about what you like. One is about where you are, the other is about your work. Perhaps your work interests you, perhaps one may say that your work necessarily interests you, in a compelled sense of &quot;interest&quot;. But it&#x27;s not about preferences or opinions.<p>So you could say, fairly and honestly, that your interests as indicated by search history influences how Google interprets the search term. Returning to the &quot;IBS&quot; example, your search history hints to Google which IBS you have in mind. This is good, not bad, as long as there are more senses of IBS than will fit on the search results page.')
