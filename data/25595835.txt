Item(by='NoodleIncident', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609441160, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25595217, text='Some people think that &quot;roguelike&quot; is a good term for games with no permanent progress, with &quot;roguelite&quot; being the alternative for games like Hades. These people don&#x27;t say these terms out loud to anyone, they just post on the internet about it, so they haven&#x27;t realized why the distinction hasn&#x27;t exactly caught on. Regardless, most people who have played games on both sides of this split can tell that it makes no sense to wish that a game on one side was more like the games on the other side; they&#x27;re just different sub-genres. It&#x27;s like saying that Spelunky has interesting platforming mechanics, but you wish you had a lives system and hand-authored level design. It would just be a different game, made by someone else.<p>In Hades, the majority of the emphasis is on the story and characters, which a lot of people seem to have connected with. This isn&#x27;t a surprise if you look at the devs&#x27; previous games (Bastion, Transistor, Pyre). From that perspective, making a game most people who play won&#x27;t finish would be a bad decision; upgrading your character enough to eventually win is completely intended, it&#x27;s how you are meant to reach the end of the story.')
