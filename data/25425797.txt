This doesn&#x27;t mean that they necessarily violate the 8th Amendment, only that they are subject to it. Unfortunately, almost every state already has such a restriction on their books and it hasn&#x27;t stopped CAFs yet.<p>It&#x27;s likely that another CAF case would result in the court deeming <i>federal</i> CAFs to violate the Sixth Amendment where the CAF is not actually related to a criminal conviction. (This is conjecture based on certain justices&#x27; remarks to the Federalist Society before they were appointed to SCOTUS.)')
