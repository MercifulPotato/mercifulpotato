Which is counter to what most of the teams were used to when deploying services in JavaScript or Ruby. Usually you test like hell, QA, ship, get a few error reports from users, fix them, get one or two a couple months later and fix those... then a year later you change something and get a bunch of new error reports about the feature that used to work... and you fix those.<p>Haskell forced me to address most of those errors before my program would compile. I had to write a few tests but orders of magnitude fewer than I was used to. I shipped fast.<p>I got one report from the customer many months later when I made a mistake due to a miscommunication of requirements. One test case prevented that kind of error happening again inadvertently and shipped in less than an hour. Haven’t heard any reports since.<p>Haskell is my go to where I can get away with it. Absolutely solid stuff.')
