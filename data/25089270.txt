I used to run a Mac.<p>And I&#x27;m not scared, I&#x27;m sad. I would love to have 3 or more open competitive desktop&#x2F;laptop platforms (Windows, Linux and MacOS) but my view is that the release of the M1 makes that not very likely.<p>The M1 is almost identical to the A14, a great chip that was designed for mobile devices. It is designed to run one application at a time, don&#x27;t do much compute or graphics, have a fixed set of memory and no hardware attachments. It does that brilliantly.<p>The problem is that a chip designed for a computer have different priorities. The need for low power consumption is less important. Even in a laptop, after 10h, Id rather take performance then more battery time. In a Computer you want more threads, expandable memory, PCI Gen 4.0, discreet graphics, GPU Compute, Raytracing, support for fast networking (the Mac Mini used to have 10Gig lan), multiple display support, expandable storage, and in a stationary computer preferably you want to be able to upgrade parts.<p>If we look at the M1 compare it to the A14, we can see that Apple has made almost no modifications to the architecture to make it fit in a computer rather then a mobile device. They didn&#x27;t add more cores, they didn&#x27;t add support for PCI, GPUs, Ethernet, or anything else that makes it more like a Computer CPU.<p>Maybe this is besides the point, but to me it was very telling that they didn&#x27;t update the physical design of any of the 3 computers. The thermal envelope of the M1 Should make it possible to make some much sexier designs, then the old designs we where given. It tells me a lot about how Apple allocates its resources.<p>This paired with Apples messaging, tells me that Apple is not interested in making Macs that are competitive with PCs on the things that make you choose to use a computer over a mobile device. It feels to me like Apple has moved to Apple Silicon on the mac because its convenient for them to have a single platform, rather than it being the right design for the products.<p>Apple have neglected the mac and especially the pro segment for a long time. There was always a chance they would get their act together and build reasonably priced, top speced machines, that could compete with Linux and Windows boxes, but with this move, I cant see them put the resources behind their silicon to compete with AMD, nVidia, and Intel when it comes to Performance and features.<p>So, no I&#x27;m not scared, I&#x27;m sad that Apple has taken themselves out of the running.')
