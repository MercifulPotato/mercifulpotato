Our approach is to negotiate the actual security objectives and provide targeted assurances. Some customers are very strict with their requirements, but others are willing to negotiate.<p>We have signed on a publicly-traded entity without having a SOC2 on hand. It&#x27;s not impossible to make a deal happen if the customer really wants your product, and you can somehow prove to interested parties that you wont sink their ship in the process. We achieved this with technical deep-dive sessions which involved our customer&#x27;s IT and security people. Being able to communicate with agility and think outside the box is a good way to get around red tape.<p>For us, the biggest thing our customers seem to be worried about is the continuity of <i>our</i> business relative to support of the product. Offering source code escrow through some 3rd party is a good way to help alleviate some of these types of concerns.')
