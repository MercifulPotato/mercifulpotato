I actually like it.<p>It is not significantly better than a whiteboard, but also not worse. It is probably 100x more expensive though.<p>Edit: it might be cheaper than having someone that make sure that working markers are always available which is a common failure mode of phisical whiteboard. How long this will last we will have to see.')
