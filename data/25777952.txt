I remember the stories where I used to work from a study on soy supplementation done on obese post-menopausal women.  They would insist that all they ate that day was something like a half cup of green beans.  The human mind is far too fallible and prone to deception for any meaningful thing to be gained from food memory.<p>I really only trust studies now where they supplement in a controlled environment and monitor all food intake.  Not surprisingly these studies often show no benefit of the supplementation.')
