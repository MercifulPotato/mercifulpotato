Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=[25235077], score=None, time=1606506577, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25228919, text='In US and Canada, the time zones are named after geographical regions. From east to west, they go Atlantic (UTC-4 in standard time; services Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Labrador), Eastern (US east cost, Canada&#x27;s Windsor-Quebec main population center), Central (Chicago, St Louis, Texas), Mountain (Arizona, Wyoming, Colorado), Pacific (US&#x2F;Canada west coast), Alaska, Hawaii.<p>Most US residents are going to be familiar with these time zones because you are more likely going to have to deal with multiple time zones in this set than any other international time zones. Television shows that announce to the broader country usually announce their times as, say, 11 Eastern&#x2F;10 Central, because they&#x27;ll be broadcast in both Eastern and Central time zones.<p>If I&#x27;m talking to someone in the US, I&#x27;m not going to bother prefixing the timezone with &quot;US&quot; because it&#x27;s implied. But if I were talking to someone international, I&#x27;d be more likely to prefix &quot;US&quot;, as in &quot;this meeting is scheduled for 11:00 US Pacific time&quot;. This formulation has the added benefit of also describing whose daylight savings rule take effect in international settings.')
