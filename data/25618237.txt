If a road is indicated to be a major one, the surface ought to match its heavy use. What&#x27;s more, if you&#x27;ve ever driven in Belgium, or crossed the border from Germany into the Netherlands over a highway while it&#x27;s raining (pervious asphalt, &quot;ZOAB&quot;), you&#x27;ll find that asphalt != asphalt. Driving from Aachen to Nijmegen might be much nicer over Dutch roads than over German ones in the rain, but both would be tagged with the same surface.<p>It&#x27;s a very easy quest so I complete it when I&#x27;m checking the location anyway, but I do find it to be quite a bit less useful than, say, whether a road is lit, which I have been tagging near me because my girlfriend mentioned that she was having trouble planning runs because she doesn&#x27;t know which streets are lit. The lit tag is prioritized below surface data, and road type isn&#x27;t a quest at all.<p>(Ties into a book I&#x27;m reading: <i>invisible women</i>. We&#x27;re not purposefully ignoring them, but men developed the app and we are much less likely to care whether a road is lit when going out after dark. I don&#x27;t actually know why prioritization was set this way, just that I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this bias subconsciously played into it, or perhaps is the reason why there are so few apps that display it.)')
