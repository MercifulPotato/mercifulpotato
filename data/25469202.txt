You had the opportunity and means to change your mentality and become &#x27;intentional&#x27; with your money, and learn how to prioritise your spending, because you&#x27;ve had such a surfeit of wealth compared to the average that you won&#x27;t have faced the same problems others would (and still) have. That&#x27;s fantastic for you, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but for many people it would sound quote tone-deaf.<p>If you can afford to put aside almost 100k a year and still live comfortably you are decidedly not in the class of people for whom saving is, if not an impossibility, a luxury.<p>We&#x27;re not just talking about Pratchett&#x27;s Boots Theorem[1], but also the fact that such people are quite literally only one or two paycheques away from total disaster. These are the people who <i>can&#x27;t afford</i> to save because every penny is spent on merely surviving, and they can&#x27;t amass the bare minimum amount of wealth it would take for them to be able to lift themselves out of that situation.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;moneywise.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;boots-theory-of-socioeconomic-unfairness" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;moneywise.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;boots-theory-of-socioeconomic-unfair...</a>')
