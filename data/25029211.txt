This requires police, a court system, and a military to defend it all.<p>Single payer health care is not a necessity for a functioning free market economy, any more than the government must run collective farms.<p>&gt; Find a private company, and have them do it.<p>Government contracting is not free market, and suffers from most of the ills of the government doing it directly.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t believe Biden will have &quot;central economic planners&quot;<p>Of course Biden will. You can&#x27;t oversee $2 trillion in spending otherwise.')
