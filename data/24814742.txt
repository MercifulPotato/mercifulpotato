Our transactions go through stripe but we also have Paypal checkout option. About 80% of the people landing on our site choose Paypal.<p>It has nothing to do with &quot;got my back&quot; because they still use a credit card to pay through paypal. The main reason is it is <i>easy</i> to just hit Paypal, and approve despite of the dark patterns (I can&#x27;t believe how many times I&#x27;ve had to switch between my bank a&#x2F;c source and creditcard or paypal balance... fuck you Paypal PMs for making this confusing on purpose), and there is no need to fill out credit card forms.<p>Stripe folks if you&#x27;re listening - I am reporting from the battle field - please work on a Stripe user account and it will kill Paypal instantly. Just login with Stripe account on any store and instantly checkout. Whenever I have an Apple Pay option, I choose it because it is instant. Filling out credit card details is the real problem.')
