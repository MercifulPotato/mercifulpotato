So much outrage has been channeled into destructive memes like denying that Covid is a problem and rebelling against simple measures to stop the spread.<p>The real problem is the unsustainable structure of the economy. I don&#x27;t think this woman is being driven to tears because she really wants to be running her restaurant right now, but rather because she&#x27;s going to lose it completely when she falls off the debt treadmill. Instead of small businesses and individuals getting recurring stimulus and suspended rent&#x2F;mortgages&#x2F;taxes, we got peanuts. Meanwhile trillions of dollars were given to Wall St to make sure the magic Line keeps going up. That was a massive theft from the public to the plutocrats. But until the outrage stops getting divided and derailed by distractions, I&#x27;m afraid it will only continue.')
