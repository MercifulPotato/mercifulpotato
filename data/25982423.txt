Before even counting the regulatory credits, Tesla’s gross margin on their cars is the best in the industry. That means their cars are profitable on their own.<p>Their <i>gross revenue</i> is ~5% from regulatory credits. Which are not 100% profit by the way, because they had to build things to get those credits.<p>What the credits are doing is financing Tesla’s rapid expansion while allowing them to maintain positive net income.<p>Amazon, for instance, just maintained negative net income for decades to finance their growth. Tesla is doing it with the regulatory credits instead.<p>Shorts like to say that Tesla is “structurally unprofitable” because they finance future growth with regulatory credits and stock issuance.<p>What’s actually happening is that TSLA is growing at a 50% CAGR and that will absolutely increase current year expenses.<p>The fact that they can grow 50% YoY while maintaining a net profit building <i>automobiles</i> is nothing short of incredible.')
