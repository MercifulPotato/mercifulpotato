We purchase custom fabricated equipment and other supplies from all over the world and German companies often are slow to respond to technical questions about products and other sales related inquiries. Its almost feels like they&#x27;re doing us a favor by giving us their time. Maybe its cultural expectations, but meanwhile local US suppliers are way too pushy, but at-least we get our questions&#x2F;concerns addressed quickly.<p>Couldn&#x27;t resist a small dig here, but German cars are well known to be money-pits. :)')
