Any single business that chooses to pay outsized amounts for their COGS, including labor, will get crushed in the larger market. There might be some like Costco and Apple that can afford to pay more, but they serve middle upper class customers and have a unique product.<p>For everyone else, people will choose to shop at the place that sells bread for 50 cents less.')
