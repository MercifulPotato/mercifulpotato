I can select a job listing to get details, but the back button on my mouse doesn&#x27;t work as expected. It takes me back to the page <i>before</i> the home page, not the home page itself.<p>Clicking on the scroll bar while viewing a listing makes the detail view disappear.<p>Bookmarked for future use anyway. Thank you !<p>Edit: a filter for part-time&#x2F;contract work would be very useful')
