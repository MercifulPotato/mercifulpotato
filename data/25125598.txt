Item(by='Espressosaurus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605630323, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25125406, text='Mercurial shows that it&#x27;s possible to hide much of that complexity behind a user interface that only exposes as much of that complexity as necessary.<p>Git&#x27;s--and Mercurial&#x27;s--secret sauce is the directed acyclic graph of commits.<p>Everything else is window dressing.  It&#x27;s complicated if you&#x27;re used to a linear sequence of commits, but it&#x27;s not too hard once you grasp the tree structure.<p>All operations are operations that manipulate (or share) the DAG, so it now becomes a matter of mapping how you want to manipulate the DAG onto the command set the tool gives you.<p>Git&#x27;s toolset was designed by a dozen madmen that didn&#x27;t talk to each other, so it&#x27;s a loosely connected set of tools with conflicting syntax and meaning.  Mercurial&#x27;s toolset was designed to be used, so if you know the right terminology, you can easily figure out what command to write.  Want to commit something?  It&#x27;s probably hg commit.  Want to rebase?  It&#x27;s probably hg rebase.  Etc.<p>Git exposes unnecessary complexity.  But it won the DVCS popularity contest, so we&#x27;re stuck with it.  I wish something else had won.  Oh well...')
