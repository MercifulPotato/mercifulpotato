If you never use recover and use Vim regularly, then go ahead and disable it; if you haven&#x27;t used it because you don&#x27;t know how to use it or you only rarely use Vim, then I&#x27;d encourage you to either try it first or leave it enabled (as it is by default) until it becomes a nuisance.<p>And like u&#x2F;strogonoff, I also disable line numbers, but that&#x27;s just personal preference of course. For vim newbies, relative lines might also be worth checking out: &quot;set relativenumber&quot;.<p>One thing that really annoys me is :Wq or :Q not being commands. Or typing only Q because you didn&#x27;t hit the : and accidentally entering ex mode. Or hitting F1 instead of escape. I can recommend:<p><pre><code>    command Wq wq\n    command WQ wq\n    command W w\n    command Q q\n    nnoremap Q &lt;nop&gt;\n    map &lt;F1&gt; &lt;Esc&gt;\n    imap &lt;F1&gt; &lt;Esc&gt;\n</code></pre>\nOr for the non-newbie that has the &#x27;too many terminals&#x27; problem, &quot;set title&quot; will give your terminals more useful titles. There are a bunch more things, of course, but these are the lines in my vimrc that I think are useful to most people.')
