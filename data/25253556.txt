Because of #1, there <i>cannot</i> be a single &quot;start here&quot;. I was hoping that the interactive tag cloud would make this obvious and also fulfil that &quot;start here&quot; role: Users choose a tag&#x2F;topic of interest and get a list of relevant projects, each with a readme (and often a list of examples)<p>To give an example of the problem: Say you&#x27;re interested in building UIs. There&#x27;re currently ~20 different projects related to that (of which only a few are related to each other, the rest independent), some are DOM based, some use canvas, others are for OpenGL, Java, Clojure, even others are for baremetal ARM devices. Where&#x27;s the &quot;start here&quot;? An even larger number of packages are dealing with&#x2F;providing data structures? What funnel should&#x2F;could these have?<p>140 of the ~260 projects are part of the thi.ng&#x2F;umbrella monorepo and written in TypeScript. These are somewhat more cohesive (in terms of style, approach &amp; infrastructure), but still definitely <i>not</i> a framework. Then, there&#x27;s also the issue that &quot;monorepo&quot; has multiple interpretations too by now:<p>1. a large (more or less) single-purpose project consisting of multiple packages&#x2F;sub-projects\n2. a google-style monolithic repository providing a common source of truth for thousands of projects (not all related)<p>thi.ng&#x2F;umbrella is somewhere between #1 &amp; #2. thi.ng at large is definitely a #2...<p>I&#x27;d really be interested in hearing how others would approach this from an UX POV, since it is seemingly different to the vast majority of open source offerings, especially in that wider field of &quot;creative computing&quot; (which itself IMHO is a too limiting term for thi.ng - there&#x27;s a much stronger focus on topics outside what&#x27;s covered by P5, OF, Cinder, OPENRNDR etc.)')
