There&#x27;s usually a corner shop about 20 minutes walk max away, some connecting bus not too far away. Cars move OK - not too fast to be annoying.<p>However I found the houses tiny (compared to a farm we&#x27;ve lived in recently), backyards minimal and just so claustrophobic.<p>Country roads here mean people driving past you at 70-90 kmh - you can bike and walk relatively safely, but it&#x27;s going to be too far to get anywhere unless it&#x27;s just for a hike. Also not super pleasant to have cars rushing past you where as traffic in suburbs is much slower and you&#x27;ve got a sidewalk.<p>The cost in country is also much higher, especially in areas that are not too far from city. Of course you get 10x more land that&#x27;s going to appreciate like crazy in future, but you also shelve out at least 2x initial cost + more on maintenance.')
