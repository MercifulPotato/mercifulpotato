I describe the product, the work, the gaps. I ask them what their interests are. We find where the interests align with our gaps. If there is no alignment, we simply don&#x27;t move forward. I tell them the compensation. They accept or reject.<p>Takes about 45 minutes. Pretty simple, the goal is to make sure that they want to do the work that we need done, and that they feel prepared to do so.<p>So far so good.')
