My feeling has always been that it&#x27;s trying [and failing miserably] to evoke a &quot;retro film stock&quot; feel. It seems to be used extensively on anything that&#x27;s trying to look &#x27;period&#x27;, whether the period in question is Victorian, 1950s, 1970s... or any other era.<p>*[I&#x27;m assuming because of lower budgets and quicker turnaround times than films]')
