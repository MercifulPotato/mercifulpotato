Sun sets and rises, don&#x27;t need study for that. Similarly, people who start and direct large enterprises have a strong command of people and understanding of their field. &quot;Studies&quot; don&#x27;t disprove that.<p>&gt; income inequality is a huge problem in the US; societies with dramatic income inequality are historically corrupt and unstable.<p>This seems ... less than proof of anything. Past societies were highly unequal due to &#x27;half the population gotta farm&#x27; at the very least, so comparing them to modern societies seems like a mistake, and at any rate the &#x27;successful&#x27; integrating empires were, well, integrating empires. Modern society hasn&#x27;t existed for that long, and the US (land of inequality!) is quite a bit more stable than many poorer and more income equal (or ... poorer and less income equal!) countries. Historically, societies in europe were much more successful than ones outside europe, yet you wouldn&#x27;t take that correlation as a causation, so i won&#x27;t take yours either.<p>Anyway, you cant just throw a book at me and expect me to read it for a HN comment without laying out its argument at all lol<p>Your second paper says that &#x27;racial discrimination exists&#x27;. The idea that asians somehow derive most of their success from systemic racism and entrenchment - &quot;Overall, these results paint a picture of a rigid income structure by race and ethnicity over time&quot; - seems absurd. Your second paper doesn&#x27;t say anything about meritocracy though.<p>Your third study is also just &#x27;black people are poorer&#x27;. That doesn&#x27;t mean understanding of an opportunity (not &#x27;general skill&#x27;, but local, specific skill) doesn&#x27;t lead to success. So i&#x27;m left with a book (i don&#x27;t have time to read it, it&#x27;s midnight) and two papers that don&#x27;t relate to your point. Maybe asians are just really smart? Maybe they work really hard as kids while the whites play tennis or soccer, which explains why despite being 13% of the population they&#x27;re 52% of the coders?')
