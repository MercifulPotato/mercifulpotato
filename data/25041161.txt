If people only understood this right from day one, a lot of frustration would be saved. And with it all the expressed entitlement on which this frustration is built.<p>You <i>write</i> some code because you need and want it, be it for your learning experience or to make a tool that you need or because to get paid for it. You <i>open source</i> something because you want to get the community engaged in it, to help you find or fix bugs or add features.<p>Conflating these two is a recipe for frustration and the type of post that has prompted this article and the 500+ thread contributions, 90% of which demonstrate that they don&#x27;t understand the difference either. Which is the real sad aspect here.')
