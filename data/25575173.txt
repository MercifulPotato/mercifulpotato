If your bias and immovable opinion weren&#x27;t so obvious I might tell you more about  things like the mafias (including Trumps mentor, Roy Cohn) part in the Hoover compromise, and other things.<p>edit: I got wooshed... <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;QKVS8TMork4?t=23" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;QKVS8TMork4?t=23</a>')
