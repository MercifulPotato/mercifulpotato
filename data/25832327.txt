In both cases I got, a coupe of weeks after incorporation, a letter with a form form the GEZ covering stuff like number of employees and so on. But having the same address, it was enough to provide them the registry number under which the residential fees were already paid. Than I got a letter confirming I don&#x27;t have to pay any fees. That happened in 2019 and 2020, so it could have been different. The GEZ was known for some less than clean practices in the past. I never got directly an invoice from them so tight of the bat.')
