It&#x27;s Free Speech all the way down. And a fundamental aspect of Free Speech isn&#x27;t just the right to say something, it&#x27;s necessarily the right to <i>NOT</i> say something, and to <i>NOT</i> provide material support against your will to speech you disagree with. If you or I or anyone else or any general organization decides to <i>NOT</i> provide help to someone else&#x27;s speech, be it our own direct voice or access to our private property, that&#x27;s not censorship that is itself Free Speech. They in turn have the right to complain, and to exercise their own freedom of association, and we may change our minds, or not, and others can chime in, and on and on forever. Free Speech is a <i>system</i> not an end goal, a constant churning that hopefully over long enough timescales will give us a better grasp of Truth.<p>When government uses force, that halts the system, and speech becomes frozen. History and present indicates that the bar for that, though not infinite, should be quite high. Some companies that truly have natural monopolies or exercise quasi-governmental power may fall into that too, particularly if they in some way are significantly making use of government power themselves (limited spectrum allocation for cellular carriers for example, or physical infrastructure companies making use of public rights of way). But social and economic censure is a fundamental aspect of the process of Free Speech. 3rd parties aren&#x27;t some disembodied Other, they&#x27;re entities that have the same rights as anyone else by default.')
