I did state Sci Hub is getting benefits they didn&#x27;t pay for, like keeping out crap, the value from being reviewed, uniform quality from known journals, etc.<p>If I, having published academic papers, and in many cases keeping my own copyrights as I <i>always</i> try to negotiate that (and a surprising amount of journals will let you if you ask), want scihub to not publish my work, funded by me, and published by journals I selected, will they remove it? No?<p>Then they are stealing the same as others. It&#x27;s just their theft is popular since it lets people access stuff for free.')
