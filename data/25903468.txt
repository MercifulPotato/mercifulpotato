A big one is security.  When I was homeless and learning to code, I couldn’t afford to replace my laptop.  People told me that if I stayed in a homeless shelter, there was a good chance my laptop would be stolen.  I chose not to stay in one for that reason alone.<p>A few years later, I offered to let a homeless coding student stay with me for a couple weeks while she got housing lined up.  She didn’t have one of her own, so I gave her my old MacBook Air.  She made arrangements to stay in a shelter, left my place, and her laptop was stolen within a week.<p>Safety &amp; security matter, and any solution that is going to effectively address homelessness needs to take this into account.')
