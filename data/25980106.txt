Well why weren&#x27;t they in place by Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday in the expectation that DTCC would increase these requirements? Volumes were already exploding with many days of advanced warning and IVs already approaching the hundreds of percent. There&#x27;s a plausible alternative that RH is not being entirely truthful, and purposely didn&#x27;t organise the required lines in order to satisfy their biggest customer, so they had a legal way to restrict trading. I don&#x27;t have evidence that this is true, but nor would I expect to have this evidence at this early point in time.<p>I believe RH&#x27;s explanation is probably the truthful one (Hanlon&#x27;s Razor), but some scepticism is warranted.')
