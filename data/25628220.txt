Arrays are <i>fast</i>.  Keep your data in the cache and they&#x27;re 10x or more faster than normal, and plain flat arrays are almost always faster than literally any OOP nonsense.  By &quot;almost always&quot; I mean that I&#x27;ve never once encountered a situation where flat arrays weren&#x27;t the fastest solution attempted, and I haven&#x27;t seen everything, so I can&#x27;t claim they&#x27;re always fastest.<p>People really don&#x27;t understand how fast their computers really are, thanks to developers not caring how fast their code is.')
