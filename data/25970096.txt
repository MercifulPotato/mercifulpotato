Public spaces have clear first amendment protections. I can hold a sign on a publicly owned sidewalk (well, public right of way) begging for money or praising &#x27;bong hits for Jesus&#x27;. But private spaces do not. I can&#x27;t do the same thing on your living room. This allows folks to exercise their freedom of association, which is a pretty big part of the first amendment.<p>Where and how do you draw the line between public and private spaces then in an online context? Should the government be required to host unmoderated and uncensored discussion boards? And how do you keep the unregulated public spaces useful when such spaces are easily overrun by trolls and spammers?')
