Maybe your numbers you quote are correct - there are other problems, like relying on people to report their positive test results and isolate. A lot of people would, but many also wouldn&#x27;t, because they can&#x27;t afford the loss of wages. You&#x27;d have to cover wages lost, or some percentage anyway, and that would mean requiring another test at a trusted facility, which increases the complexity again...<p>Maybe the concept would be workable, but it&#x27;s also not a simple slam dunk, and again, I don&#x27;t know that any country is doing anything like it.')
