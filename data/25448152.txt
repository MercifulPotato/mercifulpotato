We&#x27;ve colocated our servers for the past 18 or so years.<p>We have about 40.  The oldest is around 17 years old. Our newest server is 9 years old.  Our average server age is probably around 13 years old.<p>The most common failure that completely takes them out of commission is a popped capacitor on the  motherboard.  Never had it happen before the 10 year mark.<p>Never had memory failure.  Have had disk failures, but those are easy to replace.  Had one power supply failure, but it was a faulty batch and happened within 2 years of the server&#x27;s life.')
