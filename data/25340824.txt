Users can see icons or images that represent their devices and enable lost device tracking with a slide of a toggle button (1 of 3 ways). It also helps identify potentially dangerous devices during the Bluetooth scanning and identification processes. There&#x27;s also a manual location tracker: simply type in where you keep your devices so you don&#x27;t lose track. We&#x27;re looking at adding the ability to manage Wi-Fi connections next.<p>We&#x27;re getting about 1,100 downloads per day and hit 83,000 downloads today since we first made it available on 3 September.<p>~steve')
