There&#x27;s so much confusion right now.<p>- Will they ship a more advanced spec for the upper line? Something like a M1x, thus replacing the need for a third-party discrete GPU?<p>- Will they market these devices like they do with the iPhone: same Soc for every generation but with different sizes&#x2F;extras (Macbook Air, Pro, Mac Mini just like you choose between an iPhone Mini, Pro, Max)?<p>- How long Intel-based machines will still be around? What they will do with the Mac Pro?<p>- How smooth will be the transition with OS&#x2F;software (I expect it will take more than the two year planned) and how much it will change with this new ARM ecosystem?<p>As with any new first generation device from Apple, plus this vast, unknown land, I&#x27;d stay away from these machines and wait for at the least the next iteration (maybe two).')
