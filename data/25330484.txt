So much online documentation has the ids but not the links. How else are you supposed to find the ID to link to a heading? Guess? Open dev tools? I will do both, because I&#x27;m particular about it, but 99.9% of regular people I know don&#x27;t care enough to try either. But if it&#x27;s right there (and they know what it is and what to look for), then maybe there&#x27;s a <i>chance</i> someone will give me a direct link to the specific part of the docs under question instead of another enormous pre-compiled single page document with vague instructions to search on the page for what turn out to be frequently used terms.<p>Please make linking to content headings easy on your site!')
