I can&#x27;t think of any divergent colormap that has this feature. In jet the cyan and yellow regions highlight small deviations from zero, which are usually more interesting than zero itself.<p>I understand that jet is poor for accessiblity, and I don&#x27;t use it for that reason, but in my experience jet is used frequently for divergent data and highlighting extreme values. The article&#x27;s argument for perceptually uniform colormaps in this context is weak to non-existent. Surely roma wouldn&#x27;t look very good on a photo of Curie.')
