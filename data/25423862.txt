Last I heard, the mechanism was unclear.<p>There was a &quot;smell of space&quot; perfume kickstarter[2], and then &quot;of moon&quot;, but IIRC both were working from descriptions rather than chemistry.<p>I saw someone ask, what would a Falcon 9 first stage smell&#x2F;taste like after it landed.  It reminded me that most science education content is very sensorially impoverished.  Elsewhere, someone reported their half-century-ago geology professor, as emphasizing that you should bring all your senses to bear, and taste your rocks.<p>Material sensory properties (&quot;smooth vs rough&quot;, etc) are taught in Kindergarten.  But the descriptive ontologies are ad hoc, so I&#x27;ve wondered what leverage might be obtained by swapping in something more principled from industry.  So what about about smell?  Either in the spirit of material properties, or more &quot;artist&#x27;s eye for color&quot;, or music appreciation?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;astronomy.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2018&#x2F;07&#x2F;outer-space-smells" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;astronomy.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2018&#x2F;07&#x2F;outer-space-smells</a> [2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kickstarter.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;eaudespace&#x2F;what-does-outer-space-smell-like-nasa-designed-fragrance" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kickstarter.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;eaudespace&#x2F;what-does-ou...</a>')
