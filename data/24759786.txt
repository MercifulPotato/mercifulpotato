Insurance is &lt;$1k&#x2F;yr. Average maintenance &amp; repair is pretty low since I don&#x27;t drive a heck of a lot (1-2x trips&#x2F;week typically).<p>Is it strictly cheaper than rentals? Maybe, maybe not. But it&#x27;s cheap enough to not matter, and instead optimize on convenience rather than cost.<p>I&#x27;m even considering buying a new or very lightly used car in the nearish future, which would cost considerably more in the short term, but I would hang on to it for a long time barring unexpected circumstances. Cost (within reason) is not even a top 3 factor compared to convenience, comfort, and safety.')
