They should be allowed to pick and choose what people can use them to express because that&#x27;s a freedom one person has, and therefore that they have as a group of people who individually have it. So the defence rests on it being expression.<p>However, the defence for them not being liable for expression on their platform is that they&#x27;re &quot;just the platform&quot;. By choosing not to enforce on other things and choosing to enforce on these things they&#x27;re not &quot;just the platform&quot; - the expression they permit is their expression.<p>It&#x27;s a bit hazy, but it feels to me like you forfeit some of your &quot;just a platform&quot; defence when you exercise your &quot;it&#x27;s my right to expression&quot; defence. Morally, of course, not legally. IANAL and this isn&#x27;t a court so who gives a damn about the law on its own.<p>ยน If you don&#x27;t hold these beliefs, then you&#x27;re not in the audience for the comment. Skip safely.')
