The bank, meanwhile, gave out a loan of X Euros, and is receiving payments in a currency whose aggregate value is X+Y Euros.  Their profit is Y.  There&#x27;s also the opportunity to make even more money selling options backed by these payments.<p>This is a completely valid means of making money, but it carries substantially higher risk than single currency lending.  Which is probably the reason most banks don&#x27;t want to carry too many of these on their balance sheets.')
