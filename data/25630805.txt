Most tech workers are above the median salary in the US ($35k). I don&#x27;t make nearly as much as a Google employee, but I would like a union for a couple reasons (they could mostly fix this through legislation and avoid the unions) like removing forced arbitration, or having an actual contract rather than a one pager that says they make the rules and can change them anytime without notice.<p>And speaking of income. It seems like 1% of that group&#x27;s income is a high number for supporting the union.')
