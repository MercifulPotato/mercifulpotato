I can understand if they&#x27;re using the images for machine learning or something, but if it&#x27;s truly just to prevent future malpractice, data like this should only be kept on air-gapped systems or offline media.<p>That said, let&#x27;s hope we&#x27;re beyond the point of anyone caring about pictures of the human body or whether someone&#x27;s had plastic surgery.<p>If I were threatened with something like this, which could be pretty embarrassing since I lost so much weight and have loose skin, I&#x27;d tell the hackers that I&#x27;ll release even more if they leak mine and then attempt to find dirt on them.')
