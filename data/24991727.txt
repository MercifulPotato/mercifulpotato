Maybe from a more mature person&#x27;s mind set, looking back over things?<p>All that being said, randomly going and shooting people doesn&#x27;t really seem like an effective &quot;attack on the system&quot;.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t attacking the system involve figuring out the responsible &quot;system&quot; people or components, so they&#x27;d be the focus of attack?  Random shooting acts... isn&#x27;t really that. :(')
