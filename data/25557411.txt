WebAssembly has played an important role protecting CI on the Internet and it&#x27;s cool that it enables us to run LLVM in the browser. I was very surprised when I learned that some people were using it offline outside of browsers, since doing so requires a JVM-like runtime such as wasmtime. Cosmopolitan proves that it&#x27;s possible to just fix C instead, which might fix all the stuff that&#x27;s built on top of C too. We can in fact have first-class portable native binaries, which will only require JIT compilation if they&#x27;re launched on a non-x86 machine. This is probably how Java would have been designed, if Intel&#x27;s instruction set hadn&#x27;t been encumbered by patents at the time. That&#x27;s changed. The x86-64 patents just expired this year. So I say why not use it as a canonical software encoding.')
