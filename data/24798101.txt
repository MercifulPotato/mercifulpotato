We focus on disinformation, but social media gets used for a lot of other things.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what anything else in your post has to do with the quality of ideas being better. You claim that right wing populism is a reaction to liberalism and globalism, and that ideas are getting better. This leads me to connect the dots and think that your claim is that right wing populism is a good idea.<p>We know now, in hindsight, that the Treaty of Versailles and the Great Depression led directly to the circumstances that led to the rise of Hitler. And indeed, Hitler was not alone. Fascist dictators rose throughout this time period. Was the discourse worse then? Was it better then?<p>This feels disingenuous. &quot;Ideas are getting better.&quot; &quot;Fascism is a natural reaction.&quot; Please, if you are trying to make a political point, say it. Don&#x27;t tiptoe around it.')
