You pretty much always trust some authority with what&#x27;s a fact and what&#x27;s not and twitter isn&#x27;t taking that away from you. Have you verified every evidence yourself, for the things you take as premises?! I doubt it.<p>So let&#x27;s not get all trolly problem here, alright.<p>(1) What&#x27;s something specific you get moderated for? What&#x27;s the thing you wish to express but can&#x27;t in today&#x27;s social media landscape? Can those things be falsified and the condition for accepting evidence?<p>(2) I say, there _are social networks for _every niche and kink; the only reason you would feel limited in expression and participation would be you trying to expose people to your ideas not likeminded. You have no right to be heard in every community, all the time, no right win people over everywhere, with everything. People can chose against you and your words. That&#x27;s their right. A community implicitly or explicitly choosing a moderator or moderation guideline, isn&#x27;t that a very democratic dynamic, too?<p>(3) We all know the internet changed the assumptions on independent thinking, and ignorant opinions can triumph over facts easily, if they are simpler, more convenient, more stimulating, more viral. Do you really want to be heard or do you want to win?<p>(4) Do you speak up, when a comment here gets downvoted to void, because the boys took offense? Have you ever fought for visibility of an argument or opinion totally against your world view, in the name of unconditional free speech?')
