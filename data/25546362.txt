Santalum Album or Indian sandalwood is the best cultivar and has the most valuable sandalwood heartwood. It takes about 15 years to get a good heartwood and sapwood ratio as well as the best quality for the best oil distillation.<p>It has to follow a very strict crop and host planting rotation. Many host plants of different lifespans have to be selected as the first two years are most crucial for its parasitic inputs.<p>There is much we donâ€™t know about this family.')
