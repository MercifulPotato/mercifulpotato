The difference between human vision and computer vision is that human vision is stereoscopic. We perceive depth in addition to color and shape. And that gives us the ability to perceive the 3-dimensional shape of an object, which lets us anticipate how it might move. A lot of CV algorithms operate on single images from a single camera, which makes it impossible to judge depth. In that case you&#x27;d have to use the size of an object as a proxy for its distance and speed, so you&#x27;d tend to misjudge how far things are from you and where they&#x27;re going.<p>The nice thing about LIDAR is that you can gather that depth&#x2F;shape information and with sufficient calibration map the shapes in the camera image to the depths in the LIDAR image. You can do the same thing with two cameras so I&#x27;m not sure why LIDAR would be preferred here.')
