Hardly anyone watching scientific content of any kind is an expert in the subject matter.  What the public has always relied on is some sort of authority figure lending credibility to some idea or news story.  For instance, saying masks don’t work is “obvious” bullshit.  But remember back in March?  Our glorious leaders were urging us not to buy masks because they don’t work, and besides, doctors need them.  Even though they don’t work.  And to have argued differently at the time was “misinformation.”<p>Now we’re trusting Facebook, Twitter, and Google to be the authority from which all truth flows.')
