Item(by='jaredklewis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610111705, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25684281, text='&gt; I’m not talking specifically about Twitch.<p>Ok, but this article is about Twitch.<p>&gt; At the moment where they make their platform public, they have no political nor moral authority to say what’s good or bad.<p>So anything that is &quot;public&quot; cannot have moderation? A chess forum has to allow Osama bin Laden to post his political rants? Should it be illegal to run a website with moderation?<p>&gt; Tomorrow if the leadership changes, they can on the contrary censor everything but not Trump and you’ll have nothing to say then.<p>I&#x27;ll say the same thing I am saying today: it&#x27;s their own platform and they can moderate it however they want. If I don&#x27;t like their moderation, I am perfectly capable of going elsewhere.')
