Item(by='claudiawerner', descendants=None, kids=[25245405], score=None, time=1606658547, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25242865, text='&gt;I like to be able to spot the idiots and know who they are and where they stand, not to put them underground where they inevitably fester into violence in their bubbles.<p>This idea, that &quot;sunlight is the best disinfectant&quot; does not seem to have much evidence going for it. In fact, surely we&#x27;re owed some justification for the principle - does exposing widespread misinformation correct the bad effects before it was exposed? Some harm has already been done, and I&#x27;m not sure how that is justified by the principle.<p>I think that principle is lacking in empirical evidence, and theoretical justification for the harms it allows, which seem to be based on a shaky idea of the greater good.')
