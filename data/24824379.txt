Moreover, it does seem recycling is a nice way both for IKEA and customers to buy themselves the comforting (but fake) feeling of doing something sustainable while at the same time keeping things going as usual. Or who knows, even increasing &#x27;hey I can recycle this so doesn&#x27;t matter if I buy more, I&#x27;m still doing my thing for the planet&#x27;.')
