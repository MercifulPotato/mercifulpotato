This is something that will have a technological solution.<p>Carbon sequestration from the atmosphere is not a hard problem and turning atmospheric carbon into fuel is not a hard problem. It just makes no sense to burn fossil fuels to do it. This is a net energy loss although there&#x27;s still a market for turning inconvenient energy sources into convenient ones.<p>But as soon as the energy source is cheaper than fossil fuels, the equation completely changes.<p>This, to me, is the ultimate promise of renewables.<p>It may well be the promise of fusion too but I&#x27;m not yet convinced fusion will ever be commercially viable. I&#x27;m least convinced about Tokamak reactors. New designs may prevail. Fusion is attractive because of the abundance of the fuel but the problems of containment (eg turbulence), alpha particle embrittlement and neutron embrittlement remain... huge. Stars contain all this with gravity.')
