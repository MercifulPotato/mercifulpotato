For me I had some weird visual things like things popping out of flat screens, objects momentarily seeming further or closer than they really were, odd dreams, and floaty feelings. Some people describe short periods of disassociation like their hands aren&#x27;t real or feelings of unreality. There was quite obviously some neuronal re-wiring happening, but it passed quickly and I don&#x27;t have any urges to put my hands through solid objects or anything like that. It was actually pretty similar to when I&#x27;ve been skiing a lot and I have some after effects of the ground seeming to move.')
