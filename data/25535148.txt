And it’s very easy to adjust various DNS setting with Google, the whole process is very well done. Highly recommend them here and many others do too.<p>Re pricing, I’ve noticed a few others bringing it up on 1,000 per year. This is a premium domain and instead of some scalper grabbing it up, by setting the annual price high, an actual end user like myself gets to buy one. In a perfect world we will be the first to snag up a domain, but this model of charging premium prices for domains, as long as it’s not exorbitant, works better for both end users and registrants.<p>1,000 sounds a lot per year, but when the .com is in the millions, it’s much fairer.')
