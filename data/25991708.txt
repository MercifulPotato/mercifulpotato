You&#x27;re betting on future value without actually possessing the thing that may (or may not) be valuable in the future. I would argue this is a meaningless distinction in context.<p>And I wouldn&#x27;t say futures are &quot;obviously useful&quot;. They are &quot;useful&quot; in the sense that if you bet on the future and bet correctly, you win, but does the overall economy win? Or is it just a layer that creates more winners and losers without those winners actually providing more value than they otherwise would&#x27;ve? Futures are effectively a zero sum game, and I don&#x27;t think we should in general encourage those. Futures and shorts are basically just gambling. Would you say gambling (when applied to sports &#x2F; etc) is economically useful?<p>What we should be encouraging is positive sum games &#x2F; win-wins.')
