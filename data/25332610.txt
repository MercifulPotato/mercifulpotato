For better for for worse.<p>I&#x27;ve worked on teams where I had colleagues who were incredibly deliberative. They would spend lots of time working with stakeholders to deeply understand their problems, and then produce elegant solutions that made their jobs drastically easier. Small changes with huge payoff. But management, and even most other team members, didn&#x27;t recognize this. They just saw a slow programmer. Credit tended to go almost exclusively to other teams, when their members started using those tools to radically improve their own processes. The company&#x27;s dev org largely didn&#x27;t care about that effect, because it didn&#x27;t positively influence their own KPIs.')
