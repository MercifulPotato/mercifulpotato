Item(by='tptacek', descendants=None, kids=[25263122], score=None, time=1606801854, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25262594, text='Non-deniable messages plainly leak information. Alice knows Bob&#x27;s message is valid the moment she receives it (if she&#x27;s running a serious protocol with Bob --- no comment if she&#x27;s using the PGP MDC), and from that point on no longer needs the authentication on Bob&#x27;s message. Neither Bob nor anyone else need to validate Bob&#x27;s message; Bob sent the message and knows its plaintext bit-for-bit; &quot;anyone else&quot; isn&#x27;t a party to the conversation. We design cryptosytems to minimize what &quot;anyone else&quot; gets. Non-deniable messages fail that test.<p>What you&#x27;re giving is a rationalization people use, to defend PGP and, recently, to argue that mail spool compromises are in the public interest, and should produce publicly verifiable logs. In reality, when Alice and Bob agree to produce verifiable, non-deniable messages to each other, they do so explicitly, not inadvertently, which is what is happening when your messaging system does that signing for you.')
