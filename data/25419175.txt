I dont have a moral vendetta against it.  But it seems to be a no-go topic for discussing the serious societal issues from porn.  As I&#x27;ve grown older ive realized its really very toxic and probably the most widespread addiction in the US causing real issues.<p>When you watch porn all day or even just a few times per week, your testosterone and hormonal balance as a man changes.  You do not go after women and start a family.  You are more likely to be depressed.  It causes brain fog and mood disorders.  Etc.  Theres some good TED talks on this which are easy to find.  This is never talked about and should be.  Little off topic maybe but just wanted to state this.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wSF82AwSDiU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wSF82AwSDiU</a>')
