Probably the biggest factor is that Phase III trials are insanely expensive, like a billion dollars plus or minus.  High touch, 30,000 people minimum for the US, lasts two years, etc.  Sanofi&#x2F;GSK is hazarding some of their own money in this, and has to look at the market for COVID-19 vaccines, which is obviously weighted towards the elderly.<p>Might also be risk management in wondering if the final results for the younger would be disappointing or worse, this problem with the elderly was learned through surrogate endpoints from serological as in blood testing of immune system responses.  See Oxford for how they were led astray from their first big 500 Phase I&#x2F;II people test of their vaccine platform, and achieved <i>much</i> worse results than they anticipated when put in the crucible of multiple Phase III trials and the real endpoints of getting COVID-19, or serious cases of it.')
