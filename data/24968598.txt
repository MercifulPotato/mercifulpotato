The more you present your opponents as dangerous, the more people are encouraged to amp up the rhetoric. Compromises have to be presented as impossible -- if you compromise with them they can&#x27;t be all that bad.<p>After a while, it becomes self-fulfilling. If your opponents are your enemies, then you act like their enemy, and they have to perceive you as one. Fringe elements of your own side will eventually escalate to violence. And you won&#x27;t discourage them too much -- if you&#x27;ve ceded the middle, you need to keep your extremes.<p>It&#x27;s not clear to me that Gandhism will succeed as a policy. Sometimes it works; sometimes you get bowled over. Gandhism requires a charismatic leader who can focus attention. Without that, you just seem boring and ineffective. It&#x27;s especially hard today, when social media can quickly spread anti-Gandhi propaganda. Even Gandhi isn&#x27;t Gandhi today; he&#x27;s got a lot of negative things on his record and they&#x27;d eat him alive.<p>So you may eventually become enemies for real, and not just as a matter of rhetoric. Breaking that self-reinforcing loop may be impossible.')
