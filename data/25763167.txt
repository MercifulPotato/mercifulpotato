I think one reason for this is that they hardly do any OEM, so you have to build your own bike, which often ends up more expensive. In particular if you otherwise buy bikes when they are on sale. The other reason is because the groups don&#x27;t really compare with the Shimano and SRAM groups, i.e. the equivalent to Ultegra is probably Potenza not Chorus, and to DA and RED it&#x27;s probably Record (this isn&#x27;t helped by the fact that Campa now only does SR in electronic).<p>I&#x27;ve recently after many years riding shimano moved back to campa (I got an awesome deal on a SR-EPS equipped bike) and I have to say it is an awesome groupset. From all I have read, especially if you want mechanical Campa super-record and record is what to get.<p>Regarding SRAM AXS, I want to like them, but I&#x27;ve heard about way to many quality control problems (Force AXS front derailleur chainsuck has been widely reported) , Red Etap was much better.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t think any groupset will make you substantially faster.')
