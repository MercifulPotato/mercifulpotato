If one of A or B are contested and (validly) claimed false, then the truth&#x2F;proof state propagates and you know, visually, that C is not proven.<p>And then yes, C can be used to support something else, so you can chain multiple together. Kialo - and really, the whole warrant&#x2F;claim method of argument-mapping - doesn&#x27;t have the concept of truth (or sufficiency, or necessity) built into the machinery.<p>It goes deeper than that, there&#x27;s a distinction between syntax and semantics (or form and content) - all of these design decisions are driving exactly how the project evolves.')
