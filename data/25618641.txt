Item(by='joshka', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609639160, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25615756, text='&gt;Writing endless books and articles about how you’re engaging in wrongthink by questioning official narratives isn’t the solution, never has been, and never will be. For as many words that are written about the rise of conspiracy theories, I haven’t read a single one that tries to explain their appeal and origin in a neutral way, without having a condescending tone throughout. At some point you have to ask yourself: is your goal to actually persuade people, or is it to make them feel stupid?<p>I&#x27;m unsure if you meant this to be read as a criticism of the book, or a general statement. The book seems to embrace the ideas that you&#x27;re suggesting are missing. E.g.:<p>&gt;Show empathy. Approaches should be empathic and seek to build understanding with the other party. Because the goal is to develop the conspiracy theorist’s open-mindedness, communicators must lead by example.<p>&gt; Avoid ridicule. Aggressively deconstructing or ridiculing a conspiracy theory, or focusing on “winning” an argument, runs the risk of being automatically rejected. Note, however, that ridicule has been shown to work with general audiences.')
