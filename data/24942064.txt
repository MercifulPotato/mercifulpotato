Rendering to the screen implies a graphics driver.</i><p>VGA text mode should always be available.<p><i>You need to be able to set resolutions, control multiple plugged in monitors (otherwise your BIOS output is sent to your HDMI connected projector only rather than your primary monitor).</i><p>Sane defaults help a lot here --- like all outputs enabled (and showing the same thing), and of course 80x25 text mode.<p><i>and support for FAT32, exFAT, likely NTFS since a lot of people use it, etc.</i><p>Load first sector of boot device to 7c00h and jump to it. The code there can use int 13h to load the rest. BIOS doesn&#x27;t need to have <i>any</i> knowledge of the filesystem to do that, nor should it.<p><i>Also most users want their BIOS to present devices in a abstract way, i.e. so that your kernel is able to render to a framebuffer on an ARM server board with the same code it uses to render to a framebuffer on more standarized x86.</i><p>Approximately zero users care about ARM having the same BIOS as x86.<p><i>and hardware has become complicated.</i><p>Not all of that complication is necessary, however. USB and ATAPI boot, as well as PXE (network boot) was been around long before UEFI reared its ugly head. I bet the amount of space taken up by the (IMHO totally unnecessary and definitely not wanted if you&#x27;re in the CMOS SETUP to fix something with the GPU not working right) graphics in UEFI setup is far more than an entire pre-UEFI BIOS with all the other features.')
