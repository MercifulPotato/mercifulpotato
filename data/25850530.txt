This opens up opportunities for monitoring,  visual, data-driven programming and it is white board friendly.<p>In Elements of Clojure[0], the author discusses the concept of &quot;principled components and adaptive systems&quot;. And a flow based design reminds me of exactly that. The semantics of composition and communication are well-defined and universal, but internally the components can (should) be specific and concrete.<p>Similar can be said about Small Talk as well. A primary aspect of its design was the mental model, understanding and learning. The core idea was that learners (especially children) understand things in terms of their operational semantics.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t mean to derail the conversation, but this really does remind me of the game Factorio, though sort of in reverse.<p>So no, I don&#x27;t think this is a derailment, but likely one of the most important aspects of paradigms like this.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elementsofclojure.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elementsofclojure.com&#x2F;</a>')
