It would be nice if it included deployment model like daemonset vs replicaset.<p>With the plethora of options, what missing for me is what ones perform well under heavy loads.  Its painful to find out after the fact since each ingress controller deploys in differing (and sometimes not compatible) ways.<p>For example, with nginx-ingress there are gotchas under heavy load.  nginx-ingress doesn&#x27;t support SSL session caching on the upstream (nginx&lt;-&gt;your pod).  This is a deficiency in the lua-balancer implementation.  You can tune keep-alive requests on the upstream, but it isn&#x27;t always enough.  That 50% CPU savings from SSL resumption is costly to lose at times.<p>This has bitten me when a client side connection burst requires a connection burst in nginx&lt;-&gt;service.  Upstream services then burn a lot of CPU negotiating SSL, to the detriment of request processing.  This then  causes more nginx connections to open up due to slower request processing; and might cause healthchecks to fail.  There just aren&#x27;t enough tuning parameters to control how hard nginx hits your upstream PODs.')
