You’ll likely need to fax a copy of your id to a fraud department who’ll take their time.<p>A friend of mine has been unable to convince a credit agency to reset their password as they are out of the country and cannot fulfill the requested authentication task. Wouldn’t be a problem in normal times, as they are back and forth every other month. Except it’s been 7 months since corona disrupted that. They can’t just “sign up for a new account” as it tied to their identity.<p>I’ve never had this problem myself either. But it’s a real problem.')
