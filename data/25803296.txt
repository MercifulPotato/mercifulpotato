Like the previous poster says, it&#x27;s about what firmware versions you have.<p>For example, if your mac came with Sierra, and through the regular usage and update, you patched it up to Mojave, and installed (or was forced to install by the way, there is no way to reject certain types of updates) firmware updates, you find that all of a sudden you can&#x27;t re-install Sierra anymore. You&#x27;d need to install whatever version your firmware now supports.<p>This behaviour is undocumented and it&#x27;s case by case - for each mac hardware there is a firmware for it - there are lots of people online who have figured out patch levels are for each revision of hardware, etc - but it&#x27;s more trial and error to see what older version of macOS you can downgrade to.')
