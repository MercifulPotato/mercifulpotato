The price would still be shooting up. In a short squeeze all that WSB had to do was hold.<p>Obviously the blocking of buys will have an effect on the price and availability of the stock. Not that it provides any reasonable justification for RH either way.<p>&gt; If your &quot;short squeeze&quot; is dependent on people buying more in order to create a short squeeze, then you are just coordinating to create a short squeeze, not dealing with a &quot;natural occurring&quot; one.<p>Even if you want to buy the stock because you know there is a short squeeze ongoing, that is not illegal. That is just analysing the market conditions and seeing the obvious.')
