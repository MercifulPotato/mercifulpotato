I have little experience on the differences between a good warehouse worker or manager and a bad one, but I know that at least for software, the difference between a good software engineer and a bad one; or between a good software manager and a bad one; can make or break a business. I&#x27;m sure the same is true in many others domains of Amazon&#x27;s activity (B2B sales is another obvious ones, as are marketing and market research; but I&#x27;m sure there are many less obvious ones).<p>The other point where I think your analysis is flawed is basing the &quot;fair&quot; compensation only on replace-ability. Even if 2 warehouse workers are perfectly replaceable, as long as they are doing the job and their work is absolutely required for the business to function, they should also be getting a large proportion of that business&#x27;s success. This is where Unions can really improve things - by allowing collective bargaining, they help people who are interchangeable but whose jobs are crucial to get their fair share of the pie they are contributing massively to.')
