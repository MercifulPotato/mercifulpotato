Item(by='usrusr', descendants=None, kids=[25120282, 25120330], score=None, time=1605584877, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25119450, text='If the immune reaction in the vaccinated was good enough to avoid symptoms but a few still tested positive then those five are surely not the only ones. What are the chances that a random person without symptoms would be getting tested exactly those days that a very mild infection lasts? Those studies don&#x27;t observe the subjects with daily PCR or something like that (impossible for ten thousands) and most mild infections remain undiscovered. And mild, hard to discover infections aren&#x27;t exceptionally rare even without a vaccine, as antibody testing studies have shown again and again.<p>The pressing follow-up question is this: how many of the control group were discovered with (and despite of) equally weak symptoms? The answer could be anything between many more and many less. If it&#x27;s more (more discovered very mild cases amongst the placebo group) then the vaccine apparently prevents most infections from happening at all, but if it&#x27;s less then the vaccine doesn&#x27;t really reduce the number of infected (and infective), it only prevents bad outcomes (which usually remain undiscovered, even in a phase III trial group).<p>A vaccine that only prevents bad outcomes would still be very valuable, but only to the vaccinated themselves because it would not create a herd immunity effect. This virus is very good at spreading from a mild case, so if the vaccinated still get unnoticeable mild cases they would still serve the virus as stopovers.')
