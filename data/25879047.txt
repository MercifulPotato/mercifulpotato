How long it takes to get down to an unsurvivable ~250mmHg (assuming an Earth-air-like breathing gas aboard ISS, which seems reasonable) takes more trouble to figure out than I care to go to on a Friday night, but the lowest possible bound (assuming a constant ejection rate) would be somewhere around 500 minutes, or between eight and a bit to nine-ish hours.<p>Honestly I&#x27;m more curious what area a breach would have to have to produce that kind of leak rate.<p><i>edit:</i> Actually, given the effectively infinite volume at effective vacuum outside the hull, you wouldn&#x27;t see the same &quot;counterpressure&quot; effect you would in atmosphere, that causes pressure equalization to slow\ndown as it approaches equality - there&#x27;s no <i>equalization</i> that can happen here. That said, you&#x27;d still lose less mass per unit time over time, as the internal pressure and thus the mass per unit volume drops.')
