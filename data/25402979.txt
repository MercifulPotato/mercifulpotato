You can&#x27;t use them interchangeably. I would also argue that big data is the more sensational one of the two. Machine learning can be easily defined as a group of algorithms. Big data on the other hand is a vague notion that doesn&#x27;t make it clear what is happening at all and this ambiguity allows sensationalizing.')
