Should small OSS projects have lived without CI for the last few years? Or should everyone who publishes an OSS project set up and maintain a self-hosted CI service for it? Either option would be a massive drag on OSS development.<p>It doesn&#x27;t actually matter much for this if you use an OSS CI service like Gitlab: the hosted service is still dependent on the generosity&#x2F;marketing of the company hosting it, and switching to self-hosting is much more effort than porting config from one CI service to another.')
