The free market can certainly be made &quot;better&quot; (however one might define it) by certain interventions.  Your example of weights and measures is a good one - the market benefits from an increase in knowledge of both parties in a transaction.<p>Another good example is FDIC insurance.  We could have little to no banking regulations, but that would also introduce a lot of uncertainty and result in wild swings when the economic situation changes.  Tell depositers that the gov&#x27;t will back their savings helps stabilize the banking system which actually benefits the market (the same way a stable and predictable government&#x2F;legal system benefits the market).')
