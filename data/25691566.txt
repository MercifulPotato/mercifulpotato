A book that claimed that dragons really existed historically and were instrumental in William the Conqueror&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Hastings is not enjoyable, it&#x27;s just weird.<p>ASoIaF (and Martin) is quite clear that his dragons are fantasy, so they&#x27;re unobjectionable. The problem is that Martin has been equally clear that he intends some other elements of the world to have been historically accurate.')
