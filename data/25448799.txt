There could be 10 payment facilitators rather than two, when the NYT breaks a major abuse scandal about a platform such as Pornhub they would all jump ship.<p>You see this all the time with these industries, there are countless of advertisers, but almost all of them avoid the porn industry, because nobody wants to be associated with it. It&#x27;s not a market power issue, that&#x27;s only tangential in this case.<p>People don&#x27;t want to be commercially associated with scandal plagued porn sites, any business would lose most customers or suppliers if it acted like this, and I think that&#x27;s fine. IF you think the American people are too harsh on porn sites then you gotta take it up with them.<p>It&#x27;s comparable to say, Google throwing Alex Jones of YouTube. Yes, Google is huge, but that&#x27;s not the reason they&#x27;re doing it, it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re anticipating public backlash which is bad for their business. If there were 10 youtubes, 8-9 of them would have thrown him off too. It&#x27;s way too simplistic to say that a large company is exercising undue market power every time it makes a decision about who to do business with. That&#x27;s only true if the size is the actual motivation for that decision, not if they&#x27;re just responding to consumers.')
