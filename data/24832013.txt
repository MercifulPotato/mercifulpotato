But those that used it in the very early days will remember - as users in this reddit thread[1] do - that the early days were pretty rough, and not quite the &quot;10x better&quot; described here. Yet still, it grew. Why?<p>In startup mythology there&#x27;s a belief that you need to build a &quot;10x better&quot; product in order to get people to switch to it. This is generally good advice, because in most spaces it&#x27;s hard to get people to try your product at all, and it&#x27;s even harder to get people to actually switch to it.<p>Gaming is different, though. Gaming communities aren&#x27;t generally using your product for business-critical functions, are generally extremely receptive to trying new things, and are often led by enthusiast early adopters. As a result, gaming communities have uncharacteristically low switching costs. This explains why Discord was able to move gaming communities far more quickly than could ever be done with (for instance) corporate customers.<p>My hypothesis: Discord built a compelling product, and succeeded at talking to their early users and improving the product far faster than competitors. Because they built it for gamers, they didn&#x27;t need to be 10x better right away: they just needed to be faster (and to stay alive in the meantime).<p>If the above is true, the risk is that - especially as they move away from gaming and as they continue to move much more slowly than before - they can also lose that community to a better product very quickly, in exactly the same way.<p>Only time will tell if this is true or not, but since we launched our chat product in May we&#x27;ve been seeing support of it in the form of accelerating growth and in the form of entire large communities migrating from Discord to Guilded every day.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;discordapp&#x2F;comments&#x2F;j8siby&#x2F;discord_vs_guilded_a_quick_thoughtopen_discussion&#x2F;g8ey936" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;discordapp&#x2F;comments&#x2F;j8siby&#x2F;discord_...</a>')
