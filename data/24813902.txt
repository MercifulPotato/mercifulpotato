Obviously, Biden himself had no say or knowledge of the ridiculous article being blocked.<p>Also, this articles headline is inaccurate. Facebook and Twitter are private organizations and have a right to not allow certain things without it being censorship. Restaurants can keep out people known to defecate on the floors, Twitter and Facebook can stop By post garbage.<p>Censorship by nature is something a government does, not a private entity.
