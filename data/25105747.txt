I don&#x27;t like taking medications in general. I had heard that statins do lower cholesterol, but that studies (right or wrong) showed no decrease in mortality so why bother. That&#x27;s it. I was actually pleased with the red yeast results - the lower cholesterol would get doctors off my back and the reduced triglycerides was IMHO a very good thing! But yeah speculate about chance, or my subconscious remembering something I didn&#x27;t care about if I ever did hear it.<p>This is straight up some jackass trying to use a cute term - nocebo - to deflect blame for side effects onto patients. That&#x27;s a thing too.')
