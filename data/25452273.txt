I told the design team that 1) Its just bad design &#x2F; hostile to our users, and 2) that I&#x27;d quit before I&#x27;d build it for them.<p>It&#x27;s a hill I&#x27;d be happy to die on.  I feel like 6&#x2F;10 engineers wouldn&#x27;t care to have that fight, let alone risk their job over it.  I&#x27;m lucky to be in a position that I am even able to.  So many are not.  Yet another example for the banality of evil.')
