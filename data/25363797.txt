If your job does go full WFH, you can most likely keep your salary and then move, but then if you want to find a new job in a couple years, finding that same SF salary will be much tougher. I live in Dallas and have friends in Austin. 6 figure jobs are available, but you won&#x27;t find many (if any) of these 180-200+ type jobs outside SF and NYC.<p>Granted, $120k-150 for a single earner is plenty to live a good life in Texas, even in the cities (as long as you don&#x27;t have excessive personal debts). Something to think about that I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve probably considered.')
