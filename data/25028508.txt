Guix is smaller, but much cleaner in this regard. Julia can&#x27;t be used in Nix, and many Bioconductor packages are broken.<p>However, I feel like the existence of FHSUserenvs needs to be better advertised and documented. These give you the ability to easily install unpatched software that assumes a regular (FHS) Unix filesystem layout (&#x2F;bin, &#x2F;lib...).<p>Still, I think the benefits of using Nix and NixOS surpass the drawbacks right now. I use Nix in dozens of machines. It is, along with Arch, my favorite distribution. Both sit at two local maxima of the design space. Declarative-functional and imperative with a minimal layer of tooling.')
