I think the key point here is that the web is a radically different place than it was in 1998 (when Google launched and established the search engine paradigm as we know it). Back then the quality-to-spam ratio was probably much higher, the overall size of the web was certainly much smaller (making scraping the entire thing more tractable), and there were many more self-hosted sources rather than platforms (meaning it was more necessary to rely on inter-linking, and &quot;authoritative domains&quot; weren&#x27;t as much of a thing). The naive scraping approach was both more crucial and more effective. And in the decades since, it&#x27;s been a constant war of attrition to keep that model working under more and more adversarial conditions.<p>So I think that stepping back and re-thinking what a search engine fundamentally is, is a great starting point for disruption.<p>Additionally, something the OP didn&#x27;t mention is that ML technologies have progressed dramatically since 1998, and that much of that progress has been done in the open. I can&#x27;t imagine that not being a force-multiplier for any upstart in this domain.')
