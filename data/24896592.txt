Less time passes for the traveler.<p>Invent an engine efficient enough to allow constant 1g acceleration for years at a time and humans really could become interstellar.<p>The best ion engines get around 200,000 Isp. If you had a 500t ship burning 1t of mass per day, you would need an Isp of ~4.5m to achieve 1g over that first day (it gets easier as you get lighter).<p>The theoretical limit (ejecting mass out the back at 1c) for specific impulse is 300 million.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;space.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;840&#x2F;how-fast-will-1g-get-you-there" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;space.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;840&#x2F;how-fast-will-...</a>')
