If I start spouting insults, that&#x27;s not just off topic but abusive and I should expect to be treated accordingly. And if I do those sorts of things in multiple forums, I should expect to get a global reputation for not being a good participant and suffer the appropriate consequences.<p>But if I come into a cooking group and just talk about cooking, why should the information that I&#x27;m also in a completely different group talking about firearms even be relevant? Why should &quot;being a member of a group that talks about firearms&quot; be part of my global reputation at all?')
