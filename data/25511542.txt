Item(by='gkoberger', descendants=None, kids=[25513468], score=None, time=1608672959, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25511069, text='It&#x27;s complicated! I&#x27;ll do my best to explain it simply, but there&#x27;s a lot of nuance.<p>There&#x27;s a few different valuations. There&#x27;s how investors value it, which can be different between investors. There&#x27;s also a 409a valuation, which is what the government deems it to be &quot;actually worth&quot;.<p>But since the OP hasn&#x27;t vested, the number that matters here is the strike price at the time the OP got their shares, which is likely ~$100. At some point the OP wrote the company a check for $49 (or so) to &quot;legally buy&quot; their shares (49%). But they haven&#x27;t vested, so these shares are in a sort of &quot;limbo&quot;.<p>So, the company can&#x27;t just take them back, since it would be stealing $49. The OP also hasn&#x27;t earned the shares, per the vesting contract.<p>This means the company has to pay back the $49 if they&#x27;re going to take the shares back. It might seem silly to be talking about so little money, but that&#x27;s all the OP means (even if they don&#x27;t realize it) when they say the company has the right to buy back the shares.')
