The Lightning port is 10 years old. Apple supported Thunderbolt for its entire life as a standard. Apple was one of the first to use USB-A and supported it for ~20 years until they switched to USB-C (another standard).<p>Apple does tend to go <i>all in</i> on a bus, but they don&#x27;t change them often. You won&#x27;t find 8 different ports on a Mac to satisfy the previous 4 generations of various connector technologies.<p>Regardless, if you buy a USB-C powered computer, it doesn&#x27;t matter a bit what Apple does next year. It&#x27;s USB-C. Whether Apple changes next year or not, you can still buy cheap&#x2F; good third party USB-C charges and they are likely only going to get better.')
