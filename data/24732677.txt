Even if you assume exponential decay of labor as a percentage of the remaining cost, it can still add 5-10%, which is a meaningful fraction.  I don&#x27;t strictly disagree with the original post regarding labor not being the lion-share of many businesses.<p>As a nit to my original post, butchers was more meant to be representative of a class of service that is relied on by consumer-level providers. I think we can agree that it is fair to assume there are more than just first-order workers who make less than $24 a hour in most supply chains these days.')
