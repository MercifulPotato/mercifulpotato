I&#x27;m not going to pay to optimize the efficacy of the pills I get for a headache or heartburn or bloating or whatever. If I choose one brand&#x2F;compound over another and it&#x27;s 20% better...what&#x27;s that worth? $5&#x2F;year? Maybe?<p>I can see this being useful for problems that are not trivial. Heart medication. Cancer drugs. HIV medication. The sort of stuff where a 20% difference in efficacy is not the difference between me having an extra cup of coffee or not—it&#x27;s the difference between an extra year on medication and worse side effects or not (or even life and death).<p>But even then, you&#x27;re not selling to patients—it seems super unethical (or at least immoral) to profit from folks with serious illness who want to know what&#x27;s best going to keep them from dying. You sell this to the healthcare industry. But like the post says, doctors don&#x27;t...really care. Not that they shouldn&#x27;t care, but they don&#x27;t benefit personally, and the patients aren&#x27;t going to pay them more for it, and the industry will (slowly) get better on its own in the long term. That doesn&#x27;t feel great.<p>So to me, it seems almost obvious that the customer here is the pharmaceutical companies. They&#x27;ve got money to burn. They pay HUGE amounts of money for <i>display ads</i> and <i>instagram stories</i> which literally don&#x27;t even tell you what the damn drug does. During Ru Paul&#x27;s Drag Race this past week there was an ad for a medication which didn&#x27;t mention what it treats or who could take it.<p>Make the data free to consumers and doctors. Hire someone to call every cardiologist and HIV specialist and oncologist and whoever else in eastern standard time. &quot;Hey, I&#x27;ve got this thing that will tell you what&#x27;s likely the best drug for patients. It&#x27;s free to use, and we&#x27;ll send you a free mug after you use it 100 times.&quot; Then you call up every pharmaceutical company you can find and say &quot;Hey friends. We&#x27;ll put up a profile page for each of your drugs and make sure they&#x27;re represented with independently verified data. We&#x27;ve called X thousand doctors who will be using this. Pay us $Xk&#x2F;year and we&#x27;ll make this happen.&quot;<p>You could probably do the same thing for healthcare companies (e.g., Kaiser): &quot;pay for a license for all of your doctors and you&#x27;ll have better health outcomes for your patients.&quot;<p>This is obviously untested, but if you exclude the doctors and the patients as potential customers, you&#x27;re left with a pile of companies with a lot of money. I would love to hear from OP why this wasn&#x27;t something they pursued.')
