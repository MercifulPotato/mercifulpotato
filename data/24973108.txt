Doing any more frequently is too much overhead and cashflow isn&#x27;t a huge concern for me.<p>Just a thought... after I had a client try to not pay me &#x2F; slow pay me, I moved future contracts to a more aggressive invoicing &#x2F; payment schedule, plus I added a harsher late payment penalty. Especially if you have payroll to make, it becomes very important to never let a customer get too far into you.')
