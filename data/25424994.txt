Example: Women are, on average, slightly older than men (because of higher life expectancy). The p-value here is as close to zero as you&#x27;ll get in the real world.<p>But, given two randomly selected people, one male and one female,  knowing the above is close to useless! The probability of the woman being older differs from 0.5 by no more than a fraction of a percentage point.<p>- The difference b&#x2F;w mice and humans is that humans have the ability to overcome biology with reason.')
