But it lacks community, and stalled after 2.7 release.<p>All CPython alternatives stall do due to the widely used C API (required for NumPy, TensorFlow, etc). This API is very CPython specific.<p>There is some work on both sides, that might overcome the issue though: CPython is trying to decouple API from the implementation details, while .NET is working on better C interop story (.NET 5 just introduced ability to export managed functions as C functions).')
