It depresses the real value of labor wages.  That is almost definitionally the poor.<p>Consider:  You are spending 90% of your wages on day to day expenses and there is 2% targetted inflation.  You have lost a whopping ~20% of your margin of survival (100%-90% == 10% -&gt; 100% - 91.8% ~ 8%).  If you are spending 20% of your wages on day to day expenses and there is 2% targetted inflation, you have lost closer to 2% of your margin of survival.  It&#x27;s much easier to find lifestyle changes or, more likely, shift your investment balances that will keep you prospering in the &quot;wealthy&quot; situation.<p>And, before you say &quot;wages keep up&quot;.  No they don&#x27;t, otherwise the policy of using inflation to prop up employment doesn&#x27;t work via the policy mechanism.

You can&#x27;t do things like trade forex, place margin stock trades, place options, etc, so fluidly except in a low-interest rate, debt-fueled economy.  These debts are awesome because the nominal payback is diluted by real loss in purchasing value. By contrast, the poor are consumers of high interest rate debt.  Sometimes even in the annualized double digit regimes (sounds really bad, but this is usually short-term, on the order of weeks to months loans, so only slightly bad).  These financial instruments are NOT substantially ameliorated by inflation.  If you are in debt and poor, you are not waiting for hyperinflation to make it easier for you to pay off the repo man.')
