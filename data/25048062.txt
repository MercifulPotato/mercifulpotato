This is how the pilot of the Lion Air flight the day before prevented disaster.<p>&gt;At this point, I would consider it justice to see Boeing go bankrupt.<p>And what when this happens to Airbus, is that the end of air travel? As long as humans are involved, there will be issues. Airbus still averages pilot input, rather than providing feedback to each pilot, which has led to more than one accident (AF447 being one example, where one pilot tried to pull up out of a stall warning).')
