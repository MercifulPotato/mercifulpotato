Many staff at my wife’s work got infected. 0 deaths of those and 0 “long covids”.<p>I’m just saying that like with the flu, everyone around me who had COVID finds it laughable because it was actually milder than the flu. Feels to me like the people who get critically ill must be some really badly unhealthy people with some bad existing health issues. I’m not hand waving it, I’m just not very surprised and not freaking out when someone tells me that extremely unhealthy  people have health issues. I mean that’s kind of what unhealthy means at the end of the day, when your body is much weaker than the average person and vulnerable to benign viruses.<p>We had someone die in our family presumably from COVID, but that person was 94 and we were told that she probably won’t make this year already in November 2019, which was before COVID. It’s a perfect example where she ends up in the COVID statistic, but she didn’t die from COVID. She died because she was 94 and her body gave up no matter what she would’ve had.')
