I want to respond to you personally, because we did have someone raise a bit of hell about our CAA for these reasons. They did not have any contributed code, however. They were just a vocal third party.<p>In the end, if they have opposition to the CAA, they don&#x27;t sign it, and we make sure that we don&#x27;t merge pull requests whose contributors have not signed the CAA.<p>You have a moral opposition to the concept of the CAA or a CLA, and that&#x27;s perfectly fine, it just means you will not be able to contribute to NodeBB. Unfortunate, but our butts are protected and your rights are not potentially infringed upon.')
