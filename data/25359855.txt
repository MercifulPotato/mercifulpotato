This article does talk about managing cash flows in a way that involves never making a profit.<p>First, and tangentially, it&#x27;s interesting that real estate developers do this all the time.<p>Second, it&#x27;s interesting that this article shows not only why cable companies regional monopolies are extant, but also that their continued existence relies on the preservation of those monopolies.<p>These and other companies that rely on a strategy of unfettered subscriber growth, in this case leveraged as a marketing tool to creditors to acquire additional debt, is no different than a Ponzi scheme. It makes the fatal assumption that subscriber growth can continue ad infinitum.<p>But, similar to the amount of free energy in a system, the number of potential subscribers remaining is finite. Eventually, cash flows will fail to meet the projections sold to creditors and established as assumptions in their financial models.<p>Thus arises a situation that remains tenable only as long as subscribers remain subscribed for as long as is required to service the debt outstanding at the time the growth stopped. Because the debt didn&#x27;t go anywhere. It hasn&#x27;t disappeared. Today that debt is sitting on the balance sheet of every one of America&#x27;s cable providers: the direct result of a flawed line of thinking promoted by the author.<p>Consider the implications. To remove the regional monopolies of the cable companies is to not only destroy their subscriber base, and thus their cash flows, but also the cash flows promised to their legion creditors. Every one of these creditors now has a vested interest in the preservation of those monopolies, having themselves extended and received credit based on said promises of payment.<p>I propose that, contrary to the statements of the author, the proof presented by their friend is not &quot;framed incorrectly&quot;. Rather, it shows something the author doesn&#x27;t wish to see.')
