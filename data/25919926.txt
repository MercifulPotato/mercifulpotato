One of the benefits of plex is that it&#x27;s available on everything--iOS, roku, samsung TV, apple TV, you name it. However, most of those controls are not meant for arcade games.<p>If anyone from the plex team is reading this--I&#x27;d love to hear if there&#x27;s any plans for controller integration or anything?')
