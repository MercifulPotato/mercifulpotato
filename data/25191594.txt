You’d have to give up their subsidiaries as well: Whole Foods, Twitch, IMDb, ring, Audible, and even AWS. As well as several online large scale shops (many even based through Shopify) use Amazon’s delivery network for faster shipping.<p>Google and MSFT provide cloud services also but AWS for sure has a large grasp on the market. Whole Foods is fairly unique; you can give it up but I doubt most people will. Audible and Kindle definitely are at the top of the pack for what they do, and Twitch is unrivaled. In Hollywood IMDb is the fairly standard. Ring can be replaced with Nest but you’re just going from one large company to another.<p>Giving up just amazon’s retail platform is part of it but it’s just a piece of a larger conglomerate.<p>Out of the bunch you described I’d actually argue Apple is the simplest to give up since it’s a select few high end technology pieces, rather than several large footholds in several niches.')
