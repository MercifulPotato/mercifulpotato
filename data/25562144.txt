Sex education isn&#x27;t a high priority, so most people barely know sex, much less sex + tech, which is very much its own thing. That makes building technology like this extra fraught, because of the amount of thinking I have to do up front in order to try and guide things in as safe-ish a direction as possible.<p>As for talking to people about the project, I&#x27;ve been a public face for the field of sex tech since like 2005, so by this point I&#x27;m pretty used to it. It&#x27;s on my resume, I have academic publications and book chapters on the subject, I&#x27;ve spoken about it at all sorts of conferences around the world, so I&#x27;ve kinda settled into being &quot;The Buttplug Guy&quot;.<p>It took a ton of hard work and image building to get here though, so it&#x27;s a cliff I don&#x27;t really recommend anyone else try to climb without realizing how much work it is.')
