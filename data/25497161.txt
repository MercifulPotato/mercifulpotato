A modern story like this is The Boys where Butcher pursues his vision of justice to no end. To a man who seeks to right a deep wrong this seems prudent within the context of a fantasmal story about the plight of super heroes into super villains. I&#x27;ve debated with a number of people whether Butcher is an anti-hero and I&#x27;ve found most people don&#x27;t think so. The jurisprudence of his actions largely boiled down to, &quot;He was trying to do the right thing, right? Sometimes you must disregard the system to attain <i>real</i> justice. That doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as it bothers you.&quot; My takeaway was that we no longer fear the King Henry archetype, whereby an individual dawns the mask of judge, jury, and executioner. As long as justice is perceivably served then the means may not be laudable but they are passable. I don&#x27;t know if this translates into how people view the real world and interpret real life events, but if it does then it&#x27;s quite curious.')
