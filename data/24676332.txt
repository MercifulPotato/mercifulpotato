There are 3 main independent parameters you can tweak to improve maximum transmission range: transmit power (100,000x more power has been done commercially), antenna size (we now have a dish antenna over 250x larger), and you can increase the transmission frequency to substantially improve collimation by many orders of magnitude (e.g. use a laser instead of sub-GHz).<p>&gt; your friends on Earth pointing their antennas towards you are blinded by the star that practically touches your spaceship<p>A star puts out a lot of power, but it&#x27;s spread pretty evenly across a blackbody spectrum. You can certainly overpower it within a very narrow frequency range. Your bandwidth&#x2F;power ratio might be quite abysmal compared to wifi, but it&#x27;s workable.<p>&gt; How is SETI supposed to discover aliens who are not purposely beaming waves straight at us<p>I think the idea is that perhaps they would be beaming waves straight at various stars. This is something I can easily imagine humans doing in the near future.')
