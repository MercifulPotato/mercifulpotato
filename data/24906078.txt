It&#x27;s not the case that others don&#x27;t see the light and don&#x27;t grok the power and flexibility that those languages bring, but that those don&#x27;t really matter that much in most practical use cases, and that they&#x27;re even detrimental to building and maintaining a large code base with multiple developers.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s great that you can write your own control flow constructs. So what? A sane language already includes those constructs, and they&#x27;re known and understood by all users of the language without having to first read the documentation of some third-party lib (haha, just kidding, there is none â€“ read the code, dummy!).<p>[1] I don&#x27;t mean to imply that you&#x27;re one of them, I&#x27;m talking in general.')
