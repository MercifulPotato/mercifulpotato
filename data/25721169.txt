I feel sorry for the folks running some Linux desktop that don&#x27;t know why the option to start screen sharing just doesn&#x27;t exist in various apps.  I can imagine another Linux user saying &quot;but it is right there!&quot; to them, also not understanding why they have it but the person they&#x27;re talking to does not have screen sharing.')
