Same goes for newspapers.<p>If they could somehow target ads based on who&#x27;s watching, the ads would be massively more effective and they could charge a lot more for showing ads.<p>By targeting ads and charging so much more for ad time, some companies can even afford to offer their services for free, which massively increases the audience, which brings in more money, which gives them the budget to build a bigger, better service, which increases their audience, which brings them more money, etc etc<p>And that&#x27;s how you end up with Facebook and Google.<p>Obviously the problem is that this isn&#x27;t transparent. Many people don&#x27;t know why they get all of this complex technology for free. It&#x27;s not explained when you sign up for a new account.')
