There really is no way around that fact.<p>There are plenty of ways around that fact.<p>Preventing repair while changing nothing else generates more e-waste.  But that&#x27;s not what Apple does.<p>If you prevent repair in order to <i>also</i> do any or all of the following things at the same time enough, the result is <i>less</i> e-waste than if you didn&#x27;t prevent repair:<p>- Use less environmentally harmful materials (e.g. on-board sockets, larger PCBs etc)<p>- Make the device last longer before it needs repair (reliability, longevity)<p>- Make the device easier to recycle<p>&gt; Reuse and repair is FAR superior to recycle<p>It&#x27;s a good goal, but it&#x27;s only superior for sure if everything else is able to be kept the same to make it possible.<p>Some things really are better for the environment melted down and ground down and then rebuilt from scratch.  I&#x27;m guessing big old servers running 24x7 are in this category: Recycling the materials into new computers takes a lot of energy, but just <i>running</i> the old server takes a huge amount of energy over its life compared with the newer, faster, more efficient ones you could make from the same materials.  I would be surprised if not recycling was less harmful than recycling.<p>&gt; What good does it do? They are still harming the environment.<p>When saying Apple should change they way they manufacture to be more like other manufacturers for environmental benefit, Apple being rated number 1 tells you that the advice is probably <i>incorrect</i>, as following it would probably cause more environmental harm not less.')
