The company will just get someone else to do the job.  If you remove all programmers the shelves will be stocked at a slower rate.  If you remove all shelf stockers, the entire system falls apart and no shelves are stocked.<p>It certainly seems like the shelf stockers are more important to this process than the programmers.  They still provide value without the programmers but the programmers are entirely dependent on the shelf stockers to provide value.<p>Why do the programmers therefore get to claim the entire surplus in productivity if they are dependent on the shelf stockers for that productivity boost to actually materialize?')
