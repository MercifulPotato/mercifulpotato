There isn&#x27;t anything remotely similar in Paris. There are underground parking spaces but far from the necessary scale. Plus they are extremely expensive (4â‚¬&#x2F;hour is common).<p>Public transports are extensive, but they&#x27;re overcrowded and perpetually strained to the limit of breakage. This week, a 400 tons concrete beam fell on RER C tracks. I suppose it will be weeks before it runs normally again. This sort of problems happens constantly.<p>Paris resident are only about 30% to own a car (a constantly dwindling number). Most cars in Paris come from the suburbs, therefore making motorists miserable isn&#x27;t a problem for the mayor as most motorists vote elsewhere. This has the very unfortunate effect that nobody is really interested in solving the problem at its root.')
