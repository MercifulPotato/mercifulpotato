As a researcher in the field I feel bad people don&#x27;t give Google more credit (I have no affiliation with Google). They created a research environment where researchers have freedom to work on their own interests and publish papers (they publish more than any other company). You don&#x27;t find many environments like that outside of academia. I still remember Microsoft Research closing down their research lab in the west coast and sending a huge number of researchers home. I can tell you I always apply when there is an opening. So far without luck. If you&#x27;re a Google Researcher don&#x27;t forget how lucky you are.')
