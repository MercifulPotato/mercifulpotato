But that&#x27;s also true for science and everything else. We are individuals, in different situations, different problems, and different goals.<p>Philosophy teaches us how to think about our problems, goals, etc, and how to put them in perspective, value them, examine them, etc.<p>It doesn&#x27;t hand them out to us. Philosophy is not an oracle telling you what to do and absolving you from thinking (and that&#x27;s true whether some philosophers treated theirs as such or not).<p>In its totality, philosophy is the exact opposite, a set of prior observations, discussions, hypotheses, thinking tools and approaches, to make you think better and to give you the benefit of the insight of others.<p>You get that insight on technical matters from science.<p>You get that insight on meta-matters (thinking about thinking, morals, etc) from philosophy.')
