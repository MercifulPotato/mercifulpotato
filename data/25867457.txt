This model also limits the stock to whatever items are available on store shelves.<p>I put in an order later in the day, and half the stuff I ordered was unavailable because the store shelves weren&#x27;t being restocked before closing. I was stunned. I had naively assumed that the food was coming from an Amazon-like warehouse, where they knew exactly what was in stock prior to ordering. A pretty terrible experience overall.<p>I expect Amazon will at some point leverage Whole Foods to build a proper food warehouse with the experience we&#x27;ve come to expect from Amazon Prime. The big supermarket chains better get their act together quick, before Amazon eats their lunch.')
