A large amount of people seem to be unable to accept that others just prefer living in cities or the burbs or rural. \nI guess it&#x27;s part of our social hard-wiring. We can&#x27;t just accept that we like this thing, we also need to believe that it&#x27;s the best, and denigrate others who choose a different path.<p>I miss my public transit commute, my gym, my soccer club, and being able to go out with friends and just come across stuff happening. COVID has actually made it more clear to me that I&#x27;m a city person.')
