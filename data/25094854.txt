Police do encounter people with more serious warrants while responding to minor infractions or calls. Some of these individuals are dangerous. It&#x27;s best to have the equipment needed to deal with those situations. I think the shortfall is that some people lack the training to go with it.<p>are you saying police need to pull people over for minor infractions because a) this is a good way of catching people with serious warrants, or b) police need to pull over people for minor violations anyway <i>and</i> they need a gun in case the person turns out to be a violent criminal?<p>in the case of a), I think this is the kind of fishing expedition bs that makes it hard for people to trust the police. the idea that they are not just going to ticket you for the thing they actually saw you do, but also make the most of the opportunity to look for anything else you&#x27;ve done &#x2F; are doing wrong seems needlessly antagonistic. I would also question how much more effective this is than compiling a list of the fugitive&#x27;s vehicles, known associates&#x27; vehicles, stolen vehicles, etc. and just checking the license plate reader against it.<p>in the case of b), this is kinda my point. if there&#x27;s a meaningful chance that the officer or the offender ends up dead in a traffic stop, this should probably increase the threshold for what kind of offense justifies a stop. a broken brake light isn&#x27;t worth dying over for either party. just take a picture&#x2F;video and send a ticket to the owner of the vehicle.<p>in the case of an officer responding to a call, they no longer have the initiative to decide whether an interaction needs to take place. in this case, I think it is much more justifiable for the officer to be armed.')
