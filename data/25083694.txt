My understanding is that these VC-backed companies of Uber type are designed to run at a loss until a) the market dominance is achieved, at which point the prices are raised to get to profitability; b) it&#x27;s clear that the market dominance won&#x27;t be achieved any time soon, at which point the funding is pulled and VCs leave for greener pastures. Such companies aren&#x27;t designed to compete in your typical sense, i.e. by improving service or reducing operating costs. Instead it&#x27;s about which VC is ready to lose more money before their competitors go bust. Am I being too cynical here?')
