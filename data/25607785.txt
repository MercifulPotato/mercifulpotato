Generally, the difference between a good lawyer and a bad lawyer is that the good lawyer will counsel the client about the chances of <i>not</i> winning the case, especially after discovery has concluded, while a bad lawyer won&#x27;t.<p>If the the winnability of a case was apparent at the start, <i>there wouldn&#x27;t be a case</i> as the parties would settle before a formal lawsuit was filed. This happens very frequently, especially for labor cases where the employee has documented instances of harassment.<p>A lot of cases that appear to be &quot;winnable&quot; at the beginning turn out not to be winnable based on evidence that becomes available during discovery, and a lot of cases that didn&#x27;t appear to be winnable turn out to be slam dunks after discovery. Most of the landmark cases today were cases that didn&#x27;t appear &quot;winnable&quot; at the start (see, e.g., the DuPont and Erin Brokovich cases).<p>Moreover, for most cases of this type (and generally for almost all civil cases involving individual torts), lawyers work on a contingency basis for plaintiffs, so they only get paid if they win. The only lawyers that won&#x27;t handle civil torts for individual clients on a contingency basis are the bad ones who don&#x27;t expect to win, or the truly amazing ones that charge fixed or hourly fees because they&#x27;re so good that they can resolve the case without doing the amount of work that would justify a 30% or 40% fee.')
