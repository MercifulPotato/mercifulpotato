Git needs the &quot;rebase&quot; command to stitch independent histories together; Darcs doesn&#x27;t.<p>With Darcs, all merging can be thought of as rebasing, except histories remain compatible and mergeable. With Git, on the other hand, rebasing the same commits multiple times result in the same conflicts that need to be fixed every time, which is why &quot;rerere&quot; exists. Darcs does not need &quot;rebase&quot; or &quot;rerere&quot; or any of the other tools for complicated history surgery.<p>As for workflows that &quot;require any of those properties&quot;: There&#x27;s wide agreement that Git is overly complex (exhibit A: hundreds of HN posts about learning to use Git) and is especially daunting for beginners, compared to easier tools like Subversion and Mercurial that provide nicer UIs. Darcs brings modern version control to users without incurring the complexities of Git.<p>It&#x27;s not perfect — it had&#x2F;has corner cases where merging became computationally expensive, though I hear there are new developments to fix this — which is why I said the future isn&#x27;t Darcs.')
