Looking at my own residential public address it calls it a &#x27;low risk proxy&#x27; when I can assure that it most definitely is not. It doesn&#x27;t help that their explanation for how they attempt to detect this is a pile of marketing word salad. I don&#x27;t expect them to be completely transparent to their methodology, but they should make some attempt at presenting a bit of technical background.')
