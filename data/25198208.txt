I’ve started coding at around age 12 and coded as a job since around age 16. Later I did an apprenticeship as a Software Developer and supported teams right after that. At 19, I was a self-employed contractor for a German car manufacturer, later on, I contracted with a for a Swiss company, … .  I managed to save a lot of money and make some with good investments. Right now I have about 80K cash and 120K in stocks.<p>My monthly expenses are all-inclusive around 2K which includes health insurance, rent, … — so I could actually do nothing for 8 years.  I’m not happy with the management and as a single contractor I just get to support a team and basically work on it as an extern.<p>What I’d really like to do is get contracts and do them with a team of my choice — I had the opportunity to meet many brilliant people that I now consider good friends.<p>Problem is that acquisitions take a lot of time and energy and while we are trying to get some gigs on the side (2 Weeks in) it’s hard to do as a part-time job.<p>Generally, I’m also interested in getting a CS degree but I need to lean a lot of math first (already have the books here, but lacking time). While doing all of that I’m doing a bit of electronics and 3D Printing on the side as well.  I often think about leaving the Project I’m currently involved in and just do nothing for a while. I know myself well enough that I will end up working on things that I’m passionate about and will probably have a lot more energy to find projects that are interesting for me and friends.<p>Would be interested in what you think — especially people with more life experience. I’m a bit worried of reentering the marked after not having a proper project for a year but guess it&#x27;s not a problem.<p>Thanks a lot in advance.')
