Item(by='graderjs', descendants=None, kids=[25109508], score=None, time=1605269531, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25079095, text='Wow, this comment is awesome. It&#x27;s really got a lot of attention. People are extremely engaged with my response.<p>Them: Why say logo?<p>Me: Because is logo.<p>Others: !!!!!!!!<p>What can explain this? Is it just people jealous that some &quot;design&quot; thing got to top of Show and onto front page, and they want to find a way to try to pretend it&#x27;s wrong, and they see a bit of grey comment and they jump on thinking, &quot;Yes, this makes me right!&quot;<p>The comment cannot be faulted on its merits. It directly addresses the questions and provides interesting and useful information.<p>Seems people are unhappy with the dissent. Do these people dislike it when someone speaks up against someone who questions you?... So they expect silence? And the purpose of the negative score is because they want to try punish for...they&#x27;re own misplaced feelings?<p>It&#x27;s an honor that my success so infuriates a handful of haters, it makes the success seem even more significant than without the hate. But I actually feel bad for you. I don&#x27;t want to think you suffer because I do well. I want to think you can be lifted up by it, too, but honestly, your feelings are not my responsibility. So if you feel threatened by it, as much as I wish that weren&#x27;t the case, for your sake, there&#x27;s nothing I can do about that for you, and that&#x27;s only your responsibility. So, as much as it&#x27;s illuminating, to be a first hand witness to this sort of pathology,  it really shouldn&#x27;t be a part of the medium. But because there&#x27;s no way to remove it without losing the power of fading out comments...I may choose to speak up against it, like today.')
