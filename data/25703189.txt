I understood everything in that post except this paragraph.<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;\nLanguages like Erlang must implement tail call optimizations, since\npersisted data is stored as &quot;loop variables&quot; in infinite loops.\nThis happens when we write code like this:<p><pre><code>     loop(Data) -&gt;\n          ....\n ...\n loop(newData).\n</code></pre>\nWhen I see code like this I mentally &quot;see&quot; the last call as a &quot;jump&quot;\nto the start of the code, rather than a recursive call to loop.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>What is the loop(Data), loop(newData) doing? Would be great if someone could elaborate on this point.')
