At first I balked at the syntax.<p>I can see $foo on the right of the equals sign, but on the left?  And $_ and @_ and regular expressions everywhere like line noise.<p>But working with it for a bit... and all of that just disappeared as I became fluent.  They just started becoming idioms in my head.  And after a while, I found Perl the most expressive language I&#x27;ve ever worked with.<p>So, maybe you just have to get over the hump?<p>(But yeah, I thought python was too ordered, but I switched and it&#x27;s pretty much my favorite language presently)')
