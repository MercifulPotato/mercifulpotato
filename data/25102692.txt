Item(by='Yetanfou', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605460216, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25102580, text='&gt; I disagree with pretty much every statement you&#x27;ve made here.<p>As long as you do not want to make it impossible for me to say these things I&#x27;m fine with that.<p>&gt; Extremist views on one side do not &quot;balance&quot; extremist views on the other side.<p>They don&#x27;t, but having views from both sides of the spectrum available to the public makes it clear to them that what is written on the one side is not gospel. Having only one side represented in the media means that people will not be confronted with opposing views.<p>&gt; &quot;Left&quot; media is already more Centrist than Liberal&#x2F;Socialist.<p>That is besides the point, this being that there needs to be a balance in the way the news is reported. That is also why I stated that there needed to be media on &quot;the right of the middle&quot;, not &quot;on the extreme right&quot;. There is a difference here, not everything to the right of the middle is &quot;extreme&quot;, just like you stated for the left.<p>&gt; Centrist views are already the majority held beliefs. 42% of registered voters are Independent.<p>They are but they are not the ones driving opinions in the media. If they were the problems I mentioned would not exist. The New York Times would not have pushed the <i>1619 project</i> to give an example. They would have reported on it but not pushed it as an alternative history. The media views centrism as &#x27;boring&#x27;, probably because media consumers are more attracted to the simplified world view professed by more opinionated writers. Good versus bad is a large driving factor here through times, from the &quot;good free west&quot; to the &quot;evil dictatorial east&quot; of the 50&#x27;s to the current &quot;good ethnic minorities&quot; to the &quot;evil white patriarchal cis-gendered majority&quot;. The former gave us McCarthyism, the latter gives us Wokeism. These will be seen in a similar light by historians.')
