I&#x27;m an early engineer at a startup (took job right out of college), considering a career move and I&#x27;d like some advice.<p>What I&#x27;ve learned:<p>* Language proficiency: I am proficient in $LANGUAGE because $COMPANY uses it for everything, really nice to sit down and write code without Googling.<p>* Full stack: I&#x27;ve done everything: AWS, infrastructure as code, database design, security, Web development, system architecture, etc. I love the breadth.<p>* Data: I work with data a lot and am good at wrangling it now.<p>* Management: I&#x27;ve been managing a team for a while now and have grown a lot from it.<p>* Communication: I&#x27;ve gotten better, but not great - hardest thing for me is convincing non-technical leadership how certain engineering investments are necessary &#x2F; will pay off in the long run.<p>What I want:<p>* Engineering excellence: I want to be on a team where I feel junior.<p>* Less stress: I&#x27;m married and want to have more time with my spouse.<p>* Positive environment: Don&#x27;t want to lose that.<p>* Remote: Again, want to keep this. (I am not in a tech scene like SF.)<p>So now I&#x27;m looking for a senior engineering role elsewhere. Advice on how to pick a company&#x2F;team? I&#x27;m interviewing at companies whose products I&#x27;ve used before, and that seem solid, but perhaps the one I&#x27;m most worried about is gauging &quot;engineering excellence.&quot; How do I know I won&#x27;t be disappointed there? Some places do have more talent than others right?<p>In the longer-term I want to start a tech company or tech-focused non-profit, building an awesome product &#x2F; product suite. Might even want to start building that on the side with my next role, as long as the time commitment is lower.<p>Thanks for any advice you can offer! :) It&#x27;s nerve-wracking to leave my first job, a good job, and not know if I&#x27;m going someplace better or not - especially when I read Glassdoor and see people complaining about things, or when it seems the places I&#x27;m interviewing are second-tier.')
