Indeed, that was the point of the example being provided by the poster you replied to: her staff quit because they acted based on a hysterical rather than rational analysis of the situation. They didn&#x27;t break a law by quitting, but that doesn&#x27;t mean this is something to take lightly or ignore. Mass hysteria is a very, very dangerous path to go down -- it&#x27;s not something to brush off.')
