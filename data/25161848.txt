Being able to visually look at timelines and set tweening by dragging a slider is much more my speed, and reminiscent of Flash, which I haven&#x27;t done anything on in more than 10 years.<p>Best of all, it&#x27;s a one-time payment. I considered Adobe Animate, but monthly subscriptions are a total no-no for me.')
