There are however many asteroids that would be valuable (or so we suspect). When earth formed heavy stuff sunk to the bottom and light stone rose to the top, and as a consequence e.g. most metal is in Earth&#x27;s core, out of reach. On some asteroids valuable material is much more plentiful than in the parts of earth we can reach')
