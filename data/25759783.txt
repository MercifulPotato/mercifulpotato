However, none of that is the law.<p>I strongly agree that Facebook, Twitter, et al have disproportionate influence due to the strong network effects of their user bases.<p>And I believe that we should take steps to limit that power and influence.  However, modifying&#x2F;repealing Section 230 is not the way to do so.<p>In fact, reducing or eliminating the protections of Section 230 would have the opposite effect, because only those with deep, deep pockets could continue to operate in a world without Section 230.<p>I made other suggestions[0] which I think could help by providing other places for people to go.<p>Any success would depend on folks voting with their feet.  Let&#x27;s make that easy to do and give people a better, more positive experience, with more privacy and choice and less ads and tracking, and people will run away from these monsters.<p>I&#x27;ll say it again.  Repealing&#x2F;weakening Section 230 would hurt <i>everyone</i> else much more than it would hurt Facebook and Twitter.  In fact, it would significantly harm free speech on the Internet -- which is what Section 230 was designed to (and has done for 25 years) protect.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25688032" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25688032</a>')
