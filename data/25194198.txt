For example, PC 25400 has extra penalties if the firearm is loaded or if, &quot;...the unexpended ammunition capable of being discharged from it are in the immediate possession of the person or readily accessible to that person.&quot; That makes your suggestion just as illegal as carrying a loaded handgun.<p>&gt;  Close protection details for large US corps virtually never fire a shot in anger. It is a once-per-decade event.<p>The point of a concealed handgun is to react as quickly as possible to what is usually a once-in-a-lifetime event. Even if it only takes an extra second to load a magazine into a firearm, that second can mean the difference between preventing a murder or not. It doesn&#x27;t matter how rare the event is. It matters what the consequences are.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leginfo.legislature.ca.gov&#x2F;faces&#x2F;codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&amp;sectionNum=25400" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leginfo.legislature.ca.gov&#x2F;faces&#x2F;codes_displaySectio...</a>.')
