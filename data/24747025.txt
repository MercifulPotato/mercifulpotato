Item(by='joncrane', descendants=None, kids=[24747104], score=None, time=1602434415, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24746933, text='&gt;the way to make fusion generate power more efficiently without changing the underlying technology is to make it bigger<p>Actually there was a front page item on here a couple of weeks ago showing that there&#x27;s a new superconductor that can generate a stronger magnetic field, which will allow new, much smaller fusion reactors.  So according to the guy from MIT who gave the talk, ITER is already obsolete technology.<p>Having said that, with fusion, it looks like every time they have a breakthrough, they find a new limiting factor when then takes billions to overcome, rinse and repeat.<p>It&#x27;s amazing in theory but we have yet to achieve a fusion reaction that is energy positive and the path to that is still fraught.  In theory with these Lithium neutron blankets you can even create your own fuel (Assuming Deuterim-Tritium reaction) but the hurdles are still insanely high to get something that&#x27;s actually practical.<p>Also, I believe fission and fusion can be synergistic in that you can have a fission reactor that not only produces energy, but it produces some of the fuel for the fusion.')
