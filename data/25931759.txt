This is more like a hearty f-u to the people doing the hyper-aggressive shorting. It might make some redditors a nice bundle of money at the expense of some hedge funds in the short term.<p>GameStop, AFAIK, is a dead-end strip-mall based retailer who, much like Blockbuster, has failed to adapt to changes in the last few years. They&#x27;ve lost something like a billion dollars and nothing is looking up for them as far as their actual business goes. Gamestop likely doesn&#x27;t have a plan for revitalization unless that involves liquidation or getting bought out. I expect they&#x27;re utterly blindsided by these recent events-- they&#x27;ve been very quiet about it. Gamestop surely knows this won&#x27;t end well for them.<p>Is there a place for GameStop-like retail in dying suburban strip-malls? Sure. Are they a growth industry? nope! The Hedge-fund guys are ultimately &quot;correct&quot; that GameStop has no future. I just hope that all the reddit kids who bought this stock are fully aware that the last ones holding the bag are going to lose money, but I feel nothing but elation at the hedge funds losing a ton of money over something so ridiculous.')
