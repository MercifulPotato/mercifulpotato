Item(by='burntsushi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604334076, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24957712, text='&gt; Well I&#x27;ve never understood what you&#x27;re hoping to accomplish with any of this<p>I said as much in the opening of my post. I get into both philosophical and practical discussions on licensing online fairly frequently, and the same questions and arguments are recycled over and over. So I wrote them down primarily so that I can reference them.<p>As far as my beliefs, ideally, I want to see IP abolished. So what if it&#x27;s quixotic? I have plenty of other quixotic beliefs. I&#x27;d like to see the war on drugs ended too. I don&#x27;t see a problem with having these beliefs.<p>You might say it&#x27;s a waste of time to have and act on these beliefs. I think it should be clear from my post that I at least partially agree with that, since I&#x27;ve continually acted as a pragmatist rather than as an idealist. But that doesn&#x27;t mean I can&#x27;t take some small steps toward the ideal while I&#x27;m at it.<p>Sometimes shifting the Overton window just a little bit is a big victory.<p>&gt; (As a legal realist, I think we should evaluate law like any other human activity; licenses that lead to outcomes that we want are good, licenses that lead to outcomes that we don&#x27;t want are bad).<p>I don&#x27;t really share that view when it comes to law, so we probably have some really fundamental disagreement somewhere. But, I do think elements of legal realism are important. They just aren&#x27;t what form the bedrock of my beliefs.<p>&gt; I, at least, assume that when someone uses a license that grants me permission to do something (such as falsely claim authorship of their code), they approve of me doing that thing, because that&#x27;s what people granting permission in a license normally mean by that grant of permission.<p>To me, that implies you conflate laws with ethics. Again, probably due to some fundamental disagreement on the nature of law (or ethics).<p>This is not too dissimilar from the common refrain of, &quot;I may not agree with what you have to say, but I support you&#x27;re right to say it.&quot; It&#x27;s an explicit acknowledgment that there&#x27;s a difference between what&#x27;s legal and what&#x27;s ethical&#x2F;preferential&#x2F;whatever.')
