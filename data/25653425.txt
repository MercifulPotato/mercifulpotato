I wasn&#x27;t enlightened, despite expecting to be, from a bunch of HN posts like this.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;andychu&#x2F;hatlog" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;andychu&#x2F;hatlog</a><p>For example, can someone add good error messages to this?  It didn&#x27;t really seem practical.  I&#x27;m sure I am missing something, but there also seemed to be a lot of deficiencies.<p>In fact I think I learned the opposite lesson.  I have to dig up the HN post, but I think the point was &quot;Prolog is NOT logic&quot;.  It&#x27;s not programming and it&#x27;s not math.<p>(Someone said the same thing about Project Euler and so forth, and I really liked that criticism.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lobste.rs&#x2F;s&#x2F;bqnhbo&#x2F;book_review_elements_programming" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lobste.rs&#x2F;s&#x2F;bqnhbo&#x2F;book_review_elements_programming</a> )<p>Related thread but I think there was a pithy blog post too: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18373401" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18373401</a> (<i>Prolog Under the Hood</i>)<p>Yeah this is the quote and a bunch of the HN comments backed it up to a degree:<p><i>Although Prolog&#x27;s original intent was to allow programmers to specify programs in a syntax close to logic, that is not how Prolog works. In fact, a conceptual understanding of logic is not that useful for understanding Prolog.</i><p>I have programmed in many languages, and I at least have a decent understanding of math.  In fact I just wrote about the difference between programming and math with regards to parsing here:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oilshell.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;comments-parsing.html#what-programmers-dont-understand-about-grammars" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oilshell.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;comments-parsing.html#w...</a><p>But I had a bad experience with Prolog.  Even if you understand programming and math, you don&#x27;t understand Prolog.<p>I&#x27;m not a fan of the computational complexity problem either; that makes it unsuitable for production use.')
