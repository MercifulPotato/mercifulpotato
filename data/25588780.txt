Products used by billions of people may just as well not have serious requirements. I beg not to debate semantics, indeed my own fault, but in the world of network software requirements can start to get very serious, straight through to userspace protocol stacks on DMA&#x27;ed device buffers.<p>Would you go through all of the effort to rig an application with userspace networking only to return its results inside an `std::string` -- one of the few std containers where one can&#x27;t even control the allocator <i>if they wanted to</i>?
