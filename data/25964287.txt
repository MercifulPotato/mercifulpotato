The pundit consensus what that that it would be a bad, deep, long bear market.<p>Same for the post-Covid tech boom, which few foresaw too.<p>GME is not crashing as everyone is expected it to, even with Robinhood restricting buys. It is up huge today. I think this has a lot more to run, IMHO. More shorts will get squeezed out next week.<p>Like Tesla, GME may not really end badly at all and just keep going up and up.<p>I own some GME and not worried. Yeah, it is not that much of my total net  worth,  but I have found that heeding warnings of bubbles usually just means selling too soon.<p>If GME does crash, there will be no systemic risk or anything like that. It will be an isolated event.')
