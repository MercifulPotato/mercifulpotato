But maybe that&#x27;s an ebb-and-flow issue as well. I tried adding React to an existing project last week, and was completely unable to. Everything broke. I&#x27;m debating which is the less-bad option - create a new repo, starting with React and gluing everything else around it, or moving just-the-react parts into a repo of their own. I&#x27;m tired of trying to figure out how to glue disparate, opinionated things together. I&#x27;m missing the Unix philosophy the author is talking about.')
