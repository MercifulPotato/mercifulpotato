Innovation is more likely to occur when people cross disciplines and they can only do that if it is approachable, it is gradual and discoverable.  Simple is hard, simplistic is easy. Someone is going to come back with essential vs accidental complexity [1] but we can always strive for simpler, more cohesive ways to exchange knowledge. How much of our current notation systems are essential? And when do they diverge for non-essential reasons? Computer systems form primarily around notation (language and syntax), so notation is definitely important [z]<p>In the post the author mentions an excellent talk by Guy Steele that goes over issue of notation and balkanization titled, &quot;It&#x27;s Time for a New Old Language&quot; where he outlines &quot;the history and current status of computer science metanotation&quot;. [2]<p>Notation, like syntax is important, but like a plethora of ill defined and specified Domain Specific Languages (DSL), notation also needs to be defined, regular and learnable. For notation takes words and turns them into pictures that compose into thought structures that cannot be expressed in human written language to the same specificity. Think Feynman [3] and Railroad [4]  Diagrams, or musical notation [5]<p>The abstract explains it beautifully,<p>&gt; The most popular programming language in computer science has no compiler or interpreter. Its definition is not written down in any one place. It has changed a lot over the decades, and those changes have introduced ambiguities and inconsistencies. Today, dozens of variations are in use, and its complexity has reached the point where it needs to be re-explained, at least in part, every time it is used. Much effort has been spent in hand-translating between this language and other languages that do have compilers. The language is quite amenable to parallel computation, but this fact has gone unexploited.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simplicable.com&#x2F;new&#x2F;accidental-complexity-vs-essential-complexity" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simplicable.com&#x2F;new&#x2F;accidental-complexity-vs-essenti...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7HKbjYqqPPQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7HKbjYqqPPQ</a><p>slides, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;groups.csail.mit.edu&#x2F;mac&#x2F;users&#x2F;gjs&#x2F;6.945&#x2F;readings&#x2F;Steele-MIT-April-2017.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;groups.csail.mit.edu&#x2F;mac&#x2F;users&#x2F;gjs&#x2F;6.945&#x2F;readings&#x2F;St...</a><p>paper, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sci-hub.st&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;3155284.3018773" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sci-hub.st&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;3155284.3018773</a><p>[3] 6 minute video from Fermilab on Feynman Diagrams <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hk1cOffTgdk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hk1cOffTgdk</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sqlite.org&#x2F;syntaxdiagrams.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sqlite.org&#x2F;syntaxdiagrams.html</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mfiles.co.uk&#x2F;music-notation-history.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mfiles.co.uk&#x2F;music-notation-history.htm</a><p>[z] Wadler&#x27;s Law')
