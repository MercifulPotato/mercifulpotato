Anyone who dies with 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 is counted as a Covid death, don&#x27;t think there are exceptions for obvious things like motor-cycle accidents and definitely not for heart attacks (some of those probably are caused by Covid). Also, the NHS is testing almost everyone admitted to hospital. Used to be anyone who died at any point after testing positive but that messed with the figures too much and made it impossibe to see any actual increase in Covid deaths.<p>This is one of many reasons that it&#x27;s difficult to compare death figures from different countries.')
