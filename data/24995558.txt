If it is correlated with preferences on the issues polled <i>even controlling for</i> non-preference demographics, it&#x27;s not going to be correctable by that means, nor is it going to be measurable so that it can be corrected.<p>OTOH, <i>if</i> it is a long-term consistent effect tied to partisan presidential voting preferences across election (and not, e.g., tied to the particular transitory trends, or evolving significantly over time) you could, as a poll-based forecaster, correct for the effect without measuring the correlation in preference and response rates by adjusting how you draw forecasts from polling data by correctingnbased on empirical election results and their relation to polls.')
