Item(by='filar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608481782, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25486760, text='I have used PJON, with the SWBB and DUDP strategies, for my home automation setup for at least 4 years. I do not need the kilometer range of SWBB, but have stretches of tens of meters running alongside 220V AC wires with no problems, in both star and daisy-chained topologies. The system is very stable, and I would like to point out that the alternatives I looked at before required me to buy extra hardware&#x2F;shields that cost more than the Arduinos themselves to get going. With PJON it is just connecting to the pins in the most inexpensive way. This plus multimaster, the strength against interference, the long cable lengths and few topology limitations makes it a clear choice for many purposes. Plus, it is free :-)')
