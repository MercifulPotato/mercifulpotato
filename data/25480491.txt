I appreciate the warning about the slow-loading graph (which did load after a minute or two).<p>Two things that might be tweaked:<p>* The search didn&#x27;t behave in an ergonomic way: I typed a query (&quot;graph neural networks&quot;) and great relevant stuff came up immediately in the dropdown.  When I hit enter, however, I got an error that read &quot;Invalid search: Check your spelling, enter a DOI, or another paper identifier\nor.&quot;  I would have expected my action to take me to a search results page that listed what I saw in the dropdown (which I regard as a preview of the top hits) so that I could peruse the selection carefully.<p>* I wanted to load a paper to take a look at it and it took me a while to realize that I could click the &quot;Yes&quot; above &quot;Open Access&quot; to download it.  Since one of the big use cases for a site like this is the eventual consumption of these papers, I suggest making a &quot;read&#x2F;download paper&quot; call to action more explicit.')
