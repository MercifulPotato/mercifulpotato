The solar+battery kit is cheaper than the cost to run the underground wires.  The real jokes is that with the days so short, and the nights so cold, some poles are running out of power just before dawn.  There have been experiments with running intersections (traffic lights etc) on solar as that can really reduce installation costs at remote locations.')
