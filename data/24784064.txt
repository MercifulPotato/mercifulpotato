People are not upset that this event could have been communicated better, they&#x27;re reasonably pissed that Twitter is very obviously filtering news on its platform for political purposes.<p>There is no evidence that the stuff in question was &quot;hacked,&quot; and Twitter itself is becoming a disseminator of disinformation by stating so. But even if it were - they gave no such affordance to, for example, Trump&#x27;s tax returns, which could have only been hacked&#x2F;leaked&#x2F;stolen to be released. That&#x27;s a straight-up double standard.')
