Before that Windows CE, 95 and think Vista or 7 was the last.<p>I was curious about what Windows looks like these days as it&#x27;s been a decade and also curious about WSL2 as it seems online posts are generally positive over WSL. The surface go &#x2F; surface line of devices looked interesting for a nsmall, stuff in the bag while traveling doing email&#x2F;browsing&#x2F;office type of machine. I was tempted to buy one to see what they are about.<p>At a contracting gig last year I was given a Windows machine. I&#x27;m not sure if it was because it wasn&#x27;t the best and typical corporate laptop specs, or if it was because of the corporate lock-down, installed software, av, and other junk but my eagerness to try modern Windows and WSL2 quickly diapered. I struggled getting docker running, i struggled running docker in the subsystem, i found things where not working in the subsystem, had difficulty with paths etc. In the end the machine went back and I got a mac and was up and running in an hour with full dev environment and everything set up how I like using nix-darwin. Same for the other devs, they where unable to get a working dev environment on windows so sent the machines back for macs.<p>Some of it will certainly be my unfamiliarity but it just didn&#x27;t seem compelling enough to overcome. Clicking the start menu and seeing ads instead of finding programs was a blatant yes this is windows moment.Even the UI &#x2F;UX felt old which seems odd given that Microsoft have quite a lot of material out on user interaction and ux research.<p>An interesting observation about modern Microsoft is a lot of the onsite Microsoft Azure employees seem to be using Macs and Microsoft give them the option of running Macs.')
