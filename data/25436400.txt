I don&#x27;t even see how it&#x27;s remotely possible for a full 40% of NYC&#x27;s population to have turned over in the span of 9 months.  New lease signings are <i>down</i>, not up many hundreds of percentage points!  Every single thing that would have to be true for this to be true as well, isn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s bad methodology from one company trying to get its name in the news and then a media outlet running an uncritical article using this as fact.<p>We just had an election.  Go look at the voter rolls and who actually voted, and for the absentee ballots, where the absentee ballots were sent.  There&#x27;s no way in hell 40% of the voter rolls have turned over since the last time we held an election.  The data is out there to easily disprove this ridiculous notion.')
