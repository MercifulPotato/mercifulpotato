There are a few large differences between chat and email, so it&#x27;s not a great comparison.<p>1) length -- most emails are significantly longer than any <i>single</i> chat message<p>2) context -- email threads are saved (and indexed) in the context of their thread.<p>With chat, you really don&#x27;t get ether, so it&#x27;s significantly more difficult. You can never really know what a message is a reply to. Responses can come fast or slow. Individual channels can have multiple conversations happening, if not simultaneously, then at least over time.<p><i>&gt; as long as people use the tags</i><p>I mean, that&#x27;s the difficulty with any system... getting people to use it. If your team can be disciplined about the tags, then I&#x27;m glad that works for you. I not sure it would work well in many other contexts.<p>I&#x27;ve tried a few different options over the years, from archiving&#x2F;indexing IRC chat logs, to bug trackers, to wikis, to email, to Slack, to Notion, etc...<p>Almost anything can work if you&#x27;re disciplined. My problem has always been getting the rest of the team on board.')
