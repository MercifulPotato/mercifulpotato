As I understand the surplus was socialized and they turned education, transportation, libraries and so on into public, free services.<p>In real terms this meant you were able to just get your bread from a bakery without paying or otherwise trading directly, if you provided your services for free as well. Turns out that many donâ€™t need greed, nor coercion as a motivation to contribute to their community, if that community is based on freedom and equality.<p>I think this kind of society is something that is worth thinking about and even a goal worth working towards in some capacity. So much energy and time is lost by working against each other, which is really disheartening.')
