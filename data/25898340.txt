For the same throughput you generally need more expensive equipment to obtain the same level of reliability.<p>Where with the previous calculations it may cost X dollars for equipment, using the new calculations you may need to use a larger antenna or a more power transmitter, costing sometimes 2-3x, if it&#x27;s even possible at all. Many times the link is just no longer viable at the required reliability.<p>Rain rates are typically measured in mm&#x2F;hr but it&#x27;s an instantaneous rate, but what I&#x27;ve observed in 2020 is instantaneous peak rates easily 50% higher (indicated by signal attenuation levels) than 2019&#x2F;2018. I&#x27;m not aware of any standard meteorological way to measure this as it seems most measurements are done as cumulative over minutes&#x2F;hours&#x2F;days, when the effects on microwave signals are in the seconds and minute scales.<p>Certainly can&#x27;t establish as causal relationship with climate change, especially since my observations are on the scale of just a few years, but it shows the danger in simply relying on low resolution historical 10&#x2F;50&#x2F;100yr data for infrastructure design.')
