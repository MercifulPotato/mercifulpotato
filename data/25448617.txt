The middle column had Doing and Follow up files.<p>The rightmost column had Done and Projects files.<p>My done would be archived each week with a script and a new done file opened for the upcoming week.<p>If there were any other major files I wanted (for example I would maintain a ling term projects file) that would be opened in a different buffer in the VIM app containing the projects file.<p>Moving items from one folder to another was as simple as quickly navigating to that folder, using a shortcut to yank or cut the line to the global clipboard, ans then pasting it to the file I wanted to move it to.<p>I suspect it would have been trivial to write a script that would have automatically moved the entire line over with a single shortcut.<p>There is absolutely no additional overhead and it works extremely fast and well.')
