I think the danger comes from the potential for abuse. Once you ship software that has failing tests, you&#x27;ve established a precident and are likely to face pressure to do so again even when the tests are more critical. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;d resist that, at least. My experience is if there&#x27;s a real problem and later everything in production is on fire, no one cares about the caveats or risks you pointed out.<p>I do also agree that CI can hide complexity, but that&#x27;s true of any tool as well as non-CI builds. Compared to a human running things, it&#x27;s at least somewhat self-documenting due to being scripted.')
