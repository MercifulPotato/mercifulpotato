Theyâ€™d feel like they had arrived at great epiphanies or accomplished something impressive after solving trivial or obvious problems.

We politely hinted that they should stop when they struggled to keep up in meetings and conversations.<p>This sounds like <i>extremely</i> distorted cognitive behavior, when microdosing is &quot;supposed to be&quot; done at sub-perceptual levels (suggesting they weren&#x27;t actually <i>micro</i>dosing).
