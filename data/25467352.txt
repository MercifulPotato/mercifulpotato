Essentially what that means is that if you are able to lay out a strong case for your viewpoint while also keeping your emotions in check, you might have an effect on people around you (like the kids) who see you as a calm and rational person and therefore more trustworthy. This also has the added benefit of making anyone listening in more receptive to your ideas moving forward, and could (if exposed to the ideas enough) change their views over time.<p>Sometimes you&#x27;re just not going to convince someone to stop believing a conspiracy theory; accepting that and trying to constructively argue without any expectation of changing their opinion will be more beneficial for everyone.<p>FYI (in case it&#x27;s not clear) I am fully in support of the science behind the vaccine.')
