Item(by='underdeserver', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603617765, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24884083, text='It&#x27;s not just the output of their team; compared to people like Bellard (and John Carmack, Jeff Dean, Peter Norvig, ...), 99.99% of people are mediocre. Increasing the output of 100 mediocre people by 20%-30% is worth more than contributing one person&#x27;s output, even if it&#x27;s 10x or 20x.<p>And I would argue the difference between a mediocre manager and a good manager is more than that.')
