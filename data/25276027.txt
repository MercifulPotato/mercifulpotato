In practice, of course Taiwan has no interest in claiming all of China. The claim, which dates back to the days of dictator Chiang Kai Shek, stays on the law books because the government of Taiwan is literally threatened with war by China every time they move towards updating it to a more realistic position. Everyone on both sides knows the claim is just a relic from the past. \nLeading with saying &quot;The ROC claims all of China&quot; does not help anyone understand the situation.\nFurther,  I wouldn&#x27;t say the current party &quot;wants to&quot; separate. The current party wants to get a clear international legal&#x2F;formal recognition that they <i>are</i> separate, and have been since beyond living memory.\nYou can live your whole life, birth to death, in Taiwan, and your taxes, driving licence, passport, etc etc, will always be arranged in Taipei, not Beijing. China is a foreign country to Taiwan.')
