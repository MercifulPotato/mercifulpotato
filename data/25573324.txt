If this study was well done, great!  If it was poorly done, then it is appropriate to call it out.  If the study truly wasn&#x27;t able to find any correlation (positive, per my hypothesis, negative per yours), then either there really isn&#x27;t any correlation (meaning all of the potential forces that would cause a correlation happen to be perfectly balanced (which would be surprising to me), or there is something wrong with the study.<p>- To be clear, I don&#x27;t think there is a causal relationship between violent video games and violent behaviors.<p>- There are likely correlations between video-games and ADHD, as well as single-player video games (actually any solitary activity) and depression.  There are links between both of those and violent behavior, particularly self-harm.')
