It keeps Airflow small and dumb, and lets the Fargate containers do the heavy or complicated lifting in language of developer&#x27;s choice.<p>We&#x27;d really appreciate if the ECS Operator could be given a bit of attention:<p>Running a task on FARGATE_SPOT containers is a cheap, convenient option, but it requires passing capacityProviderStrategy in.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;issues.apache.org&#x2F;jira&#x2F;browse&#x2F;AIRFLOW-6604" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;issues.apache.org&#x2F;jira&#x2F;browse&#x2F;AIRFLOW-6604</a><p>Also currently the ECSOperator only shows the output logs once the task has finished (which could take hours), it&#x27;d be better if the operator could poll the Cloudwatch logs during the run rather than wait for it to finish.<p>---<p>Congratulations on the release, I&#x27;m looking forward to  upgrading soon, and trying out the new features and syntax!')
