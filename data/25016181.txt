Trump was so popular that his base <i>increased</i> over the last four years. So popular with that base that an actual <i>messianic cult</i> formed around him. Trump himself just wasn&#x27;t charismatic, competent or forward thinking enough to capitalize on it at scale the way populist dictators in other countries have. But that still leaves the danger of a <i>competent</i> successor to Trump in the future.<p>What we need to watch for is whether or not the Republican Party interprets this as a repudiation of Trumpism, or merely of Trump himself.')
