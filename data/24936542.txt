He did seem to react unnecessarily harshly, before his email even received a reply.<p>As you say, he was the one who first began displaying the unprofessional behavior. He probably should have just sent like half of his follow-up email (the citations of the email compared to the article) and given them a chance to reply. But I also understand why he felt he was being unduly pressured and why staying there wouldn&#x27;t have been wise for him.')
