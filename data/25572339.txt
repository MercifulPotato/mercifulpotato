I then contacted a ton of companies asking if they would be interested in offering their open positions on a 4 day &#x2F; week contract, for 80% of the starting salary, e.g.<p>- Before: Software engineer (38hrs) $100k<p>- After: Software engineer (30hrs) $80k<p>So far I&#x27;ve had 0 companies interested. Isn&#x27;t 5 software developers @ $80k &#x2F; 30hrs just the same as 4 @ $100k &#x2F; 38hrs? I&#x27;d argue the former is even better as the developers will be less fatigued!<p>Why are companies not interested in this? Is it because:<p>- the stereotype of being &quot;lazy&quot;?<p>- &quot;its the way we&#x27;ve always done it&quot;...?<p>- extra paperwork?<p>- something else I&#x27;m missing?')
