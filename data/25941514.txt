The trouble is that you would need to require brokers to prevent short selling stocks that have been already been borrowed and short sold. Aside from tracking a tree of stock ownership changes at the brokerage level, this would de facto create two similar but different assets for every equity: those which are &quot;clean&quot; (have never been sold short, or the short position is closed) wnd those which are &quot;dirty&quot; (have been sold short at some point and the position is not closed).<p>This is trickier than it might sound, because you are in some sense restricting the rights and capabilities of some subset of the shares. That has valuation implications.<p>I am not saying it can&#x27;t be done or even that it&#x27;s undesirable; just that the mechanics of this are nontrivial to enforce.')
