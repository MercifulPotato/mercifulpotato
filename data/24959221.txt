I very rarely now start with a blank page and very rarely beat myself up for &quot;writer&#x27;s block&quot;.<p>In a nutshell, the book describes how the act of writing can be broken down into many stages: sometimes you are collecting &quot;fieldstones&quot; (i.e. research), sometimes you editing, and sometimes you are synthesizing.
