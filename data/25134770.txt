Have you seen curbside chargers? There&#x27;s some up the road from me and by no means does it look simple to install them, not to mention that you&#x27;d have to do it along _every_ single residential street _everywhere_ and we don&#x27;t have the electrical capacity to do it anyway!<p>If it really is so simple, why when I live in London do I not see entire streets filled with chargers? Surely you&#x27;d think that&#x27;d be in place by now given the time frames?<p>I think it&#x27;s hand-wavey to say &#x27;oh you can just charge at low current&#x27;. And if you&#x27;ve ever seen a petrol station near a motorway here you&#x27;ll realise the idea of parking your car for x * 10 mins to charge would simply not work, there&#x27;d be multiple mile tailbacks.<p>Overall the govt treats this issue like it&#x27;s a smaller problem than it really is.')
