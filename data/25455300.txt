It&#x27;s actually a rather capable device, in a kid-friendly form factor.<p>It&#x27;s not quite up to the ESP32, but what you lose on capability, you gain on ecosystem. The ESP32 is more a device for people who don&#x27;t need an Adafruit &quot;How to Choose a Microntroller&quot; manual. It seems like the sorts of people who need an intro guide are better suited to a device with more of a beginner-friendly ecosystem.')
