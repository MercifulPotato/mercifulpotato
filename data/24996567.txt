In fact there are a number of RFCs around how IPv6 firewalling should be implemented on _consumer_ routers but since pfSense seems to be mostly aimed at enterprise customers my guess is they don&#x27;t necessarily follow all that.<p>Specifically I&#x27;m referring to:<p>- RFC4864 | Local Network Protection for IPv6,<p>- RFC6092 | Recommended Simple Security Capabilities in Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) for Providing Residential IPv6 Internet Service and<p>- RFC7084 | Basic Requirements for IPv6 Customer Edge Routers, which pulls in the other two by reference.<p>In fact RFC4864 is specifically about this &quot;Perceived Benefit of NAT&quot; and how to preserve the security benefits in the v6 world.<p>[RFC4864]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc4864" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc4864</a><p>[RFC6092]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc6092" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc6092</a><p>[RFC7084]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc7084" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc7084</a><p>Just as an example, OpenWrt, a more consumer focused router distribution follows RFC7084 and provides the default deny behaviour on IPv6 ingress from WAN much like IPv4-NAT would do.<p>Also note that IMO the author is simply conflating NAT as known in the IPv4 world with it&#x27;s usual implementation of actual Address Translation plus Stateful firewalling. In fact prefix translation which he&#x27;s going on about here isn&#x27;t necessary at all to be exposed to this security problem.<p>Just plugging a IPv6 (and DHCPv6-PD) capable router into a WAN would do if it weren&#x27;t for the stateful firewall.')
