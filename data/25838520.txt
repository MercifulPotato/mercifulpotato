The fact that they have been trying to position themselves as a social network, unsuccessfully, for several years and they still haven&#x27;t given up on it is alarming.  If Google can&#x27;t even pull it off with all of their resources and properties (including giants like YouTube and Gmail), I don&#x27;t see how Reddit will either.<p>The &quot;me too&quot; features, like the TikTok clone and the chat rooms, are either derided or ignored entirely by the community.<p>I suppose it&#x27;s difficult for them to attract dollars and media attention as &quot;just&quot; a message board -- despite seemingly being the world&#x27;s largest.  But that&#x27;s what their actual users want it to be: the world&#x27;s best message board.  But their product changes keep making it a worse message board in the hope of being more like Facebook.')
