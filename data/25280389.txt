If you don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s like how fixing your car exhaust brings you very little personal benefits. But if nobody did, smog would make your life miserable.<p>Kids are just the same - except the other way around!<p>So personally, when I&#x27;m old and retired, I plan to depend on the work your kids (and the kids of other people who also generously considered the &quot;continued survival of the human race&quot;) while in the meantime maximizing the benefits that come from the freedom of not having kids.<p>You may not like this freeloader spirit, and governments generally encourage people to have kids by various means (&quot;working economy, GDP growth and all that are important after all!).<p>But as it&#x27;s not illegal to &quot;abstain&quot; from the rat race, I do not care much :)')
