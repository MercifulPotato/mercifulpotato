Item(by='ajarmst', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605980301, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25162666, text='I actually like the reduced width because of the way I arrange edit panes, and after a brief adjustment period, have no readability issues at the font sizes I typically use.  That&#x27;s a personal taste thing, though, so I can see that others wouldn&#x27;t like it. The &#x27;m&#x27; glyph is a useful bellwether&#x2F;canary in that it becomes difficult to distinguish the legs before most other glyphs become problematic.  I tend to adjust the font size to one level above where the m&#x27;s start turning into bricks, and have no readability issues, and still ample horizontal space.  I don&#x27;t generally use the font for publication to others (although I&#x27;m experimenting with its use in code blocks). I do often use it in projecting demonstrations to students, although that&#x27;s typically at a large font size, when the legibility isn&#x27;t much of an issue, but the narrowness is an asset.')
