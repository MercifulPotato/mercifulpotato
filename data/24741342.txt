I would not play this at a live gig myself, but it does run fine on my Acer laptop with i5 processor, which is not meant for serious audio processing.  If you try it and are getting latency issues, try adjusting the sample rate. Also the stand alone app seems to run much slower than the VST plugin, but most people interested in this I expect would use the plugin anyway.')
