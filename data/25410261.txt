It&#x27;s painful, and people hate it, but they do it because there&#x27;s no other good way to get from point A to point B in America.<p>Some examples:<p>1) I suspect the &quot;new car smell&quot; that car buyers believe affects their judgment is purposely chosen glue (I think it&#x27;s a glue) that dissipates into a gas that literally, psychiatrically impairs buyer&#x27;s judgment.  It&#x27;s real. [edit: it&#x27;s still relatively mild].<p>2) Stealing a person&#x27;s main means of transport should be punished independently of how expensive that mode of transport is.  So, the penalty for stealing a car should be based on the price of a car <i>and</i> the fact it was the main means of transport for that person.  Same goes for bicycles, it could have been a $100 bike, but it&#x27;s the main means of transport and that person is equally stranded as the driver without it.  For this reason, being a bike thief stealing 10 bicycles could mean a decade in jail, if laws were different.  Who would steal bikes then?<p>3) Enforce both car driving violations and bike driving violations, but based on lethality of the vehicle.  Right now both driving a car drunk and riding a bike drunk are a DUI, which is ridiculous.<p>4) Legislation that privileges driving over biking harms children, because they <i>can</i> ride a bike starting age 8 or so, but can&#x27;t drive until 16.<p>5) Driving is an extremely lethal activity, but AFAIK biking deaths are mostly attributable to automobiles.  If you try to run someone over with a car you can be charged with (I forget the wording but more or less) &quot;using a deadly weapon&quot;.  Because that&#x27;s what it is.  A killing machine.')
