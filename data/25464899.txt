(They also expanded access to the BASIC system by developing a time-sharing OS and deploying terminals in multiple locations, which meant the system could be used for synchronous (chat) and asynchronous (email, bulletin board) text messaging and collaboration.)<p>Every modern computing device with a web browser includes JavaScript, but I can&#x27;t help but imagine what the computing landscape might look like if JavaScript in the browser were as visible and easy to use as BASIC systems were, from the 1960s to the 1990s. Why doesn&#x27;t Firefox come with a button you can press to open up a user-friendly programming tab, e.g. with a REPL, a canvas&#x2F;textarea, a code editor, and the ability to easily share programs and games over the internet?<p>I think you can (still) learn the basics (haha) of Python&#x2F;Smalltalk&#x2F;Logo&#x2F;Scratch&#x2F;Lisp&#x2F;Matlab&#x2F;JavaScript&#x2F;etc. in an afternoon, but it&#x27;s hard to beat BASIC&#x27;s straightforward simplicity.<p>I also miss the days when<p><pre><code>    print &quot;Hello, world!&quot;\n</code></pre>\nwas a valid program in both Python and BASIC.<p>(Note John McCarthy started the work that led to LISP when he was at Dartmouth, but then promptly moved to MIT. Imagine if Dartmouth had gone with LISP instead of BASIC...)')
