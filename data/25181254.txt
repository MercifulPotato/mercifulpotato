On one hand going deeper and back out of a though feels so much more natural, just like our brain branches off and returns back. But we are so used to paragraph based text due to its history and it feels more familiar. I like how in Notion you can indent and deindent normal paragraphs but that still doesn’t feel totally fluid, I’m not sure what it is. Maybe different modes or views for each is closer to the ideal?')
