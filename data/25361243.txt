A valid argument means the conclusion follows from the premise, kinda like the quoted argument in the article which seems to be valid.<p>A sound argument is one whose premises are also true. This is where the quoted argument in the article fails. The premises either are false or don&#x27;t apply to all startups. This is basically what the author means by a argument that is missing premises. It&#x27;s not really that a premise is missing, but that without additional into it may seem like the argument is sound,but with additional into you realize it is not sound and therefore leads to a different conclusion instead.')
