No? So it sounds like it was localized to one state.<p>The point is that this is a nation-wide problem, and the federal government is in a unique position to be the most efficient at handling production and distribution of vaccine&#x2F;testing supplies&#x2F;PPE. What exactly is your argument around why it should have little or no role? There is a shortage of these things and production happens in a few centralized places. It makes sense that one centralized entity coordinate the production and distribution. What is the problem with that? Please show your work on how 50 states plus territories would handle it better.')
