Item(by='rmah', descendants=None, kids=[24674801], score=None, time=1601662097, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24664971, text='I&#x27;m speculating, but I suspect marcus_holmes&#x27;s world view has been shaped by reading the many articles about of the &quot;GIGANTIC SIZE&quot; of various derivatives markets.  Those articles almost always use &quot;notional value&quot; of the underlying assets to &quot;size&quot; the derivatives markets.  Which is, IMO, pretty misleading.<p>In the simplest terms, a derivative is a security that is <i>derived</i> from some other underlying asset.  Typically, they are contracts -- contracts that can be bought and sold on financial markets.  For example, a call options contract says &quot;the holder may, at his option, purchase 100 shares of ABC at $250&#x2F;share on or before 15-Dec-2020&quot;.  And on the other side, the writer of that contract is obligated to fulfill it if the holder exercises it (but most options contracts expire unexercised).<p>What many articles for the public would say is &quot;that derivative is $25,000 in size!&quot;  Except that the contract may be trading at around $0.50&#x2F;share (or $50).  And then they&#x27;ll multiply it out across all derivatives... thus leading to surprising &quot;conclusions&quot; like &quot;the derivatives market for X is 10 times larger than X itself!&quot;  Which is sorta true if you squint hard enough, but mostly not true in terms of all other financial metrics.<p>To circle back, while it is true that there is a huge amount of what many would term &quot;excess capital&quot; sloshing around, I don&#x27;t think the derivatives market &quot;provide[s] an infinite soak&quot; for it.  In reality, a large chunk of it goes into low-risk fixed income instruments such as US Treasuries, other sovereign debt, and AAA-rated corporate bonds.')
