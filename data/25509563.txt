I have pretty good vision (corrected—to 20&#x2F;15 or so—uncorrected is crap but I&#x27;m not coding without glasses&#x2F;contacts) and honestly my 34” ultrawide at 3440x1440 is excellent for coding, and pretty much any other use. Now, would I prefer whatever resolution a 5K 16:9 would be when extended to 21:9? Or better a 4320p at the same aspect ratio? Sure, more pixels are always better. But does the sub-4K display look like crap or force bad sizes for controls? No.')
