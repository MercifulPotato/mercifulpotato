The technology had to be invented first. It would be crazy to use exploding metal drops in a vacuum chamber where you want to manufacture microchips if they had any other options. And there are few applications of EUV in general, especially at those luminosity levels. So R&amp;D is a big component here, not just manufacturing. And even if we only look at the manufacturing part, this isn&#x27;t some &quot;simple&quot; vacuum chamber gadget either, only ~30 machines were built last year and they cost more than 100M$ each.\nFor comparison, four of these cost as much as one Wendelstein-7X. This is more of a big, barely productized science project shipped out as soon as it works just good enough for the chip manufacturers.')
