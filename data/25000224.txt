I think there were several reasons:<p>- When I moved to the Iphone X, I stopped using it so much, because it is just annoyingly large. It is awkward to use, so it doesn&#x27;t come out.<p>- I do not use anything from the &quot;social media&quot; surveillance outfits, so have never had that clawing at me.<p>- And after setting up somewhat paranoid monitoring on my home network, I became aware of just how gossipy some apps I naively trusted are, and deleted them. (If you share data with anything not needed for function, or with any of the surveillance shops, I will not use your app.) That cut almost all the time-wasters.<p>At home, which is where I am now almost all the time thanks to the plague, it lives on a table, like phones used to. When it begs for attention, feeding it becomes something I do when I get up to stretch or get coffee instead of being a reflex.')
