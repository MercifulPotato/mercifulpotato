This is an absolutely pitiful amount of energy. For example, three gorges produces 22,500 MW of power.<p>Common designs for self-contained PORTABLE nuclear reactors easily outclass the entire generating capacity of these dams.<p>The balance of impact vs benefit on these is incredibly tilted against these projects continuing to exist.<p>Also, Chinook is delicious and anything which means more lox is a win in my book.')
