It can clearly be used for to traffic drugs, humans, blackmarket weapons, etc. It can be used to flee justice, evade police, abets vehicular manslaughter, etc. The list goes on and on. Is it even controversial to support the highway system as is? Do we loose sleep over it?</i><p>I&#x27;ve seen this kind of argument all too frequently in the last week.  While I don&#x27;t think the People Who Decide what is taken down to be infallible, I do think that we&#x27;re all capable of making reasonable decisions here.  Taking down a hate speech site obviously doesn&#x27;t mean we need to delete the internet, or iPhones, or whatever else Parler users have in common with every other person who uses the internet.<p>&gt; <i>I feel like we&#x27;ve all been a bit brainwashed by the government in our notion that &quot;free speech&quot; must have limits. I very much doubt that that is true. I think the speech part should always be 100% free. Of course any crimes that derive from it are and will always been fully enforceable. I just question whether or not the speech itself should be viewed as illegal, or something that should be regulated.</i><p>I strongly disagree.  Apps and websites being taken down is not something new at all, and what happened to Parler is only notable because it impacted more people.<p>There are many sites that are IMO righteously taken down.  Our conversation should not be &quot;should big tech control what we see online&quot;, but should be &quot;where do we draw the line?&quot;.')
