But here is the actual conclusion, copied and pasted, in case people read your version and come away thinking it’s what the study actually concluded.<p>“This study suggests that combined MICT and HIIT has no effect on all cause mortality compared with recommended physical activity levels. However, we observed a lower all cause mortality trend after HIIT compared with controls and MICT.”<p>This is a scientific study, presumably posted because the poster believes we can read it and understand it. I’m not sure why it needs to have its conclusion rewritten and then some opinion based advice added.')
