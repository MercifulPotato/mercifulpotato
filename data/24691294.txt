In particular at a higher temperature that the graphene and the support and the circuit. In the PR they claim that it produce &quot;something useful&quot; that I interpret as &quot;work&quot; or &quot;electrical energy&quot;, but in that case it breaks the Second Law even if in their setup the resistor is at the same temperature.<p>After reading the paragraph again, I&#x27;m not sure if your interpretation is right and they are claiming that the device is transferring energy from the graphene to the resistor, but that breaks the second law, in spite in the PR they claim it doesn&#x27;t.<p>I think they never claim a 100% conversion anyway. They just don&#x27;t have a temperature difference to operate the engine.')
