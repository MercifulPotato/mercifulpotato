We are now being recommended (not compulsory) to include our preferred pronouns in our email signature going forward.<p>My case: my social circle is all politically left leaning to various degrees, however I don&#x27;t think any of them use pronouns on social media. Most of my team were completely bemused when this was raised in staff as they genuinely did not know that stating pronouns was a thing.<p>I am interested to know peoples thoughts:<p>How widespread this is across industry? Do you think this is a good&#x2F;bad initiative?')
