Of course, there are many lotteries for small prizes, for example there are millions of rounds of roulette plays occurring daily, and of course it&#x27;s pretty often to have 2,3,4,5 and 6 occurring in sequence on some roulette table somewhere during a day. The phrase &quot;1000 a year&quot; relates to large national lotteries, where probabilities are much much smaller, it&#x27;s about 1&#x2F;250mln for US megamillions lottery, for example. So for 1000 of 1&#x2F;10mln lotteries this will happen once every 273 years. I would say the probability of a foul play is high enough to warrant an investigation.')
