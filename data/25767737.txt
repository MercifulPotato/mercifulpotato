Am idiot. Anyway, maybe someone reads something new to them.<p>Nitrogen won&#x27;t get you below 10°K, tho. It&#x27;s solid below 63°K (-210°C).<p>You know things are getting expensive, when superconductors are rated &quot;high temperature&quot;, when they can be cooled with LN2...<p>Helium (He2) is _practically finite, as we can&#x27;t get it from the atmosphere in significant amounts (I think fusion reactor may be a source in the future), and it&#x27;s critically important for medical imaging (each MRI 35k$&#x2F;year) and research. You also can really store it long term, which means there are limits to retrieval&#x2F;recycling, too. I sincerely hope we won&#x27;t start blowing it away for porn and Instagram.')
