You are aware that FB &amp; Google pay 2x other companies such as Microsoft and Amazon?<p>If you join tech companies such as FB, Google, Amazon or MSFT as an H-1B immigrant, if your performance is good they want to keep you, so they sponsor you for greencard. Once an employee gets a greencard he&#x2F;she is free to leave the company, so if the goal is to underpay you want to NOT sponsor for greencard.<p>As part of sponsoring an employee for greencard you have to post an advertisement for the position the employee is <i>already</i> doing a good job in, so most employers see this as a formality and don&#x27;t recruit as vigorously as they would for a position that is actually open. This should be expected, and the problem is the stupid rule, not the companies. The rules need to be changed to advertise <i>before</i> the position is given to an H-1B candidate, not <i>afterwards</i>.')
