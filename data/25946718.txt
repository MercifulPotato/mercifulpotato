It&#x27;s very possible that RH just knowingly violated whatever rules&#x2F;regulations in full expectation that this would still be in their long-run best interest, particularly if they were financially exposed in whatever ways on the shorts that were generating losses. We&#x27;ll see how this works out for them - they&#x27;ll take a reputational hit but honestly most people do not have an incentive to leave the platform other than smoldering moral outrage or because they think that GME-like opportunities will continue to present themselves in the future (unlikely imo.)')
