I say in a parallel comment approx “if starship and SpaceX succeed in making a base and regular support missions” in the next few decades then I could imagine Mars being self sustaining for at least emergency conditions in 50-200 years. I don’t know what “laughably far off” means. I’m certainly not saying it will happen in our lifetime I’m just describing possible timelines. The comment I responded to talked about the present motivations for Mars exploration which I think was incorrect - it has never been presented as a land full of resources as implied by the comment I first responded to. It’s about long term human goals.<p>I disagree that there is “nothing to gain” and in fact I think there’s a lot humanity could gain from the development of regular space travel and settlement of other planets.')
