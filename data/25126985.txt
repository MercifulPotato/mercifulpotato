Did these patients get any of the 5+ antiviral or immunomodulatory drugs with published successful RCTs? Did they get prophylactic antithrombotics? Did they get good advice on a healthy diet and medical care throughout their life? Probably not, and I don&#x27;t think a judgmental tone towards them helps anything.')
