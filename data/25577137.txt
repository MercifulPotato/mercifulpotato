Even if they contain something that, if you squint hard enough, looks like a string, that&#x27;s no reason to suppose that reality actually looks like that.  (But I suspect that you&#x27;re inclined to accept those books for other reasons, and therefore to accept them as also accurate about physics.  I suppose a starting point is where you find it, but you should forgive the rest of us when we remain unconvinced that it is likely to be a useful starting point.)')
