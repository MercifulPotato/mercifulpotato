The online stuff should be an adjunct to your study of books. Also it is best if you look at books dealing with a survey of all the relevant topics required for Science&#x2F;Engineering before delving into specialized ones. To that end, i can recommend the following;<p><i>Mathematical Techniques: An Introduction for the Engineering, Physical, and Mathematical Sciences by Jordan and Smith</i> - This book is really accessible.<p><i>Mathematical Methods for Physics and Engineering: A Comprehensive Guide by Riley, Hobson, Bence</i> - A more advanced coverage of topics than the one above.<p><i>Mathematics for Physicists: Introductory Concepts and Methods by Altland and Delft</i> - The coverage is excellent but somewhat challenging to read.')
