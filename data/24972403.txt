(&quot;First you ban me from freely speaking about the holocaust not happening, next you ban me from criticizing the president!&quot;)<p>Practically, non-US democracies have demonstrated a stronger commitment freedom of assembly and freedom of the press than the US has over the last 4 years.<p>The only difference is that in the US these protections are guaranteed by an effectively &quot;sacred document&quot; that supercedes all laws (The constitution)<p>But it is more and more clear that that is a bug not a feature of the system, and is causing legitimate harm as your supreme court is getting stacked with &quot;textualist originalists&quot; who think that the wisdom of slave-owning cotton farmers applies unquestionably to 21st century technology and societal concerns.<p>And this is before we even get into the question of what it means for something to be &quot;democratic&quot;, which is to say there is a &quot;Democratic electoral process&quot;, which we&#x27;re about to find out just how much the US process has been degraded as seemingly HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of people&#x27;s votes will either be not counted, or will be denied the opportunity to vote. What is happening in the US would be impossible in any other Western Democracy.')
