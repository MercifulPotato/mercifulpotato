A century ago, private industrial wealth and power were in effect synonymous, but today the industrial wealthy are relative front men to a core of institutional players with considerably less wealth, but who have the levers of policy that pervade every micro aspect of life now.The wealthy people I know are not running the culture wars, they are toeing the party line as an appeasement plan to what they perceive as the mob. In this sense, any opposition they might have had has been neutralized.<p>The taboo I think is it&#x27;s not a culture war, it&#x27;s a class war that sets largely publicly employed people against mostly privately employed ones. For all the rhetoric around race, this is mostly a Girardian schism between white city &quot;burghers&quot; and their country &quot;redneck&quot; complement. The former see their role as global, and the latter see their identity as national.<p>I don&#x27;t think even a model with predictive power can do much to mitigate the consequences. It may have festered too long.  If you destroy what a culture has built, it will have to contend with you and your organizations to rebuild afterwards.')
