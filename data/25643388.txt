Christie has an interest in fighting child trafficking.<p>2. Christie used bridge closure to fight child trafficking.<p>3. Ft. Lee mayor defends child traffickers.<p>4. Ft. Lee mayor wanted to escape from a NJ police raid and bridge was the only path out.<p>5. Escaping via the bridge would have ensured Ft. Lee mayor&#x27;s protection.<p>6. NJ state police were conducting a raid at GWB during bridge incident.<p>7. Bunkers at GWB involve child trafficking.<p>8. Ft. Lee mayor knew about child trafficking at GWB.<p>All claims can be viewed independently. Some claims have dependencies on earlier claims. If earlier claims turn out to be false (or extremely unlikely), any subsequent claims that have dependencies on those prior claims must be dismissed.<p>You apply some heuristic in your own mind like this all the time in the real world. You just probably never take a fully analytic and logical approach to it.<p>But that&#x27;s roughly the system I use to evaluate the world. I don&#x27;t dismiss things automatically but I won&#x27;t buy into a claim without some evidence. But I will look at each claim independently because sometimes there is signal in the noise.')
