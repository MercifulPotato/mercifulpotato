That process has a &#x27;content&#x27; aspect to it as well in the form, &quot;by this date, this content, by this later date this additional content&quot;. But I understand the angst against managers who &quot;manage up&quot; promising impossible dates and &quot;blaming down&quot; when the dates aren&#x27;t met. I learned early on as an individual contributor that &quot;getting it in writing&quot; was essential to protect myself and personally vowed never to inflict that pain on anyone that works for me.')
