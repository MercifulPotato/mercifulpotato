Many of which is to better understand our position in the universe and not just to survive.<p>But there is a crux to it; not everyone cares. Which again can also be seen through the generations many people are just interested in surviving and have no more desire than to get to the nearest McDonalds or Starbucks, and that&#x27;s fine.<p>I feel this is the majority of people and it&#x27;s only a few exceptional individuals that have the drive and ability to push beyond; some of them are actually often quite troubled and maybe it&#x27;s their very lack of contentment and happiness that drives them on.<p>I feel the nihlistic point of view has the greatest of troubles with this state of affairs because if the vast majority are just content to sit back and go to the nearest Yelp recommendation, and there&#x27;s no real higher purpose, then it&#x27;s all just rather depressing.')
