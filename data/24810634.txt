I was inspired by a post here on HN a few months ago about someone who put today&#x27;s paper on a giant e-ink display.  This link is just a helper redirect to the New York Times&#x27; website.  For anyone interested, it&#x27;s just AWS CloudFront for HTTPS directing to a lambda function to parse the current date and return a redirect.<p>I&#x27;ve been using this as my primary non-tech news source for a while, and I really appreciate the lack of adds and pop-ups, and the inability to follow links to anything.  It restricts my news-reading to just the front page and that&#x27;s felt pretty healthy.  Sort of like the opposite of this recent XKCD: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;2371&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;2371&#x2F;</a>')
