Next, you need to register it, then take some online test periodically, then pay yearly insurance fee, later you&#x27;ll be required for the drone to register with a mobile network to track its use. All for a thing you might use 2-3 times a year on average. If you managed to buy a DJI drone, it might be confiscated upon entering the US. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s over for this hobby as well as for drone manufacturers.')
