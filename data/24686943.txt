The one that is currently in the building, or the one that could move in and pay rent?<p>The one currently in the building.  This is quite clear cut, the two tenants are not equivalent.<p>Rationale:<p>The one that could move in <i>and pay straight away</i> almost certainly has a place to live already.  It&#x27;s possible they are currently homeless and yet able to start paying immediately and convince you it&#x27;s sustainable, but it&#x27;s very unlikely.<p>The one being asked to leave is likely to end up homeless, in a pandemic.  Unless your place is significantly above market rates and there&#x27;s a realistic cheaper place available to them.  Even if there&#x27;s a cheaper place they could move to, with all the checks in place, most potential new landlords will reject a tenant who just got kicked out of somewhere for non-payment of rent.  There may also be high competition for a small number of &quot;last resort&quot; places to live which accept people in this situation.  And moving when you have no money is also very difficult, sometimes impossible and they will lose their possessions too.<p>So if the <i>value</i> being prioritised here is to <i>minimise avoidable homelessness</i>, then priority should be given to the person who would be made homeless, not the person who wouldn&#x27;t.')
