We&#x27;re just saying: it doesn&#x27;t work&#x2F;nor does it make sense.<p>&gt; Allowing student loans to be resolved through bankruptcy after 10-15 years is enough time so that most graduates have assets, and are probably looking for a mortgage on a home in the near future. Going through bankruptcy at 30 or 35 is a much bigger deal than doing so at 21. In this situation, the student can&#x27;t easily exploit the lender. But at the same time the lender still has the potential for loss if they try to loan to a student studying basket weaving at a university with a 98% acceptance rate.<p>So instead of trying to solve the problem of crushing student debt, we let people at 30-35 tank their credit score so they can never buy anything again. So we&#x27;re doing NOTHING for people 22-30, and we&#x27;re ruining the 30+ year old&#x27;s credit so they can&#x27;t actually buy a house. It doesn&#x27;t help anyone. That&#x27;s our point. It does nothing to solve any real problem, it just makes everything worse.')
