Any kind sets me off unfortunately.  And yeah it took me a while to realize but any kind of fried food is bad for me.  So even eating coconut tortilla chips sets me off, despite the fact that they contain no grain.  I am hopeful that in the future, more paleo &#x2F; autoimmune paleo targeting brands come out.

Not cheap but it helps to break some of the dietary monotony.')
