First of all, I wonder if they mean Wayne County, MI, or actual Wayne, MI. If it&#x27;s the former, that almost makes more sense because Wayne, MI has a total of 17,000 people. The only thing I can think of is that demand has cratered because car company employees took the time to relocate once their leases were up.')
