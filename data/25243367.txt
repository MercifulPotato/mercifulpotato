Make it work for you for a steady stream of passive income. Create a self sufficient compound so your passive income is only for your spending money.<p>If all else fail, you still have the land to sell. You can’t print land. It will always be in demand.<p>Buy productive land you can steward. One acre of fertile land with water is much better than 500 acres of scenic acreage.<p>Where can you find that in America? I have a rough rule. Follow the Amish. Can’t go wrong.<p>(This is not investment advice. Just my thoughts.)')
