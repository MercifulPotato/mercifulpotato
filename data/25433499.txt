Those with boiling temperature similar to water will probably mostly remain (it&#x27;s more complex than that).<p>A better question would be: Are there dangerous levels of contaminants in after a single distillation pass? For municipal water - probably not. For chemical factory effluent - probably yes. Plastic pipes after wildfires - no idea.<p>Also, you need to add something to distilled water, as it&#x27;s shocking to a body. Almost anything will do, though you may need to think about mineral content in the longer term.')
