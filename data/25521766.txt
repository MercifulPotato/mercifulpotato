It&#x27;s &quot;being unable to determine whether they are good&quot;. If you simply don&#x27;t know enough to evaluate a source, it is <i>correct</i> as a matter of epistemology to view its contents with a large dose of suspicion. Any historian will tell you this; a pretty sizeable aspect of the study of history is the weighing of sources, working out why they said what they did, what they&#x27;re not telling you, and what they&#x27;re wrong about - because every source is incomplete, biased, and contains simple factual errors. I might sit back from a book and go &quot;wow, that was good&quot;, and it&#x27;s possible for a book to be &quot;great but wrong&quot; - but I can only reasonably conclude that a source&#x27;s contents are correct if I have got more evidence for its thesis than just that one source.<p>So the situation is bad enough when I am encountering a new source. But if I&#x27;m already familiar with a source, and it&#x27;s consistently wrong about the things I know, then I can only be <i>even more</i> suspicious of everything else they say; and sadly, an awful lot of publications do fall into that category. Finding a mistake in a book <i>does</i> make it more likely that it contains other mistakes, and it <i>does</i> make any given fact in the book more likely to be wrong.')
