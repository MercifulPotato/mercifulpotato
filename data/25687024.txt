Item(by='saagarjha', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610126395, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25683158, text='&gt; Using this kind of bounce-buffering offers some benefit on its own. Your editor, who has written device drivers in the past, would never have committed such an error, but it is not unheard of for driver bugs to result in a device performing DMA when the rest of the system thinks it should be idle. Having memory buffers seemingly randomly overwritten in unreproducible ways can (again, your editor relies on the word of others for this) result in corrupt data, painful debugging sessions, and excessive alcohol use. By separating the buffer used by the device from the buffer used by the kernel, restricted DMA can mitigate many of the more unpleasant effects of this sort of bug.<p>lol')
