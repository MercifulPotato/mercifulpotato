Item(by='SahAssar', descendants=None, kids=[25131469], score=None, time=1605655877, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25130866, text='&gt; I submitted for consideration the notion that governments engage in &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;, and covering them up.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone disputes that governments have conspired and kept it secret before. The &quot;teapot&quot; in this case is QAnon or any specific conspiracy theory, not that any government has ever had any conspiracy. Prove or argue for a specific conspiracy and don&#x27;t hide behind that &quot;people have kept stuff secret before&quot;.<p>&gt; To me, this is kind of the logical equivalent of asking conspiracy theorists where the evidence is that substantiates their characterization of the state of reality.<p>Isn&#x27;t that exactly what we should do? If someone (the conspiracy theorists) has a theory they should also put forward evidence for that, right?')
