Why not solve the root cause? That&#x27;s where I and many others are surprised.<p>&gt; For example, if someone who is poor, disenfranchised, has no retirement, lives paycheck to paycheck, lives in heavy pollution both of air and water, etc., is living longer really on top of their list?<p>Maybe, maybe not. Most people don&#x27;t want to die even if they don&#x27;t live in the western world. Some of the things mentioned here (eg. no retirement, polluted air) wouldn&#x27;t be as big of a problem if aging was solved since they would be healthier.<p>I would agree most people in developing countries wouldn&#x27;t put longevity on top of their list (seems like people in the richer countries doesn&#x27;t do that either) but the thing is we can work on multiple problems at the same time. People generally aren&#x27;t suggesting we take money from aiding the poor to instead focus more on solving biological aging. It&#x27;s rather using resources allocated to fighting age related deceases one by one, to instead fight aging (which seem to be the root cause) and&#x2F;or adding _more_ resources to the pool of doing good in the world.')
