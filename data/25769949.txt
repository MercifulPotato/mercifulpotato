A forth friendly (data and return) dual stacked CPU can be very simple and small yet achieve a throughput close to one instruction per cycle.\nGoing superscalar on a single datastack is hard. You basically have to rename every stack access and most compute instructions consume two arguments producing a single result. You just trapped yourself in a fate about as bad as having to implement a superscalar x87 FPU.<p>One interesting design to break the 1 instruction per clock barrier is a multistack VLIW design. In this design the dense encoding of a stack based instruction compensates for the low usage code density common in VLIW instruction sets.
