What it turns out to be is the most useless thing that ever happened to programming: it&#x27;s pure overhead, undocumented (surprising) behavior, unwanted defaults that you have to spend time working around without the benefit of actually simplifying anything.  Not saying React is the same (like I said, haven&#x27;t really spent much time looking at it), but it&#x27;s adherents defend it the same way Spring&#x27;s adherents defend <i>it</i>.')
