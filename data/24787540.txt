Item(by='72deluxe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602762326, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24786914, text='It is interesting that people were horrible or selfish or manipulative before the Internet, before the Web, and are horrible or selfish or manipulative AFTER widespread adoption of the Web and these &quot;platforms&quot;. It&#x27;s almost like arguing about the platforms is a side-point to the root cause of the problem - people&#x27;s personalities and selfishness, and some people&#x27;s gullibility without investigating &quot;facts&quot; presented to them.<p>It&#x27;s obvious that the Internet and social media wouldn&#x27;t solve these issues with people, or hide these flaws in humanity. I am baffled why people think it would. It&#x27;s just another form of something governments or institutions cannot handle&#x2F;control, which has been occurring since written history began. The only difference is the sheer quantity and ease of having a voice these days.<p>(For reference regarding my use of these &quot;platforms&quot;: I use YouTube periodically to mainly watch the C++ conference videos to further highlight how out of touch I am with the modern iterations of the language, but have nothing to do with Facebook or Twitter since I found it to be a stream of people talking about themselves; by definition that is not a conversation, so is not social and should be renamed &quot;Selfish Media&quot; IMHO).')
