I moved countries recently, but I still need to do things like retrieve tax statements etc. Some companies only support SMS as a second tier authentication method (some at least allow you to use email as an alternative), some won&#x27;t allow you to change to a foreign number, some will not be able to send you a text if you&#x27;re in roaming mode abroad (I keep my old SIM active just for that).')
