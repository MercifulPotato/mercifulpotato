Too much using a Technology X hammer when a screwdriver is what&#x27;s need.<p>That said, the metric here is too blunt, too broad.<p>1) We need to call out avoidable bloat. A simple example: too often I&#x27;ll visit a site where say the full-hero image is full width and full height. The problem is the same 300-500k+ image that&#x27;s served to desktop is served to mobile. No media queries (if they&#x27;re using background-image), no sizes and srcset if it&#x27;s an image tag.<p>2) It&#x27;s about expectations. Some site are naturally image heavy (e.g., photography). Within reason, that&#x27;s acceptable. Some use of lazy load is better than paging, and such.<p>3) And do we throw the baby out with the bathwater? If a site is slightly bloated but accessible, I think there should be redeeming points for that. That is, you had X or Y amount of resources and you made #a11y a priority, at say the expense of trimming some bloat. I&#x27;m okay with that.')
