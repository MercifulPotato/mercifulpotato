That&#x27;s understandable, but what I want to know is: Have they also customized the underlying protocol by which their homeservers communicate?<p>The reason I ask is that it seems to me (as an entirely uneducated outsider) that if they&#x27;re using the Matrix protocol as-is, then they have incentive to support and assist with the further development of the Matrix protocol, which is great. But if they&#x27;ve already started customizing it, then I would worry that they eventually will decide they don&#x27;t need Element or the main Matrix protocol and will just go off and do their own thing.')
