Health care organizations are HIGHLY decentralized entities where authentication is extremely difficult; where orgs employ many different protocols and software stacks; where many different types of data need to move freely between many orgs, with various levels of sophistication, in many different directions (patient to provider, provider to patient, provider to provider, provider to payer, payer to provider, patient to payer, payer to payer, provider to regulator, provider to researcher, provider to vendor, etc), with few established standards for how that is done (paper, phone, email, web application, fax, API, snail mail, CD, hard drive, USB, etc), with many people having access; and where organizations need to be porous, with high turnover by design. It should also be realized that a failure to access payment data or process a payment results in lost business and headaches. A failure to access medical data may kill someone, so tradeoffs between confidentiality and availability are much more nuanced.')
