(And it’s generally the package figure that you care about.)<p>AMD Ryzen 9 5900X: 17.9W&#x2F;54W at 4875MHz.<p>AMD Ryzen 7 5800X: 17.3W&#x2F;37W at 4825MHz.<p>AMD Ryzen 5 5600X: 11.8W&#x2F;28W at 4650MHz (though the highest core reading is 13W, at <i>three</i> cores loaded).<p>You’re both correct: by simply restricting that power envelope by 40%, you shed a lot less multi-threaded performance than people realise, and no single-threaded performance.<p>Look at the 5950X figures, and you observe that at about 120W, it can run 6 cores at 4,650MHz (27,900 core–MHz), or 16 cores at 3,775MHz (60,400 core–MHz).<p>Expressed one way: by dropping the frequency by 20%, power per watt increased by around 2.7×.<p>Expressed another way: let’s skip a 65W envelope—put this particular 105W chip in a <i>40W</i> envelope and you lose only 20% of your six-cores performance. Seriously. But I’m not sure what the curve would look like if you load all 16 cores at a 40W envelope, what speed they’d be going at.<p>(But do remember that “TDP” is a bit of a mess as a concept, and that we’re depending on non-core power consumption being generally fairly consistent regardless of load.)')
