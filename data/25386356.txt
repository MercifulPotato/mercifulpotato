The lowest power saving modes are basically so great these days I can at least a couple of days out of them without any configuration whatsoever...<p>On Windows many newer laptops don&#x27;t even use actual &quot;sleep&quot; modes but rather simulate them with lower power active modes. Linux&#x27; problems with traditional sleep modes are only going to get worse as a consequence since manufacturers are going to abandon them. I&#x27;d stop using them ASAP.')
