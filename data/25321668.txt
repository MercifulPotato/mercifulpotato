Islam, Judaism, and Christianity outlawed lending money with interest many centuries ago, and for good reason. Once the core is fixed, we will see benefits across the board almost by definition. Ban parasitic and immoral practices (interest&#x2F;usury, stock shorting, selling debt for debt, short and long option positions [aka gambling], etc.) and things will get fixed very quickly. Don&#x27;t forget to return to a properly backed currency, not today&#x27;s fake currency that allows the government to print money at will.')
