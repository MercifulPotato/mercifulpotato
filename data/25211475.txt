Small farms that are meant to support a family would do better by having a great variety of crops. It&#x27;s also nice to support a local community this way, by selling some extra produce to local markets or people in the local community.<p>My girlfriend has a small 3 rai (~5000 m2) farm. Originally she only grew rice ... or rather some Myanmar people grew rice on her farm for a small amount of money. In the past 1.5 year my girlfriend transformed the farm to support our family. Now about 1 rai is used for rice (enough for our family) and the remainder is used for growing fish, fruits (bananas, coconuts, mangos, ...) and vegetables (Thai aubergines, long beans, cauliflower, spring unions, ...).<p>Having a greater variety of crops also protects a bit from bad harvests or bad market prices. It makes one more anti-fragile.<p>In the future we should probably buy some land to grow the farm to about 5 rai and from then on we should be able to fully support ourselves with fish, fruit and veggies.<p>I think Jon Jandai has some nice ideas on setting up a small scale farm [0].<p>---<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=b2eoQyYoUww" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=b2eoQyYoUww</a>')
