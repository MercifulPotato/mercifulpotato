Sooner or later someone will not adhere to the unwritten rules and ask &quot;Who&#x27;s going to stop me?&quot;. Even if you can eject&#x2F;ban them, it will be quite a mess, as you now seem to enforce completely intransparent and artificial rules. People will (rightly) ask you to state the rules before you enforce them. Even if your rules are completely obvious to you and all the people in your peer group, they won&#x27;t be to <i>everyone</i>.<p>On the other hand, a CoC signals to potential participants that you take these things seriously. Look at it from the point of view of someone who is used to sexist&#x2F;racist&#x2F;otherwise discriminating comments: If you see that a conference has a CoC, that means that they know of your problem and are prepared to combat it. This is more a more inviting conference and it will put you more at ease, because you can feel safer.\nWithout a CoC, people will not attend because they&#x27;re just tired of this.<p>So, yes, CoC should be unnecessary because we all know how to behave. Ideally, their content is suprising to no one. But experience shows that not everybody does, or that they in good faith behave in ways that are not acceptable to other people. With a CoC, you make it clear beforehand that &quot;these are the rules&quot;, so everyone&#x27;s on the same page, and you show that you mean it.')
