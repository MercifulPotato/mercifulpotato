Item(by='WalterBright', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608614067, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25501993, text='I regularly drive my ancient Bronco 2 and sometimes a newish car with the touch display. I spend less than a second glancing at any control on the Bronco. It&#x27;s so bad on the touch display I sometimes have to pull over to figure out how to get the fracking defroster on. It&#x27;s even impossible to tell if it is on or off, you just have to wait and stick your hand on the base of the windshield. In Seattle having a working defroster is &quot;flight critical&quot; as they say. It&#x27;s not a joke, but the controls are a joke.<p>BTW, &quot;defrost&quot; is a verb, and pictures are for things, not verbs. So I never know which stupid icon means &quot;defrost&quot;. Lack of verbs is why picture written languages evolve into phonetic alphabets. I predict in 20 years Apple will announce a great breakthrough in user interfaces - words!<p>rant, grumble, rant, grumble, harrumph<p>BTW, I have no idea what a defog control does that defrost doesn&#x27;t.')
