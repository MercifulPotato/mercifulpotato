Windows is the product for which its users (theoretically) paid, not Edge.  If people want to run Chrome or Firefox or fucking NCSA Mosaic on Windows, then that&#x27;s their problem, not Microsoft&#x27;s.  Microsoft got their money; they should mind their own business instead of bitching and moaning about &quot;but but but the user doesn&#x27;t want our shiny new browser!&quot;.<p>Microsoft&#x27;s insistence on what seems to be a deliberate attempt to make Windows as horrible of a user experience and product as possible is precisely why I switched to Linux-exclusivity in 2012 and haven&#x27;t looked back.  I would much rather put up with the broken dumpster fire that is the Linux desktop experience than even pirate (let alone <i>buy</i>) an operating system that by every indication hates me and wants me to suffer.<p>And it&#x27;s baffling because pretty much every other part of Microsoft seems to be figuring out how to make decent (or at <i>least</i> mediocre) products; it&#x27;s just their flagship product line that they seem to have been actively sabotaging since it peaked as Windows 2000.')
