I&#x27;ve been fortunate and never had many problems with health insurance. Once or twice we got a surprise bill because a doctor deceptively ordered a test that our insurance wouldn&#x27;t cover, and we had to pay the full cost (probably 1-2K). In one instance, we explained the issue to the company that produced the test and they comped it to us (and somehow the cost counted toward our deductible, which was really nice). Anyway, IIRC, there&#x27;s legislation to make this kind of deceptive practice illegal (doctors can&#x27;t refer you out of network or order tests without your explicit approval), but I might be misremembering.<p>None of the above is to make any sort of political point. I still want universal healthcare. Too many people aren&#x27;t insured or are under insured and it&#x27;s far too easy for hospitals and insurance companies to screw you and leave you with no recourse, especially if you&#x27;re already vulnerable. There was a time when I was undecided on the issue, but it seems like every country that has universal healthcare really likes it even if some of them complain endlessly that their healthcare system is a financial black hole (e.g., my UK friends complaining about NHS always getting more money and yet the quality of care doesn&#x27;t improve perceptively--although that was a pre-COVID sentiment).<p>I also know American friends who have flown to India to have lasik and paid full price for a reputable Indian doctor to perform it because all-in it was cheaper than paying for it domestically (it&#x27;s possible that their insurance didn&#x27;t cover lasik? I&#x27;m not really sure how that worked out).')
