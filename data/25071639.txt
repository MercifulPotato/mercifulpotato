As a motorcyclist myself, I scorn many of the bicyclists I see out on back country roads full of blind corners and hills without a shoulder. In my opinion, it is not safe to have large speed differentials in traffic because it erodes trust in the road and other traffic. If you enjoy two wheels as much as I do, you’ll perfectly enjoy motorcycling without the rush – you’re only as fast as you want to go but at least you’ll always be managing the speed limit. I appreciate in other regions there are minimum speed limits, and I’ve heard personal stories about getting ticketed for riding a bicycle slowly on a fast road.')
