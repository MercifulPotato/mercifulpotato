Docker came out with their container system without understanding what made it work so well for Google.  They then discovered the hard way that the whole point of containers is to not matter, which makes it hard to build a business on them.<p>Docker responded by building up a whole ecosystem and doing everything that they could to make Docker matter.  Which makes them a PITA to use.  (One which you might not notice if you internalize their way of doing things and memorize their commands.)<p>One of my favorite quotes about Docker was from a Linux kernel developer.  It went, &quot;On the rare occasions when they manage to ask the right question, they don&#x27;t understand the answer.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve seen Docker be a disaster over and over again.  The fact that they have a good sales pitch only makes it worse because more people get stuck with a bad technology.<p>Eliminating Docker from the equation seems to me to be an unmitigated Good Thing.')
