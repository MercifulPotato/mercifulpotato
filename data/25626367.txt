There is always that case where someone goes &quot;wait, this doesn&#x27;t work unless we do X, which hurts us in the long term, so we should change things and do Y&quot;. Except now management and the client are so stuck, they demand the RFC regardless of X. Part of this can be mitigated by prototypes, but it is not a fail safe. Or worse, management tries to cut down the costs by involving only one technical person for a short time, who then completely misses a few critical points and the same problem forms.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is: no planning or development method is going to magically cure mismanagement, unwillingness to listen and a tendency not to kill the darlings.')
