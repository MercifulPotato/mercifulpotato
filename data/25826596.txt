A lot of people won&#x27;t come in because they can&#x27;t afford it, or they won&#x27;t get the test because they can&#x27;t afford it. Your wife can order the imaging test, but she doesn&#x27;t have to deal with the debt, and&#x2F;or months of arguing on the phone with administrators that her patient sees.<p>I live in Canada where I am enrolled in the provincial health plan. If a doctor recommends a test or treatment I get it. Cost isn&#x27;t a consideration. My age isn&#x27;t a consideration. Please don&#x27;t spread lies about how universal healthcare works. Unlike insurance in the US, if the doctor orders it, it is covered by the healthcare system here.<p>Truth: I may have to wait based on a triage system.<p>If the doctor doesn&#x27;t recommend a test as necessary or I don&#x27;t want to wait for my place in line, I can go to a medical clinic that offers these tests privately and pay&#x2F;have my employer provided secondary coverage pay.<p>In that way it turns out that we don&#x27;t have to make the tradeoff.<p>I&#x27;ve had the best insurance I could buy in the US, and now I have the standard health care that every person in my Canadian province gets. My experience, which is backed up by studies, is that I am healthier, and the population in general is healthier under the Canadian system.')
