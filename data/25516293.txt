For example, attacking a smaller cell may not be worth the effort for a malicious actor because impact of outage is very limited. It sounds like with SuperCell you can take down one tower and the impact is similar to taking down hundreds of sites.<p>My intuition may be wrong here as I&#x27;m not an expert in cell networks, but the tradeoff seems quite analogous to ones faced in distributed computing, storage and other systems. I&#x27;m curious to see some more authoritative opinions on this.')
