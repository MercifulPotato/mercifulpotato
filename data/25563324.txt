If there&#x27;s a $150k job out there and a recruiter gets $30k for a placement, guess how much that job would pay without the recruiter? $150k. It&#x27;s an expense to the business and one that doesn&#x27;t impact how much you&#x27;re going to get paid at the end of the day.<p>Pretending the recruiter takes &quot;a cut&quot; of your salary creates an unnecessarily adversarial tone.')
