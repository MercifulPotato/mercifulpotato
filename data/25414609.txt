If that made you not to want to <i>invest</i> in bitcoin, not just gamble, then I guess they did their purpose. Did they stop you buying it also when it was 10 or 100?<p>The fact is nobody knew where it was going back then. In hindsight sure you can try to shift the blame to others, but seriously I have always noticed that if I do investments based on emotional whims without understanding what I am actually buying I never feel comfortable owning said asset. Then I have no idea if the current price is right or wrong and whether I should sell it or not.<p>But coming back to your main point, it is more than usual that no small portion of HN comments are conservative and critical towards any new innovations. Therefore, it is up to the reader to make their own research and judgement before taking anything said here for granted. I like that criticality, to some extent, as that keeps you grounded in reality but it is true for certain that some of it is just plain old resistance to change.')
