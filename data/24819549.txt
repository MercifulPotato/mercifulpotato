Your problem is you&#x27;re hiding all the inconvenient logging and generation of metadata propagating knowledge of my communication with your website beyond the scope of what was intended every time you propagate out metrics logs, or transaction data out to other third parties.<p>If you stop at &quot;oh, an HTTP session happened&quot;, you&#x27;re being a disingenuous maker and perpetuate of strawmen. It&#x27;s almost always what happens with data by actors you invite into that &quot;seemingly private HTTPS transaction&quot; that violate the simplestsocial precept of the technical exchange.<p>Things branch off from there. If you can&#x27;t see that as a fundamental breach of privacy and professional discretion, then again, it&#x27;s likely you have a vested interest in not seeing it. It&#x27;s damned obvious to anyone who doesn&#x27;t.')
