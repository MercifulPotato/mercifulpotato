Item(by='walrus01', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611431368, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25885363, text='two problems there:<p>a) the present starlink architecture is bent pipe from each satellite. meaning that a satellite (for uninterrupted service, two or more satellites at the same time), in its moving LEO orbit needs to be simultaneously in view of the customer premises small terminal, and also a starlink earth station which is a link into terrestrial fiber networks. spacex is working on satellite-to-satellite trunk link connectivity but to the best of everyone&#x27;s knowledge outside of the company, none of those have launched yet. because of that, you can&#x27;t presently have a starlink terminal for an ordinary customer without a spacex-operated earth station geographically located in the same region.<p>b) an adversarial high tech nation like russia (or iran, whatever) would have absolutely no problems with operating portable spectrum analyzers on the ground to identify and confiscate starlink terminals. it needs to be on a roof or other place with a clear view of the sky, isn&#x27;t very small, and it needs to transmit. if it transmits in known bands, from the ground towards space, it can be identified from the ground and confiscated. training relatively unskilled law enforcement to use a portable spectrum analyzer and a ku band horn antenna would be at most a one day, eight hour training course. see what happens if you try to operate an unauthorized two-way VSAT link, 1.2 to 2.4m dish size, in the C or Ku bands in Ethiopia today, for example. Men with a pickup truck and firearms will show up to take your equipment and arrest you.<p>all of that said, I think that there is still a lot of possibilities for circumvention of government censorship and filtering, even in an aggressive environment such as behind the great firewall of china. I highly encourage any interested persons with linux&#x2F;networking software development expertise, and network engineering expertise to put some thought into how they might assist open source projects related to censorship, obfuscation&#x2F;stego, and traffic-blockage circumvention. Except in an environment where the government literally orders EVERYTHING to be shut off (Kashmir, recently!), there will likely always remain some paths for traffic, because a country can only cripple its own internet for so long without causing significant economic impacts domestically.')
