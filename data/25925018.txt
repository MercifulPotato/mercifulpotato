We all like to think asking questions doesn&#x27;t make you look stupid but the reality is, it does. That&#x27;s why most humans (men especially) have an inborn fear of asking questions... it&#x27;s actually an evolved trait. Think about it, you have this fear regardless of what kind of person your mentor is...<p>All these little hang ups that humans have like biases and jealousy exist because they helped us survive natural selection. Ever wonder why evolution hasn&#x27;t already put in place the behavioral idealisms we strive for? Possibly because that type of behavior didn&#x27;t actually help us survive.<p>You are a petty person who lacks self control and is too cowardly to ask questions because in certain ways these qualities can actually be good for you.<p>It goes even further then this, because there&#x27;s a huge possibility that asking too many questions IS actually a good metric for how stupid you are. If evolution evolved in you a fear of asking questions, it may be that this was an evolutionary response to another evolved trait of people accurately judging intelligence by measuring the amount of questions someone asks!<p>Is there any data correlating IQ and amount of questions asked? I would like to know.')
