Item(by='jart', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609954756, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25659480, text=' I actually like Facebook. It used to be a fantastic place to hang out online and be open from the comfort of my home, without having to drive somewhere, or be in the public sphere. I&#x27;m also somewhat of an oddity because my friend list never went above dunbar&#x27;s number. Then when when the tide turned against Facebook with events like Cambridge Analytica, it turned into a ghost town. Everyone I know just stopped using it, and stopped sharing, because no one trusted it anymore. So if you still think of quitting Facebook as a choice, chances are you&#x27;re friends with too many people. How could people here honestly suspect their friends of being bots, unless they needed the self-esteem boost of having 5,000 &quot;friends&quot;? Fact is, the platform was ruined by too many people using it for the wrong reasons and that&#x27;s what the app makers and the bad policies exploited. The Facebook that friend judicious people like me had had is gone and I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s going to be anything to replace it.')
