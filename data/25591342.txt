I refuse to use jira because it is over-engineered and is generally used as a crowbar to foist non-technical influence upon technical teams, at least in the sites I&#x27;ve seen. Jira is in my opinion a fatal source of friction to the production of reasonable software.<p>That&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m getting from this list.<p>Worse, almost all of the points (all maybe? Haven&#x27;t checked) declare that something is &quot;missing&quot;.<p>Please god no.<p>Jira isn&#x27;t missing more features. When you make a list like this, some product manager at Atlassian is going to turn it into a bunch of scrum epics and jira will be even worse in 12 months.')
