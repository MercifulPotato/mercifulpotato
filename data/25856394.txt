He likes to quote a tweet from 2015 from the CTO of AWS when they launched the Elasticsearch service in AWS. That was 6 years ago! They have had time to build a better offering with heir commercial licenses have failed. Elastic is trying to sell security now, what happens when they lose there too, change the license so any SIEM or analytics vendors have to pay them too? Elastic made a promise that the code would ALWAYS be Apache 2.0 and they went back on that promise, they lied to the community that helped build it, their customers, employees, partners and investors. The blog post about the license titles “Doubling Down on Open” is an insult to peoples’ intelligence, they are trying to play the victim because AWS is a mean bully. Well that’s business, if the CEO&#x2F;founder didn’t see it coming then maybe he shouldn’t CEO? Take his billion dollars and go start something else and hand the company leadership over to someone who knows what they are doing.')
