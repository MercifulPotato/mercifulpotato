And random HP laptops are really not great. Also, I sometimes have to work travel, so I prefer limiting the number of items I have to cart around, especially expensive personal ones (like an external DAC).<p>A BT pair of headphones solve this problem. I currently have a Sony XM3 that I mostly bought for the sound isolation and I&#x27;m very happy with them. Are they as good as some other similarly priced analog headphones? Probably not. My old Shure 840 had a better sound for 1&#x2F;3 the price.<p>But I actually like not being encumbered with wires and having the headphones suppress the air conditioning hum and other random noises around the office. The ambient hum would go through my old Shure, despite being closed-back. I often like having the Sony on my ears just for the noise-cancelling, with no audio coming through.<p>The issue with bluetooth is the lag, though. I don&#x27;t really care about that as I mostly listen to music or watch movies, but if lag is important to you (say for video-conferencing or games) then the usb-wireless may be a better route. But I get the feeling that those models don&#x27;t really attempt to address high audio quality.')
