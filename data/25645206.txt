Also, I&#x27;m not saying autonomy is irrelevant, I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s <i>not the only thing that&#x27;s relevant</i>. Morality entails more than respecting autonomy.<p>&gt;It would be more unjust to interfere in the affairs of consenting, autonomous adults because we didn&#x27;t like their preferences.<p>I mostly agree, but there is a strand of libertarianism which would argue such interference is permissible if it comes in the form of soft power (advertising, taking certain products off the market, etc.)<p>&gt;You&#x27;re going to have to explain why I would care that you think something is exploitation.<p>The point is that you don&#x27;t have to care for it to be exploitation. You don&#x27;t have to care that 2+2=4, but we structure our science around the mathematical principles that lead to that result anyway. You don&#x27;t have to care that murder (for example) is wrong, and the murderer doesn&#x27;t have to care that murder is impermissible.<p>&gt;Of course, and with easily replaceable skills I&#x27;m at a loss as to why you think he would be entitled to a stronger bargaining position.<p>Perhaps not individually, but as a general trend in society it leads to a mass of people being in poor positions to bargain and a smaller number of people being in very good positions. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a good thing, because it leads (very realistically) to some being at the mercy (speaking in terms of resources required to live or sustain a family) of others by virtue of factors beyond their control. That restricts autonomy beyond the economic sphere.<p>&gt;This is created by restricting barriers to ownership of capital so there aren&#x27;t competing employers.<p>I&#x27;ve already mentioned the concept of the local maximum in employment; even if there are multiple reasonable options for employment all options are possible, it does not follow that any will be good options.<p>&gt;But if you want to live and eat and can&#x27;t make the wage that you want, well maybe your desires are larger than your entitlement.<p>This is the just-world fallacy; the market, as already clarified, does not necessarily produce just outcomes, and it&#x27;s unclear why it should be thought it does. Why does the market decide my entitlement? <i>Should</i> it, speaking in terms of economic systems, decide my entitlement? For slaves, their masters decided their entitlement. Now it&#x27;s a market which was created by a set of laws and property rights, and maintained as such. Is it really beyond question?<p>&gt;It would be a prerequisite to the demand.<p>The demand is useless if nobody will agree to it.<p>&gt;Needs are contingent on goals. Given no goals, one needs nothing.<p>Sure, I have a &quot;goal to survive&quot;, but this seems to cheapen both the concept of goals in a goods economy and the idea of survival which supercedes all other goals to the point of being a biological impulse we are prepared to kill for. It&#x27;s lower than any psychology or even any other need. It&#x27;s a physical process. When we say somebody has no goals, we don&#x27;t assume they are just okay with dying and would be apathetic if we killed them.<p>&gt;The left is collectively engaged in a process of pushing authoritarianism while claiming anarchism<p>Perhaps we have different ideas of authority and anarchism. Besides that, Marx was clear that socialists should not rationally support non-socialist platforms, which I agree with to a large extent. The labourer and the capitalist have opposing interests (speaking class-wise). Better wages were never on the Marxist agenda.')
