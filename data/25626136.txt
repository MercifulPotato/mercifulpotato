I&#x27;m English, with just a smattering of French when I watched The Wire (that is, I&#x27;m definitely not a polyglot) and when I watched it I hooked into the language really quickly, revelled in it in fact, and didn&#x27;t need subtitles at all - but I also know friends that really struggled. I think it helped that at the time I was only working a three-day week and didn&#x27;t have kids: one of the most glorious memories of The Wire for me was getting Series 3 as a DVD box set through the post just after it was released (I was in Scotland at the time, and didn&#x27;t have access to HBO) and watched the entire series in one day with just occasional breaks for food and drinks.')
