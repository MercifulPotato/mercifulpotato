This allows them to probably show they were the first to discover a certain idea, or work on a specific problem, without trusting a central party.<p>You&#x27;re welcome to try it out at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.assembl.net" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.assembl.net</a>. You&#x27;ll see the blockchain involvement is quite minimal (no private keys, no cryptocurrency, etc.). The core feature, which is decentralized timestamping, necessitates a blockchain.<p>Do you have an idea of how to do this without a blockchain? I&#x27;m all ears.')
