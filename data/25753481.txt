Any flat-earther has heard all of the flat-earth debunking.  Sadly, I know a handful of flat-earthers, and I tried arguing for a while, but it does no good. Instead it appears that the theorists double-down on the conspiracy.<p>I think people believe in conspiracies, not because they&#x27;re mislead on a certain topic, but because they <i>want</i> to believe.  So debunking conspiracies is attacking their faith, which is what causes zealotry.<p>It&#x27;s more like spreading a religion, which, yeah, you can&#x27;t really ban it.  You just have to let people do their thing.<p>tl;dr I agree that one shouldn&#x27;t censor it, but only because it does no good.')
