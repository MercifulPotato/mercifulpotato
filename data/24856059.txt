That&#x27;s not even one minimum wage salary. That&#x27;s <i>nothing</i>.<p>They received big donation of 10K they got from Mozillas Opensource Speed dating session at FOSDEM this year [4] which is <i>great</i>. It&#x27;s not recurring though from what I can see.<p>BUT: for being the one project that people (me included) point to when the question of a more open mobile platform arises, having the entire infrastructure (build servers, hosting, code, not to mention someone supervising the whole thing) be done by a handful of volunteers on a shoestring budget doesn&#x27;t seem right.<p>Edit: I am aware there are many other open mobile projects and I love them to bits, but they are nowhere near as complete an experience as AOSP + f-droid. Personally, I don&#x27;t really think of android (even without google and with f-droid) as a free platform, and I don&#x27;t think that will ever change. So by all means, also donate to Mobian, UBports and all the others. :)<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bubu1.eu&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bubu1.eu&#x2F;</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opencollective.com&#x2F;f-droid#section-budget" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opencollective.com&#x2F;f-droid#section-budget</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;liberapay.com&#x2F;F-Droid-Data&#x2F;donate" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;liberapay.com&#x2F;F-Droid-Data&#x2F;donate</a> ( â‚¬143.76&#x2F;week * 52 &#x2F; 12, converted to USD )<p>[4]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;fdroidorg&#x2F;status&#x2F;1243499250551410688" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;fdroidorg&#x2F;status&#x2F;1243499250551410688</a>')
