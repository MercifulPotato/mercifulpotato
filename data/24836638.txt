I know lots of folks who prefer C to C++, but still like Rust.<p>I do think that these sorts of language comparisons are useful, but they don&#x27;t always generalize. Partially this is because what a language <i>means</i> to each person can vary. As long as they&#x27;re understood in a very coarse grained way, I think they can still make sense, but it&#x27;s tricky!')
