I&#x27;m running HA with mostly Jasco switches.  It&#x27;s been okay, but there have been hiccups.  Z-Wave devices can be annoying -- ESPECIALLY door locks.  I&#x27;ve gotten them all working, but the setup was finicky, mostly due to the security requirements.  The only way I deal with HA breaking changes is that I don&#x27;t update often.  About once every couple years I&#x27;ve gone in, dedicated a couple hours on a Saturday to doing a major update.  And I keep everything in git so I can roll back if something goes pear shaped.<p>I&#x27;m probably sticking with HA, but my latest batch of light switches have been TP-Link Kasa WiFi switches and I really like them.  Very fast to respond.  Easier to setup than Z-Wave.')
