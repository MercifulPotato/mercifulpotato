But keep in mind that it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of diagnostic accuracy by itself, and the false positive rate can lead you to do things that are more invasive than necessary. Family history should be considered.<p>If the numbers are low, you&#x27;re probably good. If the numbers are high, it isn&#x27;t necessarily bad, but it could be good excuse to keep a closer eye on things. You might do additional PSA tests and look at whether it&#x27;s trending up or down. A biopsy might be suggested, which is more invasive, and <i>can</i> be more accurate, but it also depends on where the doctor is able to collect the tissue -- if they miss the spot, a biopsy could be inconclusive or contradictory.<p>Finally, if you have prostate cancer and the numbers are bad and your doctor tells you that it needs treatment, the common treatment seems to be high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), which is unpleasant and invasive, but it isn&#x27;t surgery, and it isn&#x27;t anywhere near as damaging as radiation, and apparently it works rather well.')
