Item(by='fxtentacle', descendants=None, kids=[24832509, 24834593], score=None, time=1603144202, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24828800, text='My impression has always been that &quot;unschooling&quot; is mostly an indicator of wealth, and so it&#x27;ll correlate well with future success.<p>If both parents have to work a regular day job, there&#x27;s nobody at home to teach the kids so unschooling is not possible. And if only one parent stays at home, they will also yearn for some free time and push for getting the kids signed up for school.<p>The only situation where I can imagine the parents being enthusiastic about unschooling is if they are independently wealthy and can afford to spend lots of time with their kids, when other people would have to work. And obviously, plenty of personalized attention from the parents will make the kids learn a lot faster than your typical 1 teacher 30 students class.<p>Plus, once you assume that all unschooling parents are much wealthier than regular people, it kind of makes sense that they will have very different opinions about life in general, due to their very different experience of it. Regular folks will go to a public playground and complain about the dog shit there. Rich folks will just buy a playground for their backyard and hire a gardener to keep it tidy.<p>To outsiders, that wealth discrepancy would then look like a religion, because all of the unschoolers have a shared untypical worldview.')
