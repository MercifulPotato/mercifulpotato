Not a good place to &quot;you&#x27;re out of touch with the needs of the world&quot; from.<p>While it&#x27;s true that pronoun usage in English is a relatively unimportant problem compared to lots of other existing problems in the world, it&#x27;s worth noting that the person who seems to be the most emotionally invested in that problem here is you. You might accurately feel that using &quot;they&#x2F;them&quot; this way is forced on you in other situations, but that&#x27;s not what happened here. In this conversation, you observed &quot;them&quot; being used that way; you didn&#x27;t get told that you have a moral or ethical obligation to use it that way. That a pretty important distinction.<p>You&#x27;re the one that&#x27;s being high and mighty and trying to impose a standard on somebody else&#x27;s use of language here, not vice versa.<p>Also, until just now, the &quot;1% of the population&quot; that you are talking about (which I presume is trans people) wasn&#x27;t even directly relevant. You&#x27;re right that part of the cultural shift towards greater use of gender-neutral pronouns is socially driven by trying to make trans people&#x27;s lives easier, but you could easily have the more or less the same conversation and not have trans people in mind at all. That shift is also socially driven by just trying to leave gender out of the picture when it&#x27;s irrelevant. That&#x27;s an aspiration that one might reasonably have even if one doesn&#x27;t give a shit about trans people.<p>The thing you&#x27;re upset about in the first place wasn&#x27;t a case of someone using &quot;them&quot; because it was a preferred pronoun or whatever. It was case of using &quot;them&quot; as a gender neutral singular second-person pronoun because they didn&#x27;t bother to do the legwork to work out the gender of the person they were referring to.')
