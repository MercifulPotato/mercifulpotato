Rather, in my opinion &quot;coins&quot; re-introduce problems that have been solved in banking and finance for more than a century. Transactionally, they seem like a hassle.<p>With respect to investing, they smell like a pyramid scheme. I think there is no coincidence that the &quot;coin&quot; landscape is littered with failed charlatans and corrupt exchanges. I view &quot;coins&quot; and &quot;Tesla&quot; stock as interesting day trader entertainment. As a way to test if I am smarter and faster than the system. I would never consider either as anything other than speculative entertainment and would never base a portfolio or retirement on them.<p>That is just my opinion though and if you think that &quot;coins&quot; are great then power to you.')
