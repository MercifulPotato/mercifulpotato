Thats effectively the same as a chargeback, since the sender of the money can decide at any point up to the time of the actual transfer to send the money elsewhere.<p>You could theoretically design a hardware wallet (like a credit card) to only sign transactions three days into the future.   That would give you three days to &#x27;charge back&#x27; anything you don&#x27;t like.<p>Not sure merchants would be happy to accept that though...')
