If you reach this quota, Amazon SQS returns no error messages. If your queue has a large backlog of 20,000 or more messages with the same message group ID, FIFO queues might be unable to return the messages that have a different message group ID but were sent to the queue at a later time until you successfully consume the messages from the backlog.&quot;<p>Link to the documentation:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;AWSSimpleQueueService&#x2F;latest&#x2F;SQSDeveloperGuide&#x2F;using-messagegroupid-property.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;AWSSimpleQueueService&#x2F;latest&#x2F;SQS...</a>')
