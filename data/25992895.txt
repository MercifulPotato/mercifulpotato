It&#x27;s one of those insidious disorders that doesn&#x27;t let you know how bad you actually have it until you experience what it&#x27;s like without it for the first time. The inattentive type is <i>nothing</i> like the stereotypes.<p>One of my favorite signs you might have ADHD. Caffeine doesn&#x27;t do anything for you and&#x2F;or makes you sleepy. You&#x27;ve never know what other people talk about when they describe being &quot;wired&quot; after drinking an energy drink. Bonus points if despite &quot;doing nothing&quot; you still intake lots of caffeine. Congrats! You might be self-medicating without knowing it.<p>Everyone will recommend the book The Disorganized Mind for lots of good non-medication strategies and I&#x27;m no different. It&#x27;s fantastic.')
