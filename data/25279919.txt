At the time, Tulane put CS in the school of engineering, so every first year had to take a mandatory engineering safety class. The first day of class, they turned off the lights and played a home movie that was recorded during the dance at the Hyatt-Regecy. The video cuts out right before the disaster, but there is audio from one of the musicians, and they played that.<p>Sitting in a dark room listening to a huge crash followed by screams of pain and terror fully instilled the importance of engineering safety in me. This was 20 years ago and I still remember it clearly.<p>Often I wish everyone had some mandatory class like that to teach them the seriousness of the consequences of our actions.')
