Consumers will initially be happy, until service suffers, but vendors will be hit hard on margins.<p>One niche where I could see such an app succeeding: less-urban areas. In the past year or so, Amazon has neglected my parents&#x27; market in the college town of Blacksburg VA. My Dad broke his computer mouse over the weekend; while I could get one in hours via Amazon here in Seattle, the earliest delivery Amazon offered via Prime on Monday was Friday, with no option to pay more for faster delivery. I guarantee that there are hundreds of computer mice in existing store inventory within an hour&#x27;s drive.')
