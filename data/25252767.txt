Humans love human sacrifices, all the ancient cultures did it.<p>Human&#x27;s effort is not linear.<p>Try this: Go outside, measure some distance by counting steps, like 500 meters, or measure it with google earth.<p>Experiment A:\nThen take your clock and start running your distance multiple times, do for example 5 Kms, apply more and more effort until it is reasonable but not that exhausting and can sustain it. Run for 20 minutes. Write down your time and how do you feel.<p>Experiment B:\nNow do the same thing another day but applying all the effort you can. Then you will be forced to stop in order to rest and not die. Then try again, stop when you can&#x27;t do more and so on until you make the distance. Write down your time and how do you feel.<p>Compare both times. Compare your feelings in both situations. You will be surprised at the results.<p>You can do bigger distances if you are trained, like 20 kms, because it represents better work load.<p>In places like Singapur, or China and now the US(it used to be different in the past because of religion) they are living their lives like in experiment B.<p>In places like Germany or Israel they live their lives like in experiment A. In Germany people is not less productive than in America, or Singapur. Quite the contrary.<p>In China people work all the time, they sleep on work, but the intensity of work is very low. Working all the time means you can&#x27;t be excited for work. All work, no fun,your mind sabotages you.<p>Jews invented the system that forced everyone to stop working at least one day a week. Christians inherited that and dominated the world.<p>Now the US goes backwards, glorifying hard work until you die in your 30s because of cancer.<p>I have known several guys die very young of cancer in the startup scene and it is not a coincidence. The immune system and organs are depressed by constant stress. Stress is good if you can rest. Tissues are not repaired. They eat badly and don&#x27;t sleep.<p>Do not do that. Do the above exercise with your work. Measure the real output of your work. Force yourself to rest and be with your family, go hiking or to the beach like in experiment A. Work as hard as you can,and do not take breaks, like in experiment B.<p>Do that for a week and compare your output results. You will be surprised.')
