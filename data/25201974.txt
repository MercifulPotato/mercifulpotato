Item(by='smt88', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606245497, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25201589, text='People are downvoting you because you&#x27;re writing things that are:<p>- factually wrong (revealing you don&#x27;t know very basic info about Rust)<p>- anecdotal<p>- inflammatory (as you yourself admit when you say your comments were &quot;crude&quot;)<p>It&#x27;s not that people are being fanboys. I see lots of non-downvoted comments about not wanting to use Rust. Look at any HN thread about Zig, and you&#x27;ll see a ton of non-grey comments that say Zig is better or that modern C&#x2F;C++ don&#x27;t need replacing.<p>If you want to sincerely debate Rust, you should learn the basics (for example, understanding how it&#x27;s intended to reuse the C ecosystem, not &quot;throw it away&quot;); stop insulting other people in the thread (e.g. saying that using Rust is &quot;playing with toys&quot;); and acknowledging that it&#x27;s not intended to appeal to anyone who thinks they&#x27;re able to perfectly manage memory in C&#x2F;C++ without any mistakes.<p>On that last point: no one with a lot of experience in C&#x2F;C++ thinks it&#x27;s possible to manage memory in those languages without dangerous bugs, and increasingly people think adopting a new language (Rust) is a good trade-off for avoiding whole classes of memory bugs.')
