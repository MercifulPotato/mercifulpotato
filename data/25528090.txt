There is an art to reaching someone with talent who is untrained. It&#x27;s like their innate sense of music is a reservoir behind a damn and the damn is their facility on the keyboard. There&#x27;s no shortcut to bringing that damn down no matter how much water is in your reservoir an often times the ones with the most water have so much pressure that it affects their ability to be patient and thoroughly build a channel through the damn. Sometimes my most successful students are the ones without much prior learning because, yah know, tortoise and the hair.
