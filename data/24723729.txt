It&#x27;s expensive, because the engine is expensive, but at the same time you&#x27;re getting the exact same interior and fit-and-finish as the non-AMG versions of that class, which means an AMG S-class is <i>very</i> nice, while an AMG A-class is just not very nice at all. So yeah, your experience sounds exactly like what I would expect out of that specific model, and by just looking at the price tag, it&#x27;s not very intuitive that that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re gonna get.')
