For example, men are the highest paid teachers and professors despite the reduced participation by men in higher ed.<p>So my opinion remains that men do perfectly well with traditional instruction and we don&#x27;t need to make adjustments to it to favor them, particularly not the types of adjustments that would disadvantage women.')
