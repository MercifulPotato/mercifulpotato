Since I&#x27;m editing code written in a programming language and not text written in a natural language the forward-word command can often jump over an entire line worth of C++ tokens, and sometimes it jumps into the middle of a token. This mismatch is really tiresome. Vim commands usually hit closer to the &quot;move by token&quot; motivation, even though it&#x27;s still just regular expressions. And so editing in it is a breeze (but then it has other disadvantages that deter me from it).<p>Overall, I don&#x27;t think you need the full power of paredit when programming. For any given language, your editor movement commands understanding what tokens in this language look like will usually already be sweet and enough.')
