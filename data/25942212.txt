Spam is anything which makes dislikes less useful as metric for those things. Users who dislike everything aren&#x27;t a useful metric.<p>&gt;Also how you think youtube knows which dislikes are driven by &#x27;social media post&#x27; ?<p>A sudden jump in dislikes with a referal tag of &lt;insert social media&gt;. Probably mixed with their knowledge of those user&#x27;s other Youtube browsing behaviors. And Google&#x27;s absurd knowledge of your internet browsing behaviors via its massive analytics network. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s whole teams doing nothing but this at Youtube and I suspect they have very sophisticated methods at this point.')
