I have stocks that I know are prone to selling off at certain resistance points just by watching them do it repeatedly, but some options buyers may not know that since. So I profit off knowledge asymmetry and am comfortable with the high IV.<p>If I don&#x27;t know the stock well (maybe less than a month or so of watching it daily) I&#x27;ll just get a low IV contract.')
