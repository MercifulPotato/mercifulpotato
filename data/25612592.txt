I don&#x27;t think it means what you think it means.<p>At least in my book pointers are still variables (as in &quot;a pointer variable&quot;), and a variable is any named value, whether it&#x27;s a scalar or a pointer or a nth-pointer, or what its storage is.<p>But you mean that in your example there is no way to affect the previous value, right?<p>&gt;<i>I just googled it... why the heck would you copy pointers? That&#x27;s insane!</i><p>Well, copying values and passing them around would be too costly on memory (for larger structs especially), and would prohibit several techniques.')
