Item(by='tifadg1', descendants=1, kids=[24744858], score=2, time=1602409793, title='Ask HN: Is there a website which has currated truths, but not Wikipedia', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I&#x27;m looking for a resource which I could consult for various things throughout life - something akin to, but not limited to -<p>1) how much vitamin d should I take and are there useful combinations, i.e. D3+K2?<p>2) which limb streches should I do to get most benefit as a beginner; what about as an intermediate?<p>3) which screws should I use when drilling a specific wall type?<p>4) recommended daily dosages of protein, carb, fat based on activity level?<p>5) common active ingredients one should look for when treating common ailments?<p>and so on. These and similar questions are not rocket science. Guidelines, while may be shifting with advancements, have been established for decades, yet anything outside of a simple query usually directs me to some content farm, ad farm or similar. Even most books published within this decade are guilty of this, inflating the word count for seemingly no reason.<p>Wikipedia is often the wrong resource for the job, because it&#x27;s aims are academic, not practical - yes you may find bits of useful pieces, but they&#x27;re in a sea of noise, for this purpose.<p>Does such a resource exist? If not, should it be so hard to find factual information on everyday things? I&#x27;m finding myself doing things half-assed because I couldn&#x27;t be bothered to read a 500p book on a subject that I only have a passing interest on, which also becomes unsustainable if I have 20 of such passing interests.')
