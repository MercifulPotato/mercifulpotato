Item(by='kovac', descendants=None, kids=[25144783], score=None, time=1605745472, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25142175, text='&quot;We imagine the internet as a global medium where anyone can access any resource, and itâ€™s supposed to make communication easier, especially across international borders,&quot;.<p>It is. That doesn&#x27;t mean that a democratically elected govt has to allow sites considered &quot;good&quot; by a private group (like the authors of this article) especially when even the authors themselves seem to be okay with blocking child pornography sites. It&#x27;s tricky to argue against articles like this as it can quickly be twisted into an argument against human rights or same-sex marriages.<p>As far as I can see, all parties involved are behaving exactly like one would expect in a free society. People deciding who they want ruling them, democratically elected govts deciding what&#x27;s good for their societies, ISPs following the laws and those who want to access the blocked sites firing up vpns and accessing them anyway while a group of people whining about this whole situation for profit pretending like they are the watchmen of a free society. This is virtue signalling. A private group passing judgment on what other sovereign nations may consider right and wrong (at that time) for their peoples.')
