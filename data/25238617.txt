As a European coming to America, you generally find the sweets here to be waaay to sweet. You get used to it though.<p>I also did Keto for a while though and after you&#x27;ve been on that and then you just eat something made from flower again not even with sugar in it it tastes sweet. That was eye openingly weird. Of course that goes away quickly if you start eating it regularly again even if in low quantities.')
