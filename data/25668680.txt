Item(by='brigade', descendants=None, kids=[25668898], score=None, time=1610008468, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25668268, text='Intel&#x27;s TB3 controllers can&#x27;t do both TB3 daisy-chain <i>and</i> provide two DisplayPort endpoints. That&#x27;s why most TB3 docks that have two DisplayPort ports don&#x27;t have a second TB3 port, and why the HP had to use MST to have both. It&#x27;s also why 5k+ displays may or may not support being daisy chaining, depending on whether it&#x27;s using two DisplayPort links.<p>MST isn&#x27;t necessarily great because over an HBR2 link it doesn&#x27;t have the bandwidth for dual 4k60, and there&#x27;s still a lot of stuff that doesn&#x27;t support HBR3 links. And MST + hotplug is still a mess. So you&#x27;re just trading for a different set of confusion.')
