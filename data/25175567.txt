Item(by='Reelin', descendants=None, kids=[25176360], score=None, time=1606028480, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25174809, text='&gt; probably just a &quot;newbie in the deep end&quot;<p>Honestly the entire system is staggeringly complicated because (if you&#x27;re asking about the bits in the diagram there) it includes hardware input devices, user accounts, applications, GPU output, and the network (so basically the entire computer).<p>X11 is a protocol that clients (applications you run) use to communicate with a display server (it sends them input events and outputs things to the screen for them). Anyone can implement a display server that speaks the X11 protocol and clients can connect to it.<p>Xorg is one such server implementation. Unlike other server implementations, Xorg does all the heavy lifting to deal directly with a wide range of real world hardware devices (mouse, keyboard, GPU) which makes it quite complicated. Adding to that, it&#x27;s also quite old and thus supports some rather outdated hardware.<p>Just to make things super confusing, X.Org (the project) provides additional X11 display servers such as XWayland and Xephyr. These alternative implementations are much simpler than Xorg because instead of directly interfacing with the hardware they nest inside some other windowing system.')
