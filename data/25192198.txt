That technique for manipulation has been around for a very long time, convincing people that your lies are priveledged secrets. It checks so many boxes for fufilling emotional needs with utter bullshit. It flatters the believer and gives a scapegoat to mean they don&#x27;t need to try to understand nuanced issues, trade-offs and the cure being worse than the disease. It also provides an easy answer that doesn&#x27;t mean admitting to yourself that your friends and family have frankly gone far beyond differences of opinion to become outright terrible people.<p>I have personally concluded that there is no practical difference between credulity and corruptability - both make it easy to get them to support and commit evil. I can only conclude that a lack of critical thinking is a moral flaw in itself as strange it may sound at first blush. But really if greed can get people to do bad things nobody would deny that it is a moral flaw so why should credulity be any different?')
