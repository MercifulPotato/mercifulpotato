However, I think people have a strong tendency to overestimate how much their favorite pieces of information should force others to update their beliefs. The same piece of information can be valid in many worldviews  with wildly varying interpretations. It is sometimes difficult to separate the core information from the interpretation, and so one can become confused when sharing facts with others doesn&#x27;t change minds. This can be mitigated by spending more effort to understand others&#x27; priors.')
