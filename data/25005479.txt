Trying to remove all distraction, and going on&#x2F;off on a &quot;wave-like&quot; rebound pattern is very common, and sure persistence might help for some.<p>A slightly more fool-proof approach is to try to do a introspection on &quot;how&quot; and <i>what</i> part of the distraction you are coming back for, and gradually remove these.<p>For example, I had problem with Facebook long time ago. I tried to delete it from phone, block news-feed on browser with extension, but still couldn&#x27;t get rid of it entirely. After a bit of introspection, I realized checking facebook is actually not a problem at all, <i>getting stuck on it was</i>. So, I took my time to analyze <i>what</i> part of facebook did steal my attention. I pin-pointed it down to a couple of news pages, group &amp; liked pages, and about 90% of my friends posts. So I blocked all the news pages, groups &amp; linked pages, unfollowed 90% of my friends.<p>I still check facebook, but each time I check it, its about 20-30 sec MAX, and since the content is 99% boring or insignificant, it doesn&#x27;t steal my attention at all. When facebook became this to me, deleting it (and NOT re-installing) from the phone became a very painless process.<p>Hacker News is my new hit though.')
