It seems like a very minor planned change. The most significant part appears to be changing the version number drastically to adopt the trend of making version numbers meaningless. Or at least that is what I am assuming they are doing. I didn&#x27;t see it specified, but changing to version 40 only seems to make sense if the plan is to regularly increment the major version. Regardless, the changes don&#x27;t seem controversial at all.<p>I have been using GNOME 3 daily for a couple of years now. I have gotten used to it, but I still think it is genuinely bad. These minor changes don&#x27;t address any of my gripes, and in one case makes things ever so slightly worse. Honestly though, I don&#x27;t think these super minor changes are going to change anyone&#x27;s mind about GNOME 3.<p>Back to version numbers, if you are going to make them purely based on date like projects such as Chromium and Firefox have done, why not make the version number a date like Ubuntu does? The major version is meaningless in the normal major version sense and mapping the version number to the release date requires a per-project formula&#x2F;table.')
