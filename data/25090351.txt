Not to say that it can&#x27;t happen, but it would be more likely that we are missing a component&#x2F;relationship that we don&#x27;t understand about our reality either because we don&#x27;t have to the physical senses to detect it or the technology to measure it. I&#x27;d highly consider studying some physics even if you view yourself as a layman, it can geniunely be immense fun!')
