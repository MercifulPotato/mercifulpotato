I go on long walks and I&#x27;d like my partner to know where I am so she knows when I&#x27;ll be home or to surprise me along the route.<p>So far we&#x27;ve always shared via Whatsapp which recently stopped working for some reason. But I also don&#x27;t want to use Google maps or Whatsapp for privacy reasons. If you could find a way to make 100% sure Google won&#x27;t &quot;intercept&quot; the location and store it anyway, that would be great.<p>I&#x27;d use it probably 3-4 times a week. I&#x27;d be happy to pay for it but please don&#x27;t do the standard 10 bucks a month thing, I won&#x27;t even bother then. How about a model based on usage? 10c&#x2F;hour or something for the one sharing? (Being shared with could be free). If I had to commit to a subscription, I&#x27;d probably not sign up if it&#x27;s more than 2 bucks a month.')
