It&#x27;s very obvious that those inner rendering frames can be handled by remote servers. We&#x27;ve managed to reduce a lot of chromes memory usage by sleeping&#x2F;unmounting unused tabs transparently (where we can) and have seen a ton of performance improvement. Looking forward to swapping out the chromium rendering layer to a cloud one down the road!<p>The security implications are interesting too. Moving the &#x27;sandbox&#x27; to the cloud for security purposes seems like the browsers definitely missed some of their goals.')
