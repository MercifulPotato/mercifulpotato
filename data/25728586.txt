But it does, and it&#x27;s annoying!<p>KDE has own sins as well - they removed ability of running Dolphin as root giving some vague arguments about security and users protection, while other DE allows running their file managers with highest rights without any walkarounds nor weird acrobatics. I&#x27;ve seen some Plasma addons restoring this feature but it seems it doesn&#x27;t work on my Manjaro at all.')
