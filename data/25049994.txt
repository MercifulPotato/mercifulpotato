At the very basic level, I don&#x27;t know what 2GHz or 5GHz will mean for my computer aside from bigger is better, but anyone <i>can</i> understand &quot;2x faster.&quot;<p>Beyond that though, processor speed is increasingly useless as a single metric.  This thing has eight cores, half high-performance and half high-efficiency; GPUs are everywhere and doing seemingly everything; and RAM is always important.  The speed cannot be summarized in Hz, but in standardized tests and &quot;The stuff you care about is way faster now.&quot;')
