That&#x27;s how you paint yourself into a corner, fast.<p>It&#x27;s much easier to evolve from a very restrictive schema to a more open schema as the use-cases present themselves, than it is to move clients from an open schema to a more restrictive one because your backend is choking trying to support the cardinality of edge cases introduced by it.')
