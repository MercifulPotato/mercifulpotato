Cloudfront allows app developers to cache content on proxy servers hosted by AWS around the world – and closer to an app’s users – rather than load those files from the app’s servers. As a result, any files on the S3 buckets could be indirectly viewed and accessed through the CDN, regardless of their individual security settings.”<p>I have minimal knowledge of this kind of configuration, but it seems like making content available via a CDN from the same vendor should by default carry forward access restrictions on the original backend data.')
