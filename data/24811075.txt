State-of-the-art architectures typically rely on schedule-based safety models that are not productively expressible within Rust&#x27;s ownership-based safety model, and the performance characteristics of working within these respective safety models is not comparable. There aren&#x27;t many alternatives when a GC language is a non-starter due to the adverse impact of a GC on throughput. C++ is winning for data-intensive apps not because it is great (it isn&#x27;t) but because there isn&#x27;t a practical alternative.<p>I&#x27;ve seen Rust being used for the layer above C++, where it doesn&#x27;t have to deal with I&#x2F;O, scheduling, etc that don&#x27;t play well with Rust but you still want the throughput&#x2F;latency and memory safety.')
