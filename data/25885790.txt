You could make a dish on a movable mount, but from an RF perspective that would be no less detectable than a dish. The point is that Starlink is a two way link, so someone flying overhead in an airplane could detect the transmitted signal. TV dishes are harder to detect because they donâ€™t transmit when receiving TV, not because they are a dish.')
