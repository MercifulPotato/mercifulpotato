Who decides what is considered violence and what is not?<p>I personally feel black lives matter was a terrorist organization, they looted stores, destroyed people livelihood, murdered whites in the streets, and destroyed many cities across america. Yet posts calling for those protests are fully allowed, even encouraged on mainstream platforms like twitter etc. Yet a small group of crazies march on the rich politicians like pelosi profiting off all the dumb people who voted for them, eating 10000$ ice cream and going to hair salons while everyone is locked down and that is called violence!!<p>Why should apple be the one to decide what is violent and what isn&#x27;t. This is crazy.')
