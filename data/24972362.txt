I even found and fixed a mobile GPU heat death bug :) So that 2x to 4x is just my personal experience.<p>Some things like GPU pixel shaders tend to be magically slower on WebGL, even if you send the same raw HLSL&#x2F;GLSL source code. The reason appears to be that due to security concerns, the same shader source code is compiled differently by WebGL than by desktop OpenGL.<p>Also, many smart tricks like DMA from the SSD bus to the GPU are inherently very unsafe, so WebGL sandboxing simply doesn&#x27;t allow them. The result is that you need to copy the data twice instead of once and if memory bandwidth is a bottleneck (it usually is for triple-A), then that can easily completely waste performance.')
