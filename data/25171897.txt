Item(by='sreque', descendants=None, kids=[25172805, 25171963, 25173607], score=None, time=1605985464, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25171666, text='I can confirm this with recent interviewing experience. I interviewed at a top tech company and got asked puzzle coding questions I wasn&#x27;t prepared for. Testing whether I can find the longest palindrome subsequence of a string optimally via a tabular or memoized dynamic programming solution in 20 minutes has practically zero ability to measure how effective I am on the job. That said, after that interview I studied the algorithm and am now slightly prepared for the next big tech company I interview with, I guess.<p>In contrast, at another interview I got given a take-home assignment that I almost didn&#x27;t want to do because it felt like the kind of work I would do in my day job and I didn&#x27;t want to do that in the evening or my time off. That task, on the other hand, probably measures infinitely better how effective I am on the job.')
