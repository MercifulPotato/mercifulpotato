There seem to be a lot of people out there who don’t understand this concept and don’t understand that western societies are not immune to mass unrest or violence or even insurrection.  In particular it seems like courts and legislatures are failing at their most basic tasks in many western countries.  I hope that in Europe that the legislatures or the courts intervene precipitously in these kinds of widespread fraud by corporations; a few executives going to jail as an example to others would quickly correct the situation.  Otherwise this eats away at the credibility of the government in general and you just see more lawlessness.')
