Item(by='jessaustin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608580315, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25498508, text='Hughie is the protagonist. The viewer and nearly every other character relate to him and his actions. Butcher OTOH is a violent inconsiderate weirdo who is hated by everyone, including his parents. (He <i>is</i> barely tolerated by those he has dragooned onto his &quot;team&quot;.) Butcher was convenient for getting the action started but after he transitioned from &quot;mysterious stranger&quot; to &quot;surrogate father&quot; to &quot;everyone hates this asshole&quot;, his role would have been better filled by others on the team.<p>It would be a considerably more &quot;experimental&quot; program if a character like Butcher were the actual protagonist.')
