The opportunity cost in not leasing out can be made up for by holding out for tenants that will overpay on the commercial side, and rent control makes renting apartments out for too low a price unappealing on the residential side.<p>Kill both Prop 13 (entirely, not just sections of it) and rent control and you <i>might</i> see some normalcy return to the California property and rental market.')
