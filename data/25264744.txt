Shaped charges work because they either have enough kinetic energy from inertia to keep the explosion directed to the target or they fused with the target before exploding usually by also hitting it really fast.<p>This is what 400g of C4 looks like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ajmIEhK4LKc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ajmIEhK4LKc</a> and this is under good conditions where the forces of the blast are contained because they put them in a hole in the ground.<p>If you detonate a few 100 grams of military grade explosive mid air you pretty much need to be within slapping distance of someone to guarantee a kill from the concussive blast.<p>A hellfire missile has about 10 Kg of high explosive in its warhead and you still get people walking off from a direct vehicle hit mainly because if the missile breaks through the roof and through the floor of the car before exploding it&#x27;s usually sufficient to prevent the occupants from being turned into a brussels pate, and here were talking about a few millimeters of sheet metal protecting you against 10 Kg (if you wonder why - the path of least resistance works on explosions too, and rather well this is exactly why shape chargers work and why they don&#x27;t need to be made out of adamantium or even anything particularly though in fact what essentially is paper mache is often used to make the lenses that focus the explosion in a shaped charge).<p>With the payload these drones can carry a fragmentation warhead would do absolutely squat against a vehicle it might be able to devastate a crowd where these can essentially detonate on contact but even unarmored vehicles won&#x27;t be nearly as damaged as you think they would.<p>Life is not a video game.')
