I said I think humans avoided the night based on the way other primates in the area are prey for the big cats and hyenas. I&#x27;ve also never heard of any recent hunter-gatherer cultures where they hunt at night. I think that&#x27;s strong evidence against your claim.<p>You think humans would have risked the dangers to hunt at night for better cover but without evidence. Can you find an example of of a recent human hunter-gatherer group that did that? Any archaeological evidence? Obviously we&#x27;re not evolved as nocturnal animals - so the evolutionary evidence goes against your theory.')
