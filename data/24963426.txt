(I.e. a result of no significant correlation found.) Journals pick and choose the best articles to peer-review and publish out of all submissions.<p>It feels like there ought to be some other system for tracking no-result and unpublished studies, something easy and low-friction -- not the trouble of an entire paper, but maybe something more like the length of an abstract?<p>Then if you think about running a study, you can run a search to see if others have already done something similar and found nothing... and reach out to them personally if you need more info.<p>Is there nothing like this?')
