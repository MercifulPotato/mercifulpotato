For example, I’d be more inclined to buy a Tesla and install home solar panels then I would be to buy a VW because Tesla is emissions free and VW lied on their emissions tests.  VW lost some long term customers because of that incident and Tesla is continuing to attract new buyers that are concerned with climate change.  Due to this trend we are able to deploy more electric vehicles then government regulations require.')
