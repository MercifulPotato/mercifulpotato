See how that’s not the same thing? Instead of &#x27;not preventing someone opening a new shop in the village&#x27; you&#x27;re asking them to cut a hole in the side of their store so someone in a greasy food cart can connect up to it and sell smelly burgers with poor food hygiene standards in the middle of their boutique, and then maintain that hole going forward.<p>They don&#x27;t want to do that! Many of their customers don&#x27;t want that! Those customers that do want it can go somewhere else, like Android!')
