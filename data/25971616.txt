You’ll certainly crank up some terrible hour counts running purely off a generator, but for only 2kw continuous you can size a generator that will sip fuel. Depending on local fuel prices, it could take many many years before solar would be even close cost wise.<p>If only 2kw peak, a common strategy is generator to charge a battery bank, also charge when possible the bank with solar, and run inverters off the batteries (or switchover to the generator when charging the bank). Some people just skip the solar panels.  Solar has many problems with unpredictability, and if you need to be sure you’ll have power year round, it isn’t a good idea to rely on it 100% without some other way to charge or supplement it. Dedicated off grid folks always have a generator in my experience, even if it rarely has to get fired up.<p>Sizing a battery bank to give you enough excess to not worry about a freak 2 weeks of bad weather in winter is extremely expensive and has other issues (like not being able to properly cycle or maintain all the batteries due to lack of peak power)')
