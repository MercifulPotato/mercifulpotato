I would be all over that, but I&#x27;m a 24 year old man so maybe we can&#x27;t compare so much.<p>It&#x27;s definitely a bummer if you&#x27;re only seeing these kinds of events, but I also think these should be welcomed and encouraged as well. These activities bring kids of all types together and get the creative juices flowing. Why should it not be so for adults? There is countless evidence of controlled experiments demonstrating improved mental health and social connection in participants through these activities.<p>I recently worked for an educational NGO in India that runs social and emotional learning sessions primarily for underprivileged children but also for many adult clients in industry and public education. Countless documented success stories around self-empowerment in the face of much adversity, including representational. The vehicle that has facilitated this growth? Activities just like this. It just has to be done right to avoid distraction. Passive engagement doesn&#x27;t do anything. Of course, these sessions were complemented by focus groups and more direct discussion, but in no way was any of this dumbed down by the visual arts.<p>Have you attended any yet? If not, you might want to give it a chance. Your aversion may just be ignorance. Legos and arts &amp; crafts are not just for kids.')
