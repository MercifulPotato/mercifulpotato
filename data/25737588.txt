But HFTs&#x27; tech advantage isn&#x27;t just about finding a better arbitrage algorithm or being smarter: it&#x27;s also quite clearly about exploiting a pure technical advantage over other traders. The fact that HFTs are so willing to invest in speed <i>even to achieve a tiny advantage over other HFTs</i> kind of gives the game away.<p>And when people quite rightly observe that having a speed advantage over other traders obviously allows extractive behavior like frontrunning, a bunch of people on HN come out with irate counter-takes that claim HFT are an unalloyed good -- never something nuanced like, &quot;yes HFT could allow for some extractive behavior, but it&#x27;s counterbalanced by these advantages which I will explain in detail.&quot; (And the corollary, which is an explanation of &quot;why a world where all traders have the same speed advantages wouldn&#x27;t have all the claimed advantages of HFT but be even more efficient.&quot;)<p>I guess it&#x27;s also worth pointing out that these responses are usually from people who are involved in the HFT industry in some way, and usually they start out by accusing people of &quot;not understanding the industry&quot;. Which is precisely the accusation many make against HFT: that it&#x27;s so deliberately opaque that people outside the industry can&#x27;t possibly determine how much extraction there is compared to value being added. Saying &quot;trust us&quot; or &quot;you couldn&#x27;t possibly know because you aren&#x27;t on the inside profiting from it&quot; is not the compelling argument you think it is.')
