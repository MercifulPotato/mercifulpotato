Projects are only successful when somebody knows how everything works together.<p>The person you feel comfortable approaching with a problem knows about problems nobody else knows about. If the problem turns out to be severe, they have more time to come up with a reasonable fix. They look smarter in the emergency meeting. If the problem is malingering, like architecture problems, they&#x27;re constantly inoculated with details about broad parts of the system they might not otherwise be looking at.<p>If you are being helpful, your goal should be to get promoted into a mentoring or a leadership position.
