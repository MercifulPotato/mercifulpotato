Item(by='imgabe', descendants=None, kids=[25311970], score=None, time=1607143289, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25311584, text='&gt; That&#x27;s another assumption, I&#x27;m concerned about both.<p>Not an assumption at all. From your response to my other comment: &quot;You can burn the money in a furnace for all I care, as long as the ratio between the richest and poorest goes down substantially.&quot; I&#x27;m really trying, and I can&#x27;t find any other way to interpret that than your primary, if not only concern, is just making rich people poorer.<p>&gt; You still haven&#x27;t answered the question of what is going to be harmed by reducing the wealth of every billionaire by 73%.<p>You still haven&#x27;t explained exactly how you would make this happen. Forced stock sales? Government mandated price caps on stocks? What? Is Bezos supposed to write a check for $130B? You realize it&#x27;s not sitting in cash in a bank account, right?<p>But more importantly, you are the one proposing a radical change to the status quo. The onus is on you to prove, not only that the change is not harmful (not at all apparent from historical evidence) but that it will provide some benefit that will outweigh the cost to implement it. I mean a benefit besides &quot;It makes me feel bad when people are richer than me, and I&#x27;ll get to enjoy some schadenfreude if they get knocked down a peg&quot;.<p>&gt; We tried the New Deal, fought a Europe-destroying war, followed by more Keynesian policy, and it resulted in prosperity (including the areas rebuilt under the Marshall Plan). I&#x27;m just some guy, but I&#x27;m going to go with my gut and say we should do the thing that worked, over the economic ideology that has failed the average American every time it has been trotted out.<p>What you are proposing is not the New Deal, nor the Marshall Plan, nor any economic policy that has been tried in the US before. The New Deal did not involve confiscating 73% of the wealth of billionaires (or the inflation-adjusted equivalent). It did not involve taxing unrealized gains on stocks. The US has never had a wealth tax before. Most countries that <i>have</i> had one ended up repealing it because it&#x27;s expensive to enforce compared to the amount of revenue it brings in and wealthy people, unsurprisingly, are quite capable of moving to another country that doesn&#x27;t have a wealth tax.')
