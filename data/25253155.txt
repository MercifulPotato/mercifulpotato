And no one actually said easier, they said faster. Code is typically full of parenthesis special notations and characters. Nobody&#x27;s speed-reading code. That doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>You speed read code all the time - when working on a codebase you can pinpoint the exact segment of a line you&#x27;re interested without even parsing the whole line. For example if you&#x27;re trying to modify an argument that&#x27;s being passed from parent scope - you navigate there and just go to the argument on the caller - you don&#x27;t read the previous arguments or call definition, you don&#x27;t read surrounding lines, etc. you just know where you are and what you want to change.<p>Having a limit on width is very useful - but 80 is too constraining because of indentation and using descriptive names (assuming you don&#x27;t obfuscate your function names, like you said an anti-pattern).<p>I personally like 120 characters :<p>- beyond that and the editor takes up too much horizontal space and my eyes need to jump too far from line start to end, I&#x27;ve worked on a ruby project that had unconstrained line length and it was a nightmare even after a year spent on the project<p>- below that I have to break too many lines that shouldn&#x27;t really be broken, worked on a project in JavaScript that had 80 character limit as well a long time ago and it was a complete mess, it directly impacts the way you organise code and not in a good way IMO')
