I don&#x27;t see widespread criticism against US non-state companies BECAUSE of their involvement with the US. Even talks about privacy issues are mostly about how those companies could abuse the data, not about how the US govt could abuse that data.<p>I don&#x27;t see many people calling for the banning of US non-state companies.<p>I don&#x27;t see US students and researchers being ousted out of other countries for being potential spies, even though there&#x27;s no proof.<p>I don&#x27;t see people, who have a US background but living in other countries for a long time, being taken to parliament to unconditionally condemn the US govt before they&#x27;re trusted as normal citizen.<p>&gt; Heaven forbid we also call out the CCP when they do something much worse!<p>Calling out the CCP, and blanket banning all Chinese companies, are not at all the same thing, or even on the same level.')
