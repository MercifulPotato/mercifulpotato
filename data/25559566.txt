As always, the labor theory of value is complete bunk. The same process used to collect samples on Earth will not create the same value in the samples.<p>The value of the samples is the willingness of someone to pay for them. A particular group of scientists want to see what unexpected components and features are in the sample. Send the same sample to a group of vehicle engineers or surgeons or athletes and they won&#x27;t be willing to pay that price.')
