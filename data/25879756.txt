You&#x27;ll have the top 1% of wallets controlling &gt; 80% of the supply. Dev keeping half the supply to themselves. Even airdrops to users like Uniswap did don&#x27;t prevent someone from buying up most of the supply. Crypto and governance tokens give you plutocracy, not democracy.<p>And that&#x27;s not even mentioning the issue around access to the code (see Blockstream)')
