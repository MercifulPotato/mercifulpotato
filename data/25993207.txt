To be honest, power consumption was of interest for the build I was talking about because I wanted it to be fanless (I actually ended up adding a very silent fan, just for peace of mind). For my NAS needs, I&#x27;m building in a recycled server, so power usage isn&#x27;t as much of a concern.<p>However, I did look for 2.5&quot; drives (the server comes with a 2.5&quot; backplane) and there don&#x27;t seem to be many &quot;consumer&quot; drives in this format that are both high capacity (&gt;2 TB) and non SMR (I&#x27;ll be running ZFS). I&#x27;m also not looking to spend very much, so SSDs are out.<p>[0] Seagate specs for 2.5&quot; Barracuda: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seagate.com&#x2F;www-content&#x2F;datasheets&#x2F;pdfs&#x2F;barracuda-2-5-DS1907-3-2005US-en_US.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seagate.com&#x2F;www-content&#x2F;datasheets&#x2F;pdfs&#x2F;barracud...</a><p>The startup current is 1.2 A under 5V. So if you&#x27;re running four of them, you&#x27;ll need 24 W just for the drives. Not sure if the &quot;cheap&quot; enclosures are able to stagger drive startup.<p>My Gigabyte motherboard cannot, so it would require a PSU large enough to drive both the board (CPU + RAM + etc) and the drives for a little while. So with four drives, you&#x27;d be looking at 50 W to be sure it fits.')
