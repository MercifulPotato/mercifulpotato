It brought all of the posts over, though, so that’s good.<p>Using drone with caching for rubygems got my jekyll builds down to under 2 minutes (I use docker) but I imagine hugo will be under a second once I get it switched over. I’ll probably just commit the binary to the repo.<p>Shoot me an email if you’d like me to share the sources.')
