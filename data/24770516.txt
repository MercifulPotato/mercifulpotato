Item(by='somethoughts', descendants=None, kids=[24770799], score=None, time=1602624395, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24770118, text='&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s worth pointing out that housing costs are included in CPI (by proxy of rent).<p>I think that is the reason CPI hasn&#x27;t increased.  CPI only accounts for rent and not the cost of actually buying the house.  There are definitely highly inflated price to rent ratios particularly in land constrained urban areas.<p>I think a better way to put it is that there is low&#x2F;no Consumer Price Inflation but there is tremendous Asset Inflation (in stuff that wealthy people buy).<p>And perhaps if there did need to be inflation, then perhaps this is better than the reverse (i.e. high CPI inflation which would impact people&#x27;s ability to buy the basics)?')
