I’ve only ever had Nikon or Fuji.<p>There’s a bunch of other small things that initially roused my suspicions that these weren’t my photos:<p>Whoever took the photos kept all the photos they took, there are sequences of 50+ photos of the exact same thing, I never save the extra shots, i always just choose the one i want to keep and discard the rest at import time.<p>It’s possible they were shared photos but my gut feeling is no.  The photos date from around the time i was a heavy user of google photos, well i was a heavy user of picasa anyway and used gphotos as a backup. I would definitely have spotted these photos if they were in my collection back then.')
