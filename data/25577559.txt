It doesn’t mean that it’s not a potential danger to the cells, though.<p>I’m not anti-vax. But, I don’t  want to gloss over the danger with vaccines that were fast-tracked and now will be given to a few billion people.<p>What could go wrong? Lots, but if we don’t take it, that could be much worse.')
