For people who have had a Gmail account for over a decade (almost 2), they&#x27;ve probably got most of their life connected to it -- losing the account then is tantamount to a huge chunk of your life being erased. Photos. Conversations. Access to dozens or hundreds of other websites.<p>Basically all that&#x27;d be left is your physical ID, your bank account and you get to start over from scratch.<p>And while all of the above <i>can</i> happen, many things on that list are under your control: losing access to your Google account (usually) isn&#x27;t.<p>You&#x27;re quite correct there are no absolutes but the problem is, when the consequence of something happening is extreme, the level of effort you put in to protect yourself from it must be equally extreme: to the point that it&#x27;s generally good advice simply not to use 3rd party auth at all.<p>I no longer do.
