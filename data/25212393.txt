It seems further ahead on the Darwin AArch64 transition. About 80% of things that I&#x27;ve tried have worked without trouble. Unfortunately, ffmpeg wasn&#x27;t one of them. I got that working yesterday with libx264 and libx265 integration. Oddly, libx265 installs fine under MacPorts but libx264 doesn&#x27;t. But I was able to download the latest from git and build it and copy it manually to &#x2F;opt&#x2F;local.')
