No wonder he eventually attracted a lot of believers. I love this:<p>&quot;Well as a longer-term investor I have the benefit of heavily discounting daily moves. I care much more about the longer-term charts, and these have been fairly constructive for months now. Even today, after the typical quarterly sell-off, the longer-term chart still looks decent so there’s been nothing to panic over. Let’s see what the price does over the next few weeks.\nOf course charts are only a minor part of the equation in my opinion. The fundamentals are much more important in a situation like this.&quot;')
