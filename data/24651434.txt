If you want a Logitech webcam with USB-C, you&#x27;ve got to pay over twice as much for a model like their StreamCam.<p>I&#x27;m happy to use dongles for HDMI or Ethernet when I have to. But the fact that I still have to use dongles with <i>brand-new</i> devices that are <i>still</i> only made in USB-A seems ridiculous. At this rate, I don&#x27;t see how we&#x27;re <i>ever</i> going to move on.')
