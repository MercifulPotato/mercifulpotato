There&#x27;s no campaign limits, so if you don&#x27;t spend much, you&#x27;re liable to lose.<p>As a result, the people who run successful campaigns almost always have already agreed to side with the MPA and other interests that have money.<p>Us telling our legislature we&#x27;re not happy about it won&#x27;t help either because, well, what are we going to do? Vote for the person on the other party? Not likely. Vote for another guy? It&#x27;s unlikely anyone else will even be on the ballot since both the democrats and republicans will avoid having multiple candidates to avoid splitting the vote within the party.<p>I agree that the problem is really legal at its root, but I think we need better plans than &quot;contact your representative&quot;.')
