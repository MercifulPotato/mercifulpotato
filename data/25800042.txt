C&#x2F;C++ just allow undefined behavior which means they don&#x27;t need to bounds check because the generated code is allowed to have any behavior in this case (either the read just reads some random memory out of the heap or the kernel kills the process since it tried to access unmapped memory). In rust, panicing involves unwinding the stack. The compiler must generate code to do the bounds check and then also generate code to do the stack unwinding for the panic in the case where the bounds check fails.')
