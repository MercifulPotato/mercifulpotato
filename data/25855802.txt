Thank You.<p>One suggestion: A lot of folks don&#x27;t go to gym, lack access to exercise equipment etc. It might be worthwhile to have a section on how to work out the specific muscles without any equipment and in minimal space using only bodyweight&#x2F;calisthenics; eg. Yoga stretches, deep squats, pushups(both Normal and Hindu) etc.')
