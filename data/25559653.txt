I went with a smaller keyboard for ergonomics.  Also, I never use F-keys and rarely use the arrow keys, and there are some &quot;60%&quot; layouts (The [Mass]Drop ALT) that still have the arrow keys.  I don&#x27;t care for the RGB and other blingy crap on these, since I really don&#x27;t look at the keyboard much anyway.')
