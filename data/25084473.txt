However a couple of years from now, there will remain a temptation to use the same tools to address whatever normal problems we have. And that is a big step towards a planned economy like the Soviet Union had.<p>It is difficult for me to imagine another set of scenarios that could plausibly lead to popular support of a lockdown. Even our past lockdowns from this year were poorly enforced and basically voluntary (the worst punishment was largely being fined). Yeah businesses shuttered but at GREAT political expense to politicians which is why we have half assed our lockdowns repeatedly. Politicians couldn&#x27;t bear any more pain. The last thing they want to do is lock down again.<p>&gt; I cannot forget that 9&#x2F;11 has transformed us into a permanent surveillance state where our communications are tracked, travel by plane involves a search where someone gets to look at your privates<p>Yeah 9&#x2F;11 definitely enhanced the surveillance state which is deeply unfortunate, but we had security screening for planes long before we had 9&#x2F;11, and it wasn&#x27;t just 9&#x2F;11 that made the experience miserable, it was the 10 follow on attacks targeting different vulns in the screening process (liquids, shoes, blah blah). The security measures need to be decently strong because we vehemently refuse to employ the more effective authoritarian technique of flagging passengers based on history and demographics like they do in places like Israel (eg, simply flag anyone with a higher probability of being a muslim because most attacks were performed by muslims). We are actually resisting the aggressive response in this case.<p>&gt; it is considered normal in low crime neighborhoods to require security badges and&#x2F;or passing armed guards to get into office building<p>This has nothing to do with terrorism or 9&#x2F;11.')
