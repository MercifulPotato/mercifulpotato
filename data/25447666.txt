What would be your contingency plans?<p>If your policies are workable, let&#x27;s get them concisely outlined and email them to some key interest groups so that they can start getting them out to the public and key stakeholders.<p>Do you have experience in Public Administration and Public Health? If you&#x27;re an epidemiologist or city official, your credentials will give your policies more weight and your knowledge and experience will be highly valued since it likely takes into account a variety of &#x27;Chesterton&#x27;s Fences&#x27; that a layperson wouldn&#x27;t have considered.<p>Even if you have no knowledge of the field, you might have some great ideas.')
