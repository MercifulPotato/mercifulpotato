Idk about Appleâ€™s GPU, but for example there is no GPU alternative to the SQRTPD instruction (Square root of double precision). Also, when there is branch divergence across threads, CPUs still do a much better job than GPUs.<p>Curious to think about how unified memory may change the ratio of flops&#x2F;memory access when it makes sense to shift job from CPU (better for low number) to GPU (better for high ratio)')
