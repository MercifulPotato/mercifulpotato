Yes, the functional people are absolutely correct that shared mutable state is evil.  If that&#x27;s the world you live in, though, you need to deal with it effectively.  You need to have thread 1 able to respond to an external event by changing shared state that thread 2 sees, but in a controlled way so that thread 2 never sees an inconsistent state.<p>Now, there is a place for pure functions in that environment.  But making decisions based on state can run so thoroughly through the code that &quot;functional core&quot; leaves very little core.')
