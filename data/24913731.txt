And humans so consistently err on the side of leaping to conclusions in advance of the facts, that we need to consciously counterbalance by reminding ourselves of the fact.<p>Yes, correlation is suggestive of causation.  Yes, it suggests an often fruitful line of research.  But while pursuing that line of research it is important to remain aware that it isn&#x27;t proof.  And to not shut off other lines of research.<p>In this light, it is worth reading <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;calteches.library.caltech.edu&#x2F;51&#x2F;2&#x2F;CargoCult.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;calteches.library.caltech.edu&#x2F;51&#x2F;2&#x2F;CargoCult.htm</a> again.  Science isn&#x27;t supposed to be easy.  Scientists have had to learn the hard way how to be honest with themselves.  Some fields have done better on that than others.<p>Medicine&#x27;s record on this front has generally been abysmal.  And their failure to be honest with themselves about the limits of their own theories in this case has had an opportunity cost measured in trillions of dollars spent on millions of tragically preventable lingering deaths.<p>In the face of that, it is wrong to argue that their mistake was a defensible jump in reasoning that people shouldn&#x27;t be blamed for.  Instead we should notice that a logical error really can have a cost measured in trillions spent on millions of tragically preventable deaths.  And figure out how to not do that again.')
