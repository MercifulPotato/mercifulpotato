It is based on his paper with Luis Trabb Pardo called &quot;The early development of programming languages&quot;, originally released as Stanford Report STAN-CS-76-562 (the link posted here), then properly published in an <i>Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Technology</i> (1977), reprinted at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1016&#x2F;B978-0-12-491650-0.50019-8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1016&#x2F;B978-0-12-491650-0.50019-8</a>, and finally reprinted with corrections&#x2F;updates as pages 1 to 93 of &quot;Selected Papers on Computer Languages&quot;, 2003 (the fifth volume of Knuth&#x27;s collected papers). The talk was given shortly after this book came out, so he spoke about the first chapter of the book I guess.<p>The nice idea here is to illustrate (very) early programming languages from their first decade (roughly 1947 to 1957), by writing the same program (&quot;TPK&quot;) in each of them. I added a little bit about it to the lede of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=TPK_algorithm&amp;oldid=992083216" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=TPK_algorithm&amp;old...</a> (the rest of the current version of that Wikipedia article misses the point by giving implementations in C &#x2F; Python &#x2F; Rust, while originally the point was to illustrate the programming languages in which all the ideas we now take for granted were yet to be developed).<p>&gt; <i>The history of a subject helps us not only to understand how the important ideas were born but also to appreciate the amount of progress that has been made. The history of programming languages is a striking example, because basic concepts that we now regard as self-evident were by no means obvious a priori; many years of hard work by brilliant and dedicated people were necessary before these basic principles were learned.</i><p>&gt; <i>This talk will discuss contributions of Zuse (1945), Goldstine and von Neumann (1946), Curry (1948), Mauchly et al (1949), Burks (1950), Wheeler (1951), Rutishauser (1951), BÃ¶hm (1951), Glennie (1952), Hopper et al (1953), Laning and Zierler (1953), Brooker (1954), Kaminynin and Ljubimskiy (1954), Ershov (1955), Grems and Porter (1955), Elsworth et al (1955), Blum (1956), Perlis et al (1956), Katz et al (1956), Bauer and Samelson (1956), Melahn et al (1956), as well as the prototype of FORTRAN developed by Backus et al from 1954 to 1957. At least a dozen of these efforts will be illustrated by showing how a particular procedure called the TPK algorithm might have been coded at the time.</i>')
