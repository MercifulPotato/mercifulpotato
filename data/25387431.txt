Most of the code is from the 80&#x27;s or 90&#x27;s but is well commented and easy to work with and understand. Speaking of, most of this code still works or was in use until 2-3 years ago--on the HP3000. Its a testament to how long this stuff can be kept useful. Also, the COBOL team here wasn&#x27;t astoundingly well paid, but good stable and low-stress jobs in the middle-range of local income is something that is becoming harder and harder to find.')
