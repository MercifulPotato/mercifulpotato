In case of stolen or lost funds I always notify the police which they really don&#x27;t seem to want but It&#x27;s the only way to activate insurance , so wtf is going on? Are they professionals or its an elaborate scam?<p>I&#x27;m waiting for 2677 dollars and 40 cents so I can pay my fucking rent and buy food but I get none of that with revolut.<p>Is this what I should expect from an online bank in 2020-2021?')
