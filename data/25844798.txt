But once you go to 2560x1440 with slightly bigger screens the issue with 16:9 generally becomes wasted horizontal space.<p>I have found with 2x 16:9 that a lot of interfaces really haven&#x27;t caught up to the widescreen aspect yet and I imagine that is worse. 32:9 is going to be great for gaming however and that is largely where I think 16:9 is much better than 4:3 and why I used triple screens in the past.')
