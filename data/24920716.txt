And, realistically, being spied on by the CIA is fairly low down the average person&#x27;s list of problems. Even the citizens who are most directly threatened by American policing would prefer dealing with the immediate threat of street violence and gunshot murders by the police than the distant, nebulous threat of the CIA plane over the protests.<p>Having your <i>candidate</i> spied on by the CIA, FSB, Met police, or Jim-Bob&#x27;s Laptop Repair Shop is more of a problem.')
