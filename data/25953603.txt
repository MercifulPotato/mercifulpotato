Trump violated many rules in his years on Twitter. Twitter let him go on for things that would have resulted in a banhammer for anyone else. Same goes for the alt-right. They were allowed to go on for a very long time. Despite the hate and harassment they generated. Are you arguing Trump should have received special treatment forever? That sites can&#x27;t moderate as they see fit?<p>On the other hand, these WSB bans seem to be related to external pressure from some very wealthy people. Not really the same situation. And not something that&#x27;s new to the Internet. Digg&#x27;s blocking of the HD-DVD key comes to mind. Or sites that removed content under threat of a lawsuit.')
