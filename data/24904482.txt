Figma  is still ahead of Sketch Cloud for sharing and collaboration.<p>The Figma rest API also helps to improve the design&#x2F;dev workflow. I did tools for Sketch and Figma to extract icons into React components. While the Sketch CLI helps, the Figma API is portable and easier to use — handling stdout and files vs doing simple Rest calls.<p>I see the same trend with other native apps. I love Keynote and I hate Google Slides with all my heart (who thought that was a good idea to use the scroll gesture to move to the next slide in the editor!?). But, the last week I had to collaborate in a presentation and Keynote collab crashed all the time... it felt like going back to the 2000: sharing files with version numbers and notes to not overlap our work. Suddenly the sharing use case became so painful, that I was more open to work in a limited tool like GSlides.<p>BTW: I love macOS native apps, but if Apple doesn’t fix the collaboration use case, the browser apps are going to eat them... like Google Docs did with Word.')
