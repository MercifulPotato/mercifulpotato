Conventional thinkers have a sense of value which is grounded mostly in social approval&#x2F;reinforcement; their sense of value is mostly detached from any underlying utility.<p>Independent thinkers are better at innovating since they don&#x27;t value social approval&#x2F;reinforcement and so they are more capable at identifying real utility value.<p>The problem today is that there are many conventional thinkers and they have been reinforcing each other&#x27;s arbitrary decisions (not rooted in utility). This arbitrariness which is only rooted in social convention has been terrible for independent thinkers. Independent thinkers have been competing with large groups of conventional thinkers; on a ratio of maybe 1 to 100 or worse.<p>A lone genius is no match for hundreds of fools. History has demonstrated this time and time again. Socrates, Galileo... Successfully persecuted for being independent thinkers. It doesn&#x27;t matter that they were right.<p>Our society just seems to be breeding conventional thinkers by the millions.')
