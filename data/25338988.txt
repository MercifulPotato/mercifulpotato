I ran into a hiccup when I was setting up the Chrome extension. It asked for the API from my account. I copied the API and pasted it into the extension but it didn&#x27;t seem to work when I tried sending an article. I went back to the extension setting and realized that when I pasted the API number it added it to the default text saying to go to listenlater for the api code. Once I manually deleted this and left the API key in everything worked. Maybe you can update so that when you click into the box to enter API the explanation text auto removes itself.')
