That in a good number of areas bugs are said to not really matter that much because you gonna have some, so why not having some more so that you can sooner have something instead of nothing.<p>One of the sector where this can arguably be applied the most is videogames. Nobody dies in real-life, nor has their data stolen, when a video game crashes (esp. a single player one). Or when the polygons are sometimes all over the place. Or when characters randomly T-pose pantless on their motorcycle for 2s. Or when scared NPC just disappear when out of your field of view.<p>Well actually this is a reminder that enough is enough, and that garbage is garbage, and not a sign of success nor wisdom. And don&#x27;t even get me started on the consequences of this attitude for people doing the real work. Would CDPR codebase be more easy to improve right now if management had not imposed this failed launch after repeatedely telling plain lies during months? I don&#x27;t know, but from my experience this is likely. <i>Maybe</i> on some axis the operation will have some net temporary positive results, but in the long run this is just a complete disaster: the reputation and trust that permitted such many pre-orders in the first place is likely broken for years. This will also affect other important things for their business: current or prospect employees might be less likely to want to work there.<p>This is also a reminder of how fragile the value brought by giant digital stores is, (if it is even net positive, considering your own priorities). Between Sony and MS selling unreviewed garbage to their clients, GoG refusing games for political reasons, and concerned digital stores commonly leveraging (abusing?) being for a specific hardware platform for imposing partial (only possible digital store) or total (if the only possible digital store is the only possible way to install software) monopolies for said platform with completely arbitrary and changing rules, sometimes even fighting local consumer protection laws, one might think carefully if the positive things that remain, if any, are worth it. The current overall situation may not be in the interest of the developers, and even less so of the users. At least I consider it not being in my interest.')
