(People complaining about dead people voting is a great example of this. Someone casting an early ballot, and dying before November 3rd is an example of a dead person voting... But not of election fraud.)<p>If we&#x27;re going to blame the Russian boogieman for the milk going sour, have you considered that maybe their election interference mostly consists of casting doubt on the election&#x27;s results? Or of the 2016 playbook of spreading alt-right propaganda?<p>Sure, anything is possible, and maybe Santa Claus is real, but if you want right-thinking people to listen to you, you need to find evidence. So far, the evidence for wide-spread, systemic fraud has ranged from &#x27;non-existent&#x27; to &#x27;withdrawn when asked to swear on it under oath&#x27; to &#x27;completely rubbish&#x27;. That doesn&#x27;t stop the losing party from throwing a temper tantrum, and refusing to accept the results.')
