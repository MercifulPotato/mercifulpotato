It seems like rust has pattern matching and immutability which matches to F# pretty good?<p>My use cases are mostly desktop class machines, with optional extensions to single board computers and maybe, maybe, mobile devices of some kind. Utility programs, soap and rest web services, guis for the rest apis etc.')
