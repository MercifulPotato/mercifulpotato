You could add friends from Facebook or just manually and it had a neat feature where you could group individuals that you didn&#x27;t want to &quot;get&quot; eachother, eg you could group couples in larger friend groups so they didn&#x27;t get eachother.<p>It used a genetic algorithm to generate the pairings and handled all the messaging so the organiser was also kept in the dark about who got who.<p>I slapped an Amazon ad on there and it worked great, but I never bothered marketing it so it got very little usage and eventually I took it down when shutting down an old server.<p>I learnt a lot about mysql and genetic algorithms, both of which I&#x27;ve gone on to use extensively in my job so it was well worth it overall, just sad it didn&#x27;t generate a bit of passive income :&#x2F;')
