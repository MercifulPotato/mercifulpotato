How is the experience of using nix-darwin? I haven&#x27;t used it yet for fear of breakage (unlike in NixOS). I still have Homebrew but only for Casks, do you know if this too can be Nixified?<p>&gt; I even went as far as coding up colour scheme configurations to synchronise colours between Kitty, Tmux, and Neovim, and added some configs to compile Neovim from source to get to some of its newer features, and I don’t think I would’ve done any of that (or rather, kept any of that around) without Nix.<p>This sounds interesting!  Are your dotfiles public?')
