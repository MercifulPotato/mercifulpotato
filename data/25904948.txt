However, in the Balkan countries these movements have had little impact, even among the Roma themselves.<p>There is a small Roma intelligentsia, university-educated and aware of those international trends, who welcomes the usage of &quot;Roma (and Sinti)&quot; instead of the traditional word. Among most Roma, however, it is often the case that if you use the term &quot;Roma&quot; while speaking with them, they will correct you and say &quot;Don’t call me that, I’m a &lt;local word equivalent to &#x27;gypsy&#x27;&gt;&quot;.<p>Note also that in the Balkans, the Roma generally prefer to maintain their own language rather secret, for in-group use only. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprise if this extended even to their ethnonym, and when outsiders say &quot;Roma&quot; this sounds like those outsiders are appropriating their word.')
