But then that&#x27;d be used to condemn them as well.<p><i>why it is inappropriate for employees of the company to complain about such dubious donations of their CEO</i><p>Totally appropriate, just as long as those employees don&#x27;t mind the CEO telling everyone that <i>their</i> political donations are dubious&#x2F;questionable, demanding they publicly denounce their spouse, or controlling their private political and charitable donations.<p>But of course those employees would explode if the CEO even hinted at doing any of those things. One rule for them and another for the boss, likely justified with vague rhetoric about power. But, you can&#x27;t have it both ways. If employees can demand control over the CEO&#x27;s life but not vice-versa, then it&#x27;s the employees who have the power, not the CEO. Yet we all know that&#x27;s not how companies actually work. Eventually even tech CEOs will realise that, so expect them to get a <i>lot</i> more aggressive against this kind of employee activism in future. It&#x27;s simply not fair on them, currently.')
