Seems like it might be hard to come by employers who do this though.<p>Really? This is normal? I find it extremely bizarre and not to mention shitty that an employer should somehow have any say whatsoever about what you do for economic or personal gain in your free personal time. You&#x27;re not a piece of property and never should be controlled to this degree no matter the nature of your work.')
