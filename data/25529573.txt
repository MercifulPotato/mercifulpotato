But the style of play cuts both ways! The biggest difference, I think, is that zone defense was illegal for (almost) Jordan&#x27;s whole career. This allowed Jordan to showcase his isolation scoring, and I think Jordan was clearly the best isolation scorer ever.<p>This argument is more or less convincing depending on how you factor in the greater physicality (e.g. handchecking). My hypothesis is that LeBron would have been extremely hard to guard alone even with the relaxed rules. IIRC, Miami Lebron weighed 260+ and was still faster than most wings; Jordan topped out around 220 in the 2nd 3-peat. The available evidence suggests that LeBron is pretty hard to hurt -- unless you think all NBA players have somehow become more injury-prone, his almost spotless injury record relative to his peers  is remarkable.<p>We seem to have different aesthetic preferences for basketball. I think late 90s basketball is ugly as hell! But  I&#x27;ll argue that the cross-era comparisons are not that easy, and both players are hard to extricate from the style of their eras anyway.')
