I am an open-minded person and certainly not someone who objects simply because something appears to violate some sort of left-wing dogma.<p>But, for example, in the southern Amazonian areas of northern Brazil, deforestation is carried out by logging companies and ranch owners, and the ranch and logging company owners mostly come from richer areas of southern Brazil. So local people are poor, and the people from areas with higher GDP are the ones doing the deforesting. At the very least you need to explain why what you said isn&#x27;t contradicted by obvious examples like that.')
