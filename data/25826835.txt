I wish the author mentioned how much he was trying to sell the service for. It could have been $59 a month or $599 a month and with doctors you could potentially expect the same answer.<p>I&#x27;m not a psychologist but some of the author&#x27;s quoted text came off extremely demeaning in written form. If the author happens to read this, did you really say those things directly to them?<p>For example, Susan (psychologist) was quoted as saying:<p>&gt; <i>&quot;Oh sure! I mean, I think in many cases I&#x27;ll just prescribe what I normally do, since I&#x27;m comfortable with it. But you know it&#x27;s possible that sometimes I&#x27;ll prescribe something different, based on your metastudies.&quot;</i><p>To which you replied:<p>&gt; <i>&quot;And that isn&#x27;t worth something? Prescribing better treatments?&quot;</i><p>Imagine walking into the office of someone who spent the last ~10 years at school and then potentially 20 years practicing their craft as a successful psychologist and then you waltz in and tell them what they prescribe is wrong and your automated treatment plan is better.')
