The supermarkets sell authentic French wine and chocolate and will charge you for grocery bags, just like in Europe.<p>The vast majority (upwards of 90% I believe) of the 6000ish residents though live on the smaller island of St. Pierre. The nearby much larger island of Miquelon, and the attached island of Langlade to its south, are vastly barren with a very basic settlement that has 1 restaurant and 1 bakery. There are a couple of inns on it, and I managed to rent a bike from the one I stayed at, and used it to bike down to Langlade. A few photos from my trip:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dheera.net&#x2F;photos&#x2F;places&#x2F;spm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dheera.net&#x2F;photos&#x2F;places&#x2F;spm</a><p>The road to Langlade is actually very well-paved until the very end. It&#x27;s a very nice road for biking, although a little terrifying hearing the waves crashing into the island on both sides, some wild horses, and no humans in sight:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;static.dheera.net&#x2F;photos&#x2F;places&#x2F;spm&#x2F;web-2048&#x2F;img_0022.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;static.dheera.net&#x2F;photos&#x2F;places&#x2F;spm...</a><p>I love exploring these &quot;politically interesting&quot; islands.<p>Another one I explored is the Matsu Islands which are very close to the coast of China but under control of the ROC (Taiwan) government. It&#x27;s also a very interesting place. As a part of the ROC, it&#x27;s littered with 7-Elevens. But due to the history of the place, its signs claim it to be a part of Fujian province, though Fujian under the ROC rather than Fujian under the PRC. (Not here to debate the politics, it&#x27;s just what the local signs say.)')
