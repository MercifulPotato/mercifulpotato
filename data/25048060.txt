There are multiple JDK implementations. There are a lot of OpenJDK builds from different vendors, including paid support options. There is an extremely mature library and tooling ecosystem. While I don&#x27;t think that JVM is superior to .NET VM, it&#x27;s not inferior either. .NET supports value types while JVM support some very advanced garbage collectors. And, of course, JVM development is not over. Hopefully, in a few years there will be value types in JVM as well. Java is inferior to C# as a language, but there&#x27;s Scala or Kotlin for those who want better language and they are more on-par with C#. And for many people Java language is enough to write good code and they don&#x27;t really need any more features. May be simple language is a feature in itself.<p>I don&#x27;t see any strong reasons to switch to .NET from Java for those who heavily invested in Java already. But I think that .NET is pretty strong, so the same argument could be made for the other direction, for folks who are fluent in MS infrastructure and want to tackle Linux, .NET probably is good enough to keep using it.')
