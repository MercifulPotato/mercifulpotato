After 25 app updates you could own a brand new Mac Mini (assuming you never need to spend an extra day testing). Buying a used Mac makes even more sense.<p>MacStadium also already rents out Mac Minis starting at $59&#x2F;mo.<p>I think the Amazon offering only makes sense for big corporations where (1) IT doesn&#x27;t want to support macOS&#x2F;exotic hardware on their network (2) it&#x27;s easier to just charge to your your existing AWS billing than get a hardware purchase approved by your boss')
