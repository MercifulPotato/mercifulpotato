And also just about any product, or service, in any industry?<p>As counterexamples: Apple sell Logic, yet it has numerous competitors, also all fairly successful: ProTools, Live, Cubase, Reaper, Ardour, FruityLoops. Apple give their customers Notes,  Reminders and Mail <i>for free</i>, on all their devices (i.e. you don&#x27;t even need to get hold of apps for these functions), and yet we also have Evernote, Notion, Airmail, Spark etc etc.<p>Does the App Store monopoly significantly change the nature of app competition? I&#x27;m not convinced, but I&#x27;m open to learning about it.')
