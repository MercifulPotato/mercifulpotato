It wasnt difficult - it only took me a weekend, and that included the time spent learning perl (it was my first go). It was even operating at the wrong layer - using UDP control messages to schedule IP traffic. Regardless of all it&#x27;s limitations, it worked, so I got the other WAFreenet members involved with testing and development.”')
