No you can&#x27;t publish it elsewhere.<p>This is not logical implication at all.<p>&gt; In my view Glenn has integrity. That means something. I don&#x27;t doubt he would have written a similar story if the facts related to any powerful politician. Trump, McConnell, Pelosi, anyone. Do you?<p>I think that in fact he selects who he writes about a lot. He is not trying to be all sides equal objective. He also ignores evidence he dont like and uncritically believe people when it suits him.<p>In fact, it is part of his journalism philosophy. He calls journalistic objectivity myth, not something to strive for. (His arguments actually convicted me too. Altrought I dont trust him anymore, this one did stayed with me.).')
