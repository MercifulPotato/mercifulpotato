There certainly exist well-validated personality inventories that reflect the scientific consensus that personality can be represented within the Big Five or similar HEXACO frameworks, but they bear no resemblance to Myers Briggs.<p>That&#x27;s not entirely true, since two of the Meyers-Briggs axis are strongly correlated with Big Five axes; so something that maps well to Big Five will likely bear a resemblance to about half of MBTI.')
