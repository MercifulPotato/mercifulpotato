Maybe I just didn&#x27;t believe hard enough. But it stands to reason that thoughts of the afterlife do not do much: religious people do not seem, in the main, to have significantly less fear or avoidance of death. The drive to live would be pretty anemic if a mere mental trick could defuse it.<p>Personally, now that I&#x27;m secular, I still fear death. But at least I understand that that fear only exists because of my built in neurobiological values, which are there because they helped my ancestors reproduce. That doesn&#x27;t really change things much either, but at least it&#x27;s a true explanation. Before there was always a cognitive dissonance: if things are going to be way way better after we die, why do we try so hard to avoid death?')
