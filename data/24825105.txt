They are the exception though, and they&#x27;re always the cheapest things.<p>The smallest Lack coffee table (€10 or so) is assembled with double-ended screws from the legs into the tabletop.  There&#x27;s no way it can take any sideways stress, e.g. by someone leaning or standing on it.  A child falling onto the table can break it.<p>The larger Lack coffee table has the same legs, but adds a thin shelf for additional structure.  If the shelf is loaded with a few books, it bows after a while. (I have this table.)<p>There are similar problems with the €10 metal furniture.')
