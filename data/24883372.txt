By the time I became an instructor, my longest dive on a single tank was close to 1.5 hours and I had plenty of air left.<p>It would be pointless for me to try and teach breathing control techniques I was using by the time I became an instructor to an Open Water Diver student who will be lucky enough to remove and replace his regulator to pass the course.<p>We teach not holding your breath because most inexperienced divers will default to panicked fight or flight the second anything goes wrong.<p>Believe me, I’ve had to physically restrain students underwater when the reg fell out of their mouth and it took them more than 2 seconds to find it. They immediately want to shoot to the surface and 100% they’ll be holding their breath (another aspect of panic) if I don’t hold them down, put the reg back in their mouth, and calm them down.')
