Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t buy any (or even check out from the library) 95% of the books it listed for me, but I think that means it is working correctly. I guess one issue is that it I really like non-fiction, so I get mostly fiction or personal memoirs -- it&#x27;s a genre thing that has nothing to do with viewpoint.')
