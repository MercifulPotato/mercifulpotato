Any problems involving human beings are theoretically &quot;reducible&quot; to physics problems, and therefore only physics matters -- even if we don&#x27;t actually know how to perform that reduction.<p>Questions of how human beings organize and treat each other are immensely complex, and of enormous importance. They&#x27;re incredibly hard to study, and what study we can do is only in its infancy. But it&#x27;s equally infantile to declare that it&#x27;s irrelevant. And oddly, for people who pride themselves on their intellectual prowess, those who do tend to make it on the basis of a cursory &quot;study&quot; rather than serious engagement.')
