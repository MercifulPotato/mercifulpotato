It is unquestionably more dangerous to drive past a school at 8:30am on a weekday at 30mph than it is to drive in that same area at 2am on a Monday morning at 35mph.<p>If we&#x27;re talking about safety, then the speed limits should be to reflect conditions, but instead what happens is we cap the limit at the lowest value considering worst conditions.<p>Realistically the way we deal with this is through selective enforcement, the police probably aren&#x27;t going to give you a ticket for 35 in a 30 at 2am on a monday morning, but it&#x27;s silly to pretend that conditions don&#x27;t matter.')
