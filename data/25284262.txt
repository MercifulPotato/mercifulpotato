The plane is perfectly stable without MCAS, but would have had different handling characteristics than the previous version. The purpose of MCAS was to modify the handling to match the previous plane, so pilots&#x27; type ratings would carry over with minimal retraining.\nAt its heart, it was a (poorly implemented) kludge in an attempt to sidestep a lot of paperwork.')
