I ended up in management where I wrote some pretty impactful VBA to build powerpoint decks out of excel sheets. During this time I also did some of Freecodecamp.org in the evenings.<p>Then the stars sort of aligned and I got a job 50&#x2F;50 between client management and coding.<p>Right now I&#x27;m doing CS50 to plug the gaps in my knowledge and really really loving coding. I plan to finish FreeCodeCamp afterwards!')
