It was wonderful, grab your messages and read off-line.<p>Then came email which was much the same, most people used POP and later IMAP. Now we have facebooks and reddits (or Lemmy).<p>How could&#x2F;would you pull the messages and read offline if you wanted? How would you search your archive of posts for that thing you said two years ago and want to copy&#x2F;paste?<p>This is why I still participate in mail lists, all things I said are in a mailbox archive that I read with mutt, it is so responsive and easy to search. Plus, when the online mail list archive dies (as it has in the past), I have this mbox.gz that I can push somewhere else and the new host has an immediate archive.<p>Message boards provide an online interface so people can get posting right away, but there are some technical lists out there that are still heavily used. Most people have email accounts, so I don&#x27;t see why they&#x27;re not used more frequently, maybe most online webmail things suck, for me, mutt creates a better experience than reddit or fecebook. I miss bluewave a bit though.')
