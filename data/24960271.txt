Oddly enough I got pretty good at using Word Perfect and was given free training for more features and stuff by one of the top temp agencies at the time, and then I got to work the &quot;lobster&quot; shift at lawfirms and banks.<p>Word Perfect for DOS has a <i>ton</i> of features that folks normally wouldn&#x27;t know about like redlining and all kinds of fancy image rendering things (sorry it was &gt; 25 years ago and I can&#x27;t recollect specifics), law firms had an entire version-control system integrated with it.<p>Word Perfect was also how I ended up being an actual programmer for money in NYC.   I started automating my work at some of these firms with macros and later with some C and Perl code and some of the gigs I had I could just walk in and spend all day on IRC while I&#x27;d get paid $20 an hour (which was a lot) for my scripts to run through all the docs they thought I was re-formatting by hand.')
