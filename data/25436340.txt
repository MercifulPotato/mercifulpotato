Item(by='formerly_proven', descendants=None, kids=[25436634], score=None, time=1608072391, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25434865, text='&gt; I use RAW files and full manual because I have an actual workflow where I shoot a bunch of photos in similar setting and want to be able to create Lightroom preset and apply to all photos shot with same place, lighting and exposure.<p>This is basically a scene-referred workflow, but without any standardization (like ACES). Because all the files conform to the same transfer function, you can grade (&quot;create a LR preset&quot;, which is just like grading just worse UX) once to create a look and then apply that look to all footage (&quot;photographies&quot;) at once to get a very consistent look. I&#x27;ve said it before, I&#x27;ll say it again, the movie industry has this figured out, they got standards (ACES) and tooling for this. (And, movie tools are far, far superior to any photo tool I&#x27;ve seen yet when it comes to color. All the photo editing tools seem to be stuck in some kind of moronic hellhole were half of them get disqualified from the start for being destructive editors and the other half has bad UX and is basically limited to an operational vocabulary straight from a darkroom).<p>Apart from stuff like this there are some scenarios in which RAW might still result in a better overall IQ but the JPEG engines in cameras are really, <i>really</i> good and for practically any scene they&#x27;re fine, and even for most very high contrast scenes (like shadow + oncoming sun) they&#x27;ll still produce fine images.')
