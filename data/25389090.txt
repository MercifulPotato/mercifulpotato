The skills are simply not transferrable -- the things that make you good at chess don&#x27;t make you good at thinking generically.<p>From the man himself:<p>&quot;I’m not saying that I am totally stupid. But my success mainly has to do with the fact that I had the opportunity to learn more, more quickly. It has become easier to get hold of information. The players from the Soviet Union used to be at a huge advantage; in Moscow they had access to vast archives, with countless games carefully recorded on index cards. Nowadays anyone can buy this data on DVD for 150 euros; one disk holds 4.5 million games. There are also more books than there used to be. And then of course I started working with a computer earlier than Vladimir Kramnik or Viswanathan Anand.&quot;<p>Another quote from that same interview:<p>&quot;Carlsen: I’m not a genius.&quot;<p>Some sources:<p><pre><code>    https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chess.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;view&#x2F;-misconceptions-about-chess-players\n    https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;does-chess-make-you-smarter-1479403551\n    https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.acsh.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2017&#x2F;05&#x2F;31&#x2F;do-chess-players-have-higher-iqs-11366\n    https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.chessbase.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;magnus-carlsen-on-his-che-career\n    https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chess.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;RoaringPawn&#x2F;magnus-carlsen-a-genius-or-automaton\n    https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gardinerchess.com.au&#x2F;fm-stojic-is-magnus-carlsen-a-genius&#x2F;</code></pre>')
