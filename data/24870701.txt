I don&#x27;t consider being Christian to be an identity; I consider it to be simply an indication of not being a good student, i.e. that they completely failed to understand the education they received in the 20th or 21st-century classrooms that they were lucky to have occupied. Christianity, and any religion, amounts to encouraging people to not understand the world. That is a stupid intellectual choice, not an immutable identity.<p>&gt; Jordan Peterson crank<p>What makes you think that I think poorly of Jordan Peterson? This is a website where software engineers -- i.e. rational, logical people -- discuss things. You are completely failing to see beyond the confines of your bubble of modern progressive dogma if you think you can just assume that people think poorly of someone like Peterson. I guess you can say stuff like that around your friends and no-one would ever question it. He appears to be someone doing his best to speak out strongly against various highly problematic aspects of modern culture, in particular the way that anti-intellectual attitudes -- the practice of writing literal nonsense and publishing it in so-called academic journals! -- have become de rigeur in many areas of the humanities (and yes, I have experience of that). Why on Earth would I have a problem with him?<p>I think what I&#x27;m trying to say, is that you are massively underestimating how profoundly fractured the left is. Yes of course Trump is terrible. But there is a very large body of educated people on the left who cannot accept that the left be replaced with the anti-intellectualism and intolerance of the identity politics movement. You don&#x27;t seem to agree that these people exist and that they might have any sort of valid point at all.')
