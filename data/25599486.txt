The consistency of ZFC is a very useful theorem.<p>There are also very easy to understand number-theoretic and combinatorial results, like the Paris-Harrington Theorem [1]  and Goodstein&#x27;s Theorem [2] which are provably independent of Peano Arithmetic.<p>The latter has an interpretation as a &quot;hydra&quot; game: there is a rooted tree (hydra), and you can cut off a number of heads in one shot. The hydra grows back a finite number of heads according to a specified rule. The question is, is there a strategy to slay the hydra?<p>The surprising answer is that any strategy will work(!), but you cannot prove this fact inside Peano arithmetic.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paris%E2%80%93Harrington_theorem" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paris%E2%80%93Harrington_theor...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Goodstein%27s_theorem" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Goodstein%27s_theorem</a>')
