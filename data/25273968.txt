The question is related to all geo distributed strong consistent storages, but let me pick Google Spanner as example.<p>Spanner has a maximum upper bound of 7 milliseconds clock offset between nodes, thx to TrueTime. To achieve external consistency, Spanner simply waits 7 ms before committing a transaction. After that amount of time the window of uncertainty is over and we can be sure, that every transaction happens to be in the right order. So far so good, but how does Spanner deal with cross data center network latency? Let&#x27;s say I commit a transaction to Spanner in Canada and after 7 ms, I get my confirmation, but now in Australia someone also does a conflicting transaction and also get his confirmation after 7 ms. Spanner however, bound to the laws of physics, can only see this conflict after 100+ ms delay, due to network latency between the datacenters. How is that problem solved?')
