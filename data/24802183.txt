The network effect creates an enormous advantage for incumbents.<p>&gt; It is technically quite trivial to clone the basic functionality of Twitter and run a competing service. This has been done semi-sucessfully with Gab (not endorsing that community, but it is a good example), for example. People choose social media services based on their perceived value, social prestige, etc.<p>It is quite simple to create software that mimics Twitter, sure.  It is very, very hard to create a platform like Twitter.  That further reinforces it as a natural monopoly to me.  You can even look at how the companies rise and fall; typically if the incumbent fails, they do so entirely, and the new competitor eats all of their lunch (i.e. MySpace and Facebook, Digg&#x2F;Slashdot&#x2F;Reddit, etc).  There are very rarely situations where a new competitor comes and splits the market share; they either take it all, or they get none.<p>&gt; There&#x27;s no equivalent to &quot;I have to use Twitter because they own the lines to the house&#x2F;they have the only 5G coverage in my area&#x2F;they are the only company licensed by my city.&quot;<p>There absolutely is.  &quot;I have to use Twitter because that&#x27;s where everyone I want to talk to is, and they don&#x27;t allow any interoperation with other social networks.&quot;  It&#x27;s fundamentally the same thing, and treating them like a utility would involve forcing them to treat their platform like utility poles.  They can charge a fee to the other companies that interoperate to recoup their costs and get some profit, but they have to allow the interoperation.')
