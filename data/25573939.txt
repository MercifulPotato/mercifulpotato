I got hearing aids two months ago. Best decision I&#x27;ve made in my life! Now I can hear birds and I don&#x27;t get tired when speaking with people.<p>Maybe you need to lower the gain? That will make it easier to wear them full-time. Now my brain have adjusted to the new sound and tbh I don&#x27;t think I can live without hearing aids now.<p>I have Oticon Ruby with open domes.')
