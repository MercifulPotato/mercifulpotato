Item(by='toast0', descendants=None, kids=[25698333], score=None, time=1610175645, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25698099, text='&gt; If you said &quot;Section 230 is a massive gift to big tech!&quot; &gt; Once again, I must inform you that you are very, very wrong.<p>&gt;If section 230 is no big deal, let&#x27;s just repeal it. What&#x27;s the hoopla about it, then? Why are companies so adamant to protect it?<p>It&#x27;s not a massive gift to big tech. It&#x27;s a gift to everyone. It&#x27;s a big deal to remove it. Certainly, it would affect lots of big tech companies; but it would affect lots of small sites too. Case law from before section 230 is pretty clear: either moderate perfectly, or only moderate to the minimums required to avoid criminal liability. I wouldn&#x27;t participate in very many discussion forums without best effort moderation; either it would be a cesspool or sterile.<p>Section 230 allows sites to do whatever level of moderation they want. It makes no requirements of consistency or reason, whatever you do as a moderator is fine. The users who post are responsible for their conduct.<p>Certainly, there&#x27;s a lot of moderation going on these days. And there&#x27;s a real question of if there is a public square left; but section 230 wasn&#x27;t about having a public square, it was about letting people run their squares however they like.')
