Item(by='cxr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609344696, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25580426, text='Despite your pronouncements to the contrary, a comment appearing to say &quot;this is incorrect&quot; is absolutely more &quot;help&quot; to someone who&#x27;s reading along and doesn&#x27;t know anything than if the original false claim were instead to appear naked and unopposed.<p>There is no imperative—moral, logical, or otherwise—that I or anyone else spend energy to substantiate the debunking of a claim for which there has been no attempt to substantiate the original itself—even if you want to use a bullshit accounting method which frames it as a de novo claim that the first claim is incorrect.  To insist that there is, especially when the energy required to debunk is much greater than the energy spent spitting out the original one sentence nugget of misinformation, is to deliver a set of conditions where Gish gallops are even more effective than they already are.  (And that&#x27;s before we get around to pointing out that you&#x27;re not even following the rules that you&#x27;re vigorously arguing are in play; we can let this be one of your exercises for the reader: swap in the word &quot;claim&quot; in place of my use of the word &quot;insist&quot; in the preceding sentence, and then pay attention to the ramifications it has for any of the comments you&#x27;ve written here, esp. wrt the &quot;way to hold a discussion on a public forum&quot;.)<p>In fact, on the topic of outsized expenditures of attention and energy sinks, think about the role you&#x27;re playing in this even now.  (Although, perhaps that was the point—and not an attempt to excite oneself with a pastime that only <i>incidentally</i> happens be tedious in the way it makes contact with others&#x27; lives.)  This will be my last comment in this thread.')
