I&#x27;m so torn on Apple - on the one hand their ecosystem is the most complete and works the best, but on the other hand they try to take a cut from every revenue stream on their platforms, keep a walled garden and often lock out things that are useful to me.<p>For example iPad pro is an amazing tablet - hardware wise - I would use it as a on the go dev machine - but iOS is so pointlessly locked down I couldn&#x27;t use it for anything non-trivial. Compare that to an Android device where I can get Linux userland running or Windows tablets. But then Apple couldn&#x27;t monetise all my apps on the device.<p>Samsung is the closest you can get to Apple ecosystem but they suck badly - their hardware is acceptable but software is nowhere near close - apps are bad, bixby is horrible, tizen OS is missing basic stuff.<p>Microsoft could be a player here but they just started experimenting with mobile after a long time, they have no wearable, and the surface line seems promising but always has that one or two flaws that makes it unsatisfying. I&#x27;m hoping they can create something in the future, I have no expectations from Samsung - they seem both incompetent and insistent on doing their own thing when it comes to software.')
