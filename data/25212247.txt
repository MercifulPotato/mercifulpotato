They weaponise terms like &#x27;sexism&#x27; in inappropriate scenarios to manipulate others. Businesses pretend to be woke so they can make money, and those are definitely not run by leftists.<p>The idea that the fringe group of marxists on twitter are dominating the world&#x27;s discourse needs to stop. It is primarily your average every day liberal that doesn&#x27;t understand essentialism or true social justice.')
