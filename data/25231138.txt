Israel probably sees this as an opening to take out core operatives without reprisal and a low chance of escalation. Iran will probably do what it has always has done, continue their nuke and ballistics program, and attempt to destabilize unfriendly regimes. They don&#x27;t really have an awesome military tract record outside of guerrilla tactics nor the capacity for a prolonged large scale conflict against a technically superior advisory.
