We have decided some facts deserve specific protections, at least in the US.  So I don&#x27;t think we can dismiss the players here with &quot;facts are not copyrightable&quot; without knowing what specific statistics are being recorded and to which the players reject. Sports technology has exploded over recent years and the data collection of athletes is now an industry of its own.  There can be a range in the degree of ownership that a player deserves from the total number of goals scored in public matches to the heartrate of a player throughout a private practice session.')
