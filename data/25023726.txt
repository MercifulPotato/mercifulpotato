It would sell the Photoshop &quot;menu of filters&quot;, the &quot;selector toolbox&quot;, the &quot;color histogram view&quot; and such. But the workspace where you see the image and apply the selectors or filters would be outside Photoshop itself. It would be a standard part of the system, where the image could come from and go into another organizing system (possibly provided by another vendor). You could mix organizing systems, sharing&#x2F;versioning systems and filters&#x2F;selectors&#x2F;menus&#x2F;views from various vendors, commercial or free or open source.<p>This would apply not just to images, but to all kinds of media - movies, documents, including &quot;code&quot;.')
