Colour correction control is amazing. Actually is the best software for photography, the only setback is €349.00 price. :) But LR is €144 per year, so..\nMy workflow is Fast Raw Viewer for organising and metadata, RAWTherapee for raw processing and Affinity Photo for final touches. Total cost: FRW - 20EUR &#x2F; RAWTherapee - free&#x2F; Affinity Photo - 50EUR - Total: 70 EUR and no strings attached:)')
