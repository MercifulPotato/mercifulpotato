At that point, you have a few distinct options:<p>1. Build an AST on top of YAML a la CloudFormation. Now you&#x27;re programming in YAML, hurray!<p>2. Extend your static language with executable features a la Terraform&#x2F;HCL, basically reinventing (and very badly, at that) more traditional language features<p>3. Use text templates, a la Helm--now you can generate syntactically invalid configuration! (and absolutely <i>trivially</i>, at that)<p>4. Use an expression language (familiar, ergonomics) a la Pulumi, Starlark, Nix, Nickel, Dhall, etc<p>Note that in these conversations, someone inevitably shouts &quot;use the simplest tool for the job!&quot; ignoring that static configuration languages (and options 1-3 above) are strictly more complex for the reusability use cases outlined above.<p>EDIT: Pulumi isn&#x27;t an expression language; rather, it lets you use real languages to generate configuration, and these languages often include powerful expression features. AWS&#x27;s CDK is also in this category.')
