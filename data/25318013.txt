The DHT style of p2p sharing pretty much only works for popular content. Incentivized storage networks can onboard any type of data and guarantee high uptime.<p>It&#x27;s also been my experience that IPFS has significant performance issues. If you use a professional gateway like ipfs.io or cloudflare it runs at good speeds but as soon as you switch to being fully peer-to-peer it&#x27;s almost unusable.<p>I don&#x27;t have much experience with DAT, it may not have the same performance issues.<p>disclaimer: I work on an incentivized storage network called Skynet')
