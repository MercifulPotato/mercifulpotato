Failing to do so tbh means that person probably failed to comply with coding standards or whatever else is in there. It&#x27;s just as likely to have the PR closed for those reasons as for the reason &quot;No PR&#x27;s please&quot;.<p>That said, I agree with the idea of simply removing the possibility to make external PR&#x27;s. The possibility to view (internal) PR&#x27;s must be there though, so that external viewers can see PRs from the mainainer(s).')
