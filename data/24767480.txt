They all can share memory efficiently between units of concurrency; this just seems like another example of you claiming your own limited knowledge as being truth.<p>In terms of building real world systems - oh, but I have. Over a decade of building distributed systems, across 5 different companies. In domains that cared about correctness. You have a data point; a weak one. &quot;This worked for me&quot;. Which I&#x27;m not arguing against (well, I&#x27;m nuancing it a bit; it worked sufficiently well to not cause business issue, which is a different metric than system correctness, but somewhat immaterial).<p>What I&#x27;m arguing against is your claim that &quot;This will work for everyone&quot; and &quot;everything else is too complicated&quot;.<p>Which you&#x27;ve been unable to refute. In fact, you&#x27;ve been unable to even provide evidence for your own position (beyond the aforementioned &quot;it worked for me&quot;), let alone the counter claim.')
