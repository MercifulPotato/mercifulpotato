Can&#x27;t comment on it. But, there is nothing wrong in trying for an alternate implementation. We&#x27;re using Kinesis and it is a good fit in our stack with lot less overhead. They did bring Kakfa (Amazon MSK) later to the AWS service list. Its upto the consumer to pick Kinesis or MSK.<p>One example which was influential in nature - Dyanmodb. The Dyanmodb paper inspired a number of NoSQL databases, including Apache Cassandra. If they have went with the popular NoSQL database at that time, we might have missed some good contribution.')
