Item(by='wahern', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608608861, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25502237, text='Note that the operative term here is &quot;modern&quot;, which makes modern slavery a far more expansive phrase than chattel slavery as practiced in the Americas. Only a fraction of these 27 million &quot;slaves&quot; could be fairly characterized as chattel slaves.[1] Most of them are seasonal workers who end up laboring under extreme conditions due to extreme poverty, in turn often a consequence of domestic or regional ethnic group dynamics.<p>I find it problematic to compare their experience to that of chattel slavery. It&#x27;s an injustice to those who experienced chattel slavery, as well as an injustice to the experience of these so-called modern slaves today. There&#x27;s nothing constructive that can be gained by such equivocations. If the modern reality isn&#x27;t abhorrent enough (and I wouldn&#x27;t even try to compare degrees of abhorrence), I don&#x27;t see how it will move people to do anything but pontificate. Without any substantive relationships, the history of the former cannot be used to address the latter--which is actually a diverse array of situations. And if the history of &quot;white slavery&quot; is at all instructive, I can easily see people using such equivocations in a manner that further harms the abused and exploited.[2]<p>[1] See J. O.
