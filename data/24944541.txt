Item(by='typest', descendants=None, kids=[24944808], score=None, time=1604078384, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24944186, text='Most surprising consequence is probably that IRV is unlikely to break 2 party dominance, even though it this is an often claimed advantage of IRV.<p>The frequently imagined scenario with IRV is that, in a two party system where most people will rank 1 of 2 parties first, then a small percent of voters can safely rank a third party first. This party is then eliminated, but not before a surprisingly strong showing (e.g. 5% first rather than the .05% we currently have). This would likely happen.<p>The problem arises in the next election, when the third party is now strong enough to command a large percent of first place votes. Since the party with the least first place votes is eliminated (even if they have a ton of second place votes), the third party now stands a real risk of cannibalizing votes from the next most similar &quot;mainstream&quot; party. If this cannibalization were to occur, both parties could lose to the other mainstream party that many voters might not have preferred! Due to this risk, it&#x27;s likely voters would strategically rank the third party below the mainstream party even if that wasn&#x27;t their true preference. In this way, IRV can still lead to 2 party dominance.')
