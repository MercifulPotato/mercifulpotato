Within those groups, I don&#x27;t really conceptualize any difference. Two clarifications: (1) this is talking about a single person, not a group, and (2) it&#x27;s really more based on behavior than age; my grandma is in her eighties, but is so mentally sharp that I think of her in (the top end of) the 40-65 group.')
