They&#x27;re aimed at office users, casual home users, students, and a large subset of programmers who <i>don&#x27;t</i> need to run 50 VMs. They&#x27;re <i>not</i> aimed at gamers, engineers, (some subset of) programmers, and technicians.<p>For those 4 groups, most ultrabooks suffer from:<p>1. Being underpowered (for gamers  and some engineers this means graphically, for programmers memory&#x2F;cpu count&#x2F;cpu speed)<p>2. Insufficient ports (particularly for engineers, technicians, and some programmers and gamers)<p>3. Insufficiently sturdy (technicians, some engineers and programmers)<p>But often they <i>do</i> have good battery life, but by virtue of being underpowered that doesn&#x27;t really help in the balance.<p>Companies that do make laptops (IME) aimed at gamers, tend to not make laptops that have decent battery life (that is, most desktop replacement laptops get good performance, but terrible battery life). And laptops aimed at engineers and technicians tend to be 3&quot; thick, have terrible battery life, and have grossly underpowered processors and graphics, but they have every port you could ever want.')
