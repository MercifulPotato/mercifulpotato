Simply being &quot;fast enough&quot; may be fine if you have a smarter model, exploit niche opportunities overlooked by others, or are willing to shoulder certain risks that other HFTs are trying to offload.<p>To take this to the extreme, look at Renaissance&#x27;s Medallion fund. It&#x27;s certainly the case that much of what they&#x27;re doing is &quot;HFT-ish&quot; in the sense that they&#x27;re executing high turnover, high Sharpe strategies with short holding periods. Yet they&#x27;ve managed to continue to be successful from the 90s well until the age of HFT, without competing very hard on latency at all.<p>Markets are an ecosystem, and like biological ecosystems there isn&#x27;t just one trait that predicts dominance.')
