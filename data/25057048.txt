I have however designed and built data architecture for various forecasting software. &quot;all data you perform analytics on is time series data&quot; (from the article) rings so true with me.<p>However you need to consider that in this sense, it&#x27;s about what is happening at any given moment in time. In your case, the forecasts are created at a point in time, and that &quot;should&quot; be their index speaking purely from a time-is-the-ultimate-index perspective.<p>Just some random questions that might help you answer your own questions:\n1. Are there multiple forecasts made at the same time, for the same period in the future, but by different systems &#x2F; algorithms &#x2F; hyperparameters? Would you not want to keep multiple, and in that regard, what would be the &quot;latest&quot; forecast?\n2. If your latest forecast is necessarily the most accurate, why would you need to keep previous versions in the same database?<p>None of this might be relevant to you, and maybe you&#x27;ll only get the benefits of InfluxDB by using the forecast time as the index. But I thought I&#x27;d give you my thoughts just in case it helps you.')
