So the only way you could get to “if it has unanimity among the public, it has only a 30% chance of passing” based on anything even approximating empirical science is to take some observations about success at various less than unanimous levels, and develop a model of the relationship between public support and chance of passage, and use that model to extrapolate beyond the high endpoint of support from the data. Without a strong theoretical rationale which you have good reason other than the observed relationship within the tested range to believe is the explanation for the tested phenomenon, it is always suspect to extrapolate an empirical relationship outside of the range in which it has been observed.<p>&gt; Similar information can be found here: \n&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;represent.us&#x2F;action&#x2F;no-the-problem&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;represent.us&#x2F;action&#x2F;no-the-problem&#x2F;</a>.<p>The study linked to support that is interesting, but since it models the effect of interest groups, including mass interest groups, separately from both public and elite individual preferences, and finds that both elite preferences and interest group alignment have significant independent impacts, but average citizen preferences don&#x27;t have a strong <i>separate</i> effect, what it really indicates is that average citizens are effective in politics only to the extent that their preferences energize action through organized groups.')
