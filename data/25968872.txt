No one trusts that the Russians have done proper trials or that the reported data is accurate and no outside party has a means to verify their claims. Time will tell - I very much hope it works, but wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it didn&#x27;t.<p>France allowed the Pasteur institute to fail - a much desired vaccine was stopped because it wasn&#x27;t effective enough. Impossible to imagine the same happening in Russia, as Putin needs to project power.')
