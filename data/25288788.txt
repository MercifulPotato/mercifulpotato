There really is no comparison aside from Android having some [random esoteric] hardware that iPhone doesn&#x27;t for a particular year. None of this is focused on battery life, performance, and efficiency. It is window dressing on top of an inferior architecture.<p>Also I fundamentally will not buy a piece of hardware that will cease receiving security updates within 36 months of purchase. That&#x27;s insane, and frankly a major fuck you to anyone considering buying your product.')
