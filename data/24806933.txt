It was replaced by VMR (Video Mixing Renderer) which allows video to be rendered to each parent windows&#x27; offscreen DWM buffer.<p>The funny thing is that overlays are coming back (soon, I hope!) - not for performance reasons, but because using a compositing window manager like the DWM introduces an additional frame of latency, but if a foreground window is being displayed 1:1 on the desktop then the GPU can simply overlay it directly to the output signal and thus eliminate that frame of latency. Some Linux WMs support it already, and Microsoft said they&#x27;re working on it.')
