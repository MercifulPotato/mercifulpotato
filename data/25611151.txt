I&#x27;m sure with enough practice I&#x27;d get it, but there were many things that I just couldn&#x27;t replicate one to one in Rust.  Not that they weren&#x27;t possible, but they were just different enough that I couldn&#x27;t figure it out without being more comfortable in understanding the language, and I just haven&#x27;t dedicated the time needed to it.<p>Will likely go back to it at some point, as it is an interesting approach to programming, with lots of upsides.')
