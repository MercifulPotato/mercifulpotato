Are you?<p>Pretty much everyone was racist 120 years ago.  Less, even, but, still 120 years ago is a safe buffer.  I don&#x27;t think building monuments to people who ordered the massacre of natives in the name of manifest destiny is a great idea, just as I don&#x27;t think having monuments to Nathan Bedford Forrest is a great idea, either.<p>America&#x27;s fetishization of its dead rulers is really second only to ancient Rome, a culture where they literally proclaimed their dead rulers to be gods. Lincoln, Washington, and Cervantes were racist, because the times they lived in were racist.  We can do better, and uncritical reverence doesn&#x27;t help us do that.')
