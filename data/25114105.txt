Apple is to blame and should repair it for free, etc. But now I&#x27;m just curious as to &#x27;how&#x27; this would work. Is there some sort of EEPROM, flash or controller on that board that gets loaded with new settings or firmware? I know Big Sur does some UEFI upgrades, but would that extend to the I&#x2F;O board? Or is that a separate payload? Or perhaps the update is only for the SMC or Intel firmware which crashes with certain I&#x2F;O boards during init and then once init is complete it can cope with any I&#x2F;O board next boot?')
