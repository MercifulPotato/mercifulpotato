But making your language semantics say that that has to be allowed everywhere a valid instance could be passed is a mistake; for most functions it&#x27;s an error to call that function without passing valid argument values, so it&#x27;s better if the language has a way of enforcing that rather than forcing you to write it out by hand every time.')
