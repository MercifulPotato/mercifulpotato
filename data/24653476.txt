Item(by='nicoburns', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601572193, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24652854, text='&gt; the only way to prove that you have the ability is to look at past accomplishments<p>I&#x27;d argue that past accomplishments don&#x27;t prove anything either. Or rather, it&#x27;s impossible to tell whether they were actually responsible for those accomplishments. It&#x27;s not just architecture you want to ask about. It&#x27;s the practicalities of choosing libraries, making engineering trade-offs, running a team (if that&#x27;s part of the job they&#x27;re applying for). The trick is to ask them questions that they&#x27;d only know the answer to if they&#x27;ve actually been there and done that (&quot;What want wrong&quot; and &quot;what problems did you face&quot; are good ones). And to follow up with asking them <i>why</i> they&#x27;d make that choice.')
