If it isn’t the current month (+-1 based on context), I can instead specify that I meant the 14th of September and you will understand that I mean the 14th of September this current year (again +-1 by context). If I meant the 14th of September, 1987, I will say the whole date. But since most date-based conversations have an implied context, being able to simply truncate dates for brevity is useful.<p>ISO 8601 is big-endian, European style is little-endian, and US-style is just kind of pointless.')
