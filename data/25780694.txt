We don&#x27;t get residential mail delivery, closest grocery is about 15 miles away, closest gas station abut 6 miles away. Our town is a little over 300 people, with no police, the fire department is volunteer, and if we had to call 911 for a medical emergency an ambulance is probably 15-20 minutes away. All of those sacrifices just to be able to afford a half acre.<p>The appraiser refused to agree to the listing price, so we had to scramble and get cash gifts from family after we&#x27;d already made an offer. Two offers before us fell through and we were in a 24-hour bid war with another potential buyer.<p>I make 36k a year and my wife is a public school teacher, we consider ourselves to be doing very good compared to many we know and this is the best we can do.<p>Here is a little less than 20 acres within a half hour of me, just land, no buildings. It is 6.91x my gross annual income. Just about no one makes land loans so I&#x27;d need to have 249,000 USD as cold hard cash just for the land, then need another 50-125k to build a house. Then I&#x27;d have to drill a well, then install septic, then get it changed from light-industrial to residential. All in I&#x27;d need 350-450k dollars to make it work.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realtor.com&#x2F;realestateandhomes-detail&#x2F;7700-N-County-Road-150-E_Pittsboro_IN_46167_M90772-19917" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realtor.com&#x2F;realestateandhomes-detail&#x2F;7700-N-Cou...</a><p>Similarly close is this one <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realtor.com&#x2F;realestateandhomes-detail&#x2F;959-E-County-Road-825-N_Bainbridge_IN_46105_M37686-37462" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realtor.com&#x2F;realestateandhomes-detail&#x2F;959-E-Coun...</a>  for 400k USD with 10 acres and, admittedly, an absurdly large house.<p>No one is going to give a guy making 36k a 400k loan, and there&#x27;s no realistic way I, at 35, can realistically save 350-450k cash to buy land and build a house before I&#x27;m too old to do a lot of the initial work the land would need for my purposes.<p>I&#x27;d love to know why I&#x27;m being downvoted too. Is it because I don&#x27;t earn as much as you so my opinion isn&#x27;t valid? Is it because I wish I lived in a world where I could afford 0.004132231% of the land that Bill Gates owns?')
