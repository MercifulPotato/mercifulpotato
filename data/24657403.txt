A better example might be removing every 5th word from a famous work, say one of shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets. Then run GPT3 on it to interpolate the missing words. I bet a reasonable fraction of would match the correct words. Some would be acceptable substitutions, maybe you lose some fidelity or wit from the original, but it doesn&#x27;t impact the overall enjoyment or understanding of the work. Then will be some minority of cases where we get something weird or wrong. Maybe a word that matches the general meaning, but is modern slang for example. Or maybe it guessed something that is plausible in context, but is opposite in meaning that changes something substantial in the work. I would expect that last scenario to be very rare as a fraction of total word substitutions, but also quite likely over the course of a whole piece of work. On the other hand, if we were able to render have a new undiscovered play available constructed  from some sort of damaged fragment, rather than my hypothetical test ... having something we could read or see performed rather than just analyze academically seems worth the chance of getting some (even important) nuance in the work wrong.')
