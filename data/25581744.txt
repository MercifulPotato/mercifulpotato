You could also say reducing unnecessary expenses and using that money to invest could be good too.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that there are many other things in life that truly compound. Pretty much any skill gets easier to do after you gain basic knowledge&#x2F;practice of it (your knowledge seems to compound), but eventually it starts to plateau as you reach your knowledge&#x2F;skill limit.<p>I guess you could view it from an overall process efficiency prospective and find the longest poll that could be reduced. Sleep is a huge one, but it&#x27;s also important. You might be able to reduce this one by getting higher quality sleep but for a slightly shorter duration (better sleep habits, the right mattress, etc). That time (30-60 mins maybe) could be spent on productive things, like a new hobby or devoting more time to exercise and health. Exercise and health could be another overall efficiency factor (hence the &#x27;compounding&#x27;) - extending your useful years by staying in shape potentially gives you more overall time to devote to other activities.')
