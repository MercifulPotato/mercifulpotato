There&#x27;s a pretty vast chasm between a non-technical consumer trying to set up rsync and a software developer adding a Trello &lt;-&gt; GitHub integration.<p>It does seem frivolous to me to pay money to automatically close tasks when a linked pull request is merged.<p>And paying $720 annually to host some frontends?
