The problem with Facebook and Twitter is that they provide a &quot;radicalization pipeline&quot; to get people into communities like that. And one of the big issues with the riot at the Capitol is that there was an interplay between what Trump&#x2F;Cruz&#x2F;Hawley&#x2F;others were saying on social media and what these radicalized groups were saying.
