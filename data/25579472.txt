You score 6 if you can - while awake - conjure clear, colorful images in your head on demand, that you can manipulate. Based on my reading on the topic and talking with my wife, it&#x27;s very close to arbitrary rendering in your field of vision.<p>With my score of 2, I also &quot;encode differently&quot;. I can sort-of work with imaginary visual data in my head, but it feels like - excuse the bad analogy - like looking into a debugger hooked up to a program that tries to render something. I am aware of an imaginary object, I can manipulate it symbolically. I can stack transformations in my head, like &quot;it&#x27;s rotated horizontally&quot;, &quot;and also on the other axis&quot;, and &quot;it&#x27;s red&quot;, but most of my manipulations happen at this symbolic layer. The rendering pipeline goes nowhere; if I focus, I can sometimes force an unclear image to appear briefly.')
