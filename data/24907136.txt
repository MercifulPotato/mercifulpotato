Rent at those places are extremely high, $3000+ for a 2 bed in heart of Brickell. If you move in lands away from touristy place it’s not that impressive. Home insurance is high because of hurricane &#x2F; flooding risks.<p>Like I said, not a good place if you want your money to go far. Plenty of things to like about it if you visit, like the food, the pretty scenery at popular places.')
