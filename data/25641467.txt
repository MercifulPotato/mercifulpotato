It&#x27;s one of not many books on spying like this (Wright was cleaning up the mess Venona revealed for years) actually written by an intelligence officer, in clear breach of the official secrets act, and even better he was an engineer too so there are lots of tales of him reverse engineering soviet bugs like &quot;The thing&quot; and tracking down spurious radio emissions to find spies.<p>His theory about Roger Hollis is probably lost to time although MI5&#x27;s complete failure to address it is probably a hint.')
