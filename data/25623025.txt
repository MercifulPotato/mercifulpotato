I want them to figure it out, and ask for help <i>if</i> they need it. For some reason, that’s not how most people work. A lot of them expect you to tell them <i>how</i>, but they will refuse to ask for help until too late.<p>When I was on the other side, the opposite was true too, I has bosses that expected me to do things <i>their way</i>, even if I could demonstrate that there were better.<p>So far my only weapon against this has been to be very selective while hiring.')
