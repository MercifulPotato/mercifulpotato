Item(by='zaarn', descendants=None, kids=[24799016], score=None, time=1602754516, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24786481, text='&gt;Of course, but truth wins out over the long run.<p>I doubt that, and if that was even the case, until then lies can do a lot of damage.<p>&gt;How do you stay above it all? It&#x27;s not censored now but you seem able to detect it and protect yourself.<p>I don&#x27;t. Sometimes I get fed bullshit and believe it. I&#x27;m certain there is things I believe right now that are lies. Sometimes I find out a more proper explanation, sometimes I never get any truth.<p>Getting behind what is lies and what not requires education, something the US for example has abandoned over time for the rich to enjoy.<p>&gt;That is censorship, I&#x27;m not sure how that supports an argument for more free speech? We have laws against assault already.<p>Censorship is enacted by government, not private individuals. Besides, they are smart enough to never call for violence directly. They say &quot;I wish someone would call SWAT on this guy&quot; or &quot;this kinda behaviour ends you with a broken nose <i>wink wink</i>&quot;.<p>&gt;How could they win? Defamation laws, at least in the US, value truth above other considerations.<p>In the US, a lawsuit isn&#x27;t about who is right but who has enough money to keep the lawsuit going for longer.<p>&gt;Again, I&#x27;m not sure what this has to do with a free speech argument?<p>Free speech is valuable in respectful and calm debate. Disrespectful and violent speech is not free speech, it&#x27;s violence.<p>&gt;Violence and disrespect really are completely different ball games, I don&#x27;t see how conflating them clarifies things<p>Reread, I don&#x27;t conflate them.<p>&gt;If you could find someone who can judge such things infallibly then perhaps I would agree.<p>It doesn&#x27;t have to be infallible, just reasonably provable or not disprovable. If you&#x27;re lying on purpose then this entire point is moot anyway, no need to prove anything. Then you&#x27;re just out for harm.')
