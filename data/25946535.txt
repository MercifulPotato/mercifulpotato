The exceptions were (in)famous.<p>It was decentralized, which has a lot of benefits compared to having fewer, huge platforms, but the control existed and was essential.<p>The &quot;don&#x27;t let platforms moderate anything but illegal content&quot; argument is extremely disingenous. That&#x27;s not how you get back to the &quot;good old days&quot; - or how you keep current smaller places like HN alive.<p>If there are problems created specifically by the big platforms being too big, <i>target their size specifically</i>. Regulating advertising and privacy and data tracking might be one way to start, reduce the incentive and rewards for being huge; but I think more likely, you&#x27;d want specific taxes, fees, or actions, based on userbase size.')
