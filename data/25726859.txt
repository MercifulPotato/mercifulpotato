Even for Nazi&#x27;s, it&#x27;s extended to mean white supremacists of all kinds and even white supremacy can mean different things depending on how far left you are. Imagine the reverse, a platform where the right bans &quot;socialists, antifa, and communists&quot; and you see the issues. If people were a lot less loose with their definitions it would be less of an issue.<p>Also its&#x27;s a little funny to see these platforms rise up that are censorship resistant...whose intended audience is the least likely to be censored for their ideas on the mainstream platforms. Part of the reason all these alt platforms get the Nazis is because of this...its like building an alternative for Reddit because it censors leftists.')
