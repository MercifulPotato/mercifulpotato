That may be, but HN does often hate humor. This is most often dependent upon the thread in question as the subject dictates the audience<p>1 some people are fully incapable of accepting sarcasm even when something is deliberately expressed using the word <i>sarcasm</i><p>2 some people are easily offended and deliberately search for hostility even where none was intended<p>3 for some people everything is a political holy war. I have noticed that many of these commenters seems to only participate on threads of extreme social commentary lacking any hint of technical or business concern, which could suggest selective participation in subjects lacking expertise. I have also noticed that some of the highest karma HN users skillfully bait such threads<p>I have also noticed humor is more likely to be positively accepted when it is clever enough to escape notice by people merely skimming and when avoiding subject matter solely limited to social commentary. In these cases the humor in question can even be vaguely insulting or insensitive and still receive a positive response unlike the contrary where you have to tip toe across egg shells.')
