You may have derailed my Sunday :)<p>A physics teacher would probably make for a great music teacher indeed. Understanding things from first principles is so powerful. Compressed knowledge. I always try to move towards that but it has eluded me so far when it comes to music. Granted, I haven&#x27;t put much effort in. I would totally buy that book of yours.<p>Or anything &quot;for programmers&quot; really :) Not that we&#x27;re especially dumb that we need our own custom teaching materials but I do think we are more qualified than most to identify systems, decompose them, and explain the relations between their parts.
