You can stay with your &quot;pod&quot; (or by yourself), you can prepare at least some of your meals yourself, and you just generally have a lot less contact than in the case of a hotel. I don&#x27;t even normally stay at AirBnBs and I just booked one after the holidays as a hiking base and change of scenery.<p>ADDED: That said, the fact that self-contained rural properties are pretty popular at the moment doesn&#x27;t mean that a business that depends on people traveling is necessarily doing great.')
