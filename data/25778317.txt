FAANG level income lets me live a fairly worry-free life in a nice neighborhood, including a nice 2-3 bedroom flat and a private school.  It&#x27;s a tremendous luxury, for which I&#x27;m greatly appreciative.<p>Many of my colleagues in Europe, make far less than 1&#x2F;2 of what I do from a compensation perspective.  However, they&#x27;re  able to live essentially the same lifestyle I am.  Nice flat in a vibrant, walkable, top-tier urban locale with the ability to afford most things in life.  They&#x27;re able to do so because they have less worry about surprise medical bills, paying to care for their elders, saving $200k for the kids&#x27; college, etc.  My employment is also at will.  I can leave or be forced to leave at a moment&#x27;s notice.<p>Obviously, I&#x27;m only offering anecdotes here, but (IMHO) once that lifestyle moves out of reach, then companies will be forced to increase pay.')
