What tiktok is collecting is not more than what Google or Facebook is collecting and that information is not more valuable to China. The Chinese government is less likely to harm you than your own government with that data.<p>Then why was it caught spying on clipboard data? Remember the shenanigans that ensued just before this controversy blew up?')
