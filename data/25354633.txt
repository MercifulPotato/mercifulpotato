If you bought low and sold high (control for inflation&#x2F;rates&#x2F;dividends&#x2F;whatever) your purchase pulled up the price when you bought and pushed down the price when you sold, and the &quot;time-traveller&#x27;s arbitrage&quot; was reduced.<p>Say a company will live for 1 year, pay no dividend and perform no buybacks, but has some stock price. Say -X(X-1), so it starts at price=0 at t=0, ends at price=0 at t=1, and has positive but illogical&#x2F;inefficient positive prices in between up to a maximum of p=0.25 at t=0.5.<p>Now, someone who bought then sold on the up-slope -- with price impact -- would make money but increase the difference between the price curve and &quot;true value&quot; (which is the equation p=0.) But if you iterated those buying and selling operations with time-travelling argitrageurs, the realised value would eventually be the true value. The price curve would be p=0.<p>So, in conclusion, maybe &quot;all investing is value investing&quot; is false under this interpretation, but true if there are time travellers involved. (There is almost certainly a more charitable phrasing.)<p>Thank you for attending my TED Talk.')
