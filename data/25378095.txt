But it also makes some much more fundamental improvements. It provides a much cleaner, unified, <i>object-oriented</i> type system. It provides about as sane an approach to null safety as is possible on the JVM. (Clojure&#x27;s is arguably better, but I&#x27;ll concede that nil punning is not for everyone.) And it provides a clean set of core libraries that doesn&#x27;t have nearly as many friction points and inconsistencies as the core JDK does.')
