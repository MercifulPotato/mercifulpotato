Adding more content, photos, etc. may help to remedy my situation, but I would feel like I was abandoning my original purpose. I designed the site with &quot;satisficers&quot; in mind, i.e. allow people to make a decent decision as quickly as possible. No frills.<p>Until recently, I worked for product review sites like Anandtech and Tom&#x27;s Hardware, and I&#x27;m not equipped to compete with them head on.
