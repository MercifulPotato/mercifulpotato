So if I went without that noise for an hour or two and then got introduced back to it, it takes me a solid minute or two to get adjusted. All those random noises, like water moving through pipes, wind outside, air conditioning, etc. become super noticeable and end up just overwhelming me by being introduced back all at once. I&#x27;ve been observing this kind of stuff for a while (had my WH-1000XM headset for over 2 years), and I got better at adjusting back over time. But i still get those shorts periods of time immediately after, when that noise ends up flooding back and just making me hyper aware of it.')
