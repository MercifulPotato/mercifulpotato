I other words, adults doing business with adults.<p>Not so with these companies.  They are brutal and cold and have no problem destroying any business at any time for any reason.  I have seen this happen to acquaintances enough times on these platforms to be absolutely astounded that we haven&#x27;t yet seen the mother of all class-action lawsuits.  And it would be a big one.<p>I know people who have gone from having nice lifestyle businesses to loosing virtually all due to one of these platforms suspending their account with no explanation, no conversation and no recourse whatsoever.  One day you are putting food on your table and taking care of your kids and the next Monday at 7:00 AM you are on your way to losing it all.<p>I&#x27;ve said this many times, I am definitely not for the government having their hands on everything.  No way.  However, this, to me, has become a situation where government needs to become involved ASAP.  It isn&#x27;t getting any better.  We need legislators to exercise judicious control over some of these practices.  These company have such command of the marketplace that if they suspend or ban someone they might as well not exist.  That kind of power should not be allowed to be wielded as capriciously as these companies seem to have been doing for years.<p>I do understand that fraud and other issue are a reality of these businesses.  Well, they need to figure out how to deal with that while, at the same time, being human and human in their treatment of those who depend on the access they provide for legitimate work.')
