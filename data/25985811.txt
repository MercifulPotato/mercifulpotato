There are just so many things wrong his statement that it&#x27;s hard to even know where to start.<p>1. A 7% weekly loss isn&#x27;t really anything that a buy and hold investor should be worried out. Yes losing money sucks, but are you really so afraid of volatility you would rather earn practically nothing from 3 month T-bills?<p>2. It&#x27;s super easy to call shorting GME risky after the fact.It&#x27;s incredible what people call &quot;obvious&quot; and &quot;risky&quot; once a particular situation has blown up. Captain Hindsight strikes again.<p>3. He claims he is worried about &quot;market manipulation&quot;, but I doubt he would be complaining or have his faith shaken in the markets if he just realized a 7% gain this week.<p>This guy is looking to blame someone and hedge funds are a convenient populist target.<p>On an aside, it seems the market can&#x27;t ever get a break. If it crashes and unemployment skyrockets, it was due to some fat cats gambling. If the market skyrockets and unemployment is high, now the fat cats are making money off the backs of everyone else. If the market skyrockets and unemployment is low, well, everyone isn&#x27;t sharing in the gains equally.<p>Give me a break.')
