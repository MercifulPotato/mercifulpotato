Linux was doing well and his contributions to its success were recognised, even if he didn&#x27;t get as much credit as he wanted (should&#x27;ve got?). I feel it&#x27;s the past ten years that he&#x27;s become more notorious for his quirks and his gaffes.<p>For someone who was such a large philosophical influence on our industry he had some basic sociological lessons to learn, which in the past ten years have been a more dominant topic in the industry than software freedom. Both are important topics, and it&#x27;s unfortunate that software freedom has taken a backseat recently.<p>Even though we have Linux, I would love to see more dominant GPL projects out there. It is an excellent license when used strategically and I think it&#x27;s dismissed as too extreme too often.')
