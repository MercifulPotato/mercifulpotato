Go and Rust are fundamentally different tools designed for fundamentally different tasks. While it&#x27;s possible to use them for the same tasks, it&#x27;s much more difficult. I would HATE writing a full and secure operating system in Go, while writing back end systems in Rust is doable, but at an unnecessarily slower pace than Go.')
