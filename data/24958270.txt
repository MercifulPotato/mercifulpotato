Many states still have laws permanently removing the right to vote from people with felony convictions.<p>Recent shenanigans in Florida pretty clearly lay out what&#x27;s at stake here.

The mythical Charles Manson interest group is vanishingly small, and easily outweighed by basically every other voter.<p>Finally, the restoration of voting rights for felons was delivered by a ballot initiative led by formerly incarcerated people. They most definitely did not consider it a waste of energy!
