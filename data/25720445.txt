When saving, it used to be you could use the mouse to navigate to a directory, then type the desired filename, and press enter.<p>Now, typing the filename initiates a contextual search within the current directory.<p>Clicking in the filename textbox and starting to type doesn’t work either.  You have to highlight the base (not the extension or “.”) of the filename.  At that point, you can finally start typing the name of the file you want to save.<p>The same problem occurs if the file chooser happens to already be in the directory where you want to save the file.')
