Say you have a car. It&#x27;s worth $1000 but is otherwise in fine condition. It runs great, it&#x27;s safe, it is rust free and structurally sound. Except it needs to tires. Lets say those tires cost $750 because you also have to buy a new wheel and maybe the tires are harder to find. Do you go &quot;well... that&#x27;s too much... I&#x27;m just going to throw the car out and get a new one<p>I think the same logic applies? $750 is way too low to have a good chance at finding a replacement that is relatively safe, structurally sound, etc. $2000 on the other hand is pretty close to buying a mid-2000s civic with no accidents on record. there&#x27;s no clear cut answer here; either repair or replace could be the optimal choice depending on projected maintenance costs and your local used car market.<p>of course, this is all based on the assumption that your current car is already a beater. I probably wouldn&#x27;t scrap&#x2F;sell my 2017 vw if it needed a $2000 repair.')
