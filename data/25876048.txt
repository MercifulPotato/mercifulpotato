This would be a take home case study with a relatively broader problem statement.<p>So for example split candidates into groups of 3 and have each group work on the same case study, collaborating via GitHub and tracking their comms on Slack (obviously interacting with them regularly to give them more context) and then having them present the final output of their work (each candidate presenting a portion of what they contributed, their insights and individual interpretations). Using this presentation to ask more probing questions.<p>The idea about this isn&#x27;t so much about having people competing against each other but understanding who works better in a term, what role they naturally lean towards to get a better feel of not only technical skills but other soft skills you cannot test in a typical interview')
