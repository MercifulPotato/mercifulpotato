Item(by='xyzzyz', descendants=None, kids=[25395895], score=None, time=1607750893, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25395724, text='&gt; All the jurisdictions I know will blow through the entire supply of existing doses allocated to them very quickly. It doesn&#x27;t go on a slow distribution ramp gated by approval like your ridiculous source suggests.<p>You misunderstand. &quot;Blowing through entire supply&quot; and being left with nothing is exactly the &quot;slow distribution&quot; Alex Tabarrok, a professor at GMU, talks about in the link I gave. He contrasts it with vaccinating entire population on day 1. Read it carefully.<p>&gt;  What governs the ramp is production rates, which have been running flat-out irrespective of this decision.<p>I consider the vaccine production regulation people to be just as incapable at cost-benefit analysis as vaccine approval people, so I assume that most production constraints are just as artificial as the approval constraints.')
