To me, the abstract comes across as modest, very reasonable, and exploring questions highly relevant to the community as a whole. Sure, if I was to review it I would be picky in regards to any strong empirical claims since I suspect it would be difficult to demonstrate conclusively some aspects of what they hint towards in the abstract. But as a position paper it looks better than plenty of work already published at top-tier NLP venues and I doubt that it could not get accepted on academic merits.<p>Still, to echo the parent, does anyone have the paper in its entirety?')
