If I could find a job I love I would hop right on that, instead I work in a warehouse for $15 an hour. I think &quot;the norm&quot; is closer to this than the high paying soul-sucking jobs (see: 2019 US median personal income of $36K).<p>Though I too am baffled by the people in highly skilled professions who willingly take jobs they hate to make more money when they could probably easily find a somewhat lower paying (but still quite decent) job that they enjoy a lot more.')
