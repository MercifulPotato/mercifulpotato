These games have not been very successful outside of Japan but represent some of the earliest successful commercial games inspired by Rogue. They tend to be much closer to traditional &quot;Berlin interpretation&quot; roguelikes (turn-based, grid-based, etc.) than the recent &quot;roguelite&quot; indie games.')
