Also I could think about Kohlberg&#x27;s dilemmas[2], and the most known one is &quot;Heinz dilemma&quot;[3].<p>To make a projective test from this story one needs to ask a few hundred of participants for answers, to look for patterns in answers, to form hypotheses how personal traits correlate with patterns in answers, then to run correlational study with an other group of participants. Maybe something would be found. Maybe not.<p>To make something like Kohlberg&#x27;s dilemmas one would need a theory to predict in advance patterns in answers without gathering the &quot;live data&quot;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Projective_test" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Projective_test</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lawrence_Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lawrence_Kohlberg%27s_stages_o...</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Heinz_dilemma" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Heinz_dilemma</a>')
