JSTOR never involved law enforcement in this, and even tried to contact the downloader to see about arranging less disruptive access. Instead, the downloader kept evading the blocks.<p>It wasn&#x27;t until MIT discovered that the downloader had moved from using their public guest WiFi network to going into places closed to the public to surreptitiously install hardware directly on the MIT LAN to continue the downloading that MIT called law enforcement.<p>Here&#x27;s the timeline from JSTOR&#x27;s point of view [1]. What do you see in there that they should have done differently?<p>Keep in mind that JSTOR is essentially a library and a non-profit. They do not own the copyright on the journals they distribute. Wherever they can, they provide cheap or free public access to most of the library.<p>They have probably done more than any other organization to provide ways for the public to get free or cheap access to non-open access journals. Maybe someday most research will be published in open access journals and we won&#x27;t need JSTOR, but until then they are among the good guys.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.jstor.org&#x2F;summary.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.jstor.org&#x2F;summary.html</a>')
