Item(by='markawesome', descendants=None, kids=[24695072], score=None, time=1601962708, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24686707, text='While I enjoy tools like draw.io---I much prefer something like XMind because I don&#x27;t want to have to manually connect nodes, and it becomes overly tedious. Tools like draw.io are designed primarily for point and click, and people that love moving their mouse around constantly. This doesn&#x27;t make me feel very productive, when I can use keyboard shorcuts to create an entire diagram in half the time and then go back and customize the nodes, adding boxes, etc.<p>Unfortunately there doesn&#x27;t appear to be a good markup generator for this type of diagramming or mind mapping. All the ones I&#x27;ve searched for fall short of the basic features compared to something like XMind, which is unfortunate. PlantUML is descent, and so is Graphviz, but they both fall short. Markmap as well fails tremendously in only offering linear designs. I hope some coder will see this and explore using YAML and a markup formating for creating diagrams, mindmaps, etc. Or just using markdown, but adding features for boxes, summary nodes, etc.')
