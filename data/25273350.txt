Their anti-trust efforts against Microsoft + Teams seemed to go nowhere.<p>- Salesforce is one of the only companies that can go to-to-toe with Microsoft in the enterprise - 80%+ of the Fortune 500, 150k+ customers, 200k+ people at their conference each year<p>- Salesforce already know your org chart so can roll out slack to anyone already on force.com easily.<p>- Salesforce are building out from a data-up direction to take up what employees have open on their screens at work. Slack&#x2F;collab was a big part they were missing (so is video&#x2F;conf - zoom would be perfect but it&#x27;s overvalued, Workday also fits)<p>- Integrations with CRM, customer support, social media management, etc. are a no-brainer into slack<p>- Microsoft are weak exactly where Salesforce are strong so a lot of customers are across both and would be tempted by free Slack over free Teams<p>- They&#x27;re issuing stock for half the acquisition and have a cap of 250B+ which is a bit bubbly but they&#x27;re doing well P&amp;L wise recently')
