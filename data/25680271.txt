They basically could have pointed two assault rifles at each protester while having a third police office <i>per protester</i> telling them to identify themselves.<p>This was the chance for the government to show a response of hollywoodesque proportions and they didn&#x27;t. This makes the US government look like a joke, it&#x27;s not a functional democracy. If the government actually relied of this nut-jobs to function, as in like if Trump was actually throwing a coup, it&#x27;s understandable to act in this way. But the fact that no one on the Metro decided to go all in against this clowns is something that I can&#x27;t understand.<p>The crazy progressives that think that Trump is literally the reincarnation of Hitler are saying that it&#x27;s because they are white and this is Trump&#x27;s paramilitary. I thought that they were crazy living in their own reality but after seeing how they got away with storming the Capitol I&#x27;m starting to think that the woke conspiracy theories are truer than I thought.')
