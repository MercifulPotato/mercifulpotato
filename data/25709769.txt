This same ass-backwards logic is being used by some now to blame Joe Biden for the Capitol Riot. How dare Biden have won the election, he should have let trump win to prevent Trumps violent mob from sacking the Capitol Building.<p>No one should give in to the violent, hateful, irrational and seditious mob of Trump supporting Fascist thugs that are increasingly making up more and more of the right wing. They need to be crushed politically and shoved back into their basements. Capitulating to these Fascist thugs even in the slightest has shown that it will only lead to them being emboldened and pushing further and further into Authoritarianism. They don&#x27;t care about Democracy or Rule of Law, only forcing their views on the rest of society violently!')
