We run 1 t3.xlarge instances 4vCPU for the scheduler and web server and 1 t3.xlarge instance (4vCPU) for the workers. At $0.33 per hour (on demand), this seems to most closely match the resources for their medium or large offering, at $0.74-$0.99 per hour (roughly 3x).<p>I realize you are buying not just the compute, but the management, but that ends up being something in the cost range of $300-$500 or so per month for the airflow management part of it. Seems a bit steep. $50-$100&#x2F;mo would be a no brainer for us. For some orgs I can see this being a great solution, but its not really friendly for the little guy (with a min price of $350&#x2F;mo).')
