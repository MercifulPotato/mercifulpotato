Did the congresspeople get the Capitol Police to stand down?  Even if they did, that is a separate thing from throwing out votes.<p>The country could have terrorist acts every day and still have democracy.  Our congresspeople could have their meetings in an underground bunker, wear body armor all the time, and travel in armored vehicles, and it would still be democracy.  Democracy means the people decide who has power.<p>Terrorists can use violence and may change some people minds, but they cannot destroy our democracy.  Democracy exists in the minds of US voters.')
