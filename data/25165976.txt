Item(by='jedberg', descendants=None, kids=[25166058], score=None, time=1605912302, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25165668, text='Health care in the US is bimodal -- if you have good insurance and are wealthy, you&#x27;ll get the best care in the world.<p>If you aren&#x27;t rich, you&#x27;ll get care on par with developing nations.  And our life expectancy reflects that.  If you break down life expectancy by wealth, wealthy people in the Us live longer than wealthy people in most other places, but poor people fare far worse.<p>I hope we can find a system that maintains our exceptional outcomes while expanding who that applies to.  I think the systems in France and Japan are pretty good.  France has a public&#x2F;private hybrid system and Japan has public insurance but also employer based insurance.')
