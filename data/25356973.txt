They always want more. Also, their hardware can fail in strange ways and they&#x27;d shrug it off.<p>I&#x27;ve met with some nice people who migrated from Sun but they all say that the terms they work are draconian.<p>I like Java too but, developing a nice language doesn&#x27;t make Oracle good. Don&#x27;t get distracted [0].<p>&gt; I guess the &quot;community&quot; would love to keep using Java frozen in version 6.<p>Python doesn&#x27;t stop. C++ doesn&#x27;t drop. Even brainfuck doesn&#x27;t stop. It&#x27;d have prevailed. OpenJDK is one fruit of the project. After removing patent encumbered image processing stuff, OpenJDK just took off. Yes, it&#x27;s still part of Oracle in a sense but, OracleJDK is compiled from OpenJDK, not vice versa.
