I can&#x27;t imagine the hypothetical scene of Michael Scott taking pride in knowing how to use chopsticks. That sounds way more out of character to me than having him not know how to use them. Hard for me to take the article seriously when it has to make up character traits for Michael Scott to make its point.<p>I believe that the type of person the author thinks Michael Scott is exists and sucks (and I&#x27;m probably one of them), but I don&#x27;t think Michael Scott is one of them.')
