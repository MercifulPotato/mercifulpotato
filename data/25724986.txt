But the world doesn&#x27;t really work that way.<p>There is always a line between black and white that some human has to look at and decide &quot;yeah this is ban-worthy&quot; or not. Sometimes it&#x27;s obvious - sometimes it&#x27;s not so much.<p>One example: remember that &quot;documentary&quot; &quot;Loose Change&quot; that came out after 9&#x2F;11 and questioned if it was an inside job? I watched it out of curiosity at the time. It was later debunked - but if it had been just immediately removed from every site and nearly impossible to watch I think that could have had a reverse effect. Instead I was able to evaluate the details (or &quot;misinformation&quot;, in some cases) from both sides.<p>So, I believe the previous poster is implying there are always going to be subjective, biased, and sometimes morally questionable issues that arise when censoring information across multiple major platforms - similar to the issue of allowing encryption vs banning it. If you could ban encryption only for child pornography distribution purposes then yes that would be great, but unfortunately that comes at a cost (and it&#x27;s not like people&#x2F;politicians haven&#x27;t tried to do just that).<p>I don&#x27;t think we have stepped into full great firewall of China level censorship or anything, but this is a step in that direction - for better or for worse.')
