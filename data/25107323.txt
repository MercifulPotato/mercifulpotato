Software which drives safety critical systems needs to be perfect, and that is an impossible bar. Whether or not such a target is achievable, it is much MUCH harder if the software is under continuous development. It needs to take enough time to do it properly, and therefore software for critical systems ends up basically being your MVP. It does only what it must, but it does it right. You really don&#x27;t get a second chance on safety critical systems.')
