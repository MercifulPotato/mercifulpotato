If they don&#x27;t remove anything they get blasted for hosting violence and abuse and if they remove too much they get blasted for censorship. Its impossible for them to remove just the right amount of stuff since thats subjective and they could never train a million moderators on how to apply it.<p>I think the real solution here is we need to break up the social media companies. Have each community be its own self hosted website again where the moderators of the community take responsibility for it and apply their own rules. The government can then step in and take action if the communities are illegal.')
