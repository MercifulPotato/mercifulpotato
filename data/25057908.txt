The main assumption being that &quot;WFH&quot; is a net drain on the local economy.<p>While yes, people working from home aren&#x27;t paying for public transportation, or eating out every day - they are spending money other ways. For example people are using food delivery services, buying more grocery, moving to cheaper COL areas thereby supporting a local economy somewhere else. They are buying better homes or furniture or equipment, etc. We need to understand better the complete impact on the economy to determine the net gain or loss.')
