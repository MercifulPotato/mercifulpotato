I&#x27;m certainly not perfect, but I don&#x27;t downvote when I disagree, and I don&#x27;t upvote when I agree, and I try to not make unsubstantive comments. Reddit and HN maybe used to follow this when they were very small, but as sites grow the rules always fall to the wayside.<p>The fix would be that you as the founder, and the X amount of friends that you know and trust, serve as a baseline for the ranking system. If someone downvotes a post that the trusted group upvotes, their influence on the site goes down as a result. Likewise, if someone upvotes the posts that you vote, their influence goes up.<p>You can&#x27;t actually use <i>the</i> E-L-O system for this, as far as I&#x27;m aware, because it&#x27;s not a zero-sum game. But the basic idea is that you take a known group of good actors and give users voting influence based on how similar they are to the good actors, and if you can&#x27;t follow the rules (by acting similarly), you basically lose all influence on the site.')
