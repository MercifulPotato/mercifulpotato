If the prize wasn&#x27;t very prestigious people wouldn&#x27;t care.<p>Now you could argue that those &quot;wrong&quot; nominations in the last year&#x27;s have tarnished the peace prize &quot;brand&quot; so much that is no longer valuable. I would say that is in itself somewhat premature and since it&#x27;s the most political prize there will always be controversy attached.')
