It&#x27;s a simple procedure that takes half an hour of doctor&#x27;s work and the same from some assistant; if you need a million-dollar-per-year specialist for that, even then their work costs less than a $1000; double it for overhead&#x2F;facilities and you≈óe at $2k (instead of $19k) for a <i>very</i> conservative estimate (private nonsubsidised facilities in high cost of life parts of Europe would offer to do for much less for uninsured foreign patients and still make a healthy profit on that).<p>$19k represents a ridiculously inflated markup that&#x27;s not even in the ballpark of what the costs are, even in USA. Things like liability insurance etc add <i>some</i> extra costs, but not nearly enough so that tenfold increase would make any sense.')
