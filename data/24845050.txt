I have a Pax where I nailed the backplane inside out (the veneered side faces the wall, the raw face is what you see when opening the door)<p>I tried removing the nails and it’s impossible. They’re very very very snug. Even punching the backplane out just breaks it and leaves the nails in place with a little piece of board around them. There isn’t enough space between the nail head and the board to slide a kitchen knife and when there is, is breaks the knive’s edge rather than moving the nail.<p>Very curious indeed to know what your method is.')
