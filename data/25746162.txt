Facebook is The Feed.<p>However you frame it, Google are showing you things you want to see - it&#x27;s an affirmative feed back mechanism.<p>Facebook at <i>best</i> do that. Frequently they show you things you don&#x27;t care about. Also things you don&#x27;t want. It&#x27;s an adversarial feedback mechanism.<p>In this light it&#x27;s not surprising Facebook has earned a lot more ire a lot more quickly - though not undeservedly either.<p>On some level this still feels like you can squarely pin it on &quot;optimizing for engagement&quot;. I highly doubt Facebook would be earning the anger it currently does if The Feed has remained a simple linear timeline. They were functionally getting into editorializing when they went with the new thing.')
