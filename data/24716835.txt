Now with a universal executable file format that becomes possible, but requires us to have a way to <i>combine</i> different object files.<p>From here on, I think it becomes obvious that we should have compilation units. A language that does not allow the definition of such a standardized object is a bad citizen, IMO. Rust, for instance does allow it, but is severely hampered by the limitations of the C-ABI.')
