Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602523296, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24752284, text='&gt; There is ample evidence for this comparison:<p>Among the problems with your evidence is that it all concerns Leninist and their ideological descendants. While capitalists tend to accept the Leninist propaganda that Leninism is Marxism, non-Leninist Marxists have, from very early in the existence of Leninism, viewed it as a departure, and even characterized it as “state capitalism”.<p>So, even to the extent that it represents a general problem with Leninism, and also generalizes to a broader category, whether the right broader category is “Marxist” or “capitalist” or something else is a matter itself of ideological dispute that would require additional evidence to answer in any objective fashion, if that is even possible.')
