Item(by='lazyant', descendants=None, kids=[25649280, 25650108, 25650043], score=None, time=1609871605, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25647025, text='That this book and the very similar &quot;Grokking the System Design Interview&quot; (I went through both) get accolades just shows the poor resources we have.<p>What we need is more &quot;Designing Data Intensive Applications&quot;, adapted to interviews.<p>Just as a couple quick comments, the &quot;web crawler&quot; scenario suggest a breadth-first search, which is OK (as in compared to depth-first search) but not good enough; web links in general is not a DAG and you can get into a loop. As another comment, in none of these two resources there&#x27;s a single estimate that I can remember about how many servers you need as per requests&#x2F;bandwidth etc, only calculations are about data amount. They also assume collaborative interviewer, which has never happened in my experience. I think none of these two resources by themselves would get you a L5 or even do well as L4 at FAANG (please somebody correct me), they are very basic (maybe I&#x27;m &quot;too advanced&quot; heh).')
