The M1 chip has quite impressive memory latency around 30ns, assuming you aren&#x27;t thrashing the TLB.<p>Desktops tend to be much higher latency, like say the AMD ryzen 5950X.  In particular the R per RV range benchmark uses between 1 and 32 pages in a sliding window.  The M1 gets around 30ns (which I&#x27;ve personally verified with code I wrote) and the Ryzen 5950x gets around 65ns.  Intel does a bit better than AMD, but nowhere close to the M1.')
