What they mean is that if one had a single-core Zen3 and a single-core M1, then the M1 would win some and lose some.<p>But in the real world, most Zen3 CPUs will have 2x or more cores, thus they&#x27;ll be 2x to 4x faster.<p>So what they mean to say is that they praise Apple for having amazing per-core performance. But it kind of sounds as if the M1 had competitive performance overall, which is incorrect.')
