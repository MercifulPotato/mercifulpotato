My commute is 4 hours a day because I have to take public transit, and working late hours is a bigger burden than unaffected people in similar life situations.<p>I&#x27;m completely dependent on others to take me places, even for groceries.<p>I dearly miss living in Vancouver where I could just walk anywhere easily and my disability wasn&#x27;t a daily consideration.<p>But even growing up, it&#x27;s a difficult disability to rationalize to myself and to others in my life.<p>If people want to go out for drinks, I have to explain why I don&#x27;t drink since it makes me more likely to have a seizure. When friends go to clubs, I can&#x27;t go (not that I enjoy it ) and just walking down the street is a crap shoot in case an ambulance or police car go by.<p>I&#x27;ve actually learned to embrace it more as part of my identity and just be up front with people so they know it up front.<p>It&#x27;s been particularly difficult in my previous career working in entertainment, where so many newer shows and games have adopted strobing as a stylistic choice. Especially with the rise of better LED lighting. So instead I try and raise awareness with my fellow professionals so they can make better decisions to accommodate people like me when making decisions.')
