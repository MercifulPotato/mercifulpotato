I liked the people and the tech was cool, but I just couldn&#x27;t figure out how it would turn a profit. His answer was similar to yours, a &quot;what <i>couldn&#x27;t</i> they do?&quot; answer. Turns out they never found an answer, and got acquired for their technology without ever turning into a real business.<p>As somebody who used to write software for financial traders, it&#x27;s not clear to me that removing clearing houses is a step forward. They provide important services. And I&#x27;m even more skeptical that allowing randos to trade in opaque, unregulated assets is a good idea. Music industry actors, for example, have decades of experience in creative accounting and screwing people over. Real estate has a strong caveat emptor tradition, and property management companies are not exactly a watchword for fair dealing. So from you description, I&#x27;m mainly imagining people all over the world getting fleeced with no practical legal recourse.<p>As best I can tell, the cryptocurrency space seems hell-bent on rediscovering why strong markets and government oversight exist in the first place. The only demonstrated market advantage Bitcoin has in a decade of operation is in light financial crime like money laundering, capital control evasion, ponzi schemes, ransom payments, and outright theft.<p>I do hope these technologies turn out to be useful for something. But the &quot;imagine the possibilities&quot; routine worked much better when there was less of a track record. Now I&#x27;d rather examine the actualities.')
