There are a lot of bio undergrads out there in the US, and as such the wages are depressed.<p>That said, with higher degrees comes higher wages. And with &#x27;outsider&#x27; skill sets comes higher wages. Things like programming, EE, and management-skills will get you a better job in bio. Honestly, most bio people don&#x27;t have anything past Calculus 1, so if you even have Linear Algebra, you&#x27;re much ahead of the group, let alone Diff. Eqs. or some real Stats classes.<p>Granted, these salaries not near SWE jobs, but you&#x27;re not working on dog-walking-apps, you&#x27;re working on heart conditions and health issues. The effort, inherently, is compensation to those doing it.')
