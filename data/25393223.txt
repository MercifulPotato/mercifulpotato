Item(by='deckard1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607729959, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25387472, text='&gt; You can tell someone who is not trained in science when they claim you should &#x27;trust science&#x27; or &#x27;just believe in science&#x27;.<p>The layperson <i>should</i> trust science. Because the alternative is some QAnon cult bullshit. Don&#x27;t confuse the scientific process with concrete scientific results.<p>No one is out there refuting Newton or Einstein. Nuclear bombs still work as good as they did in the 1940s. Every time you use your smartphone you&#x27;re &quot;trusting&quot; that the capacitive screen still works. It&#x27;s rather silly to not trust science when the products of science are all around us. Whether it&#x27;s GPS or the airbags in your car.<p>The problem is with bullshitters and those (such as the media) that use early scientific papers as final scientific truth. With Gell-Mann amnesia effect, the bullshitters have the upper hand. Twitter is particularly bad about this, where people with high follower count toss out &quot;hot takes&quot; all day in hopes of something sticking. You might follow, say, a Paul Graham type of person that knows their VC stuff. But in between their VC messages they start talking about gravitational wells or something entirely unrelated to their core competence. Twitter is an endlessly flowing vortex of this type of bullshit. It&#x27;s sort of a trust arbitrage marketplace, where influencers in one market try to gain entry into other markets by relying on their expert status in one field.<p>As for the media, they have deadlines and revenue targets to meet. They want fresh <i>new</i> stories, and Einstein isn&#x27;t saying much these days. So they&#x27;ll reach into the scientific paper wastebasket and pull out some trash and present it as some recent scientific discovery.<p>&gt; But ignorant people think because an &#x27;expert&#x27; says something is true it has to be true.<p>The crux of this problem is that many years ago we decided that experts shouldn&#x27;t exist. America, at the very least, has a particularly strong anti-intellectual sentiment running throughout its history. So we decided to do away with experts. Just look at Dr. Drew or Dr. Oz. or Dr. Phil. These are people playing the role of expert but are just the same bullshitters that are on Twitter. With the internet, everyone can be an expert.')
