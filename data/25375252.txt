My one on ones with my manager have become repetitive because he asks me what my problems&#x2F;concerns are, I tell him variations the same 3 or 4 things every time, and has asks me for ideas about what he&#x2F;we can do to try to solve them from below since he doesn&#x27;t have the direct power or influence to address them from above. Unfortunately I know who his manager is and I know that my&#x2F;our concerns are not going to be addressed by that person.')
