Every hospital needs to let cameras in and show what dying of Covid looks like. Instead, PR depts silence us.”<p>Awww, so they weren&#x27;t allowed to put out more panic porn.  Boo.  Hoo.<p>The media could report the &gt;99% survival rate but instead they pound on cases, deaths, and individual stories.
