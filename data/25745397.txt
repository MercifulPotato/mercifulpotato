There&#x27;s a tendency for implied vols to be higher than realised, so you&#x27;ll tend to lose money holding options. This is a central element in Taleb&#x27;s Black Swan stuff. The people he was talking about were people like me, and I actually met him in the office for a chat about options stuff once. Basically if you&#x27;re incentivized to be short gamma, some traders will act on that and blow up now and again.<p>2) I think so, firms I worked for threw around a fair few index futures to hedge. quantifying it isn&#x27;t too easy though. A lot depends on how close you are to the strike and the expiry.<p>3) You can&#x27;t avoid looking at open interest, but I guess you can weight it by the gamma.<p>4) Vanna is a cross greek of vol and price. The other missing piece is interest rates, and from that you can imagine a zoo of greeks. But mainly it&#x27;s the connection between vol and price that matters, there&#x27;s a slidey thing you use to move the volatility surface when the price moves.<p>I guess if I were you I&#x27;d scrape all the open interest info and see about the relative size of presumed gamma to liquidity in the market. It&#x27;s a bit of an exercise.')
