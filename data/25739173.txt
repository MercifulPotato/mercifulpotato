They say they intended to allow any customer who wants FB and Twitter to be blocked by the ISP to reply to that email and that&#x27;s what would happen. Not that it would be universally blocked for all customers.<p>Owner does not seem to be the best communicator, he admits this and says in his defense it has been three days of nonstop emails and calls that he answers even in the middle of the night. So maybe he&#x27;s not thinking clearly.<p>Still, pretty ridiculous.')
