In Debian the zlib package is called zlib1g.  I&#x27;m not sure what the &#x27;1g&#x27; is for, but what really puzzles me is why Debian&#x27;s package for the Rust bindings is called librust-libz-sys-dev with the description <i>&quot;libz library (also known as zlib)&quot;</i><p>I guess it&#x27;s too late to fix this apparent typo?  The project is called zlib, &#x27;&#x27;libz&#x27;&#x27; is simply incorrect.')
