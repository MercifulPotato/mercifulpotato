Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607435547, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25344229, text='Why would the police want to release anything?<p>The press clearly misrepresented even the minor facts of the case (&#x27;pointed guns at children&#x27;) for which there isn&#x27;t any evidence - using that likely untruth as the headline item thereby making it an iron clad fact of &#x27;truth&#x27; in the public narrative.<p>1 or 2 seconds of a video could be taken out of context and there could be serious agitation.<p>The fact is quite likely that 1) The woman did something actually wrong and used government accounts without permission and 2) she didn&#x27;t answer the door for 20 minutes, thereby requiring the police to take a more assertive posture. And frankly I doubt they pointed guns at children because that would be pointless.<p>And FYI just someone has a grievance with your company&#x2F;government, doesn&#x27;t them a whistleblower.<p>It&#x27;s possible she is entirely innocent of breaking into said systems, and possibly has some entirely good reason why she didn&#x27;t answer the door for the police for 20 minutes - but it&#x27;s unlikely.<p>More likely than not - the press took a story of someone who broke the law and made her into a victim even though she&#x27;s the assailant.<p>If you use some public system in an unauthorized way, download data, you might expect the police to knock in the door, and you don&#x27;t answer it for 20 minutes, they might have their guns upholstered when you finally do. That&#x27;s not unreasonable.<p>For reference From [1]: &quot;Plessinger said Jones refused to answer the door for 20 minutes and hung up on agents. Jones eventually let the agents into the home, she said.<p>Her family was upstairs when agents entered, Plessinger said.<p>The 31-second video Jones posted on Twitter shows agents entering her home with their guns drawn. Jones tells the officers that her husband and two children are upstairs as they direct her outside of the house.<p>One of the agents points his gun toward the stairwell. An officer shouts, “Police, come down now.”<p>As the video ends, Jones yells, “He just pointed a gun at my children.” The video does not show any children, or agents pointing guns at any children. FDLE said agents didn’t point guns at anyone.&quot;<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sun-sentinel.com&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;fl-ne-whistleblower-search-warrant-20201207-rapzkgm7fnbujlhwzadunciigu-story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sun-sentinel.com&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;fl-ne-whistleblower...</a>')
