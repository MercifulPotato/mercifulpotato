To the point even OOP advocates complain about it.<p>Steelmanning for example would be taking successful, performant OOP projects and tackling the way they use it. V8, LLVM or UE4 for example off the top of my head.<p>Steelmanning is realizing that you can write data oriented code in OOP projects.<p>Steelmanning is realizing that you can write an ECS-style database with OOP. It&#x27;s further realizing that the ECS pattern as described is not inherently data-oriented and requires extension to actually meet that criteria (e.g. archetypes).<p>And to be clear I&#x27;m not accusing you of ignoring these things but the discussion around this topic in general.<p>Basically as a game programmer of over 16 years of professional experience I feel a lot of this stuff is dubiously presented. And I don&#x27;t even like OOP particularly!!')
