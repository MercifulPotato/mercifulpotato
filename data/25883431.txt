I just ignore it altogether... They&#x27;ll eventually give up and ask the actual question.<p>It&#x27;s harder if it&#x27;s something I can&#x27;t ethically ignore like my boss or a coworker.<p>PS: One thing that really helps to get my attention is being someone that&#x27;s actually nice to talk to. I have a LOT of time for people who are not all business and actually care about people.<p>And the best way to get on my shitlist is asking the same question 3 times in a matter of weeks.<p>Once is totally fine. Great when people want to learn.\nTwo is OK. I get it, you didn&#x27;t have time to make a note.\nThree is Shitlist. I&#x27;m not your database. Use OneNote.<p>In the same manner: I notice when people ask me a lot of questions but never the same one twice. I really respect that and I have a lot of time for those people. It shows initiative and a capability&#x2F;interest to learn. Good for a major plus on performance review feedback too :)')
