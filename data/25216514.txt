There are many human and AI powered services as well as secret exploits that attackers can use. Captchas only stop spam, amateur scripts and web-scrapers.<p>It&#x27;s a real shame that because of this &quot;safety feature&quot; the web is losing is programability. You can&#x27;t even curl many pages these days let alone write some programs that connect to the web. This whole bloated scene of browser emulation had to be spawned and now instead of serving 1kb htmls to few friendly bots several megabytes of junk traffic and countless processing cycles are wasted on some menial tasks like retrieving sport match results from the internet.<p>The problem with these captcha services are _free_ which means people just throw them anywhere. Imagine a world where land mines are free for everyone at the tip of their fingers - you could hardly go outside! Well you can hardly go online now.')
