How did past revolutions and terrorist attacks get organized? You realize most of world history existed before the Internet, right?<p>Yeah, of course.  Broadcasting means one-to-many communication.  Before modern technology, those things were organized using other kinds of one-to-many communication, such as in-person meetings, rallies, and through newspapers and other kinds of publications.<p>Movements aren&#x27;t organized one-to-one like on a telephone, because that&#x27;s a far slower way of spreading a message.
