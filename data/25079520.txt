They forced every icon to be a rounded rectangle which comparing to previous versions with free contour, does not present the beauty of skeuomorphism. Also the shadow on the message and app store icon is just visually horrifying and irredeemable. Apple moved to flat design years ago, now they are starting to move to no design. As one stated in a comment above, the new visuals there&#x27;s no cohesive design language.')
