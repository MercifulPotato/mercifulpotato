Specifically, it will generate a salt for you (included at the beginning of the generated hash). This has the great properties of: can&#x27;t forget to use or store the salt; use a weak salt; or forget to use the time-safe compare function. I want to minimize the number of footguns available to the person coming after me, who I suspect will not do the same depth of research and understanding before making changes as I have when setting this system up.')
