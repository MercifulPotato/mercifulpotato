Item(by='FooHentai', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605218037, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25063432, text='True, but I suspect the stereotypical image of a prepper holedup in a bunker surrounded by guns and ammo is more myth than representative of people with a preparedness mindset. If they exist outside of caricature, they are a fringe minority element at best.<p>A lot of people use prepping to gain a sense of control overy life&#x27;s uncertainty. Knowing you&#x27;ve laid in provisions for unlikely-but-possible (by your own determination) events can quiet much anxiety.<p>Ironically the myth of preppers all being paranoid grey beards holed up in bunkers exists for exactly the same purpose, just lazier. Just convince yourself that prepping is the realm of crazies and any anxiety you might have about uncertainties in life can be comfortably locked away with those crazy people in your head. For added effect share a laugh about it with other sane people around you, and you can all rest easy in the knowledge that nothing bad is ever going to happen and there&#x27;s no need to worry.<p>As is often the case, somewhere in the middle lies truth.')
