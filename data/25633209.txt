Item(by='thom', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609776763, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25629107, text='Emacs is slightly painful to use on Windows just because I don&#x27;t want to have WSL2 just for an agreeable set of Unix tools, so I have tried to fall in love with VSCode for the times I find myself there and not in Linux. It is good, and will probably and deservedly dominate developer mindshare for a generation.<p>That said, there are a lot of fundamental differences that might be painful for someone transitioning from Emacs. First obviously is just keybindings, there are great packages to handle most of the basics but like with any new editor it&#x27;s a faff to get everything right over time.<p>Second is that is has lots of special cases of windows, which are hard to manage. In Emacs everything is the same, just a buffer. Your shell, your database client, your code, all buffers. You decide how all this is laid out and have absolute control. The same navigation, manipulation and search functionality exists everywhere. When you get an autocompletion of some text, it works the same everywhere, and the same navigation and search functions work in those menus. In VSCode, you have some text editor windows, but also tab groups which behave subtly differently, and then the panel and sidebar which are both different. I don&#x27;t know how to 100% stop these things popping up, and the terminal seems like the only one available, so they&#x27;re a regular annoyance to someone who is used to owning every character of screen real estate. Extension developers don&#x27;t create extensions from the point of view that users want to consume textual information like everything else. It&#x27;s not bad or wrong, it&#x27;s just that Emacs works at a lower level of abstraction. It would be entirely valid to point out that VSCode&#x27;s level of abstraction enables a more vibrant extension ecosystem.<p>Third is that there are modes in Emacs that are much more mature than VSCode. Calva for Clojure REPLs is pretty weak compared to CIDER in Emacs. All the git modes are inferior to Magit, even the direct clones of Magit (which are good and tastefully done). All of these are very actively developed and will get better, they&#x27;re just not there yet.<p>Overall Emacs has fewer primitives, but they apply everywhere to everything, and I find that a much more humane environment for the kind of work I do (it&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a nice environment for a Lisp, which has the same philosophy to code).')
