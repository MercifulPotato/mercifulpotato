Sometimes it gives me a pleasant head rush which instantly relaxes my entire body. It helps me to fall asleep or to relax in every day life.<p>There&#x27;s a nice dynamic with this technique where you end up using more of the oxygen in your breath, since you inhale for less time (4 seconds) than you hold &amp; exhale (7+8 seconds).<p>With box breathing, on the other hand, I find it really unpleasant to hold the empty lung position, and also four seconds feels like it&#x27;s really not enough to use my full breath.')
