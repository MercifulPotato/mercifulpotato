It&#x27;s not a binary choice between &quot;eat or be eaten&quot;, &quot;the poor are just lazy&quot; vs. &quot;force attractive people to have sex with unattractive ones&quot;, &quot;brave new world&quot; utopia.<p>Western European programmers still live very well, they just aren&#x27;t as rich as in the US. And the high taxes do moderate and blunt the cutthroat competition to a degree, which results in less crazy work life balance etc.<p>Of course these debates get very heated because everyone wants the system that would give <i>them</i> more. I was born to poor parents who could afford their own education because it&#x27;s free here. My relatives had a social net to bounce back from during rough times (primary school teacher). It&#x27;s not good for a society to have a large portion who feel existential dread and that the only way up is taking huge risks that often require initial capital.<p>The reason it is like this in the US is because it&#x27;s not a nation. It&#x27;s just atomic families and people from all over the world, tolerating each other and minding their own business. There is no feeling of solidarity, especially across races.')
