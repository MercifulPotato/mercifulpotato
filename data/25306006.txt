Quite the opposite- Native apps suck compared to web apps. The only native apps I personally use besides the browser on my phone are Maps, Messages, Slack, Camera&#x2F;Photos and those are only because there&#x27;s no other choice. Imagine having to use an app instead of popping open the web browser to order from Amazon? Yeesh')
