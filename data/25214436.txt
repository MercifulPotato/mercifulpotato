Companies are incentivized to reduce costs and risks that do not provide a return. If an employer can hire someone experienced with a solid track record, and reduce any risk of them needing further training or not working out for other reasons, how is that any different (from a pure business perspective) then any other cost or risk reduction strategy?<p>I’m not saying this is how it <i>should</i> be necessarily, but it’s the reality for employers in the existing system.<p>The way contractors are <i>currently</i> used isn’t really anything like an apprenticeship, and functionally couldn’t be as contractors are usually required to produce specific results on a timetable. That’s not to say that contracts couldn’t be used to create this kind of relationship, something like a “work-to-hire” agreement, or a co-op&#x2F;internship with more well-defined way to transition to full employment. From a legal perspective though, that could involve the same (or new) risks, especially when it’s a new and untested kind of business relationship.')
