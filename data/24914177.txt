Thus the only way to install it is to clip it over the CPU, using a PLCC socket placed upside-down. PLCC sockets are not meant to be used this way, so this is really a bit of a hack and might not even work in all cases. Space around the CPU is quite limited, hence the odd shape of this board.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SukkoPera&#x2F;OpenAmiga600FastRamExpansion" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SukkoPera&#x2F;OpenAmiga600FastRamExpansion</a><p>Retro &quot;necessities&quot; are the mother of modern invention.
