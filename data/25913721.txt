The telemetry could be readings from a sensor attached to a microcontroller with 512K of RAM or it could be readings from a server sitting in a datacenter with 256GB of RAM.<p>You need some helper library to handle the protocol and there&#x27;s a really nice full-featured library that comes with a bunch of handy debugging tools but it&#x27;s too memory-hungry for that tiny microcontroller.<p>Another option is a minimalist library that uses very little memory but also has less flexibility in say TLS.<p>If you pick just one, one of your platforms ends up suffering needlessly.<p>Adding the options allows the user to decide what&#x27;s best for them.')
