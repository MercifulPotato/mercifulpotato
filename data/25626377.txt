Try it, C-x p f.<p>* project-find-file doesn&#x27;t call expand-file-name for all 70k files (each of which involves a network roundtrip).<p>* project-find-file will use &quot;git ls-files&quot; (see project--vc-list-files) rather than find (or expecting the user to install and enable fd)<p>* project-find-file uses completing-read, which wouldn&#x27;t by default call Ivy&#x2F;Ivy prescient.<p>I can see how the author has ended up here: projectile predates the built-in project support, so it must only seem natural to use projectile as a base, and apply performance fixes on top.<p>Emacs&#x27;s built in functionality tends to work better with other Emacs functionality, hence why project-find-file works well with TRAMP.<p>It&#x27;s worth trimming your config occasionally, and rebasing onto built-in functionality.<p>The author&#x27;s fast-project-find-file has a more responsive UI, however. It&#x27;d be great to have that in core.')
