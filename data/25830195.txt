No one is required to explain why they need something, but a lot of people feel comfortable saying &quot;my daughter would love this&quot; instead of a lot of &quot;me&quot;s and &quot;next&quot;s. It&#x27;s a weird vicarious dopamine hit for everyone else reading along; hard to explain if you haven&#x27;t experienced it.')
