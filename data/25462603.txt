There are services that try to track me across the net when I&#x27;m logged in so I never log into them except in a private window. This works great when my browser has the name&#x2F;password saved because I go to the site and its one click to login. It sucks though when it&#x27;s email login. I now have to click &quot;login&quot;, wait 10 second to 3 minutes for the email to arrive. Copy the link from the email to the private window. It basically means I avoid using that site most of the time. (Medium)')
