I hold a <i>slightly</i> lower bar (meaning more willing to take a chance) on someone who is unemployed than if they&#x27;re working now. Worst case if I take someone unemployed, hire them &quot;light&quot;, and they don&#x27;t work out is they&#x27;re back where they already were, whereas if someone quits their job to come work here and gets fired, they&#x27;re worse off than they were before.')
