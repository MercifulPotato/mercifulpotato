Item(by='stale2002', descendants=None, kids=[24736611, 24727042], score=None, time=1602216953, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24726461, text='&gt; What do you see as the downside?<p>The downside is being forced into a collective bargain agreement, if I wanted to work at whatever company was a union shop.<p>I would much rather negotiate for my own contract.  Which is something that I currently do, right now, regarding my tech job employment contract.<p>It has worked out pretty work for me.  I&#x27;ve received significant pay raises, that I do not think I would get if I were forced into collective bargain agreements.<p>&gt; As opposed to life in a non-union shop<p>I work in a &quot;non-union&quot; shop, in tech, and I make significantly more money than any other example of a &quot;union shop&quot; tech job that I have ever been able to find in the industry.<p>Feel free to let me know about any &quot;union shop&quot; programmer jobs, that will pay me more than the 300k plus that I make right now.  Maybe I&#x27;ll even consider it.<p>&gt; A seat at the table to bargain with your betters?<p>I already do bargain with my employers.  And it has resulted in me getting a lot of money for my efforts.<p>Let me know when those union jobs can get me more than 300k, for someone with ~10 years experience, lol.<p>And, to be perfectly honest, I haven&#x27;t even been optimizing as much as I could for salary.  If I <i>really</i> was doing that, I could probably go work in finance&#x2F;quant, and get another 50% raise (Yes, really... I have peers and friends, that have gotten to that)<p>I don&#x27;t think any &quot;union shop&quot; tech jobs that exist in the world, right now, match up with that.<p>I am not even trying to brag, or anything here.  The numbers I am throwing around are pretty standard, for people working at top tech companies, and I know this because this is what many of my personal friends, with the same level of experience as me are making.  None of them work at &quot;union shops&quot; though.')
