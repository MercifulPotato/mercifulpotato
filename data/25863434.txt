You throw any block device(real or otherwise) to it, and you get a &#x2F;dev&#x2F;mapper&#x2F;&lt;name&gt; volume that transparently encrypts anything written to it.<p>Other than encrypting my local workstations, you can also use it on VMs from linode&#x2F;digitalocean&#x2F;aws&#x2F;gcp&#x2F;etc. If you store all your sensitive data beneath &#x2F;home for example, you can boot the instance, use OOB console to access it, decrypt and mount &#x2F;home, then SSH and it&#x27;s business as usual. This gives you (some) protection against a malicious actor at your provider snooping your volumes.<p>edit: typo')
