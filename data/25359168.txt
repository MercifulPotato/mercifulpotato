I&#x27;ve had to recover way too many Ubuntu installs to tolerate using APT any longer (in its defense, I understand it was designed by Debian, for Debian, and often Ubuntu abuses and misunderstands it), and while YUM&#x2F;DNF aren&#x27;t that much better, they&#x27;re miles ahead APT in reliability and solidity, especially since RPM is arguably more reliable than DPKG, IMHO.<p>You may well say that Arch Linux and the like, compared to Debian-based distributions, basically leave you in the middle of nowhere with just a knife and a rope, but at least you know what you signed for. Relying on fancy shmancy automatic configuration systems is often a recipe for disaster, especially if you plan to stray a lot from the defaults, because it&#x27;s guaranteed you won&#x27;t have any idea of what&#x27;s happening when everything has turned south.<p>For these and other reasons,I think that systems like BSDs are much, much more pleasant to use than Debian and Red Hat, but I understand why they might not be the right choice for everyone. Still, I can&#x27;t but recommend everyone to give a shot at FreeBSD if your needs allow it.')
