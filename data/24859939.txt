Tire rubber dust&#x2F;oil&#x2F;windshield wiper fluid etc. There is no such thing as an emission-free car.<p>True, all cars pollute, but EVs pollute their environment less.<p>&gt;Also gray energy emission (embodied energy) is completely ignore as allays. If we compare average emission per mileage per car over the whole lifetime EVs are just as bad as any other car.<p>For one, I&#x27;m pretty sure that CO2 emissions per lifetime of EV is significantly less than ICE although it is absolutely not zero, that&#x27;s true.\nBut point two: Containing emissions from a factory is much simpler than containing emssions from a million cars driving around.<p>&gt;The only way to change that is if cars stop being parked 99% of their lifetime. Environmentally the worst thing for a car to do is not being in use. It means more cars are build than work is there for them.<p>True, personal vehicles are rather wasteful but it is definitely worse for the environment to drive an ICE than to not drive it.<p>&gt;Thats how we actually waste resources and pollute completely unnecessary.<p>I agree, cars should be taxed a lot at purchase and their usage billed (with road usage taxes for instance).')
