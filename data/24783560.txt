There are only accounts or not.<p>There are no sockpuppet bloggers; those are called bloggers.<p>If you go down the fake road, you have to realize real news by real reporters is often wrong. I’ve had someone in law enforcement tell me the news accidentally labeled them the victim on televised news and didn’t correct it.<p>Classbooks written for US public school students- I understand that some content in them has been incorrect and intentionally biased.<p>There is truth, but it’s an ideal.<p>I’m glad that this is calling out those that are manipulating people, but on the other hand- what is the goal?<p>Will\nshaming bring fairness?<p>We could have communist dictatorial leaders enforcing their version of truth, if you’d rather have that sort of thing.<p>Our president should tell the truth, and it should be a scandal if not, to a point of course, because I’d bet most have lied at times.<p>But if it’s time to activate something like a libel superpower on the internet, how would that even work in a fair and practical way?<p>Freedom of speech cannot be freedom only to tell truth; truth can be aspired to, but not necessarily known by all, and what’s understood to be truth by some may change. So, really, what should be done?<p>Btw- I’ve done my best in past years to tell the truth as much as I can when I’m not kidding around, and it typically makes things difficult, but better. I’m not recommending anyone fake up things to boost rep. But, it’s happening, it’s not good, and I don’t see how AI or oversight or a control play would end well when it comes to enforcing truth. However, the notion of a “fake” account is what allows most of the users to post content on HN and Reddit more freely.')
