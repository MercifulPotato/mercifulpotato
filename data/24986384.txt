It only makes sense where usage does not exceed some threshold the BBC absolutely certainly do.<p>There are plenty of alternative options, even on AWS, that don&#x27;t suffer from such huge markup without requiring any additional ops input. The thing that runs in Lambda is practically a container image already. Does it really cost tangible budget to have CI build a full image rather than a ZIP file that already contains a few million lines of third party JS&#x2F;Python deps?<p>IMHO this is the epitome of serverless gone wrong.')
