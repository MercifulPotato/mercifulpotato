I have finance friends that make literal millions in yearly bonuses. This is virtually unheard of in software, even though we provide orders of magnitude more value.<p>That doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean engineers are woefully underpaid. It may just be that your finance friends are obscenely overpaid.<p>Though whether all&#x2F;most engineers provide &quot;orders of magnitude more value&quot; may be questionable. Some of the highest-paid engineers, AIUI, devote their considerable expertise to optimising ad click rates. &quot;Provide value&quot;? Hmmm. To whom? Not humanity in general, I think.')
