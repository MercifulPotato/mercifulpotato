You can use replacement libraries if you really need them--I haven&#x27;t yet needed to, but for heavy-duty production use maybe one day I will.<p>&gt; Where are is of the guides for building production applications?<p>Is the emphasis on &#x27;building&#x27; here, as in &#x27;build tool&#x27;? If so, then <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dune.build&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dune.build&#x2F;</a> is what you need. If the emphasis is on &#x27;production application&#x27;, then I&#x27;m sure there are others but <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shonfeder.gitlab.io&#x2F;ocaml_webapp&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shonfeder.gitlab.io&#x2F;ocaml_webapp&#x2F;</a> comes to mind immediately.<p>&gt; Why is the documentation so poor?<p>Which documentation specifically? If you mean OCaml itself, then you should check out <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocaml.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocaml.org&#x2F;</a> , it has tons of high-quality documentation. If you mean third-party libraries, then it&#x27;s probably mostly a lack of tooling that publishes docs automatically, but I think this is starting to change.<p>&gt; How do the editor plugins compare to those for Go, Rust, etc?<p>The OCaml Language Server and its main editor plugin (for VSCode) are nearly feature-complete. The older Merlin tooling has been used for a long time.<p>&gt; How familiar is the syntax to the broader body of developers?<p>Syntax can be learned, but for those who don&#x27;t want to try, there is always ReasonML syntax that uses semicolons and curly braces to make OCaml look like JavaScript.<p>&gt; I’m not saying the Ocaml community never does anything practical; only that they don’t do enough to make their language mainstream.<p>It&#x27;s easy to make assertions without actually knowing anything, but it&#x27;s better to do the research first to back them up, instead of asking a bunch of questions ;-)')
