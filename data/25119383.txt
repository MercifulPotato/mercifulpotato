Even though I&#x27;m a CS major, my classes are often proof-based. One (non-CS-specific) example was Ma 1a, the mandatory first-quarter freshman calculus class: It spent the first two weeks building up the real numbers (i.e. starting from the Peano axioms). Caltech&#x27;s theoretical-ness has a particularly special place in my heart, because it&#x27;s one of the big reasons I recently cared to learn about interactive theorem proving and formal verification (which I love so much that I&#x27;m working on a undergraduate research project in Coq).<p>[0] (among the universities that I know enough about)<p>[1] I&#x27;m honestly a bit hesitant to share about my burnout publicly (since mental health issues can have stigmas and I don&#x27;t want to shoot myself in the foot re: grad schools or employers), but HN is sufficiently anonymous (at a casual glance) that this feels safe enough.')
