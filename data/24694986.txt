Item(by='_ah', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601962373, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24684123, text='+1 to all the recommendations for Brother laser printers. I&#x27;ve had a full-color machine for several years now and it&#x27;s been rock solid. Prints literally <i>every time, the first time</i>. I didn&#x27;t even know that was possible.

I set it to scan to a NAS on my local network, and then the NAS backup job uploads to cloud storage overnight. One-step archiving FTW.')
