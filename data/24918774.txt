GNOME stuck with COBRA longer, but I get the sense that they half agreed and were just hoping they could find a solution without abandoning COBRA (GNOME also had more corporate backers even in those days so there was probably non-programmer architects demanding they make it work).  Evenually both agreed that they needed something more lightweight to solve the desktop needs and DBus came along.')
