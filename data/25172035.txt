The folks I was referring to were already ... middle class or higher, who understood the value of savings&#x2F;insurance, and had ample opportunity to do so, and still didn&#x27;t.  That&#x27;s what sort of... gets me.  Situations where people were never earning enough to be able to remotely prepare for financial setbacks... I don&#x27;t include them in my &quot;amazement&quot; comment.  I&#x27;m generally &quot;amazed&quot; they manage to survive at all in today&#x27;s world.<p>I&#x27;ve not quite had the situation you&#x27;ve mentioned with medical stuff, but have had some ER visits which end up costing thousands out of pocket on top of the ~$10k&#x2F;year we spend on insurance.<p>For people I&#x27;ve known who were in software, or engineering, or law, and had high-paying careers over decades, to know they were still living that close to the edge financially, that&#x27;s what amazes me.  And sometimes it&#x27;s bad spending habits (or drugs, or whatever), sometimes it&#x27;s just poor financial education.<p>But to the original point - an extra ~10% year in income to many folks - even if it means a slightly reduced &#x27;quality of life&#x27; by some measure - <i>can</i> have an impact on their lives down the road, but they also need to manage that extra income properly.')
