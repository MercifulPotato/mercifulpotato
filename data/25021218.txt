I literally laughed out loud when I read in the local news earlier today that the president of my country &quot;congratulated Biden with his victory&quot;. (AFAIK, he is not some outlier, many of them did, but unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t find a full list). I mean, we all know that&#x27;s not how it&#x27;s formally done, and we all know how important formality always used to be to these folks. With such vigor they should&#x27;ve just appointed Biden the new PotUSA months ago based on some CNN polls and be done with it. Trump would obviously protest, but he is protesting now, so what&#x27;s the difference?')
