I&#x27;ve always been expected to do the research and figure out the design for myself. Sometimes I ask people to fill in parts of a design doc that I know they&#x27;ll be implementing. This ensures they are aware of the design, it&#x27;s correct, I haven&#x27;t missed some critical details, and they have essentially written the design for their own work.<p>Occasionally I&#x27;ve had a design review where a higher-up has said &quot;this is why we aren&#x27;t going to do it that way&quot;. I&#x27;ve always been given a reasonable reason (not always one I agree with, but reasonable). I&#x27;ve always been the one to re-write the design in these cases.')
