The heroine of this story happens to embody this novel behavior, which used to be a whole lot more private and a whole lot less race &#x2F; gender driven. Not sure where &#x27;ideology&#x27; enters the picture, it&#x27;s a reasonably truthful observation from someone that is old enough to remember life before social media.')
