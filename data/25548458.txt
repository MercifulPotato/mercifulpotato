There are criss-crossing paths everywhere, and you have to decide which to take. The goal is to climb until you reach the summit. There&#x27;ll always be valleys and hills, so you won&#x27;t always be going up. But each step you take forward, and each foot higher in elevation, is your life getting better. If you can say that most of the time you were moving forward and higher, to me that&#x27;s a well-lived life.<p>Could you have taken a shorter path and gotten there faster? Sure! But the longer you&#x27;re on the path, the more time you have to smell the flowers, listen to the birds sing, see the trees swaying in the wind. Maybe you&#x27;re content to stay exactly where you are. But I think most of us should keep climbing, because there&#x27;s always new trails to see. Who cares how we get there as long as we keep going up.')
