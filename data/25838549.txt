Item(by='tootie', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611088586, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25835621, text='Not to minimize, but society being &quot;right&quot; is an almost unachievable bar to hit. I tend to think in more relative terms. Most metrics of quality of life have been steadily improving for a long time. I think a lot of the things people see as being &quot;on fire&quot; in 2020 are things that have been going on forever, but we never bothered to worry about them because something more pressing was ahead of it in line.<p>The thing that has set my anxiety on fire isn&#x27;t that society has problems, it&#x27;s just how far apart people&#x27;s base perceptions are. Obviously we&#x27;ve always had crazies, but the capitol insurrection shows just how far removed from reality a huge swath of the population is. We can have debates on how to solve issues of policing, or taxation or health care, but in my mind there is just no justification for the 74M people who think a lying racist moron is the answer to anything. And I genuinely believe that &quot;lying racist moron&quot; is objectively true at this point. He led an insurrection based on absolute lies and people ate it up. They just don&#x27;t exist on the same plane of reality as I do.')
