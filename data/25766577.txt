The main chart you should look at is the increase in number of paying customers month after month.<p>Dropbox is much more than just storage. They also have their own infrastructure and don&#x27;t depend on GAFA. They made a decision to not compete on the consumer side. I didn&#x27;t like it but you cannot blame them given the large pockets of the competition and the fact they can monetize those costumers with their other products unlike Dropbox. They compete in enterprise where price is not the main factor like it&#x27;s for consumers and doing it successfully.<p>I will ping you in 5 years... (they might indeed get acquired though.
