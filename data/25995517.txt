However, while you _can_ have spaghetti and meatballs in the &quot;Italian food grammar&quot;, people from Abruzzo might be <i>even more</i> horrified by the American dish: 1) their meatballs are small enough to be part of the sauce. You don&#x27;t have to tear them apart 2) the pasta remains the base of the dish rather than a kind of side 3) you would never serve &quot;plain&quot; pasta with the sauce and meatballs on top [1], the sauce and to some extent the meatballs would be well mixed with the pasta before it reaches the table.<p>So it&#x27;s not the concept of spaghetti and meatballs, but rather the way ingredients are balanced and presented.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bettycrocker.com&#x2F;recipes&#x2F;spaghetti-and-meatballs&#x2F;cb9f45ff-f143-429d-a950-5e366e63e7c7" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bettycrocker.com&#x2F;recipes&#x2F;spaghetti-and-meatballs...</a>')
