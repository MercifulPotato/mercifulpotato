For everything but the toilet, lightly pressured spray of hot water would probably be sufficient. Throw the towels in the wash, close the waterproofed door, press the cleaning button and head off to work. Then the door&#x2F;vents open to air it out after the cleaning process. There are public toilets that do it so surely we could make an attractive home version of that?<p>And if not the entire bathroom, at least have self-cleaning toilets rather than almost every single model being a slightly different shape so there&#x27;s no standardised solution better than a toilet brush.<p>The lifetime cost of paid cleaners or just cleaning the bathroom yourself has to be worth something that could be invested into a bathroom upgrade when building.')
