I&#x27;ve been trying to use Ubuntu full time since 2010.  These days I run a (toy) deep learning rig in my cool basement that has Ubuntu.  I&#x27;ve gone through 4 (FOUR!) different hardware attempts at wifi trying to get higher than 1Mbps to the router:  2 different internal cards, and 2 different external sticks.  I spent a good 2 to 3 hours of incantations for each of those 4 options.  I finally gave up and bought a $50 wifi extender that has ethernet out, which finally worked and am now getting 5g speeds to the router.<p>Before that it was an issue with different GPU&#x2F;CUDA binaries causing conflicts and forcing a full reinstall of the system at random times when I was swapping conda envs for different python stacks.<p>I really really really want to be able to use Linux full time, but I haven&#x27;t even got to the point of wanting to use something like video conference from a linux install, which I&#x27;ve heard is a nightmare.')
