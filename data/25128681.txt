An insanely large portion of the CO2 is simply us and our livestock breathing. There’s also volcanos, etc.<p>I’m a lot more worried about chemicals outside of CO2. Such as lead or pesticides. CO2 fluctuates massively throughout the year. Presumably the world can much more quickly (due to vegetation) remove CO2 compared to those other chemicals. CO2 is also far less damaging to the body.<p>Not saying it’s not important, just I think we’d be better off focusing on issues such as pesticide contamination')
