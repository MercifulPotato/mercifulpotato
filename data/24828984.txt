Many moons ago when I first heard of Kakoune [1], I wanted to write some of my own plugins for it. Whether or not the philosophy has changed, back then it was &#x27;just use shell scripts and make sure they&#x27;re POSIX compliant&#x27;.<p>That&#x27;s when I learned about things like named pipes, the `mkfifo` command, and that it does take quite a lot of conscious effort to not accidentally include a convenient bashism. That said, there was nothing stopping you from writing the main functionality in another language and just shelling out to it. No need for the editor&#x27;s config language to include primitives to do most of what a programming language would give you.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kakoune.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kakoune.org&#x2F;</a>')
