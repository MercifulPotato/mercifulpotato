We were a red-eye and so got in pretty early in the morning for Miami. The part of South America we were in is somewhat known as a fit place as well.<p>That said, it was <i>shocking</i> coming back to the US to see how fat and tired everyone was. I remember one of the TSA people who was just enormous. Literally wider than tall. Having been out of the culture for so long, I was a bit stunned at the size of that person and most of my countrymen too. I remember think to myself: how did this happen, how did we allow it to get so bad? That, and for being on a red-eye, most of the people in the US were <i>more</i> tired looking than the people that just got off the plane.<p>The combination of fatness and exhaustion was, obviously, quite memorable.<p>My big question is then: What is this doing to our society? Sure these changes must reflect in our education system just as they are reflected in our food system. Where else do they reflect? How have our politics been effected?')
