Dapr is from the team who built Azure Service Fabric, which is basically a microservices platform, and with this they&#x27;ve decided to take an open source angle for kubernetes. We&#x27;re going the other way. Open source is great, but it&#x27;s not enough. Micro 3.0 is a hosted platform and focused on removing that operation burden but also providing value add higher level services.<p>I think like most things you either prefer dapr&#x27;s primitives or ours. As was the same with go-micro vs grpc-go.<p>Micro can be self hosted. It&#x27;s an open source project for which you can find the docs here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;micro.mu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;micro.mu</a>.')
