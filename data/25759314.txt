I feel like there is plenty to go around, but is ignored.<p>My critique:<p>a) Google Play Store ignores the spacing, and lists your app 2-3 pages down the search results for &quot;goodnews&quot;. Your listing also lacks an icon, which makes it even more difficult to find. I suggest you add some kind of unique string to your app&#x27;s name to make it more searchable.<p>b) Out of my local device stable of about 10 devices, only two can run your app, because it is proprietary to Android. To contrast, all of them can access the web, and most would support an OWA&#x2F;PWA setup.<p>c) You require registration or login before showing any content. This is a higher barrier than I personally would climb over when exploring a new app. When I see that &quot;login or signup&quot; dialog as the first thing when I open an app, the next step usually uninstall.')
