Are you saving the model and how?\nNope, its a python script. I dont use Jupyter notebook as it eliminates (somewhat) the randomising of the training and test dataset. The most of the resources (time) is needed for splitting and fitting which is dependent on randomising and the &#x27;freshness&#x27; of the run hence, I use a python script which runs every iteration cycle. Also, since the events happen daily, I have to update the training dataset almost daily hence having a Juypter notebook is not my choice of path forward. Yes, if (and when) user prompted results would be needed, I would go with Juypter notebooks as the target market is extremely finicky and will not wait for 10 minutes for the output.\n&gt;Are you doing this manually right now instead of a script?\nI cannot cal it a manual process right now.. its copy-paste.. earlier I had to type the predictors.. which was fun at the start as I understood (somewhat) how the predictors affect the output but now, I just copy-paste from websources\n&gt;What decisions do the results in the spreadsheet inform or what actions do they trigger? How would I, as a consumer, use these results?\nGuidance on how the event result can look like.. and the user is on their own on what bets they would like to place. e.g. If its a hockey match, what can the scoreline look like, how many fouls, etc. In NFL, what would each quarter look like, etc. I stay away from advising what bets to put. Its safer for me that way. e.g. if 1st quarer of a NFL event would be 6-1, I would present the output as is.. the user can place bets on what they would seem appropriate.')
