Countries like Mexico and India have this for everyone. You can’t vote without it. \n- Fingerprint of some sort. Either retina or fingerprint scan to verify identity. This opens up a civil liberties can of worms but we would need to secure this somehow. \n- I’ve read of some startups looking to us blockchain, but not sure how that would work. \n- I read an article about a company called Unum ID that was looking to address this problem. You sign up, give an address, they mail you a card with verification of your address to put into their app. The app then has a unique QR code that gets scanned. Similar verification setup to Nextdoor or buying ads on Facebook. They verify your identity by mailing you a unique code that needs to be entered into an app or page to verify your address and who you are.<p>I think the key components are, verify the address of the person, confirm it, secure&#x2F;uniquely store the identity in a service.<p>The biggest problem we face is fraud. Double votes, voting for others, voting as dead people. California had to purge their roster after being sued for the data being inaccurate. I think 300k names were removed or asked to verify. 300k wrong voters can swing a local or state election. That’s big.')
