The competition was broad, and much of it from far more well funded companies.<p>For all of them to falter and ARM to succeed was a real long-shot.<p>Even well into the 90&#x27;s, when several companies were looking at switching CPU architectures or supporting alternative architectures, ARM was just not on the radar for most developments, because people were looking to compete with x86 on performance.<p>People talked about the Alpha, MIPS, PPC, PA-RISC, not ARM. When ARM started appearing on the radar as more than a low end embedded option towards the end of the 90&#x27;s, it was DEC&#x27;s StrongARM family.<p>It was a very long way coming. Which makes it all the more impressive that they made it.')
