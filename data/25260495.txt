Just yesterday a YC company posted this in their job descriptions: &quot;Understands the commitment required in an early-stage startup and is willing to sacrifice to grow our company&quot;.  This mentality of sacrifice as the only way to disrupt and succeed demands a critical rebuttal. Calling me cynical and shitty for pointing out that YC investors subliminally encourage unhealthy overwork as part of their business model will not dissuade me from calling attention to it.<p>I bought into it myself and spent precious years of my life working for the benefit of such investors which I have no doubt will regret on my death bed. I am not attacking you or your decisions personally. I am speaking as a recovering startup employee who is tired of watching yet another generation being sold appealing ideals like risk-taking and entrepreneurship and who pay dearly for it with their health, family, and friendships.<p>I love the work I do, so do not attempt to paint me as a sad negative hater. I just want more people to think critically about YC&#x27;s business model.  Read stories like Tracy&#x27;s and think twice before signing up for life at a startup.  Better yet, I would like to challenge the idea that it takes 80 hours a week to be successful.  YC wants you to think so, because if they can overclock you for a 1% chance your company will hit it big, then they win.  They don&#x27;t care if you burn out because there&#x27;s another startup school class right around the corner.')
