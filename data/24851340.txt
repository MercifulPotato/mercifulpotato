No question about that.<p>But depending on which thread one reads, Microsoft may be seen as less privacy-invading than Google or, alternatively, scolded for all the ads, Cortana being creepy, them pushing everyone towards Bing, and requiring internet connectivity for playing simple games that used to come with Windows for free.<p>So which is it?
