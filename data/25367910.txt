If you&#x27;re complaining about monopolies or concentration of power, that&#x27;s also an entirely different matter, for an entirely different discussion.<p>I am doing both.<p>Also, switching hosting isn&#x27;t a cure. Google&#x2F;Youtube and Facebook and reddit and twitter, for better or worse, control much of the audience online. If they decided you do not exist then for the majority of people you do not exist. Not because those people chose to ignore you, but the companies made the decision for the audience. At the same time companies like google do everything to disrupt the &quot;open market of ideas&quot; and replace it with a &quot;walled garden of ideas we can monetize and do not object to&quot;, so far mostly to gain a competitive advantage not to push their point of view, but that may well change.<p>Taking about hosting in isolation is in my opinion not helpful, one has to always consider the larger picture.')
