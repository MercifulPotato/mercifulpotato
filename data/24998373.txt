Item(by='user5994461', descendants=None, kids=[24998480], score=None, time=1604585822, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24996329, text='My bet is guerilla mail was pursued for fraud&#x2F;terrorism&#x2F;drug charges, it&#x27;s not a stretch to guess how an anonymous email service is used by some users.<p>Looking at guerilla mail, there is no way to contact them and no information about who runs the service. It&#x27;s a shady company with no legal information as far as anyone can tell. (nothing in the about us or the terms or service pages).<p>If the police wanted to investigate some users&#x2F;mails, they would have to get a warrant to OVH to figure out who to contact in the first place (who runs that thing?). It&#x27;s a fair guess that OVH receiving anything of that sort would shutdown the account immediately.<p>It&#x27;s also possible that the police would purposefully shutdown the service and&#x2F;or seize the servers but rather  unlikely. Either way, all the roads lead to the site being dead.')
