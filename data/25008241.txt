I <i>guarantee</i> that simply being present will change everyone&#x27;s behavior. Most meetings most of the time have no audience. If you keep showing up, you&#x27;ll eventually figure out what&#x27;s what.<p>My next piece of advice is to get on your representative&#x27;s calendar. Pick an issue, any issue. No matter how small. Like fixing potholes or improving a road crossing. State the problem, propose a solution, make an ask, be cordial. 5 minutes. Then do it again. You likely won&#x27;t &quot;win&quot; at first. Tenacious wins in the long run. At some point, politicians will do what you ask, just to make you go away.<p>I <i>guarantee</i> that there&#x27;s a local issue, the more local the better, that you care about, that needs your attention. Anything and everything you can imagine is on the agenda at some point during the year.')
