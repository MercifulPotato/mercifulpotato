The New York Times published a scathing critique of Google’s 4000 word privacy policy, neglecting anywhere to mention that their own privacy policy was 25% longer and sketchier.<p>2. The entire handling of the Caliphate podcast and subsequent backpedaling and retroactive reframing.<p>3. Similar to 2., the doubling down but silent adjustments to the 1619 project historical inaccuracies.<p>4. The maddening insistence on handling of Slate Star Codex author’s identity and hypocrisy as compared to Chapo Trap House.<p>5. The submarine propaganda piece about CP on the dark web, which was clearly an attempt to build societal consensus for mandatory backdoors in E2E messaging.<p>You can go back farther into obvious hits like the second Iraq War and WMD madness of course..<p>I generally don’t trust the New York Times.')
