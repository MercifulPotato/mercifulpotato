About network effects and natural monopolies and high barriers to entry created by those effects. It is very natural, economically, that only a couple producers would win this particular market.<p>The technology aspect of this is barely even relevant. If there was a market for 10 mobile operating systems, they would exist. They don&#x27;t exist due to network effects making such systems DOA, not because it&#x27;s technically impossible to create a good mobile OS. Simply put, no one wants or needs a new OS without a million apps for it. And no one wants an app store without a million apps in it.<p>This is very obviously the kind of monopolistic market that the government should be regulating. Too bad they&#x27;ve gone soft on such stuff in recent decades.')
