There are signs that viruses can compete and suppress each other, e.g. influenza rates have apparently dropped dramatically during the SARS-2 pandemic.<p>&quot;Triggering an immune response&quot; is probably the mechanism (perhaps tautologically: everything viruses do is done by commandeering the host&#x27;s cells, and having them kill another virus would be classified as &quot;immune response&quot;), the difference is that viruses may have evolved ways to actively stimulate immunity against rival viruses.')
