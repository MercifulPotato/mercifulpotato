Such scuffs do happen but are very rare, usually revolve around some sort of treason - wife&#x2F;friend&#x2F;land dispute.<p>Plus we don&#x27;t have terrorist attacks (domestic and foreigners), we don&#x27;t have religion fanatics that go on killing sprees, we have a good public healthcare system that helps mentally hill (we don&#x27;t have serial killers, and the ones we had didn&#x27;t achieve the pop culture status), we have drug addiction under control, so yeah... it&#x27;s really not useful to have body armor.<p>Just to give you some perspective - I live for 11 years in the capital, and even lived near a social project where there was shady people and A LOT of police activity, and never heard a single gun shot.')
