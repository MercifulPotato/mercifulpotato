In this case, I suspect that the &quot;average&quot; statistic is not the best representative of that distribution.<p>For instance, &quot;children&quot; is definitely a bimodal distribution. There are many people in life who never have children, and therefore drag down the average for all those who do have children.<p>I suspect that, in reality, there are many modes for each of these dimensions, at each point in time. I think seeing the modes would be more interesting than the averages.<p>If you believe in free will, you can probably choose which mode you&#x27;ll end up closest to. You certainly aren&#x27;t doomed to be in some statistically-unlikely valley in-between. There&#x27;s hope you won&#x27;t die alone, in spite of what the picture painted by the average might say.')
