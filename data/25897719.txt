Obviously some things &quot;just take time&quot;, but <i>what</i> is the stuff that&#x27;s taking up time? Assume it&#x27;s all developers in the room and we&#x27;re all familiar with the code base. Are you doing a stupid boring refactor of a thing tat &quot;just takes time&quot; but someone on the team wrote - and they have thoughts on pitfalls to avoid if they were rewriting it? Are you banging your head against an elusive bug that &quot;will just take time&quot; to tease out? The point of the standup is to shine light on any number of stupid pitfalls that every developer, even (especially) seasoned developers get stuck on, have dealt with in the past, and can give guidance with.<p>If you&#x27;re just cargo-culting having a daily 15-minute meeting under the guise of agile or whatever, and it&#x27;s just a status meeting, then cancel it, until after people learn to have a proper stand-up. Waking up just to go to a meeting and report &quot;I&#x27;m still working on the thing&quot;, is a waste of everyone&#x27;s time, and is a meeting that would have been better off as an email. (Provided people can send that email, which is not always possible, and is an entirely different topic.)')
