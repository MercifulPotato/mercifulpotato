But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s ideal when knowledge about fundamental language features has to be acquired by word-of-mouth, because it wasn&#x27;t conveyed in the course of the normal learning path (official tutorials + discovery through application of learned concepts to new situations where their relevance is self-evident).')
