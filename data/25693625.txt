So the actual number is between 3 and 5 depending on if you compare with AMD on Apple.<p>You have to realize that all the fabs (and Intel) have multiple nodes on the go at any given time, the progression isn&#x27;t completely serial - they&#x27;ve basically failed this generation but that doesn&#x27;t mean that they won&#x27;t be back up there if they nail the next one.')
