In that case we were looking at running extended builds and the cost of downloading Xcode, then our source tree, then running a build for hours on a per-hour service was fairly competitive with what was being offered by MacStadium. That we didn&#x27;t choose it was mostly chance and external factors.<p>What Apple did here is create a monopoly for MacStadium, at least in the near future, and remove services like AWS from consideration completely. Brian&#x27;s claims that they were simply offering their services in a way that &quot;felt right with what Apple would have wanted&quot; is marketing drivel. I don&#x27;t care if I am getting a single core out of four, I&#x27;m not trying to browse Safari on this machine. Just run my builds and give me what I pay for; that&#x27;s how CI works for literally everything else.')
