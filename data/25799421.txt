We need to bake new research papers into encyclopedias at a much higher rate. We need to automate tons of research so there&#x27;s no more grad students hanging around beakers. We need to make much better programming tools than python or Cuda, that allow working with high level concepts not shitty arrays.<p>All that will require a lot of work. We can siphon would-be researches to do that instead. The remaining research will be more productive.')
