A word document is most of the time, the best choice. But if you know how the data extraction works, you can play around with the layout and design. Imagine we have a scale from -4 to 4. I will put you at 1 with the template because the data can get extracted in the right order, and the keywords for the sections are commonly used.\nBut the rest is (currently) up to you. Read the job description correctly. What keywords are they using there? Skills mention earlier are more important than the ones at the bottom.<p>Whether a &quot;pretty&quot; resume is better than a simple text-based resume is highly subjective. \nSo for me, I would prefer the &quot;pretty&quot; one. It communicates to me that the candidate put in the extra work. Or at least a bit more effort than the simple one. But again, highly subjective. I got actually hired because the CV I created caught their eyes. It was mentioned during the interviews. That is why I created resoume :)<p>Hmmm...there is no &quot;right&quot; way to pronounce it, since it is a made up word, but I pronounce it like this: Resoume(ˈrɛzou:meɪ)<p>Long response, but I hope that answers your question :D')
