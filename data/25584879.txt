Item(by='sliken', descendants=None, kids=[25586499], score=None, time=1609355467, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25583284, text='I have a Tesla and I agree that it drives somewhat poorly compared to a Human ... when there&#x27;s no surprises.  Handling lanes and turns just moderately well, but not great.<p>However it frequently notices things before I do.  Lane splitting motorcycles approaching for the rear for example.  Or a car in front of me slowing down, but not using the brake lights.<p>It also does quite well when a car brakes in front of me, especially if it&#x27;s a surprising slow down like on an onramp where I&#x27;m looking over my shoulder to merge.<p>So while I&#x27;ve not had an accident of any kind in over 25 years, I do appreciate the car noticing before I do.<p>So while I don&#x27;t let the Tesla drive autonomously, I do feel like I&#x27;m a much safer driver with the active assistance from the car and that the Tesla (even with the same sensors) will continue to improve.  Not sure if they will hit full autonmous on the current hardware, they might need another revision (to add CPU and better sensors) before they drive better than most humans.')
