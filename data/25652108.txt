If  so, then you are probably right that it&#x27;s not valued up the chain and you should leave because that is a total shit show that is not the norm.<p>If you haven&#x27;t, reach out for time on their calendar, and write down your data points on on-call wake-up rates, total of alarms over time, and let the data make the point that this is not sustainable.<p>The Director should have some options. How big is the rotation? Is the manager in the rotation themselves? When you&#x27;re on call are you also expected to contribute story points to the sprint? Why are you not able to solve underlying engineering issues that are causing the SLO violations?<p>If you came to me, I would be shocked, and immediately make a plan with the engineering manager. Any time a person is woken-up by an alarm it&#x27;s an incident. There needs to be a response to every incident. There needs to be some serious bar-raising and you can&#x27;t do it yourself. You need an ally in your management chain and if you don&#x27;t have one, you&#x27;re better off transferring teams or companies.')
