Instead, they invested money and resources in digital proctors - with all the invasive pains that come with it.<p>If you can&#x27;t bother to make a proper exam, don&#x27;t bother. Rather make the classes pass&#x2F;fail on project work, or grade the classes on projects &#x2F; home exams. Trying to bring a 100% replica of the physical exam space into the digital space is just a recipe for disaster.')
