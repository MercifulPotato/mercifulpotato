I wouldn&#x27;t be shocked to hear numbers way lower for some smart folks. I wonder, for example, what it cost GreenArrays to get their chips made, how big their run was. But $1M i probably a pretty safe ballpark starting place.<p>And we have pretty great open source cpu &amp; ram design tools. MAGIC is free. There&#x27;s a lot of great tools fora  lot of this.<p>What is not so great is all the un-core. And GPU, if you want that.<p>The SiFive boards were coming with TileLink[1] as the main way to talk to the core, for a while, I believe, which is a pretty low level cache-coherent fabric used no where else. There&#x27;s decent off the shelf to design a lot of the digital systems here. But I don&#x27;t know what resources if any are available to help you build a chip-to-chip interface, to expose the TileLink. And there&#x27;s basically the world&#x27;s tiniest market for things to plug in on the other end anyways.<p>When you buy an SoC, almost all embedded folk expect a bunch of semi-standard capabilities. I2C, I2S, DisplayPort, USB, Ethernet, &amp;c are all common things you might want. While we can make a decent cpu now a days, afaik, we are still in very very very early days, very pre-implementation, for almost all of these. Thusfar almost everyone relies on buying closed IP to provide connectivity for the SoC they are making. It&#x27;s quite likely to be the case as well for the new SiFive Unmatched board; I expect they bought someone&#x27;s PCIe IP &amp; integrated it.<p>We are starting to see more neat work with FPGA implementations of various protocols like USB3 &amp; PCIe but these all rely on the FPGA having really good transceivers that tackle the PHYsical layers, do the dirty work. Building actual transistors to be receivers &amp; transmitters into &amp; out of the chip, that&#x27;s where, atm, we are all but babes, it feels like.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=EVITxp-SEp4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=EVITxp-SEp4</a>')
