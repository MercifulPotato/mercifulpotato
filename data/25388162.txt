I&#x27;ve been on the suffering end of trying to find a place to rent before but couldn&#x27;t due to everyone preferring AirBnB for long term rental properties as they could make more money. I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the root cause of housing crises in cities worldwide, but it&#x27;s definitely a major contributor, as you have the same number of people now fighting over less area. The quicker AirBnB gets regulated to go back to being a place to rent out a spare room, the better.')
