Candidates under RCV win when they get 50% of the vote, so if you&#x27;re so extreme that only a small minority bothers to rank you then you&#x27;re not going to find yourself elected on behalf of a minority. This is in contrast to FPTP, where any extremist can win with any miniscule percent of the vote if there&#x27;s enough vote-splitting going on.')
