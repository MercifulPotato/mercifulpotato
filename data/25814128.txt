Since you have worked as an entrepreneur before you can be autonomous out in the field and not have the typical constraints of a normal job. That is a relationship thst is particularly well suited for backpacking since you can better test out the gear if you are remote.<p>You would probably need to reach out to companies and pitch this as an opportunity for them to leverage your background, skills, and personal drive in order to deliver a world class product.<p>My two cents...')
