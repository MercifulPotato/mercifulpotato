I have an adapter for all my lenses, which is working well. I have found no decrease in quality compared to older DSLRs, so I would not lump it in with point and shoots.<p>As an added bonus, when taking wildlife photography, the lack of a shutter click means that I can take photos silently without spooking birds and animals.')
