I would equate &quot;kill&quot; to &quot;permanently damage&quot; and not &quot;temporarily tired&quot; so maybe we&#x27;re just disagreeing on definitions?<p>And how bad is it really? Do you have anything to back what you mean and its severity? Most activities cause temporary fatigue after several hours so what makes this special?')
