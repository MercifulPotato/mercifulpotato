I don&#x27;t know Georgia&#x27;s laws, so maybe felons are allowed to vote under some circumstances.<p>How do you even get a ballot for someone who isn&#x27;t registered? Also, could they have moved after casting their vote legitimately?<p>Votes from people who moved out of state before the election. When is &quot;the election&quot;? I hope and assume they mean &quot;before mail in ballots could be requested and submitted&quot; and not &quot;before November 3rd&quot;.<p>And what is &quot;proper&quot; signature matching? Signature matching is tricky. Are they getting professionals to analyze the signatures? Probably not. I&#x27;m not sure some Joe Schmoe would be able to look at two of my signatures and confirm they match, so I&#x27;m not that interested in strict signature matching as a bar to clear.<p>Rest assured, that if these claims actually are true, I will be happy to see the issues resolved. But seeing as all of the claims so far have come up totally empty, I&#x27;m not holding my breath. Remember when Trump said that he had a TON of evidence that Obama wasn&#x27;t born in this country? Forgive me if I remain skeptical.')
