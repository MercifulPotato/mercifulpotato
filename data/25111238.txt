Better as in programs open faster, the file manager opens faster, the task manager opens faster. Everything uses less memory and less CPU cycles. Everything is snappier.</i><p>Simply untrue. It could be true for some distros, some driver versions and some hardware... but if you consider everything, Windows runs better than Linux. Mostly because most hardware is designed to run well on Windows. The Linux versions are either an afterthought or built and maintained by third-party.<p><i>Linux distros generally don&#x27;t annoy users with stealthy automatic forced updates.</i><p>Windows updates aren&#x27;t stealthy and they can be disabled. If you really don&#x27;t want an update, it is MUCH MORE straightforward to avoid installing the optional update in Windows than it is for Linux distros.<p>* Linux distros have a better app store experience than Windows, plus most of whatever there is free without much if any risk.<p>Which Linux distro has a better App Store than Windows? Since Microsoft launched the Windows App Store, it is the best App Store in any non-macOS computers.<p><i>Linux doesn&#x27;t have any phone home telemetry type &quot;features&quot; built into the OS.</i><p>Some distros do. Ubuntu has it, for example.<p><i>Linux user experience is much more customizable. There are a much greater variety of tools at your disposal to customize how you want your desktop to look and operate.</i><p>This is true. However, this has been a problem, which is why something like Ubuntu which has good defaults which they stick to has been so much successful than anything else.<p><i>Linux is free.</i><p>Sure! Many things are. That&#x27;s not always a good reason to use it.')
