On behalf of everyone who doesn’t write Java for a living, 200 lines for a plain data object, full of trivial getters and setters everywhere is <i>crazy</i>. Code like that decimates your velocity because of how much effort it takes to refactor or add features to your project.<p>The noob’s instincts are right. Well written code in just about any other language doesn’t need all that crap. And for good reason - you can really feel the difference if you actually measure your performance programming, in the short term or the long term. And in either features&#x2F;hour or features&#x2F;line changed.<p>I worked at a place once which had this C# project which wrapped incoming http calls into calls to our internal backend (also http). Then it took the JSON from the backend and converted it to JSON for the browser. The code was 3500 lines full of that sort of POJO getter and setter crap. Every time we added a feature, this code needed to be updated. We had 2 people assigned full time to do those changes. After way too many meetings we managed to replace the whole thing with a few hundred lines of nodejs code. Those guys were moved into more useful roles - saving the company 2 full time salaries.')
