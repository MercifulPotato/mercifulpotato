There&#x27;s much more to these devices than graphene, however.<p>You may have noticed that literally every experimental paper on this stuff has Kenji Watanabe and Takashi Taniguchi as authors. This is because they grow the best hBN crystals in the world and they give them for free to pretty much any researcher who asks nicely. This is amazing and without them the whole field would be way worse off. Their crystals are the bulk sort that needs scotch tape to use, much like graphite needs scotch tape to isolate graphene. I don&#x27;t think CVD hBN is nearly as good as their stuff yet. The hBN provides an encapsulating dielectric for the graphene, and is critical to getting high-quality devices.<p>That&#x27;s just one example of a problem with scaling this stuff, and there are others as well. The field is working to improve these things though, since right now it&#x27;s super difficult to reproduce any given piece of physics. I think at this point there are exactly 3 ferromagnetic TBG devices in the world, for instance.')
