My relationship with food is garbage. Moderation has ALWAYS been a challenge. I need an extreme intervention, it’s either change my life style or get some kind of gastric sleeve. NO WAY. I do not want surgery for a LIFESTYLE change. If I eat like a NORMAL person, IE, STANDARD AMERICAN DIET, I’m going to get fatter. I have to change my relationship with food.<p>Oh boy, can I relate to that. I&#x27;m not fat, but I can eat <i>a lot</i>, to the point where I am feeling quite unwell. It is very difficult for me to stop, even when I am &quot;baseline sober&quot;. When I&#x27;ve smoked a bit of weed, which I do for mental health reasons, of course, forget it.<p>Many don&#x27;t understand why I try to not have any easy food within reach where I dwell. It&#x27;s because of this.<p>&quot;Self control&quot; and &quot;willpower&quot; is a stupid myth. We&#x27;re animals who evolved for food scarcity and scarfing as much down as possible whenever it is available, because it won&#x27;t be tomorrow, and then we&#x27;ll be starving for two more weeks.')
