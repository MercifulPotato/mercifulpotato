Tooling doesn&#x27;t always make it easy to share context with translators who are often contractors for outside agencies. Unfamiliar developers try to do string math instead of laying out full sentances to translate. People are surprised to find the same original sentence needs different translations on different screens.<p>Of course, Google has lots of experience with localization, so should really have this down by now.')
