As opposed to everyone attaching 2x 1Gbps to it for whatever reasons (really tempted to say its laziness but maybe there are legitimate reasons, although I don&#x27;t think so; why would AMD make a board on which an on-chip dual NIC is unusable?).<p>Piling such addons on top of an otherwise single-board computer feels quite strange to me. What are the thermal implications of such a setup?<p>Not an expert by any stretch but I am very skeptical.')
