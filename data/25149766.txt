Just the other month google deleted my gmail account (had it set up to delete after a year of no-login)<p>It is quite easy to migrate:<p>1. get a new mail account\n2. forward everything from your gmail account\n3. sort everything GMail into a separate folder in your new account\n4. slowly change email addresses in accounts and let people know your new address.<p>I think after a year I had 99% of accounts migrated, and can only remember one or two that I moved after that.<p>Itâ€™s a good way to declutter accounts as well and was made a bit easier because I use a password manager.<p>Also with private emails, if someone contacts me after 5 years, they likely know someone I know and can get my contact Info via them or social media.<p>Take the opportunity to migrate to a domain you own, because then you are provider independent.')
