(We have the `balance_retrieve` API call designed for this purpose.) Please don&#x27;t take this as some sort of shunning of responsibilities on our part—managed accounts were designed like this so Stripe doesn&#x27;t have a direct relationship with your customer (they may not even know Stripe exists!). But like you said, it allows you to wrap Stripe for payments, so you can own this relationship and the health of their account. For _standard_ accounts with Stripe Connect, Stripe would own this and we&#x27;d send notifications warning of negative balances. We have a guide on how this works: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;connect&#x2F;account-balances" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;connect&#x2F;account-balances</a>.<p>That said, it does sound like we could&#x27;ve handled this better—and we really shouldn&#x27;t be that abrupt. Could you get in touch with me at edwin@stripe.com and I can look into what happened and see what we can improve for future cases?')
