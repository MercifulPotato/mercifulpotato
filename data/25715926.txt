He implies contradictory things at the same time and then says he doesn’t mean it that way when confronted. Meanwhile, everyone who was primed to hear the horrible&#x2F;terrible&#x2F;deplorable version of the message heard exactly what they wanted to hear.<p>He also does this with Tweets. Oh that retweet of that white supremecist, just a re-tweet. Doesn’t mean anything. Except there are good people on both sides.<p>But it <i>does</i> mean something when you are the President and you have a large number of followers.<p>People have been getting death threats for weeks about the stolen election. The only thing this President has done is continue to amp up the lies and demands of his followers to do something, anything.<p>The world isn’t a programming language, there’s no state machine and no precise instruction set. It is full of hints and innuendo.<p>Please interpret Donald Trump in context.')
