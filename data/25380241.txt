Sub-Turing languages generally don&#x27;t allow recursion or unbounded loops - your program is always making progress. Solving 3-SAT doesn&#x27;t sound like it precludes sub-Turing completeness, since you&#x27;d have a finite number of solutions you&#x27;re iterating over.<p>It&#x27;s still useful for a config language because it makes it harder to <i>accidentally</i> make a config that (in practice) never terminates, and usually allows for easier static analysis and refactoring of the config files through immutability and purity.')
