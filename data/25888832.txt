From a developer point of view this is questionable at best, but from a business point of view I reckon decisions like these are the core of why WordPress is popular.<p>You don&#x27;t have to know what cron is to install a WordPress site. You don&#x27;t have to know anything about git or setting up varnish. You just bung the files on your PHP server, put in your database credentials and away you go.<p>There is a big conflict here between what is practical for users and what is best practice for developers. WordPress has always put user experience first, to the point where it&#x27;s easy to shoot yourself in the foot and get your site hacked by installing a bunch of badly made plugins.
