It might be the case that the overdoses have increased precisely because of lockdown. It might also not be the case. That remains to be investigated.<p>I think it&#x27;s superficially easy to blame suicide, overdose, domestic violence etc on the lockdown, but that&#x27;s hard to prove, because who&#x27;s to say it&#x27;s not a reaction to the overall situation of people dying of a brand new disease?<p>Personally, I really resent lockdown&#x2F;movement restrictions and I think it&#x27;s a garbage policy, right back from when I lived in China during the initial outbreak. However, I also have to admit that the countries that locked down seem to have successfully knocked this virus on the head, whereas those that didn&#x27;t are still suffering the effects. Perhaps a lengthier lockdown pain at the beginning is better than this drawn-out shitshow of half-assed measures that other countries are going through? I dunno.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbc.ca&#x2F;news&#x2F;canada&#x2F;british-columbia&#x2F;overdose-deaths-bc-august-2020-1.5735247" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbc.ca&#x2F;news&#x2F;canada&#x2F;british-columbia&#x2F;overdose-dea...</a>')
