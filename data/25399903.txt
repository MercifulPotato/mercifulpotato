But throughout that time I bounce between actual vim and vim emulation. Lately I&#x27;ve been concluding emulation is better most of the time.<p>The problem with real vim is maintaining your setup can be super painful. 95% of the time it&#x27;s fine, but that 5% can really bite you. For example, this bug, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tpope&#x2F;vim-vinegar&#x2F;issues&#x2F;10" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tpope&#x2F;vim-vinegar&#x2F;issues&#x2F;10</a>, struck me out of nowhere. It was super annoying, and took some debugging and exploration to find a work around for. As you can see from the comments, it seemed to impact like 5 people, so you often don&#x27;t have the advantage of a large audience pushing for fixes. In the end the bug was in vim itself, not the plugin btw.<p>With all that said, in my humble opinion I would say start learning real vim with say vimtutor (it is possibly already installed on your machine) and use vim to say edit config files or do git commits. When you are getting comfortable with the vim way of editing, switch to an emulator in your IDE. IdeaVim for the IntelliJ family is really good, that&#x27;s what I use today.')
