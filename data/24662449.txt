These systens are certified for use in highly safety critical applications (think railways, nuclear reactors, chemical plants...). To keep that certification, either the whole OS must be recertified after a change or an impact analysis and extensive testing are performed for each and every minor patch. Most random hackers won&#x27;t be able to deliver any of that along with their patches. It requires resources few have access to.<p>To give you an example, I had access to the complete ThreadX source code a while ago as my employer back then was a licensee. Making functional changes to that code was a complete no go because that would instantly invalidate its certification and put the onus of recertification on us. And we wouldn&#x27;t have been able to pull that off at all.<p>Given those restrictions, the actual software license barely matters.')
