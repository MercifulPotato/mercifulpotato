She wanted to help with some python programming. Yep - playing super nerd is LAME. I thought getting environment setup to match mine would be pip requirements.txt but no go.<p>Really facinating. I think things like go &#x2F; rust etc? may work better - you compile everything and compile to binary on platform, so don&#x27;t need to build and carry around environments everywhere.<p>I moved to docker deploys &#x2F; dockerfiles locally for pretty much everything. Totally overkill, but when I switched to working from home was so glad I could just get up and go without getting my overall system sorted out.<p>I haven&#x27;t totally figured out the WSL2 python remote interpreter &#x2F; debugger code flow yet however, so still using docker. I&#x27;m sure WSL2 will or is an option.<p>I&#x27;ve been tempted to just vnc or similar into a cloud instance, but my local machine is to fast by comparison for the price.')
