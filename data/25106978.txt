It just happens to be a feeling that humans have. We probably have it because it gives our species some advantage over other species. It might be that a more &quot;right&quot; way of behaving is aggressive eugenics to create better life for future humans or even a future species. Animals often do this by killing the runt of their litter or hen-pecking each other to death.')
