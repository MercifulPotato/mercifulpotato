The main attack vector here is stolen Macs being re-sold as they can be &quot;un-bricked&quot;.<p>I know part of the point of the T2 is to make physical access less interesting an attack vector, but it&#x27;s typically doing so after a machine has been stolen. This makes it more attractive to do without stealing, but that&#x27;s an attack style that is only really done by state level threats, and one that was still possible anyway, because hardware access is essentially game-over anyway at that point.<p>I feel like this is over-blown? Am I missing something? Is there another attack vector here that&#x27;s worse for &quot;regular users&quot;?')
