Chi, Jeffrey Dean, Neoklis Polyzotis<p><pre><code>    &quot;Our initial results show, that by using neural nets we are able to outperform cache-optimized B-Trees by up to 70% in speed while saving an order-of-magnitude in memory over several real-world data sets. More importantly though, we believe that the idea of replacing core components of a data management system through learned models has far reaching implications for future systems designs and that this work just provides a glimpse of what might be possible.&quot;</code></pre>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1712.01208" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1712.01208</a>')
