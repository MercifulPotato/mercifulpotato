Climbing Everest almost always is a team effort.<p>Even if you ignore those porters , those <i>“twenty Sherpa guides from Tibet and Nepal”</i>, IMO, deserve to be mentioned there more than Jan Morris, who didn’t make it further up the mountain than 22,000 feet (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jan_Morris" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jan_Morris</a>).<p>(and aside: ten thousand pounds of baggage seems very low to me. That’s less than 30 pounds per porter ⇒ I guess that’s what made it to the highest camp)')
