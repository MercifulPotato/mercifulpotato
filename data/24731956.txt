I commonly hear things like &quot;I can&#x27;t believe how good the Facebook ads are. I only see ads for really nice Blouses in colors and sizes that I like. I&#x27;ve bought nice things via Facebook ads&quot;.<p>Granted, it&#x27;s usually followed up by &quot;I can&#x27;t believe Facebook is able to be <i>that</i> good at showing me the right ads&quot; ... but people I&#x27;ve talked to seem to feel neutral about the creepiness of it, I&#x27;m guessing because the upside is they get to discover and buy cool new things that they otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have known about.<p>(Personally I don&#x27;t like ad targeting on the basis of companies abusing &#x2F; selling &#x2F; harvesting data about me... but for the average person I think seeing well targeted ads is positive UX compared with showing non-targeted ads)')
