If you say you deleted it, and they didn&#x27;t, I think we&#x27;d both agree that&#x27;s a problem they should fix or change.<p>I think the issues you&#x27;re describing don&#x27;t have anything to do with the social media service aspect, but more like bad practices of an online company. So I&#x27;d agree we should push for online tech companies to fix many issues, including security issues and offsite tracking and proper attribution, etc.<p>But I don&#x27;t believe in your original argument that we should abolish social media, because a lot of people want to use social media and it&#x27;s not your right to stop them.')
