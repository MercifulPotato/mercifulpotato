Back in the day our website was Flash based. We had a team of animators, script writers, professional voice talent, etc. cranking out training content. People loved it and we won multiple awards. But then the ipad came out and the people who used our product adopted the iPad as their training device. Very quickly we switched from rich Flash animation to text and images with the occasional video we got from marketing. It is all the same information, but it is so incredibly boring. Usage dropped dramatically since people loved the animated content. Reading and looking at static images? Not so much. That was 10 years ago and things haven’t gotten better, at all. We really lost something special when Flash died. Somebody mentioned Adobe Animate. It really isn’t a replacement. Someday someone will create an animation tool that was as good as Flash. Maybe.')
