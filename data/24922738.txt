So they failed it because it can drive anywhere and they don&#x27;t agree it should be allow a user to use on residential streets or streets not clearly marked. Better yet the car shows that is regonizes the driving lanes even with bad marking. Clearly CR is not judging on ability but instead judging against their own choice.<p>wow, just wow. that is just as contrived as can be.<p>as for amount of torque required to deactivate the self driving it not a lot and why would you assume you want the car to retake control immediately afterward?  If I took control I want control till I state otherwise. I don&#x27;t want to suddenly find the car off doing what it wants after I disengaged it through a method they defined as will turn it off.<p>So no, I do not agree with their safety assessment because the majority ignores the fact that it was designed to drive in those conditions and not require rigidly mapped roads to operate. There is no real point in self driving system that requires perfection in roads and markings.<p>Hell the scariest part about Tesla&#x27;s FSD is how well it does work, it makes you wonder why so many cannot get even part way there.<p>Is it perfect, not on your life. However it is damn better than CR implies and the only real danger is some people might trust it too much regardless how much Tesla says not to. Well guess what, they do that will all LKA and even super cruise.')
