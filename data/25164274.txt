So, sure, if you aren&#x27;t an atheists, the people whose atheism you notice will be very disproportionately those who are proselytizers. That doesn&#x27;t mean atheists in general are proseltyizers, and atheism has no unifying belief in the value of proselytization the way, say, mainstream Christianity does.')
