I think this is feature of <i>some</i> social network designs, but I don’t see how we can say it applies to all ‘network technogies’.<p>To me that just leads back to there being a problem with how Facebook is designed.<p>It is designed to maximize engagement so they can sell ads - I.e. they profit from this disinhibition.<p>I think we largely agree on what’s happening, but what I don’t yet understand is how you conclude that Facebook is a scapegoat.')
