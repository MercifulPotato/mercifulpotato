I really hope you can make money off of this so it can remain free to use (and I think you can, judging by Auth0&#x27;s customers)<p>Also, I assume you can add captchas as a custom theme. Could you add some sample code for that (and other user stories) in your docs&#x2F;repos? In cases where somebody&#x27;s got to implement something super quick, and there&#x27;s a competitor who has really easy to follow docs, sometimes that alone can convert a customer.<p>The use cases we have for Cognito include: zero-trust authentication portals for services, enterprise SSO, customer portals for applications, session&#x2F;user management. For Auth0, the same plus API management (including billing, authn+z, etc)')
