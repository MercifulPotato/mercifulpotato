I certainly don&#x27;t know their own data on the utility of the test vs. GPA in predicting student success, but I do know that data with respect to college admissions: HS GPA is consistently as good or slightly better than standardized test scores.<p>Even if the balance is tilted the other way for this particular magnet school, it&#x27;s quite inflammatory to claim this initiative is in any way similar the destruction of 1,500 year old religious icons by an extremely violent group of religious extremists.<p>The people who &quot;rearranged their lives&quot; to try to get their children into the school are also in no way entitled a spot. If this school is doing an excellent job teaching students, and that absolutely appears to be the case, then more energy should be spent on expanding those same opportunities to a greater number of people, not worrying about the speculative incremental decline in quality that might be incurred when switching from one set of entrance criteria to another.')
