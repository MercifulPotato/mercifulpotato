Item(by='m45t3r', descendants=None, kids=[25344682], score=None, time=1607432852, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25343787, text='&gt; Clojure doesn&#x27;t have a spec at all (it has documentation for the single implementation; it seems to have another implementation which is even more a toy since no real Clojure programs can run on it, because JVM is part of Clojure, really...)<p>It is true that Clojure doesn&#x27;t have a spec, but it is very stable. I saw some very minor breaking changes in Clojure, and most code just works after a update (including very big projects). Clojure is very conservative in general, and this is something that Rich says as a explicit design goal.<p>BTW, are you referring to ClojureScript? Because ClojureScript is far from a toy language, it works well and we use in production. Sure it have some warts, but they&#x27;re mostly workable and while I am not a fan, I am not a fan of frontend in general so this is probably part of the problem.')
