Even article itself says it should be taken with grain of salt.<p>All that said there is little doubt that lower car would be safer for peds. But all I asked is some evidence and you provided some garbage.<p>I don&#x27;t think we ought to ban trigger-vehicle-of-the-year just because you feel like it. First I totally think we should discourage driving in cities, no matter the car. Pedestrian only streets, public transport, bike lanes is 100% my vibe. If you really want smaller cars in cities - make smaller parking spots. Make it inconvenient to use them (which is already case in European cities).<p>So answer me - what is your fetish with SUVs in particular and why you dance around fact that there are ton of other more dangerous vehicles on the road?<p>p.s. again your second links are irrelevant again - one is tiny sample size, other is about trucks.')
