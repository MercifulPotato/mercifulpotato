You can only influence them to change. I believe that is just as true of children as any other human.<p>By doing the activity yourself, you expose the child to it, and they may decide to take part. Over time, they will almost certainly take interest. That doesn&#x27;t mean you read a book one day and get frustrated because they are playing video games.
