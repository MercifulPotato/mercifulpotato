My comment from last time:<p>Not sure I fully understand this one, perhaps I missed it in the white paper.\nThe more traditional method of this is the investors fund the project and then the benefitting company pays the investors a portion of what they would have been paying the utility companies if it hadn&#x27;t been for the upgrad project. It&#x27;s not clear to me if that actually takes place in the Efforce method, does the benefitting company have to buy tokens to pay the investors?<p>Also, if all savings are calculated based on meter readings sent &quot;directly&quot; to the chain, how do you account for changes in energy requirements due to upsizing or downsizing or any other change not covered by the contract? A mechanism for this would seem to require a method of putting a thumb on the scale, and if that&#x27;s he case then why use the token instead of the more traditional method.')
