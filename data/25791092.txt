They&#x27;re &quot;a handful of cities with insane local economic conditions&quot; specific.<p>Homelessness is not a rampant problem except on the west coast.  Yes big cities have homeless populations but they mostly cycle into various shelters (often church run) where the ones that don&#x27;t have serious mental issues get their lives back on track. It&#x27;s not rampant like it is on the west coast.<p>Spend a few years riding the MTA, T or Metro and then compare to BART if you don&#x27;t believe me.<p>California can kind of make the &quot;hospitable climate&quot; excuse but even rainy Seattle is just carped bombed with tents.  Places like DC and Miami are not exactly known for exemplifying effective social services yet somehow they manage to have much less of a problem than the west coast.')
