Working &quot;hard&quot; means being busy, typically more than 8 hours a day. Example: answering mails, writing some sort of report, dealing with customers, driving a truck, sitting at a cash register all day. Working &quot;deep&quot; means being extremely focused on a challenging thing until it is done. This can be writing code, but also theoretical writing or building something with your hands, even repairing something. After a &quot;hard&quot; day, I am completely exhausted and my mind is blank. After a &quot;deep&quot; day, I am satisfied and euphoric.')
