Given that OpenJDK already had AArch64 support (e.g. through years of Linux AArch64 support, but also OpenJDK for iOS) and macOS support, I would bet that it is mostly a matter of making the build infrastructure aware of the macOS + AArch64 combo. It&#x27;s not like JIT, AOT, etc. need full new ports to Apple Silicon (in fact, the Azul builds were available pretty much immediately after the release of M1).')
