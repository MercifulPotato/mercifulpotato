Item(by='cxr', descendants=None, kids=[25070199], score=None, time=1605190845, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25069469, text='&gt; One concern is your pricing seems too reasonable (free)!<p>Is that reasonable?  Building anything on top of obvious loss leaders is risky.  And the costs here for a year of service are either $0 on the free plan or $420 for the cheapest paid plan.  There&#x27;s a chasm of difference there.<p>I can&#x27;t understand people offering platforms and services with a pitch that tries to describe what sets $THING apart from others, but when it comes to pricing, they settle for looking around at what everyone else is doing and copying that—which usually results in offering a free tier and paid plans usually starting at $5–9+ per month.  Chances are, what you&#x27;re selling probably isn&#x27;t as unique as you think it is (this post mentions Netlify several times, for example, but Netlify doesn&#x27;t only do static hosting―you can run microservices with Netlify, too, and Netlify&#x27;s paid plan is cheaper).<p>More businesses could and should differentiate themselves in their pricing model, because the door is wide open and pretty much nobody else is showing interest in taking advantage of the opportunity.')
