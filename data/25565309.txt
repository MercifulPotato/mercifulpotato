Durable backup media for consumers is still a holy grail as I understand. M-DISC didn&#x27;t hold up to their 1000 year lifetime promise. Archival-grade DVD&#x27;s are also not good enough as I understand. Syylex went bankrupt. I want a consumer-grade backup medium that can provide at least a 100 years of lifetime.<p>That said, I was able to recover 90% of the voice recordings my father made between 1959-1963 on reel-to-reel tapes 60 years later. Tape can be very durable but what I recovered was analog voice very tolerant of errors. I&#x27;m not so sure about gigabytes snuck into an inch-square.')
