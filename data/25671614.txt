For new entrants they need to be popular before they can be better, which is a catch-22. Additionally Google has significant revenue which is very profitable because of it&#x27;s monopoly position, and it can use this to reinvest in search technology to further widen the gap. It&#x27;s going to take more than 2 people in a garage to beat modern Google at search!<p>* For a social network, Facebook buy out any potential competition when it&#x27;s gaining traction to further solidify their monopoly.
