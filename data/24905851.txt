A long time ago I played with the idea of replicating rproxy (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rproxy.samba.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rproxy.samba.org&#x2F;</a>), which was just a cool idea. The results are here (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rproxy.samba.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rproxy.samba.org&#x2F;</a>) but are very very basic, it was just a toy.
