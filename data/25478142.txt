Consumption, in the sense of irreversibly using a one-time resource, is sort of relevant. Once I have consumed food, I cannot re-consume it (in it&#x27;s original form). Using this meaning, however, I &#x27;use&#x27; rather than &#x27;consume&#x27; a physical book or other format where I have a physical copy of the data (e.g. in the form of a non-rented DVD or similar).')
