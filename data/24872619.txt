NMR is one of the worst- my PhD is in NMR structural biology.  NMR gives you some dynamics information, but it&#x27;s not great, hard to deconvolve and it&#x27;s limited to very small molecules.  of all the techniques, cryo is probably the best right now in terms of ease of sample prep and utility of data, but my point is much more that we don&#x27;t even really need to know the structure of many things to make useful progress- fluorescence microscopy is far easier than any structural biology technique and provides far more useful signal.')
