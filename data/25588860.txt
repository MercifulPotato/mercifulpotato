The equation isn&#x27;t as simple as &quot;less lockdowns == less suicides&quot;. If the pandemic rages even worse, there are a ton of second order effects that could also trigger increasing suicide rates. Family members or friends dying to COVID, getting long term COVID complications yourself, just the emotional stress of hearing about so many deaths, economic impact.<p>How do we know that there would have been less suicide if there had been no lockdowns? We don&#x27;t, and expressing it just as a trolley problem is an oversimplification.')
