If you&#x27;re trying to understand some code written in Gratuitous Object Astronautics style, it&#x27;s almost universally assumed you&#x27;re fully aware of why the product contains hammer factory factory factories, how factories work, and how get an actual hammer to swing.<p>The Gratuitous Object Astronautics culture is so accustomed to all the nonfunctional boilerplate that skilled, self-gratifying, astronauts never need to document their cleverness.
