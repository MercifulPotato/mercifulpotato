(Edit: at the same or nearly the same 95% rate)<p>I can’t see a human trial being able to show this, and contact tracing is overall so poor how long will we have to wait to <i>not</i> see a case that can be tracked back to a vaccinated individual before we are willing to agree that the vaccine is highly effective at stopping transmission?<p>For example, by Feb 1 we will have millions of people who are effectively protected at least from symptoms due to vaccine. So e.g. by March 1, if we have no, or single digit, reported cases of 2-week post-jab transmission?<p>The corollary is how durable is the effect?<p>To fully reopen the economy you need some kind of consensus on where the truth lies to these two questions.<p>I wonder if public health agencies will never really admit, but just the case count will start to dwindle and mitigations will start to lessen, without ever really coming out and admitting vaccinated people don’t need mitigations 2-weeks-post-jab.<p>Similar to how we’ve never really admitted that people who’ve had COVID are immune and can no longer spread it.<p>I think fundamentally gov’t is too afraid of having two classes of citizens, and mainly, that one class (the antibody negative class) lying that they are actually the other.')
