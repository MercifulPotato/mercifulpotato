You should take them seriously because the markets reflect the thoughts of hundreds of thousands of people who&#x27;s salary depends on trying to find out what the future looks like. Not sure what would be a better indicator of whether news is significant or not.<p>Now of course what is good for top companies may not be good for individuals, so you can&#x27;t just say that a stock price increase means people&#x27;s lives are going to be better.
