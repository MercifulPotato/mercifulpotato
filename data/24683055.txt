For USA it was the worldwide surveillance system, but for Europe it may be something else, like ITER (but on a bigger scale) or micropayments system (I don&#x27;t know if it would be big enough). That grand project needs to be useful and reachable, though. One thing I&#x27;m certain about is that VC-style micro investments into micro projects with micro objectives will bring only micro results.')
