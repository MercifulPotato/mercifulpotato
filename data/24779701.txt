IMO #3 is not doable for a typical programmer, and certainly isn&#x27;t trivial even for people that are experts (at least for a relatively complicated pair of algorithms like AES and GCM). So even though #3 is just one more thing that can go wrong, it&#x27;s <i>way</i> more likely to be a problem than #2')
