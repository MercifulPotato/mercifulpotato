Technology is not magic. Time is not a salve that solves all issues.<p>You say that my view is &quot;painfully anthropocentric&quot;, but how?<p>It seems your only response is &quot;but aliens&quot;. That is not good enough.<p>You want to say that it is foolish of me to try and guess their intentions and capabilities, but that&#x27;s what the paradox does as well. It assumes their intentions are to colonize and their capabilities allow it. With no proof. The only life we have to base anything off of is right here.<p>And if you think I haven&#x27;t identified a single valid criticism of the Fermi paradox, then I&#x27;m just going to assume you aren&#x27;t aware of the criticisms.<p>I&#x27;ve basically touched on this one <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fermi_paradox#Economic_explanations" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fermi_paradox#Economic_explana...</a><p>So no, I&#x27;m not saying that just because it can&#x27;t be done now, it can&#x27;t be done ever. I&#x27;m saying the Fermi Paradox is basically saying &quot;Once you solve these incredibly hard problems, this becomes easy.&quot;<p>I think the Fermi Paradox is phrased wrong. It should state that if it were possible to colonize the galaxy, it would have been done by now.')
