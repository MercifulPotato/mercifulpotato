We have a whole bunch of people shot by cops, a few looters shot by store owners, people shot in unrelated murders that happened near protests, people run over by cars that drove into crowds, some people shot when groups of armed racists started gunfights with groups of armed antiracists, etc.<p>This list does not at all support the thesis that organized BLM protests were intentionally violent.<p>* * *<p>Yeah, there was a time that a group of white BLM sympathizers heckled another white BLM sympathizer who was eating at a restaurant table on the sidewalk, and the heckling was caught on video. The people involved are obnoxious jerks (organizers and most others in the BLM movement also agree they are jerks).<p>Similar heckling by all sorts of groups of jerks happens all over the country on a regular basis. For example a bunch of MAGA folks were following and heckling Lindsay Graham at an airport a few days ago.<p>But you really think heckling at a restaurant should be compared to an armed mob breaking into the Capitol building, chanting for the Vice President&#x27;s execution and for the overthrow of the US government, beating cops to death, ransacking offices, stealing sensitive national security materials, and literally shitting all over?')
