There are a <i>lot</i> of translations of the Nicomachean Ethics and they are not all equal. They range from very good translations, to idiosyncratic readings of the text, to flat out bad translations.<p>Beyond poor translations, the ancients that you&#x27;ve recommended are good to start with and the recommendation to read the primary sources of them is just fine. Those texts are easy to digest without having a formal background in philosophy.<p>But for other philosophers (e.g. Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Hegel), telling someone to just &quot;pick up one of their primary texts&quot; is a disaster. It will either (a.) be complete gibberish to the reader without any context and they may just give up, or worse, (b.) they think they&#x27;ll understand something without the proper context and spew nonsense in regards to that philosopher (this is why there are <i>so</i> many bad readings of Nietzsche).<p>So depending on what you&#x27;re recommending, primary sources can be good, but in my experience, primary sources aren&#x27;t good most of the time. Moreover, if someone is interested in a specific field like the OP is, then having a good secondary source can be extremely helpful to give someone an overview and proper understanding of the topic.')
