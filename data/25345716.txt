The PAC has a lot of season ticket holders, and Glass&#x27; music triggered an older attendee to march to the front of the auditorium and yell, &quot;this isn&#x27;t music&quot;. He was quickly ushered out by his wife, but Glass was noticeably smirking, and the whole thing really added to the avant garde vibe of the performance. Amazing concert BTW. One of my favorite artists.')
