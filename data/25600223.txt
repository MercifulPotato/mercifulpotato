Before this car, I drove a BMW 328i for 20 years. I loved the BMW dearly.<p>The Model 3 is better in every way. Crisper handling, punchier acceleration, and quiet. The electric part is wondrous: No gas stations. Electricity costs me 1&#x2F;3 what the same miles on gas would cost.<p>Maintenance? Literally 2 sets of tires.<p>The battery? I bought the extended range with 310 miles. Tesla upgraded me, free over the air, to 325 miles after about a year of owning the car. 65,000 miles in and it still holds a charge good for 305 miles.<p>I find the car itself to be transformative.')
