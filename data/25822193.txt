I&#x27;m not a native speaker and not certain at this moment if the figure of &quot;hamster wheel&quot; exists in English. But &quot;rat race&quot;  does, as well as &quot;cog in the wheel&quot;. \nThere is a certain underlying trait of self-optimizing anything, also visible in the HN articles title itself (fortunately not so much the content) as well as in many other articles of this kind, coming up here continously. And these optimization considerations are &gt;95% limited to time, they are much closer to self-exploitation than anything else.<p>Cooking for the moment aside, consider lunch. I&#x27;m German (sadly, the country became closer to the US in this respect). But if you ever worked in France or Switzerland  for example (not to talk about countries even further into the South), you will spot much a difference here - yet in time spent, but also in the opinion what is important at all. Cooking is the same  - it is not all &quot;hungry family&quot; (I certainly agree, at times it is), these are more often than not rationalizations. When I am cooking, the kitchen full of people is the most satisfying situation. It doesn&#x27;t matter really, how long it lasts. This is not lost time, on the contrary! Also not in the context of work, because it eventually produces energy (I don&#x27;t mean the calories) also for this.<p>A final small example: I have an Italian espresso machine here in my offices kitchen. Producing an espresso or cappuccino requires to do all steps manually: grinding beans, evaluating the pressure on the analog gauge, provisioning the milk, making foam from it, etc. - time-consuming! But it is a micro ritual, making my head free enough for handling some of the kinds of small problems, appearing during work. I could also buy something &#x27;modern&#x27;  using pads, maybe some sort of remote control, even a robot serving the final result to me (are there such things?). I certainly will never do this.')
