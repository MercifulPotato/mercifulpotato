Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25648486], score=None, time=1609868857, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25644902, text='&gt; Laundering implies transition from &quot;dirty&quot; to &quot;clean&quot;.<p>But this doesn&#x27;t really work directly with fiat anyway. If a million dollars suddenly appears in your bank account and the IRS wants to know where it came from, and your answer is &quot;I sold some Bitcoin&quot; their next question is where you got the Bitcoin.<p>Money laundering works with front companies. Your front company is e.g. an electronics retailer. Your foreign supplier is in on it. You transfer money to them for a truck full of televisions and game consoles, but when the truck comes, it has twice as many as you could ordinarily get for that amount of money because you paid for the rest under the table.<p>Then you sell the products and get clean money. It used to require a truck full of cash or diamonds going the other way, now it&#x27;s cryptocurrency. That&#x27;s what they&#x27;re complaining about. They used to be able to catch that truck crossing the border with a hundred thousand dollars in cash, now they can&#x27;t. But you can&#x27;t stop that by regulating exchanges or anything else that law abiding people are doing.<p>&gt; If every point of contact between cryptocurrency and a regulated entity requires full KYC, those illicit funds can be prevented from entering the regulated economy.<p>You can&#x27;t get there when cryptocurrency is used internationally. The foreign entity selling the criminal organization the televisions isn&#x27;t subject to KYC regulations in its own country. Or it is on paper but that country&#x27;s government is corrupt and looks the other way.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t actually solve the problem even if you managed to do that. Suppose the cryptocurrency of unspecified origin is prohibited from being used above board in the US. So then it isn&#x27;t worth as much. Great, then it can be acquired for a lower price; doesn&#x27;t impact its utility as a medium of exchange. And then the criminals still use it for that and the electronics wholesaler in Russia doesn&#x27;t really care that the cryptocurrency it receives can only be used in Russia because that&#x27;s where it is anyway.<p>All the regulations do is make things harder for people who follow the law.')
