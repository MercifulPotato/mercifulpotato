Noone cares if you enjoy programming or computers as long as you act relatively &#x27;normal&#x27;. It&#x27;s not that nerds care about intelligence more than popularity (trust me most aren&#x27;t) it&#x27;s just that the nerds have already lost the popularity race by being socially awkward individuals that can&#x27;t hold a conversation about any topics other than very specific subjects to save their life.<p>I&#x27;ve found nerds as a teenager to be one of the most judging, toxic group of people who actually care far more about popularity than anyone else at school. (How many other groups made lists of tables by popularity?)')
