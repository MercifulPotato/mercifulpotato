There are many tracks on a tape, and they snake back and forth from end to end on the wrap (so you don&#x27;t need to &quot;rewind&quot; when you get to the end of the tapeâ€”you just start reading back in the other direction). In newer tape drives, you physically can&#x27;t read all of the data at once because the tape head is only a fraction of the width of a single band: it physically moves (laterally) to position itself over the right data.')
