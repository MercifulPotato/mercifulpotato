Our loan was smaller than typical most probably, so we wind up paying about 30% less. But we were renting for $2k a month just 2 bedroom place. Would have been millions to buy that place too. Just getting to the point it&#x27;s stupid.<p>I don&#x27;t really know how we did it but we managed to get a decent place for under 700k, but average price is now about 1.1 million or something crazy. My sister has been looking and for what they want it&#x27;s all north of 900k and incredibly competitive. So, I&#x27;d imagine the loan on that would be quite a bit more, and 30% more expensive month to month might be realistic depending on your situation.<p>At one point we were on a single income when I was just starting my career and paying that high rent with a new born baby in the house. It was tough. I can&#x27;t imagine what it&#x27;s like in single income households with multiple kids. The math just doesn&#x27;t check out.<p>It&#x27;s definitely a great place to live if you can afford it though. Insulated from a lot of the worlds bullshit.')
