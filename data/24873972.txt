The demand for housing has sky rocketed for this winter as so many people want to work remote from here and enjoy the skiing. Local blue collar workers hate the skiiers because they are getting priced out of everything and their cost of living &amp; property taxes keep going up.<p>I have a small (~25ish person) software company based here and it&#x27;s going to be a challenge to recruit this winter (we&#x27;re hiring for senior devs) simply because it will be impossible for anyone to find housing here until the end of the ski season!')
