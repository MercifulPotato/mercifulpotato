Kudos to Microsoft for really getting open source lately<p>If they get open source so much it means not open sourcing what really matters is intentional. And quite frankly getting rid of patents, their litigiousness and data collection. But I&#x27;m asking too much and I would settle for them to just stop suffocating competitors, innovation and stop with vendor lock in. Same deal for their competitors.<p>Anything that really matters is just like the same old MS you know. DirectX, Office, Xbox, everything SaaS, IDE, compilers, debuggers, language servers, file formats, UI frameworks, UI patents, GitHub, Windows, Server, you&#x27;ll find examples in every area. Practices like buying or killing competitors like Vulkan related acquisitions. I get it they are a company and need to maximize profits, so it&#x27;s cool.<p>Microsoft has so many quality projects and good people working for them, it&#x27;s just so frustrating that it&#x27;s still like this. This will only get worse as the exploitative behavior and business models of their competitors like Google force their hand to do the same.')
