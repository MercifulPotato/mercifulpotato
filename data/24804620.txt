Partners are incentivized to bring in more business, which the associates (and the partner him&#x2F;herself) can bill against. I think partners are usually expected to bring in a certain amount of business to justify their profit share.<p>In a traditional software company, like a SaaS business, I don&#x27;t know how it would translate. A developer fixing bugs might be important for the business, but ultimately is hard to translate to the bottom line. It&#x27;s not like hiring a high level executive will have a guaranteed ROI in the same way.')
