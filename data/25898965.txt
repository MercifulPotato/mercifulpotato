And account for like 40% of the country that are not sure if the pandemic is real and&#x2F;or if the vaccine is designed to have Bill Gates track them. And the fact that kids can&#x27;t get it yet (and who knows when we will know), which would severely slow things down.<p>Right now we are production-constrained, and somewhat distribution constrained since every state is handling it differently.
