People can have racist experiences without meaning everyone is shitty or even that someone is likely to have a bad time.<p>Note this doesn’t mean people who are the subject of racism are racists. I read GP’s comment as meaning that making an overly broad statement that people in the Midwest are friendly to only whites is not accurate or useful.')
