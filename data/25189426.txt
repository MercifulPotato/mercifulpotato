That would capture all water usage, which is not helpful when you&#x27;re trying to take specific action based on water usage in a specific room. No point turning on the wrong bathroom&#x27;s fan, or turning it on when you do laundry.<p>2. Presumably if you&#x27;re ventilating the bathroom for odor control, you wish to ventilate it long before the toilet in question is actually consuming water, since it only does that at the end.<p>Ideally if you&#x27;re trying to turn the fan on during toilet usage, you&#x27;d want a way to detect that the toilet is in use long before said toilet is using water. Presumably motion would be sufficient, although I guess one could detect weight on the toilet somehow.')
