How invisible do the newest Playstation&#x2F;Xbox&#x2F;Switch (pro) controllers feel in your hands now?<p>VR can be immersive, but in the real world outside the goggles you&#x27;re not yet transparently &#x2F; invisibly integrated into the physical things you&#x27;re near. So you kinda don&#x27;t yet trust it, and some of the cables pull you out of the experience, and things are heavy etc.<p>When VR can live-integrate the world around you transparently into your virtual world, and the problems with things that pull you out of that subconscious human-tool melding are fixed, then I think there&#x27;s going to be some really epochal things happening.<p>Until then AR seems to approach that integration moat from the other side and already looks to be making its way into everyday use.')
