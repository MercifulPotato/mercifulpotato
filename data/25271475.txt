The project relies on ASM&#x2F;C&#x2F;C++ to boot into a microkernel and to interpret and run the C#. But I suppose it would greatly reduce the attack surface of C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;ASM code.<p>I just wonder, for example, how a capable hardware abstraction layer would work in C#, interrupt handling, CPU and IO scheduling, etc.')
