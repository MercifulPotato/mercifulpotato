Did not run any benchmarks, so this is subjective and anecdotal.<p>Perceived performance in light use (browsing, content consumption, light Web development) feels roughly the same, though I may be holding the M1 machine to a slightly higher standard. Memory usage as reported by iPulse hovers around 60% on the former and 40% on the latter.<p>Battery life of the former beats the latter (from memory, that Intel machine was never really able to sustain more than 5-6 hours of use).')
