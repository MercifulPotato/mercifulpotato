I don&#x27;t really follow the logic - if I was interested in privacy I would probably avoid Microsoft just as much as Google.<p>And Microsoft working on Chromium&#x2F;Blink just gives more credibility to it being an OSS project - they&#x27;ve made substantial contributions and probably have a team working on it - if Google decides to close off the development - Microsoft has the resources to continue development.')
