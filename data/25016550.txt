But that&#x27;s a big aspect of the argument, at least for me - lots of things are immoral, many of which are legal.<p>It is entirely possible to concede the point and still, for either public health or cost reasons, want to stop doing destructive, expensive things that don&#x27;t actually reduce drug use, decrease property crime or violence, or dampen business for the cartels. (My views are different, just saying these are logical views people hold.)')
