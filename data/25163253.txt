The key thing is that he counts things like instruction formats, addressing modes, memory ops per instruction, registers, and so on. There is a clear separation in the numbers between the RISCs and the CISCs.<p>What stuck out to me when I first read it 25 years ago is that the ARM is the least RISCy RISC, and x86 is the least CISCy CISC. At that time the Pentium was killing the 68060 and many of the RISCs, and it seemed clear that x86 had a big advantage in the relatively small number of memory ops per instruction.')
