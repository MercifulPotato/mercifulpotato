Item(by='PaulDavisThe1st', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611001758, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25820203, text='&gt; The best idea, though, is to attack the problem at its roots. The littering of space is an example of the “tragedy of the commons”, in which no charge is made for the use of a resource that is owned collectively.<p>Garrett Hardin&#x27;s article which created and promoted the &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; doesn&#x27;t describe historical &quot;commons&quot; at all, which were all managed over extended periods of time by complex rules and social norms. The &quot;tragedies&quot; happened primarily when capitalism emerged and demanded an end to the historical management of commons, allowing the interests of capital to destroy them.<p>Space might actually be the first really good example of &quot;the tragedy of the commons&quot; inasmuch as it was a new, globally accessible (i.e. not geographically determined) resource which began to be used without any establishment of the usual norms and rules that accompanied historical commons. Something similar presumably happened with the oceans, but their physical nature (i.e. stuff sinks, and stuff moves) hasn&#x27;t created an issue in the same way that is now happening in orbit.')
