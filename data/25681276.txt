I believe all of those things, too. Guess what: I also believe that flyover Americans deserve a shot at the world their forefathers were working toward. Wedges have been put into place to make it difficult to hold a position like this politically; who represents me?<p>&gt; Seems like an easy wedge to exploit if you were a hostile country looking to conduct psyops on America.<p>Which country is that, and why make the assumption that it comes from outside your own borders?<p>&gt; Did you consider the wider security implications of half the country no longer believing in fair elections?<p>Seems like this is a mandate to produce a more secure election. Shouldn&#x27;t that make both sides happier? Isn&#x27;t it possible to believe that the election systems are rife with opportunities for fraud and miscounts?
