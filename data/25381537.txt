Can someone with a better understanding of chip design explain to me:<p>1&#x2F; What specific design choices make the M1 so much better than the equivalent intel chips ? It looks like there are a bunch of changes -- 5nm silicon, single memory pool, a combination of high efficiency and high power cores. Can someone explain to me how each of these changes helps apple achieve the gains it did ? Are these breakthrough architectural changes in chip design or have these been discussed before?<p>2&#x2F; How did apple manage to create this when intel has been making chips for decades and that is the singular focus of the company ?  Is it the fact that Mac OS could be better optimized for the M1 chips ? Given the design changes that doesn&#x27;t seem like the only reason.')
