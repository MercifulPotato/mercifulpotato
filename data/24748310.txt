I&#x27;m not seeing this in your sources. Watts isn&#x27;t a measurement of storage, storage is measured in watt-hours.<p>To put the mismatch between available storage and required storage in perspective, the US consumes 11.5TWh of electricity daily on average. We have ~25GWh of storage currently. Most of that is in hydroelectric storage, which is geographically limited. Less than a gigawatt is in battery storage. This works out to a few minutes of storage - and a matter of seconds of battery storage.')
