The goal is to change the industry slowly. You don&#x27;t change industry by killing them quickly so these things are first made into law, then there is usually a number of warnings, then the fines starts showing up small and then the gets ramped up if the industry doesn&#x27;t change.<p>These dark patterns we keep seeing shows that the sites didn&#x27;t do their homework and is trying the usual weazel way of getting past on &quot;you clicked accept so now you are stuck.&quot;. Consent can only be given knowingly, if you hide it in the fineprint (or behind a &quot;show more&quot; button) it&#x27;s not valid according to GDPR. To invent things like selling customer data to third party and call it fair usage of private data is not ok either.<p>The agreement has to be easy to understand and very short. And it has to be presented close to the actual entering of data or the accept button. No hiding, no shenanigans, no trying to fool with colors or design. It&#x27;s that simple.')
