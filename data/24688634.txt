It used to be a two-way street, now it&#x27;s a one-way with a two-way bike lane taking up the rest.<p>People I work with argued that it was a bad idea because the restaurants would lose business because now there is less parking, and it just blows my mind that not being able to park directly in front of a restaurant is a deal breaker. Isn&#x27;t the whole appeal of a city&#x27;s downtown area to walk around a bit and look up at all the skyscrapers?')
