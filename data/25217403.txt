However it still doesn&#x27;t address three key factors:<p>* Everyone hates ads. You can try to shove it down their throats anyway by being a monopoly, but eventually this won&#x27;t work anymore, since there is too much competition that doesn&#x27;t rely on ad revenue and too many companies trying to block ads.<p>* Google doesn&#x27;t have a solid revenue stream besides ads. And it&#x27;s unclear how they are gonna get one. At least not in the magnitude they need to survive.<p>* Google faces strong competition on all fronts and all of them, except perhaps Facebook, don&#x27;t count ad revenue as primary source of income. This puts Google at a substantial disadvantage, amplified by the first point: EVERYONE freakin hates ads')
