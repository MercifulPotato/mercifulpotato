They have absurd limitations that you only realize once you&#x27;re in too deep. For whatever reason, for example, nudity is banned even in private groups on FB, so several photography groups I know are trying to go back to forums and blogs, but can&#x27;t migrate their content, nor get most people to cooperate, so many of them are juggling multiple FB accounts because they keep getting temp-banned (and I&#x27;m not talking porn here - these are actual photographers that are regularly featured in big galleries).<p>There was also a game dev group that died out because FB kept flagging their users for spam. Turns out posting executables makes it think you&#x27;re spamming viruses, even though it&#x27;s just a gane prototype you want feedback on.<p>Finally, the quality of discussion is worse no matter what the content is, as FB forces the post&gt;comments relationship, with comments being way less visible and usable than a top-level post.<p>And this isn&#x27;t just one grumpy programmer screaming into the void - I only know about that because friends and relatives (from young to quite old) keep complaining to me and asking me for workaround to these limitations. Of course, the answer &quot;just use something other than FB&quot; is rarely accepted.')
