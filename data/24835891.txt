I still remember e.g. the case of &quot;Held Der Steine&quot;, a fantastic guy who&#x27;s the most popular Lego Youtuber in Germany, where Lego thought it would be a great idea to send him a &quot;Cease and Desist&quot; letter because part of his logo vaguely resembled a Lego brick. He wasn&#x27;t amused and with his enormous reach (millions of people watch his videos) he made sure a lot of people learned about this greedy behavior of the Lego company.')
