I don’t know specifically what type, but I suspect the inrush current is quite low.  It also <i>outputs</i> considerably more power than most brushed motors can probably manage for any length of time.)<p>edit: The product blurb says it’s an induction motor. The nameplate says 1000W.  It would be fairly straightforward to estimate the efficiency by blending a known amount of water and measuring the temperature change over some period of time.')
