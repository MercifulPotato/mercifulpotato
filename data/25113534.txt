Space Time episodes are short (typically 10 minutes or less), so this makes a great thing to watch when you have a little time to kill.<p>If you want to play around with time dilation and length contraction in special relativity, I wrote a web-based calculator to help with that [2].<p>You can enter the relative velocity of two aligned frames that are moving along each other&#x27;s x axis, and it gives you a series of rows representing events. The frames are called &quot;your frame&quot; and &quot;their frame&quot;.<p>Each row has 4 numbers, x and t of the event in your frame, and x and t of the same event in their frame. When you enter any two of those numbers, it updates the other two.<p>For example, you could enter x = 3 in your frame, t = 5 in their frame, and it will update t in your frame and x in their frame so that x and t in your frame and x and t in their frame refer to the same event.<p>The README gives an example of how you could use this to figure out the famous ladder paradox.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;show&#x2F;pbs-space-time&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;show&#x2F;pbs-space-time&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tzs&#x2F;Physics-special-relativity-calculator" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tzs&#x2F;Physics-special-relativity-calculator</a>')
