It can be as easy as open the pack, identify and replace bad cells, manually balance charge the cells (one at a time),  tape the pack back together.  It&#x27;s a bit janky, because the plastic cases are sonic welded and you have to butcher them a bit to get them open and then glue or tape them back together, but it can be difficult to locate batteries for old laptops and I don&#x27;t want to spend money.')
