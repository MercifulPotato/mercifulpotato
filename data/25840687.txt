Item(by='intended', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611100563, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25838581, text='&gt; almost like people forgot their was a an upvote and downvote button<p>They forgot this within a few <i>weeks</i> of seeing rule breaking behavior.<p>I recently went through some old logs and discussions from 7&#x2F;8 years ago. People actually talked about how important it was to upvote content and follow rediquette.<p>That discussion died because you have to enforce rediquette and the &quot;honor code&quot; fails when people see that abusing the code goes unpunished. This means that upvote downvote become like&#x2F;dislike.<p>This logically implies that if you want to make upvotes work, then you need to <i>really</i> prune your community for rule compliance. My favored example of this is badecon.<p>------------------------<p>The other issue really fascinating issue is how automation results in better filter bubbles.<p>Before automod, people couldn&#x27;t ban alt accounts fast enough. Ban bigot_1, and 10 minutes later you would have bigot_2. Until automation, banning was a fools errand.<p>Later, bots could target words, so now your regexes would stop variations of N*er and other coded hate speech - which also meant that you could stop users from using the names of alternate subs.<p>Now this may be a great thing. You ban bigot_2 and he can&#x27;t speak anymore so he goes to create his own sub, where they say they will be a free speech zone (and vehemently downvote opposing ideas).<p>Of course, these bastions also use the same tools, and they maintain their ideological purity.<p>Leading to the final conclusion - that moderation is innately a question of morals and ethical leadership. Not of technological design.')
