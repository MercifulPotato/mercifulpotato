E.g. &quot;save&quot; 保 consists of a man, a mouth, and a tree. It&#x27;s about as easy to make sense of as a combination of a square with a cut corner and a rectangle inside it.<p>Interesting example. It&#x27;s worth pointing out here that most characters are not composed entirely of meaning-indicating components; there is e.g. a whole series of compounds of 青 which use it solely to indicate the pronunciation of the compound, not to claim that invitations (请) are somehow metaphysically green (青).<p>But 保 is an exception! Going by wiktionary, it originates as a compound of 人 and 子, both used for the meaning -- protecting is what people do with babies. (Interestingly, the character 仔 exists independently today.) Evolution of the component on the right into 呆 was purely based on shape, and transformed the original meaningful component into something completely arbitrary -- there was no point at which 口 and 木 (as separate from 呆) were conceptually part of the character.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wiktionary.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;%E4%BF%9D" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wiktionary.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;%E4%BF%9D</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zdic.net&#x2F;hans&#x2F;%E4%BF%9D" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zdic.net&#x2F;hans&#x2F;%E4%BF%9D</a>')
