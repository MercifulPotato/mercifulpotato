No one can stand that right? In fact, no one should put his data solely on a hosted platform out of his control, worrying one day even not being able to access it just because he’s not one of them who controls. You can social interact, share, collaborate on such platform like GitHub, but I think it’s completely logical and understandable trying to protect your data by building your own platform or storage no? Or should Github, or the US dominate all code hosting?')
