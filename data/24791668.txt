Also, that I will accept Google will track every move and shake of mine and show me ads based on that data (assuming just Google gets to do it; I&#x27;d buy a stock Android phone).<p>But when iPhone 12 was released and I saw the mini is perfectly sized for my palms. I was almost salivating. Even though I find iPhones horrendously expansive. Yes, I do. Except maybe for an SE. Just to make it sound fair, I find most of the expansive flagship Android phones expansive as well. So anyway, I almost did a full 180 and was about to think about buying the new iPhone. But then the enthusiasm started to wane. I saw that there&#x27;s no touch id, jack was gone anyway, battery life has always been lacklustre, and that there&#x27;s no way I can silence just one of the dual sims and keep another on separate notification settings (just something I want&#x2F;need). But I was still deciding.<p>What really hit me hard, in last few weeks, is that Apple has consistently been exploiting customers, more with every release - every move. Blatantly at that. Sometimes in the name of privacy on a completely closed OS and apps, in fact a completely closed ecosystem. Strips devices of useful and convenient hardware features and components. Then very sadistically and successfully patches the voids with &quot;innovation&quot; stickers. Even worse - marks the move as &quot;environment friendly&quot;. Headphone jack, earphone and chargers - all gone. Strong arms developers (small and big alike), tries to run repair shops out of business, ensures its devices are less and less repairable - by making it physically difficult and lobbying as well, stifles free speech - literally and doesn&#x27;t even try to be subtle about it, hands over keys of the kingdom to the authoritarian regimes with far reaches, CEO hobnobs with heads of states of questionable (or actually very obvious) records.<p>We still buy their devices. Enthusiastically. In fact we become such apt apologists that it must be painful for anyone else to read the reactions to criticism. There were plenty of such comments, right here; just from the iPhone 12 release day, which read something like, &quot;Oh, once I started using Bluetooth Headphones and never looked back&quot;. Innocuous looking, just a satisfied customer feeling grateful, apologetic comments like these are worst in such contexts.<p>Anyway, then I spent few hours researching a ~5 inch phone with stock Android phone for the nth time yesterday and I didn&#x27;t find one. The closest, Pixel 4a, has a plastic body. I really do not think I am buying any other Apple device ever (or for the foreseeable future) and I am glad I&#x27;ve not bought into their services. iMessage is useless here anyway.<p>My whims and fancy kinda have stopped seeing Apple as the lesser of the two evils (wrt mobile platforms), or so it seems as of now.')
