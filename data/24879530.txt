It is not a way to visualize atoms or molecules that you might be familiar with from chemistry if this is what you meant.<p>The following comparison might be flawed but imagine like it an overview sheet for screws [0].\nOne type is listed with philips head, one with torx, one type might have a thread with this angle and that pitch, the threads being right-handed or left-handed ...<p>You can then look at this sheet, see the different screws and tell which one you e.g. might replace with another, depending on the tools or requirements you have. It is not blueprint for any particular object, though.<p>To go back to the article: because of the similarity of their properties, you could substitute an electron with a muon for example.
