Over video makes it harder when network connection isnâ€™t great, and more people speak, so mostly difficult yeah.<p>Flashes &#x2F; vibration are common alerts yes. I prefer flash since you might not touch the surface that vibrates.<p>And yes one-handed sign over video is very frequent but maybe best for 1-1 or familiar groups because indeed you can lose a bit in precision&#x2F;fluidity. If you want to be accessible over video, find a stable place and sign with dark colored shirt so contrast is better ;)')
