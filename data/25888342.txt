Crowded and dirty as it is, taking the subway was a constant reminder for me that there is life outside of my confined world and that alone contributed a lot to my sanity.<p>In the smaller city, I took buses or walked, but I noticed taking a bus still makes a difference, even though one might have to stand up a little. Just the idea of being surrounded by people, each with their own untold stories and problems, made me feel part of something bigger. I agree with the OP; commuting actually helped me feel like I belong to a community, even though I&#x27;m introverted and would never talk to any of the people that I would see.<p>Now with the pandemic on top of it, depression has kicked in. I sometimes play youtube videos with city&#x2F;car&#x2F;library... ambient sounds, just to get that feeling again. It does help a bit, but I can&#x27;t wait for things to get back to &quot;normal&quot;, whatever that means from now on.')
