I would argue that the person who wrote this Twitter thread really quickly veers off into the territory of just-plain-wrong. What&#x27;s more likely,<p>- Citadel is paying multiple billions to get in on a firm that&#x27;s so talented that they managed to take on this GME position, or<p>- Citadel is a market maker that has written a shitload of near-naked call options and now needs to deliver on them?<p>HFT is not the root of all evil. Citadel isn&#x27;t making a killing off of frontrunning retail investors that have a Robinhood account containing $137.
