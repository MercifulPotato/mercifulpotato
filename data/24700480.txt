Ironically, the agency has been working to make Android more secure.<p>AND<p>&gt;It is just as preposterous to think that the best way to gain access to any operating system is to publicly announce that you are contributing to the OS, and make the tainted code accessible to anyone with an interest in it.<p>So it was NOT Snowden, but NSA itself.<p>Second Article about Coreboot:<p>&gt;Myers published a paper about STM last year on how NSA’s STM implementation could work. All Coreboot code, including all the STM contributions from the NSA, are open source, so anyone could verify that there is no backdoor in there -- in theory.')
