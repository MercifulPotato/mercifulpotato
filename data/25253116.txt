Food seems to be a powerful bonding agent for many people. My neighbor invites me over for Chinese Moon Festival with mooncakes I&#x27;ve never had before, I invite him over to my hunting lease to shoot some doves and fry them up with bacon. Substitute baba ganoush and BBQ, biryani and buffalo wings, pho and Philadelphia cheesesteak, menudo and Marzetti beef-and-pasta casserole, <i>etc.</i>, that&#x27;s why I love American street parties in multicultural neighborhoods, Americans by and large <i>love</i> sharing with each other at these events. Kids, similar parenting styles arising from similar aspirations and similar ideas on how to achieve those aspirations seem to be another powerful bonding agent.<p>But I do draw the line somewhere. Much as I love eating it, you can&#x27;t convince me anyone of any culture will ever be comfortable with their neighbors <i>making</i> stinky tofu in their backyard. I hear even the Chinese impose requirements upon those making stinky tofu to stay away from residential areas.')
