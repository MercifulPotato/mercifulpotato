We don&#x27;t know if these workers (or other workers) are pursuing this in court. Legal and illegal pursuit are not mutually exclusive, at all.<p>2. If the factory owner is not paying wages because they are already bankrupt, there is nothing that the legal system could reasonably do about that.<p>3. The workers would not have recourse to claim funds from Apple: I&#x27;m not aware that they would even in any country with a &quot;good&quot; legal system.<p>It strikes me as a long stretch to reach &quot;bad&#x2F;corrupt legal system&quot; as a conclusion.')
