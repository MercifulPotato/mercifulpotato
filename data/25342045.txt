The county should fire this dope. Government health officials need to be out there with a unified message that hits the main points:<p>1) Stay away from other people\n2) Wear a mask if forced to go out\n3) Go back home as soon as possible<p>This 15-point stream of words will only serve to confuse. The reason our kids are suffering from this year-long school outage is <i>because</i> our leadership is so confused. With unified, clear leadership we would have beat this thing in 6 weeks, tops. It is exactly this framing as a difficult moral wrestling match faced independently by millions of equals that has brought America to this depth of failure.')
