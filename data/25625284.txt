For example:<p>&gt; <i>After six years, her bosses at Penn were reportedly so frustrated by the lack of momentum that they cut her salary and demoted her.</i><p>Actually, she was denied tenure. At most universities, going up for tenure after 6 years is just part of the process, and it&#x27;s fairly common for people to be denied. It&#x27;s not like they singled her out.')
