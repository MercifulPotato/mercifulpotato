And Apple isn&#x27;t the only offender. All major manufacturers use terrible cooling systems, even on thick workstation class laptops. Their testing is seriously flawed, they design the heatsink for &quot;normal workload&quot; which means jack shit.<p>Everyone&#x27;s got different uses for their machines, so just test the heatsink at maximum load&#x2F;TDP for several hours at least, make sure it doesn&#x27;t overheat. Is that too much to ask?<p>And if you design your laptops to be thin and light, don&#x27;t shove a 6 core 45W processor in it... just don&#x27;t. It will perform slower than a 4 core 35W chip, so what&#x27;s the point? Having it on the spec sheet is not worth the negative feedback from buyers.<p>Apple went the other way with the M1, it doesn&#x27;t overheat because it just uses much less power, while having the same performance. Really impressive.<p>You can fix the overheating problem by buying some good thermal paste and applying it yourself and&#x2F;or by using software like Throttlestop to limit the maximum TDP (and even undervolt it to claw back some of that performance) and NotebookFanControl for the fans. Not sure if there are alternatives for the MacBook, though.')
