Item(by='pm215', descendants=None, kids=[24817900], score=None, time=1603023512, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24815630, text='Yeah, it&#x27;s useful to have a special-purpose &#x27;software breakpoint&#x27; instruction. Arm actually didn&#x27;t have one until v5 of the architecture, so some older systems or those wanting to maintain compatibility will still use an arbitrary undefined-instruction pattern. The advantage of an architecturally defined instruction rather than picking something invalid at random is (a) software can rely on future CPUs not deciding to use it for some actual feature (b) software can easily distinguish it from a random attempt to execute an illegal instruction and (c) it acts as a &quot;strong convention&quot; that pushes all software (OSes, debuggers, etc) towards using the same mechanism for setting a software breakpoint, which improves interoperability. In the Unix world the distinction is usually surfaced to the debugger as SIGTRAP vs SIGILL.')
