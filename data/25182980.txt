Its Reddit with a focus on anti-censorship. It was launched in 2019, so the community is not quite mature yet.<p>As you can probably guess, it is a truly hateful place.<p>Practically speaking it is essentially (from my observation) a safe space for racism, homophobia, anti-Semitism, covid denial, dangerous conspiracy theories, misinformation, etc.<p>I hesitate to bring attention to the site at all because I donâ€™t want the hate to proliferate, but I suppose it is better to know this exists rather than letting it incubate hate under the radar.<p>Edit: I also want to say I think anti-censorship is noble and Ruqqus, as a technology, is pretty well done. I think building a non-hateful community on Ruqqus would elevate it to be better than Reddit.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ruqqus&#x2F;ruqqus" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ruqqus&#x2F;ruqqus</a>')
