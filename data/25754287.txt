But I find myself in a conundrum; had this &quot;inciting&quot; speech taken place in the town square or a public park, much of it likely could not have been censored because it would have been protected by the 1st amendment and the last 100 years of case law. Where, then, is the town square and public park of 2021?<p>Despite the fact that the legal protections of public speech haven&#x27;t changed much in decades, the <i>practical</i> protections of public speech (as I discuss in greater detail in [1]) have indeed been eroded, because social media platforms and, apparently, web hosting and device makers are now the arbiters of the vast majority of speech. Free speech that only applies where virtually noone can hear you is a very limited free speech indeed.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25662466" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25662466</a>')
