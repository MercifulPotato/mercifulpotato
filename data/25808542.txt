In MySQL it&#x27;s common to name columns like user_name<p>2. In PHP you can use anything, but if you use camelCase, then  it might turn out:<p>$userName = $user-&gt;user_name (using ORM for example)<p>3. In Javascript if I choose to have camelCase, which is common too, it might turn out:<p>fullName = user.first_name + &#x27; &#x27; + user.last_name<p>So the mix of conventions is unavoidable which is irritating.<p>How to deal with that?')
