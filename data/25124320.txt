It would be much more interesting to replace IP, like Yggdrasil does (and I think gnunet, cjdns, hyperboria &amp; others).<p>If you IP is a cryptographic identifier:<p>* It cannot be forged<p>* Anyone can generate a new one on-demand<p>* Every packet is authenticated, every packet can be encrypted<p>* TLS becomes redundant<p>However, the DNS part remains a hard one. How to securely link to websites you have never seen? Pet names seem like a way to do so. Asking users to type IP addresses isn&#x27;t really an answer, I think, but I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a lot of &quot;basic&quot; users who type URLs in nowadays, they all seem to rely on google providing the right website anyway, or the web browser itself.<p>It&#x27;s not like DNS is also our single source of trust nowadays, but at least certificate providers are competent enough to make sure names are resolved correctly.<p>One option would be to make signed DNS records over a DHT: the root authority &quot;.&quot; signs &quot;com&quot;, &quot;net&quot;, etc, that sign &quot;ycombinator&quot;, etc. Publish to DHT, hash-indexed.<p>Of course, point-to-point connections have their weaknesses as well, it might be interesting to migrate to something like beaker browser (html on top of hypercore, formerly DAT, kind of like mutable torrents in a DHT). At the end of the day, the core issue is: migrating users is difficult if the benefits are not immediately obvious.<p>And yes, massively adopting anything else would litterally &quot;kill the old web&quot;, in the protocol sense. In the community or content sense? Not so sure.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yggdrasil-network.github.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yggdrasil-network.github.io&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gnunet.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gnunet.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cjdelisle&#x2F;cjdns&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cjdelisle&#x2F;cjdns&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beakerbrowser.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beakerbrowser.com&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hypercore-protocol.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hypercore-protocol.org&#x2F;</a>')
