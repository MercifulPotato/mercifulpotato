It happens all the time in other countries.<p>This was a &#x27;coup by mob&#x27; with obvious incitement (but not technically direct) by Trump &amp; Co.<p>&quot;The election is illegitimate&quot;<p>&quot;Mike Pence must stop the count&quot;<p>&quot;Everyone come to Washington and we will protest the count&quot;<p>&quot;Walk with me down Pennsylvania avenue&quot;<p>&quot;This is political combat, we need to fight and never give up&quot;<p>There are parallels to BLM, but the fundamental difference is the violent mob wanted to stop Pence from validating the election results, which is a very scary existential form of interference going right to the core of the Republic.<p>There are legal consequences to this: if Pence does not validate the vote, then in fundamentally calls into question the legitimacy of Biden.<p>If that transaction doesn&#x27;t take place, then &#x27;Who is President&#x27; in a few weeks is completely ambiguous.<p>How would SCOTUS rule?<p>And does it matter?<p>Trump is playing straight out of the &#x27;3rd World Despot Playbook&#x27; - this is pretty much how it goes down in the Congo.<p>This insurrection would have physically been deal with, surely, but it could very easily snowball into something much worse.<p>Revolutions to start with a starting gun, they build up to a crescendo, one event propagating to the next.<p>Consider this: during the insurrection, Trump was not calling for people to stand down, he was not coordinating with Pence, he was not calling in the National Guard - you know what he was doing? He was on the phone with members of Congress who were <i>on lockdown</i> the phone being passed among them while he pressured them to &#x27;stop the steal&#x27; and to thwart Mike Pence&#x27;s vote count.<p>If that isn&#x27;t straight up Treason what is?<p>What happened on Capitol Hill was not dangerous for the momentary bit of violence, it was dangerous because it&#x27;s a strike to the essential foundations of the Republic.<p>Finally - I don&#x27;t know what the RNC had to do with any of this, which is why I asked.')
