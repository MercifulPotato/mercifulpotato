I was learning LaTeX and my editor turned on ligatures for me (I think the vim-polyglot plugin was the culprit) and it was very frustrating.  Ligatures in an unfamiliar environment make it harder to follow guides and learn from the code that you&#x27;re reading.  Maybe it would be a lot easier if I was using it in my native language, but it just struck me as an abstraction and one more thing to learn and keep track of.')
