Germany wants to sell A LOT of expensive cars. But there is a problem: in most countries fast cars are illegal. So how to solve this problem? German carmakers tells about this problem to the German government. German government finds a solution: allow unlimited speed on German highways so we can make fast cars legal - at least in Germany. Now &quot;they make cars go so fast&quot; and they are legal - in Germany. Now rich people order fast, expensive cars - from Germany. Officially they will not drive them too fast in their countries. Buy everybody can imagine, what happens inofficially... they have enough money to pay for the penalties (with the exception of Finland and maybe some other countries, where penalties are percentage of your income).')
