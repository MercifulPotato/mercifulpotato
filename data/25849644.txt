Item(by='Udik', descendants=None, kids=[25853190], score=None, time=1611165824, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25847184, text='Trolling, at least in its original meaning, is not &quot;spreading misinformation&quot;. It&#x27;s saying things for the sake of provoking  anger in other people that you despise or you just don&#x27;t connect emotionally with. So it makes perfect sense to me for rightwing trolls to excite anger and confusion in leftwing people by appropriating a completely innocuous gesture and using it as a provocation. It doesn&#x27;t really have to mean anything or to capture or express your true beliefs- the important thing is just that others will go nuts over it.')
