Immediately following the airing there was so much shame that they launched a whole office  redesign and open office concept.  Nothing like some well deserved ribbing to shake things up!!!&quot;<p>&quot;The &quot;gray on gray&quot; quip led to an attempt to add color to some office buildings.  The open office redesign looked much better than the 80s and 90s cubicles, at least the one I saw in Santa Clara. Much more current, modern aesthetic, without walls.  I left the company a couple of years after that so not sure how well it took hold.  Friends who stayed said it didn&#x27;t work out too well but it&#x27;s been years since then (Conan did this bit in 2007).&quot;')
