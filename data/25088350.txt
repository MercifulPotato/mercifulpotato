In Quebec we got some private care home where 80% died of Covid. It only takes one to bring it.<p>&gt; Perhaps it’s the politicians and others who are being selfish by imposing their will and desires.<p>Their will and desires of what? Of saving lifes? Sure caring about someone&#x27;s else life is purely selfish, much more than wanting to spend time with others.<p>&gt;  it’s time we do a cost&#x2F;benefit analysis that considers all costs and complications beyond covid.<p>The US is the one that killed the most to avoid theses &quot;costs and complications&quot;. Was it worth it? Go see anyone that lost their grand parents because of this, many of them could have spend time with them today if it wasn&#x27;t because someone else was selfish.<p>If you got high risk relative that you want to see, buy them a webcam or keep them permanently in your home please. Keep the risk to yourself. If you care about them, please reduce your risk too, they deserve that &quot;cost and complication&quot;.')
