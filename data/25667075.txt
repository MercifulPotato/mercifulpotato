You can see how well the above compliments misinformation right?<p>Go ahead and read any religious text (I&#x27;ve read many!). Nearly every culture has one or many myths. Do you believe them to be fact? Or do you only believe <i>your</i> religious text to be true? And if so, why?<p>I don&#x27;t mean to take a stance against religion in general. I agree with the above commenter that the impact of religion in a general sense <i>does</i> seem to be positive! A shared mythos can be a very powerful way of building community. This can have very <i>real</i> positive affects on a population, and, depending on that mythos, on an individual. But to suggest that religion doesn&#x27;t require &quot;faith&quot; (i.e. believing in something despite no evidence) is... well... na√Øve.')
