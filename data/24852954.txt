Not sure what can be done.<p>Nothing. Any sufficiently complex system or body of knowledge is too large for any one person to understand. Does any physicist know ALL physics that was ever done? Does any one engineer know how to build a Ferrari?\nLet&#x27;s be honest, we take for granted <i>a lot</i> of stuff that we don&#x27;t fully understand, Linux is a major piece of infrastructure, it&#x27;s natural nobody can fully wrap their head around it.<p>&gt; Reading real programs is a part of learning computer science that should be emphasized more.<p>I had never thought of this in an educational sense, but I definitely agree. I sure wish I was taught more of that, toy problems get boring quickly.')
