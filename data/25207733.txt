Item(by='lowlevellimbo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606299941, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25202107, text='Jane Street has spent a lot of resources into making sure they&#x27;re well known as one of the &quot;top employers&quot;. Their recruiters put a lot of effort into pseudo-anonymously promoting the company on websites like reddit and blind. It&#x27;s pretty forward thinking actually as younger tech savvy candidates no longer pay attention to sites like glassdoor and seek information through these discussion forums. The natural evolution of fake glassdoor reviews is astroturfing I guess.<p>Firm performance is excellent but IMHO the only reason to work there as an engineer is for marginally more money.')
