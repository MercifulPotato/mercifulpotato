Or do they pass it off with &quot;you assert that you have the rights to print this content&quot;? I suspect something along those lines could work for this too. If the service can be &#x27;blind&#x27; to what is being collected (eg, all happens on the user&#x27;s device and the central printer just takes the collected file). Automated version of a local printshop that just prints whatever you give them.')
