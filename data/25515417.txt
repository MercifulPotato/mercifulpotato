I totally see the need for this as restaurants and alikes are struggling right now and any help they can get is certainly welcome.<p>Thinking of that, I have a very minor suggestion.<p>I was thinking that perhaps most restaurants that would need this because they can&#x27;t solve the problem themselves are the kind of place with low tech skills, including photography. Those places might not have pics of everything they serve, so they might prefer not to show pictures. And given the current times, they aren&#x27;t probably in the mood to spend extra cash.<p>Additionally where I&#x27;m from (Italy) it&#x27;s considered a very bad sign if a restaurant has pictures in the menu (it&#x27;s often a place for tourists -&gt; relatively low quality). It&#x27;s a cultural thing that I think is shared in many places in europe. Pics would be ok only in some very narrow situations.<p>All that just to say that perhaps you could also provide an example without pictures, with a text only polished menu.')
