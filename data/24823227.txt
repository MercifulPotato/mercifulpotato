To me the only advantages of headphones are (1) not disturbing people near you and (2) traveling.  For everything else I would use speakers!<p>The other things I don&#x27;t like are:<p>- the cable following me around, especially if I&#x27;m mobile (and that applies to ear buds too).<p>- the feeling of being cut off from sounds around me.<p>- Admittedly a niche complaint, but for music: I don&#x27;t like the stereo imaging of headphones.  Compared to good speakers, it&#x27;s an unnatural stereo field -- although I realize not everyone is sensitive to that.  Depends what you listen to as well.')
