Bit of a steep learning curve and a prerequisite that you understand networking, but cheap, reliable, feature packed.<p>Their WiFi APs are behind the curve (no mu-mimo even afaik), but you can just hook up some other wAP if you need the newer protocol features.<p>What I do is keep a Mikrotik router that does all the heavy stuff and hang wAPs off of it as needed. I especially love capsman for wAP management. They do have all-in-ones of course, just not my cup of tea.')
