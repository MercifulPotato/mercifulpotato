This isn’t about other countries doing things poorly, and more specifically Germany was not named by the parent commenter. This is about the US doing things significantly worse than basically any other developed country. I live in Germany, and know that the German healthcare system is not perfect, but I also know, as an American, that it is significantly better by essentially any metric than the US, and it’s unfair to pretend otherwise. I’m glad I don’t live in a society anymore in which I have to worry about taking an ambulance for an emergency because I can’t afford the fucking $500 price.')
