Item(by='stonecraftwolf', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611934406, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25958188, text='IANAL, but to me it seems like it would be very difficult to convict retail investors of investing in a stock they believe has value and then telling other people they invested in a stock they believe has value. Unless there are chat records of a few redditors coordinating an astroturf campaign while twirling their mustaches or whatever, I donâ€™t see how this could be aimed at retail.<p>Regulated entities who have access to tools or information not available to retail investors, or who applied financial pressure to manipulate access to the markets, or did not disclose conflicts of interest...that seems like a much easier case to make.')
