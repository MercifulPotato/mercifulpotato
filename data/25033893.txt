One has much better control over what one is doing as there&#x27;s tactile feedback from the tool&#x27;s cutting edge and the wood&#x27;s surface to one&#x27;s hands.  This allows one to achieve very fine control over one&#x27;s work.<p>One develops a feel for one&#x27;s favorite tools and learns to use them with great ease and facility.  One becomes to understand the feel of one&#x27;s tools so well that one can change stock from say hardwood to softwood and do so automatically without ever having to think about the necessary differences in approach that&#x27;s required between the different varieties.<p>Handtools also offer more control by the fact that there are more sizes and varieties of them than there are of machine tools.  Take the range of Stanley-type wood planes available for instance, the sheer range and number of sizes available is huge whereas there are comparatively very few sizes of electric planes available.<p>That said, there&#x27;s no sense in being a martyr.  Electric saws, thicknesses and surface planes, etc. do the hard bulk work and using them is not inconsistent with what I&#x27;ve already said.<p>Laser cutting is interesting from the perspective that it straddles the two concepts. Manually controlling laser cutters requires considerable skill, so does planning the G-code for an numerical controlled laser cutter require considerable skill, but it&#x27;s a skill of a different kind. Planning the shapes and designs for the laser to cut is yet another quite different skill.<p>Wood is a wonderful material to work with and I get considerable enjoyment working with it irrespective of what kind of tools I&#x27;m using at the time.')
