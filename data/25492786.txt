I&#x27;m slightly concerned with the tutorial leaving the implementation details to the user, and the tutorial basically saying:<p>&quot;Remember: to test your function, you can use the test vectors from the appendix A.1 of the AES standard. &quot;<p>Bad AES implementations suffer from variety of attacks including cache timing attacks etc. and since you&#x27;ve worked for NCC etc. I&#x27;m sure you know a ton about this including about cache timing attacks. The guide isn&#x27;t ready yet, and given that there&#x27;s upcoming parts about linear&#x2F;differential cryptanalysis of AES, it might actually be beneficial to have a weak implementation to attack later to show why AES shouldn&#x27;t be written from scratch.<p>While the writing about the attacks is in the works, in your opinion, would it be worth underlining that the implementation the reader has produced should not be used in production, and that the user has only produced an educational textbook version to learn the basics about the cipher?')
