Item(by='Voloskaya', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605803913, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25148385, text='&gt; Josua Hutagalung, 33, is a coffin maker<p>&gt; he indicated that the amount was over 1 million pounds.<p>&gt; With the money he has received - estimated to be equivalent to 30 years worth of his salary<p>Which brings his yearly salary at 44K USD. Are coffin makers in extremly high demand in Indonesia?<p>Or is the average salary in Indonesia much, much higher than I thought?<p>Edit: Reading other comments, the simpler and much sadder explanation is that he actually did not sold it for 1M pounds at all.')
