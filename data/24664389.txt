Even if they are precocious and got promoted, they have only barely made it into what other people might call the middle of their career, it&#x27;s still the beginning for them (unless they settle).

If you are going to say &#x27;no&#x27; to people, it&#x27;s because they are offering you options that might not be the ones you&#x27;d choose or make for yourself.
