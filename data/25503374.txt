It also doesn&#x27;t make much sense for having a group call with one or two people.<p>However, I could see some value in making public chat rooms that people could join. This way 50 people join a room to talk about a particular subject and naturally split off into separate groups within the room. It would be sort of like a being at a party, where you could walk around and mingle and network with different groups of people. It would be a fun way to interact with new people, especially in current times when everyone is locked inside.<p>So, I see it less as a business tool, and more like VRChat (although without all the crazy avatars and games) where strangers go to socialize.')
