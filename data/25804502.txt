The first option will tend towards longer waits, and the second towards shorter waits.<p>I would tend towards increasing the minimum wait at each iteration (until you get to some maximim wait), because it it failed 10 times in the last minute, it&#x27;s likely going to fail many times in the next minute, so we don&#x27;t need to try more than once or twice.<p>Also: in case the client random is broken, you don&#x27;t want to accidentaly end up with everyone retrying after zero seconds forever.')
