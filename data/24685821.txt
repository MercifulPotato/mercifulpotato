Given the size of the population tested, admittedly doing that is difficult.<p>&gt; Finally, while comorbidities data collected as part of COVID-19 mortality surveillance revealed clinical and epidemiological attributes of fatal cases, the fact that such data were not collected for all diagnosed cases prevented inference of the contribution of comorbidities to fatal outcomes.')
