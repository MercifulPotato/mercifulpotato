Can&#x27;t do it early; can&#x27;t do it when the baby is sleeping, etc.<p>b) It&#x27;s a moderate pain in the ass to hook and unhook. Not a huge pain in the ass, but I certainly didn&#x27;t do it any time of the year it was feasible for me to bike to work.<p>c) It&#x27;s dirty. I mean, the bike. I dislike washing the tires so I can bring it indoors even a couple of times a year, never mind if it&#x27;s coming in and out constantly. And never mind the fact that even washed, my wife sure as hell isn&#x27;t letting me bring that into a corner of the bedroom.<p>d) My bike has exposed chains and gearing that, if I&#x27;m not mistaken, the Peloton and similar bikes do not. I&#x27;ve got a toddler.<p>e) Indoor exercise bikes are usually reasonably set up to let you have somewhere to put your phone, or ipad, or kindle, etc. Bikes on a trainer do not. When I&#x27;m working out indoors, that makes a big difference for me.<p>This hasn&#x27;t been enough to convince me to buy a Peloton, but I can certainly see why someone with more disposable income (or square footage) would.')
