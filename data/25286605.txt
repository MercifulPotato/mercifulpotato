But I need a smartphone. So I&#x27;m going to buy one. My point is if they all have different drawbacks (this one is better for &quot;openness&quot;, that one is better for privacy, this one is better for security) then saying people should just not buy Apple to protest one decision isn&#x27;t helpful. Because by doing that I would probably end up needing to buy an Android phone which means I would give up other things like privacy. And then if I mention that you&#x27;ll say we should have just not bought Google phones.<p>Well yeah. But yeah they control the market. So you buy the least evil product you can that is fairly priced and works with all your other stuff.<p>Or just blame the consumer cause they didn&#x27;t choose the mythical Linux phone with great battery life and no spyware.')
