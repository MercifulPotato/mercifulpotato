Sadly though 100% of the web is written with Chrom(e&#x2F;ium) in mind. Firefox lost the ball on this too long ago for it to come back on this. I can&#x27;t help but see Firefox as a headless running chicken sometimes. And doesn&#x27;t help matters that Mozilla doesn&#x27;t care enough to at least try and take back some of it&#x27;s former glory.')
