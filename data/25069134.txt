Their app store is also a pretty good acquisition channel (I do research on this topic [1]). Here are some relevant quotes I found from my DB:<p>1. Credible ($2.5k&#x2F;mo), a Shopify app to display recent sales:<p>&quot;The other primary source of growth has been through Shopify itself. Shopify is amazing at promoting their apps. They take a 20% cut of your subscription fees, but it&#x27;s well worth it in what they provide for you. When you first launch an app on the store, they feature it in the &quot;New &amp; Upcoming&quot; section for store owners to get a first glimpse of your app. After you prove yourself with some solid growth and positive reviews, they will feature you in the main &quot;Featured&quot; section of the store. Both of these were huge for our growth. When Shopify put us on their main featured page, we netted about 180 new recurring customers.&quot; [2]<p>2. Shogun ($4.5k&#x2F;mo), drag-and-drop page builder:<p>&quot;When we launched on Shopify, sales began to trickle in and have been growing ever since. We&#x27;ve been attracting users in the Shopify app store from the beginning with very little marketing, and we got featured by Shopify fairly early on, which gave us a good boost. Now most of our new customers are through word of mouth or the Shopify app store.&quot; [3]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firstpayingusers.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firstpayingusers.com</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indiehackers.com&#x2F;interview&#x2F;how-i-grew-my-app-to-2-5k-mo-without-learning-to-code-916444524f" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indiehackers.com&#x2F;interview&#x2F;how-i-grew-my-app-to-...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indiehackers.com&#x2F;interview&#x2F;struggles-we-faced-building-and-marketing-a-4-5k-mo-business-deeb815581" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indiehackers.com&#x2F;interview&#x2F;struggles-we-faced-bu...</a>')
