Find a nice big crater in an area that gets a lot of sunlight and polish the walls of the crater into a parabolic mirror. Put your heat engine at the focus and collect tons of energy. The one drawback: how do you provide cooling? Heat engines are only efficient with a large temperature gradient (Carnot&#x27;s theorem).')
