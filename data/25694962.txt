Literally giving you no options at all to speak online, CCP style.<p>So the only difference here is that the political opponents are merely silenced instead of massacre. To think of it further, if you control all sources of information, you can not stop at silencing, no one will know if you kill them anyway - and even if they do, and somehow post about it, just write &#x27;this has already been debunked&#x27;, and a nice factcheck banner.<p>This is an incredibly sad day for all world and a turn for the worse. You&#x27;ll see.')
