Why do I have to transmit my requests from my phone to the cloud and then have it come back down to the device in my home? This means I can&#x27;t connect during Nest outages or (much more frequently) when my internet is down.<p>Even when there are no outages, it still takes ~10 seconds every time I open up the Home app for it to populate any information.<p>By contrast, I can open the app for my Wyze cam and be seeing&#x2F;hearing the live feed in ~5 seconds. (I still don&#x27;t love the cloud-first aspect of the Wyze cam, but it was dirt cheap and that&#x27;s the primary reason I got it. Nest products aren&#x27;t cheap, so I expect better performance, not worse.)')
