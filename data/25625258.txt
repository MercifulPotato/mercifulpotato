There is far too much energy in the air for an antenna not to pick up on diffused and reflected emissions.<p>On the other hand a fine, grounded mesh will protect just fine against such attacks. Even in windows. Look up IEMI shielding.<p>Now taking these two together I think that it is possible that the embassy had both shielding and detectors. Because the attacks may have happened outside the shielding, and the detectors were inside to detect bugs.')
