They&#x27;ve just sat and grumbled that their job doesn&#x27;t pay enough (while refusing to work harder or change employer or get a qualification).<p>This is neither fair nor accurate, and is the same kind of thinking that people attributed to Trump supporters in 2016. The reality is there are whole areas of the country that feel unsupported by their government.<p>Jobs they held have been offshored as a result of globalalisation and deepening income inequality ensures that they receive smaller and smaller shares of the pie, despite worker productivity vastly increasing.')
