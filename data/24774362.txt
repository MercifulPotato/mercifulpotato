Item(by='HenryBemis', descendants=None, kids=[24780515, 24775242, 24780459, 24774482], score=None, time=1602663435, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24774100, text='Hahahaha apologies for the reddit-like comment but I laughed so hard.. when scrolling (for a while) on the &quot;1 million dots&quot; portion of the page (big portion), after the loooooong image the author writes &quot;Sorry. A million dots is a lot of dots.&quot;<p>I was once in Copernic Science Centre (Warsaw, Poland), and they had some cylinders with tiny plastic spheres (imagine 1-2mm diameter each sphere). One of the cylinders was supposed to have 100k? 1m? spheres (or some similarly crazy number) and only 1 red sphere, and I remember I was rotating that cylinder for a couple of minutes (it is not tightly packed to the spheres can move around) and eventually I saw the red sphere.<p>Ps: on the URL of the parent.. I could not find the red dot.. I gave up after a couple of minutes. I will though try the following (later tonight). Save the image, take it to Photoshop, pick the &quot;black color&quot;, use that to erase all the similarly colored (black) dots, and the red one will remain behind for me to easily spot.')
