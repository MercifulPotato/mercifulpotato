This is problematic because, you deal with many unknown vendors over time. Using whatsapp to send payments would spam your contact list.<p>edit:<p>Also, this is using Unified Payments Interface (UPI). There are a lot of apps that have much better UI&#x2F;UX &amp; Value adds than WA. I use PayTM, in which, I scan a QR code with the UPI address, do the payment and be done with it. Very simple to use, no issue of confusion &#x2F;  sending money to wrong person, No known privacy issues, etc.<p>Also, It&#x27;s not like a lot of people want to send money to their friends. Usually, it&#x27;s business transactions.<p>It could work for off bank micro loans, provided there is an app for tracking and charging interest, etc.')
