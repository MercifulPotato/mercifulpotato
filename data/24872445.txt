Similar to how terrible C++ code being all over the place is making people hate C++ the language.<p>-------<p>XML can be used very well however: its use in Jabber &#x2F; XMPP is clear and concise. XML Namespaces are needed due to the extensions of XMPP, and various programs can interact with the protocol. Specifications are clear, the ability to &quot;stream&quot; data is proven, different parser strategies have been implemented. Its clear that XML in this instance works, and works pretty well.')
