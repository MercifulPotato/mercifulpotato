You do need to use a special fork of LineageOS, because it needs to implement signature spoofing, which lineage devs refuse to do for security reasons. Get it from lineage.microg.org .<p>Once you have this fork it&#x27;s great though, the spoofing is what makes it transparent to apps. It does use Google&#x27;s push service as this is the only way (this is what the apps&#x27; backend servers talk to), but it doesn&#x27;t require a google account, just a random ID.<p>The other things like geolocation don&#x27;t require google services at all. In my experience it works great.')
