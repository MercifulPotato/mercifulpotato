Just want to say that this is an extremely different experience from any other site I’ve been on, so thank you for that. Future goals for this project are to improve the audio quality and get community contributions for model training of different hardware. It’s very much still an experimental project, but I wanted to give an idea of what is possible using deep learning for audio applications.')
