This is what &quot;having free speech in society&quot; has always meant<p>Wrong twice.<p>First of all, the United States doesn&#x27;t have laws against hate speech. The US Supreme Court has said hate speech is protected by the first amendment. So, you&#x27;re protected from government retaliation, even if it&#x27;s hate speech.<p>Second of all, that&#x27;s NOT what &quot;having free speech in society&quot; means. It&#x27;s what the first amendment means. In American culture, writing op eds to a privately owned newspaper is a classic example of free speech, going all the way to revolutionary times (and actually predating the constitution). In the past (before the internet), prominent newspapers would brag that they would publish editorials from any significant public figure, even if they detested that public figure, because free speech was a good thing. That&#x27;s why the NYTimes has published so many editorials from dictators.')
