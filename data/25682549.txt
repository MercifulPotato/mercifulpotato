Scoped destructors aren&#x27;t only for memory management. They are also widely used for e.g. closing files or sockets, basically anything that you may think of as a resource. Go has the defer statement, which would also disable TCO, even though Go has a GC. You can call just about any function in a defer statement. You can have TCO in a language that has scoped constructors&#x2F;defer statement and doesn&#x27;t have a GC. It&#x27;s just that the things that at first look like tail calls often aren&#x27;t. But the same thing can be said about operator overloading. TCO will still be in this language, but it will only be applied to tail calls, not calls which the programmer mistakenly believed were tail calls.')
