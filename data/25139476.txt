And the people who are meant to be the &quot;victims&quot; of these issues almost never take offense or issue (e.g., Japanese opinions on the little girl&#x27;s geisha-themed party or Chinese opinions on the traditional-Chinese themed prom dress, or African American opinions on defunding the police, or etc). The people who take offense are very often not even members of these &quot;victim groups&quot;, but rather people who believe race is the preeminently useful characteristic of any person and that races have agency and collective guilt&#x2F;accomplishment and so on (i.e., &quot;racism&quot; in a literal, classical sense).')
