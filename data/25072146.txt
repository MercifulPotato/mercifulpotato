Can anyone speak off-hand to what the performance is like on a Pi, or what generation minimum is recommended? I&#x27;m assuming my original Pi Model B might be a little long in the tooth, and my Pi Zero might be under-speced.<p>But I could see myself setting this up on a newer Pi and plugging in my 1.5TB external into it to share out all my music with my family. Right now I&#x27;ve got a Samba share on my Windows HTPC for my internal network, but something the rest of the family can use would be sweet.')
