It made its way into the wider discourse via educators, who were actually using the model incorrectly in the first place according to a few quotes from Maslow himself in the blog. It&#x27;s a shame I couldn&#x27;t find the article. Basically, it&#x27;s an abstraction of needs that is just too good&#x2F;simple to be true.')
