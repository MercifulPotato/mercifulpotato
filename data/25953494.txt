Item(by='josho', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611891124, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25951222, text='I opened a new bank account earlier this week, I&#x27;ve got 8 documents to review. Here&#x27;s a section at random on how interest is calculated.<p>&gt; We calculate interest each month based on the lowest Daily Closing Balance. We pay interest on the last Business Day of April and October.\nTo earn any interest, the account must stay open for one full calendar month before the payment date.<p>Not dense language at all. But, note how Daily Closing Balance is title case, so that means its been defined elsewhere, so I need to flip back and refer to the definition then flip back to page 8. The definition which by the way isn&#x27;t how you&#x27;d likely define a closing balance. Next part of interest is April, and October. So, interest is only paid twice a year‚Åâ That makes no sense, so I scan around and see this is for the Savings X account. But, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what the name of my account is called, so now I have to flip through all 8 docs to find what specifically my account is named. Except none of the docs actually tell me which product I signed up for, instead I figure this out by comparing the fees outlined in the account types with what I wrote down when choosing the plan with the agent that I spoke with earlier.<p>Now back to the paragraph above and realize I&#x27;m realizing I&#x27;ve been analyzing the interest schedule for an account that isn&#x27;t relevant to me. Scanning for my account I find that the interest is calculated as one would expect--some special conditions around the daily closing balance.<p>I&#x27;m frustrated and growing tired, but that is only 1 paragraph in 1 of 8 documents. The bank clearly made no effort to include only the sections that apply to me. So there is a great chance that I&#x27;m either going to miss a nuance in a section (like how they&#x27;ve defined daily closing balance to have some exclusions), or ignore a section believing that it doesn&#x27;t apply to me.<p>Keep in mind you and I are likely both college educated, have training in logic and can figure this out if we spend the time&#x2F;energy. Do you think the average American has a chance to understand what they&#x27;ve signed?')
