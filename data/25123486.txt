Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=[25133476], score=None, time=1605619822, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25123072, text='&gt; What do you mean by this? It sounds like how stash already works.<p>I want to switch branches when I have some added (staged) changes and some unstaged changes, and keep the same set of staged and unstaged changes afterwards.<p>&gt; This is how git has worked for years: you can checkout a non-conflicting branch without stashing.<p>Only if none of the changes are to the same file, even if they don&#x27;t conflict.<p>&gt; Have you customized Git to not support this?<p>If I do &quot;git pull&quot; it does a fetch and then something else. I&#x27;d like to do just the part that&#x27;s not a fetch (because I fetched the same remote recently).<p>&gt; When does it make sense to do this? I can understand deleting a remote branch (which doesn’t require this) but deleting the current local branch doesn’t seem to make sense in any normal workflow.<p>When I&#x27;ve finished working on something and aren&#x27;t going to work on that repo again for a bit, I&#x27;d like to delete the feature branch that I just merged remotely, but I don&#x27;t want to check out anything else in particular. So I usually end up doing a git checkout --detach just so that I can delete the branch, which feels cumbersome.')
