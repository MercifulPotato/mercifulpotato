Weinstein seems to be stuck on bat respiratory disease that spreads in roosting caves. He does not consider gastrointestinal infections spread by bat guano at night in their feeding range which is shared by nocturnal&#x2F;arboreal pangolins and palm civets. Bat to human direct infection is also just as plausible near the horseshoe batâ€™s natural habitat.<p>The Barker article is confused about a 7-hour train ride not being compatible with a 4.5 day average incubation period.<p>I see no mysteries to explain just the hard work of animal surveillance required to connect the dots.')
