Violence in any form cannot be condoned, especially death.<p>One thing I don&#x27;t see mentioned is scale of death vs. scale of demonstration. There was a relatively small number of people in Washington, and in one day, much damage was done. 5 killed, O(100) injured, and the capitol overrun.<p>The demonstrations this past summer were on another level. It&#x27;s estimated that 20 million [0] people were involved. Yes there was violence and people acting in bad faith. But as a percentage of total protests it is _far_ less. I believe this says something about the intent of both demonstrations.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Black_Lives_Matter" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Black_Lives_Matter</a>')
