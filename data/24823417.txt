For years I struggled to dig even the shallowest of holes for planting things, laying pipes, etc. Holes that would take me months to dig, one painful weekend at a time, I can now get done in 10 minutes. Weirdest tool I&#x27;ve bought, but it has saved me literally years of effort at this point.<p>I guess the generalized message is just buy the best and most specific tool up front. The time saved by proper tools is totally worth it.')
