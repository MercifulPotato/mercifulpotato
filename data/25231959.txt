Item(by='PragmaticPulp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606506164, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25231357, text='&gt; there&#x27;s a level of self-assuredness that feels increasingly disconnected from reality<p>There&#x27;s a unique type of hubris that comes from operating in the startup&#x2F;VC world for a long period of time. On a long enough timeline, investors and founders alike start to forget that selection bias has shaped their perspective of who is successful. The failed investments and bankrupt startups are quickly forgotten, almost as if they never existed. What&#x27;s left is a few home run investments and headline startup founders that get to rewrite their history to make their success seem obvious from the start.<p>It&#x27;s also a side effect of coaching early startup teams. Startups are hard and often spend more time looking like failures than successes in the early days. Advisers and investors get into a rhythm of praising their founders to rebuild confidence and energize the teams. It&#x27;s common for investors to tell their companies that they are uniquely talented or exceptional as a way to short-circuit any doubts that their problem space is too hard for anyone to conquer. Spend enough time telling people that they are one in a million, exceptional, and not like the general population and eventually you&#x27;ll start believing it too.<p>This essay feels a lot like the advice we received as an early stage startup: It&#x27;s what we wanted to hear, maybe what we needed to hear to keep going, but it&#x27;s not necessarily generally true advice that can be applied to all situations. If you&#x27;re a startup foundering experiencing doubts, this type of writing can provide a kick in the pants that you need to keep going. If you&#x27;re not in the startup world, it just feels out of touch.')
