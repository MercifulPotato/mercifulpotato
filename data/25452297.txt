You can safely target RHEL 6 or RHEL 7 without having to worry what minor version they might be running. The same will be true of CentOS Stream which is the upstream for the next <i>minor release</i> of RHEL. CentOS Stream isn&#x27;t going to suddenly jump major versions.<p>If the current RHEL release is 7.x then you can think of CentOS Stream as 7.(x+1). You don&#x27;t have to worry about it suddenly being 8.0. <i>Fedora</i> plays the role of the future RHEL 8.0.')
