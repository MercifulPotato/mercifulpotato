You simply cannot engineer doors to fit right, the assembly line guys always have to pull it, twist it and ‘align’ it.<p>I know nothing about manufacturing for cars or anything else, but ... why can&#x27;t doors be engineered to just fit? In terms of absolute tolerances, I&#x27;m guessing all the stuff in the engine or transmission for a typical car is far more stringent, right? Is there something specific to the manufacturing process for doors or frames that is less controlled or precise?')
