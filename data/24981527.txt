Nuclear is just as cheap as it is to run at a fraction of its capacity as it does to run it at full capacity. Peak energy load also happens when the sun is not in line of sight. So if you use nuclear to fulfill peak load, then you can just use these plants for the rest of the day and skip building intermittent sources.<p>This is why most plans for renewables are contingent on orders-of-magnitude improvements in energy storage.  Or continued use of fossil fuels. Because if you use nuclear to fill in the duck curve, then there&#x27;s no reason to build out other sources of energy.')
