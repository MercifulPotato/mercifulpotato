Here&#x27;s a support document from 2014 explaining the capability: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20140628022826&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;kb&#x2F;HT6008" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20140628022826&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.app...</a><p>Single displays driven as two half panels over MST has been supported since 10.9.3, including the UP2414Q that I mentioned. Otherwise, DisplayPort 1.2 could only give the screens enough bandwidth to run at 30 Hz.<p><i>&gt; MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) or Mac Pro (Late 2013) also support 60 Hz displays using multi-stream transport (MST). These displays need to be manually configured to use MST. Follow the steps below to use the display&#x27;s built-in controls to enable this feature.</i><p><i>&gt; [display specific instructions omitted]</i><p><i>&gt; Your Mac will automatically detect an MST-enabled display. However, your display may require a firmware update to support 60Hz operation. Please contact your display vendor for details. If your specific DisplayPort display is not listed above, check with the displayâ€™s manufacturer for compatibility information.</i><p>Having used that Dell screen on both OS X and Windows, I can tell you this MST capability was better supported on Mac than it was on Windows. On a Mac it worked perfectly. On Windows you&#x27;d frequently get half of the screen either black or shifted sideways, creating several visible seams in the image.<p>Not my screenshots, but see here for examples: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dell.com&#x2F;community&#x2F;Monitors&#x2F;UP2414Q-Rev-A03-Wake-Up-Half-Screen-Wrong-Screen-resolution&#x2F;td-p&#x2F;4745902" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dell.com&#x2F;community&#x2F;Monitors&#x2F;UP2414Q-Rev-A03-Wake...</a>')
