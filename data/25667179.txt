There is information, misinformation, and then there&#x27;s claims that cannot be proven or disproved.  I do not believe that all things are false until proven true.  I believe that Christianity, and many other religions, can be neither proven or disproven using modern science.  It is neither misinformation or information.  It is a belief.')
