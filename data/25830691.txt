Lots of pockets of innovation in a sea of mediocrity. It wasn’t even that long ago that IBM was considered a top 5 company in cloud, AI, and quantum computing.<p>&gt; G is still way more technologically advanced than any other top tech company<p>That’s a senseless statement. Google has lots of nice tooling for developers and managing their infrastructure, but that doesn’t make them the most “technologically advanced”. They use a mono-repo for a ton of stuff, most shit is boring grpc calls and regular database lookups. There is nothing on the leading edge of the crypto&#x2F;blockchain world, there isn’t anything particularly interesting in p2p, etc.<p>&gt; Did you completely miss the memo on google duplex, tensorflow, kubernetes, etc?<p>It’s funny you should mention kubernetes since most of the innovation there comes from outside of Google. Look at who is driving ebpf networking adoption, etc.<p>You’re right though that Google is currently an AI leader. But again, that’s &lt;1% of their engineering workforce. When I left a few years back most people were working on simple shit resting and vesting. It’s an incredible place to retire in place, but that will eventually catch up with them and it’s bad for career development as a SWE.')
