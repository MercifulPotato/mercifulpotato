Item(by='robocat', descendants=None, kids=[24812813], score=None, time=1602958083, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24811154, text='&gt; The person writing this post lives for his job<p>I think you are completely mischaracterising the author. The article is about <i>career</i>: for most of us a career is a necessary evil that cannot be avoided.<p>If you read the article as though the heading were “optimising your career to suit your lifestyle”, the article still makes sense.<p>Nowhere in the article does it imply that you should prioritise work&#x2F;money over living.<p>There are multiple references to ensuring that you achieve personal goals inside and outside your job:<p>“if you don&#x27;t want your talent to go to waste”<p>“Staying in a job for loyalty or money&#x27;s sake is like staying in a bad marriage for the sake of kids. It&#x27;s not healthy for anyone involved.”<p>“Am I excited and happy to go to work every morning and see my teammates.”<p>“She had grown tired of her role and was burnt out.”<p>The author mostly talks about the time cost (not $) of your choices - most of us are given similar lifespans so choose how you invest your time wisely.<p>PS: “Valley Girl Newsletter” - @leokennis: assuming “his” is impolite IMHO.')
