Grind all of those down and there would be no trace of market economics.<p>And yet, the effects of market economics are all around us. So is it real or not?<p>If you did the grinding experiment you&#x27;d also find no trace of life left in the powder, especially not if you take it to its logical conclusion at the subatomic level.<p>Does that mean there is no such thing as life?')
