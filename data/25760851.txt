It seems that Avere is close to ObjectiveFS, which also use S3 both for data and metadata.<p>My guest is that Avere could require a cluster of nodes as the fast layer for write and synchronization. In JuiceFS, Redis is used for synchronization and persisting metadata. Local SSD could used for data read-caching, not for writing.<p>JuiceFS is in production for 3+ years, we have not find much challenge that was difficult with this design, since it&#x27;s borrowed from GFS, HDFS and MooseFS, have be proved in production for more than 10 years. I&#x27;d like to hear what&#x27;s the challenge you were facing.')
