I remember there was a time where Matrix.org attempted to purge a lot of channels related to image board communities. Channels that started with the format of &#x2F;?&#x2F; were deleted from Matrix.org. This includes the federated version of channels from other homeservers. I think it is disingenuous to say that you do not block any other homeservers when you have deleted channels from other homeservers, preventing them from federating properly. Some users have been banned from official channels on the Matrix.org server because of the homeserver they were registered on. Perhaps things have changed since I was last involved with Matrix, but from what I saw the Matrix.org homeserver was to be avoided since they did not play nice.')
