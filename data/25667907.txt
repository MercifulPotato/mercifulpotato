But plains Indians have an romanticizing gaze towards inhabitants of the Himalayan ranges. They view them as simpler nomads. The author applies a version of the &quot;Oriental gaze&quot; to Sikkim&#x27;s political struggle and attributes the kinetics to the two western woman in their midst - one who was just 19 and on the scene for barely a dozen years. This reduces the natives and the major participants - both educated, one highly - as mere appendages of the two western women in the mix. You don&#x27;t find this highly incredulous?')
