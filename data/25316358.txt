Stop calling them accidental discharges, call them negligent discharges.  Both they and you make good points as to why.<p>But, then what does the meaning of accident become?  With this line of thinking, nothing is an accident, everything has a cause and potentially a prevention.  So once nothing is an accident, then we can start using the word accident again?  I mean, most car crashes are unintentional(as are injuries at factories, and gun discharges) so why are they not accidents?  Or are you arguing for the word and concept of accident to not exist at all?')
