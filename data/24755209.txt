In fact, I don&#x27;t even install extensions anymore. My secret ain&#x27;t manuals, though, it&#x27;s the much simpler &quot;only buy machines that the vendors declare as compatible with linux&quot; or the even simpler &quot;buy machines with linux installed already&quot;.<p>Though I only use my computer for browsers, editors, IDEs, terminal windows, and productivity apps; and pretty much <i>nothing</i> else, so experience may vary of course.')
