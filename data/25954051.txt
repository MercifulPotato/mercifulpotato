Like others, I wish GitHub has a way of blocking PRs.<p>But I think, what I can do eventually is have my version of your &quot;Open-source, not open-contribution&quot; paragraph. Hopefully the term will become popular and more widely recognized.<p>Furthermore, I think it is helpful to have a public roadmap of features not implemented yet. Others (especially colleagues) might feel ownership because they were able to guess what&#x27;s on your long mental to-do list and make that their &quot;ground breaking&quot; request.')
