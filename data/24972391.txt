Sometimes it&#x27;s cheaper to destroy demand or otherwise not build for density you don&#x27;t need. This is way different (massively over budget and&#x2F;or behind schedule public projects) then dropping extra fiber in a trench because you&#x27;re there already (&quot;Dig Once&quot;).<p>For example, Strong Towns [1] seems to champion the whole &quot;the suburbs are unsustainable&quot; perspective, but never the &quot;public works projects in HCOL metros are too expensive for the resulting density&quot; thesis. Market forces will likely work it out in this case though (people leaving HCOL locations for lower density locations where per dollar quality of life is higher, with major cities having to do more with less, or do less with less [tax revenue] [2]).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.strongtowns.org&#x2F;the-growth-ponzi-scheme" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.strongtowns.org&#x2F;the-growth-ponzi-scheme</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;27&#x2F;nyregion&#x2F;mta-virus-budget-money.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;27&#x2F;nyregion&#x2F;mta-virus-budget...</a>')
