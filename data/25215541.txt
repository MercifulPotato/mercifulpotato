Until recently, Blender wasn&#x27;t even interested in partaking in a pipeline (Tons&#x27; own words at SIGGRAPH 2017)<p>Recently that has shifted and blender is looking to be able to be integrated into pipelines Which might help adoption. Such things as supporting Pixar USD and the VFX reference platform.<p>In addition to that, Blender did an overhaul of their UI and renderer that brought a lot of interest in.<p>I expect to see Blender in studios sooner rather than later, but I don&#x27;t expect it to supplant the existing DCC packages.<p>There&#x27;s still a lot of friction to working with other DCCs, still a lot of performance issues with larger scenes, and then there&#x27;s issues with support, extensibility and licensing.<p>Corporations are averse to GPL and Blender is all GPL. They might get more adoption if they dual licensed their plugin API.<p>Also since it has no C api, it&#x27;s not attractive from an extensibility perspective.<p>Finally, the major studios like to have support contracts to expedite fixes to blocking issues. Blender doesn&#x27;t have such a thing. Yes , it&#x27;s open source but it requires crewing up for something that a support contract would cover .')
