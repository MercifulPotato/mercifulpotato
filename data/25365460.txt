Restaurants don&#x27;t have to partner with delivery apps. If they&#x27;re not organized to make a profit given those margins, they should stop participating. If they can&#x27;t turn a profit, they should naturally go out of business.<p>Likewise, no one is forcing people to use delivery apps. The apps provide a benefit of convenience without a huge cost overhead. If people don&#x27;t want to use the apps, they shouldn&#x27;t use the apps. If they can get higher value by going to restaurants directly, rational customers will do that.<p>Delivery apps are simply helping to sweep the market clean of inefficient mom&#x27;n&#x27;pop food shacks and helping us get to healthier business reality where restaurants are better aligned with diners. Have you seen Gordon Ramsay&#x27;s Kitchen Nightmares? Most restaurants are run by insane people who have no idea what they&#x27;re doing!<p>If diners really expect undeliverable value and restaurants must be held together with duct tape and baling wire, it is an unhealthy market and will naturally destroy itself.')
