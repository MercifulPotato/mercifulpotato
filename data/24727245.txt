The table loads with the page. Loading it after with JS will only go slower.<p>&gt; <i>&quot;server rendering can&#x27;t accomplish with an SPA&quot;</i><p>Again, you don&#x27;t need a SPA to have some interactive DOM manipulation. Nobody is saying everything requires fresh HTML from the server, but something like jQuery Datatables will give you 99.99% of instant client features while working with server-rendered tables. htmx.js is another great library that solves most use-cases.<p>&gt; <i>&quot;For someone who is building a collaborative graph editor?&quot;</i><p>Obviously not, because that&#x27;s one of the few times where a SPA is needed.<p>&gt; <i>&quot;the anti-SPA crowd here sometimes hates JS and browsers so much&quot;</i><p>What&#x27;s with the extremes? Nobody is against SPAs or JS or browsers. In fact we want browsers to be used for what they do best, which is rendering URLs into pages very quickly. SPAs make a tradeoff in trying to emulate most of the browser performance and reliability in return for complex interactivity. The issue is that most sites don&#x27;t need that interactivity, and what little they do need can easily be done with much less.')
