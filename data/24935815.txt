The federal government has shown that it will do what&#x27;s necessary to maintain the status quo. As each COVID benefit runs out, another one is added to replace it. How long can they keep this going? I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;m not willing to bet against all the people who own 1+ homes and the politicians who represent them.<p>I personally delayed buying a house in Toronto since 2013, thinking that it&#x27;s too hot and it can&#x27;t keep going up. I missed out massively. I don&#x27;t recommend young Canadians to wait, but rather buy your primary residence if you can before you&#x27;re completely priced out of the market. Just don&#x27;t put all your investment into housing in the GTA, it may pop one day.')
