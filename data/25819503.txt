How Microsoft ships Windows tested only on a handful of hardware configs? How game devs ship games only tested on the latest graphics card?<p>The whole point of having standards, conventions and stable interfaces is that developers do not have to test their code on every &quot;platform&quot; (in this case browser). If there are platform-specific differences from the standards, that is the platform developer&#x27;s problem.<p>And keep in mind we&#x27;re mostly talking about individuals here - companies rarely develop extensions and those that do can probably afford an old mac to use as a complie box. Extensions are usually developed by individuals in their spare time and rely on beta testers anyways, as it is already impractical for one dev to test them on every possible config.')
