Nobody would really want to install Skyrim without the master esm since the assets contained therein are essential to the experience. Maybe that&#x27;s not particularly useful to the discussion, but my point is you could probably fit all your most commonly used programs in a static format + all your average assets like icons or config files, and run and use them in a pretty small amount of space. The games, FLAC music collection, high quality photo library, etc can very easily be much greater a storage requirement than an application library full of static binaries.')
