Instant navigation is nice, but that&#x27;s an implementation detail: an SPA could just as easily lazily load that data, and must chew up memory on the client and then deal with synchronization complexity with the back end if it doesn&#x27;t.<p>It&#x27;s a trade off, of course.  SPAs are a reversion to the classic client-server setup, and there are advantages and disadvantages to both that and the newer web model.<p><i>One is that you still need to hydrate and format that HTML somehow</i><p>htmx expects HTML back from the server, there isn&#x27;t any hydration or client side templating (unless you want that)<p><i>Second, you have to take on all the rendering load instead of just passing thru some JSON-formatted DB results,</i><p>Formatting database data into a JSON string is not significantly less CPU intensive than formatting it into an HTML string, and both are a round-off error when compared with the expense of connecting to the data store.<p><i>Final gripe...</i><p>Yes, an irony of my life is that I had to learn a lot of javascript in order to avoid writing much javascript.')
