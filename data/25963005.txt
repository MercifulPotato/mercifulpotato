Even if you don’t get the concept of “margin” specific to investing, you should get that you’re borrowing against the transfer when you use it.<p>Edit:\nI just deposited more money into robinhood, and the screen says &quot;your funds will be transfered in next several days... in meantime, we&#x27;ll give you access to $X while you wait for the funds to clear&quot;<p>Also, the UI separates your cleared money, from the instant deposit money as 2 line items.<p>It says that its not your money in the UI.')
