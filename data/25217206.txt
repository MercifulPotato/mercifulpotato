I didn&#x27;t say much about quality, but quantity. Hence, access.<p>Access to professional medical care is a minor factor anyway. Increases in life expectancy are not not primarily due to medical care, but to other improvements like better nutrition, better drinking water, better sleep, safer neighborhoods, even things like better financial security. And as it turns out, the effect of access to health care on life expectancy or better health outcomes for the poor is much weaker for the groups you mentioned. In a real sense, access to care itself matters mostly to the middle &amp; wealthy classes (of whatever &quot;race&quot;). Also, I&#x27;d quibble that wealthy whites aren&#x27;t also improving. Poor whites seem to be suffering, but by all indications, wealthy whites are also doing well.')
