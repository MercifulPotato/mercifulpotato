I think that many people could potentially benefit from a tool like this. Although I have spent a lot of time testing and unit-testing this tool, there still might exist some uncovered bugs. So please use at your own risk. If there is one learning that I would like you to take away from this is that trading is a hard game to master. :) Anyway, I would appreciate your opinions and suggestions for improvement. The tool is definitely far from perfect. Thx!')
