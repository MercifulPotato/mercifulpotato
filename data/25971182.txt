Affinity Designer, Affinity Photo, Logic Pro, Final Cut Pro, GarageBand, and iMovie are all in the top ten charts for the Mac App Store (an interesting tangential point here is about how mobile eating so many consumer software use cases has shifted laptops and desktops more towards creative use cases).<p>But the point is, familiarity with these apps is useful for software developers for a couple of reasons:<p>1. While they may not be developer tools, they are certainly related: User-facing apps all have a UI, and most involve media of some sort, whether it&#x27;s photos, videos, icons, etc... Being able to work with those file formats is a great supporting skill for a software developer.<p>2. As a software developer, whose &quot;art&quot; is software, it&#x27;s good to be able to use applications that other users prefer to use, just like, say, an interior designer might be interested in how people decorate their homes. As a software developer, I&#x27;m extremely interested in the what and why of the software people like to use.')
