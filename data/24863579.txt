We have an internal app within our company that a user had gone in and messed with a file it relies on. Consequently, the app stopped working correctly and multiple other people started complaining that the app wasn&#x27;t working.<p>To prevent the issue from happening again - we&#x27;ve &quot;Secured&quot; the file away so users can&#x27;t mess with it like they did ever again...<p>As so - vendors sometimes withhold agency to control how the product works - so it works as designed for their customers.')
