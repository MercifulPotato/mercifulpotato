With CoScreen, more than one user can share their windows with each other at the same time, side by side on the same share desktop - not just one.<p>2. Up to 12 participants can interact with any shared window using mouse &amp; keyboard across multiple users.<p>3. You can even copy &amp; paste code between windows shared by different users.<p>4. We are about to launch our Windows beta so users that aren&#x27;t on macOS will be able to pair&#x2F;team program too (and e.g. simultaneously share &amp; interact with macOS AND Windows windows).')
