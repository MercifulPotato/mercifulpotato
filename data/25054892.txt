Your analogy isn&#x27;t great.<p>A fractured ankle is a bad thing. A cast certainly won&#x27;t do harm. Pain is a response of your body to a bad thing. Suppressing it can do harm in itself.<p>Some pain can often be desirable because it prevents a patient from further injuring themselves by, for instance, putting weight on an injured ankle. Pain is a warning system.<p>Add to that all the possible side-effects of painkillers.<p>On top of that there&#x27;s context for everything. You should probably give a patient that experiences pain which can&#x27;t be avoided painkillers earlier than a patient who experiences pain when they put weight on something they shouldn&#x27;t.')
