Cars are absolutely brand-dominated, and famously so.  If they were really commoditized we&#x27;d be seeing consolidation of providers, where (c.f. the very company we&#x27;re talking about!) we&#x27;re seeing the opposite.<p>And batteries are legitimately high tech devices.  No one can &quot;just open a battery factory&quot; without stealing someone else&#x27;s chemistry process first, and probably a ton of industry knowledge about suppliers and chain management.  An <i>enormous</i> amount of money is still being dumped into battery R&amp;D.  They are basically the polar opposite of a commoditized product.')
