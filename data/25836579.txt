What a great bit of word-smithing there. I love it. Yes, that&#x27;s a good description of the Baofeng radios. They&#x27;re crap, but they&#x27;re fine crap. Cheap, but workable as a beginner radio. I bought mine right when I got my Technician license, and it&#x27;s served well for dipping my toes in the water a little. But I&#x27;ll be buying a higher quality radio soon, if all goes according to plan.')
