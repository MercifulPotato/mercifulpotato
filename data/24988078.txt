A proper menu&#x2F;action system requires the toolkit to retain all menus and actions; ImGui doesn&#x27;t do that (and shouldn&#x27;t, considering all the places you can put a menu), it also requires layered event handling, which ImGui doesn&#x27;t want to have. Accessibility requires a retained widget tree, which ImGui explicitly doesn&#x27;t want. Layouts are incompatible with the current immediate mode API (but could be implemented in an immediate mode API given a legion of lambdas), because the size of widgets depends on the size and possibly contents of other widgets; for ImGui this is all fixed when you call Button(), which immediately calculates all vertices and adds them to the drawlist (that&#x27;s the retained part in ImGui). There are probably many more points.')
