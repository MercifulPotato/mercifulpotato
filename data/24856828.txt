Item(by='float4', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603365432, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24856454, text='&gt; mass killing at an unprecedented level<p>There&#x27;ve been many wars that came a lot closer to WWII in terms of casualties than the Second Congo War did. Look at that wikipedia page I linked to in my previous comment.<p>- Three Kingdoms War: 184-280, 36,000,000–40,000,000 casualties.<p>- Mongol conquests: 1206–1368, 30,000,000–40,000,000 casualties.<p>- An Lushan Rebellion: 755–763, 13,000,000–36,000,000 casualties.<p>- Conquests of Timur: 1370–1405, 8,000,000–20,000,000 casualties.<p>- Taiping Rebellion: 1850–1864, 20,000,000–30,000,000 casualties.<p>- Dungan Revolt: 1862–1877, 8,000,000–20,000,000 casualties.<p>As you can see, what&#x27;s mainly special about WW1&#x2F;2 is the casualties&#x2F;year ratio. The total death tolls are not <i>that</i> unprecedented.<p>It&#x27;s indeed silly to say that there&#x27;s been global peace since WW2, but I do believe that there is a difference between the wars we&#x27;ve seen in the last 75 years, and the wars I listed above. I&#x27;d <i>still</i> call the Second Congo War a major war, but I do think there&#x27;s a distinction to be made here. The word &quot;major&quot; just isn&#x27;t it, and I think we both agree on that.')
