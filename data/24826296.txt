(by the way, the paper finds its main finding at p &lt; .02)<p>To my mind, a major post-mortem is necessary, government funded. How many other flame-retardents cause health issues?  How did they get past approval?<p>In the meantime, an immediate injunction against flame-retardent laws should be passed (numerous tobacco-lobbied laws REQUIRE retardents), and all used retardents should be listed on the labels of all products.<p>I expect the people in charge of public health to be as anal about their job as I am about mine.')
