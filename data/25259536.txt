Basically the OS keeps track of how busy pages are and rebalances things for heavily used pages that are placed poorly.<p>Similarly, Optane (in dimm form) is basically slow memory, OSs seem to handle it fine.  NUMA support seems pretty mature today and handle common use cases well.<p>With all that said, apple could just add a second CPU to double the ram and cores, seems like a great fit for a Mac Pro.')
