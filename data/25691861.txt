I do believe the number of people impacted by poverty, food insecurity and job loss is far higher than the number of people impacted by COVID long term.<p>I do not believe flattening the curve is a myth. I believe that without an exit strategy flattening the curve is unsustainable. I believe that keeping ICUs from being full is a very good goal. I also believe we generally locked down out of panic way before ICU capacity was at risk (See SFO in March) and thus consumed the will, resources etc to withstand flattening the curve. Now we have ICU issues but we&#x27;ve lost the will .')
