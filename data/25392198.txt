I&#x27;m actually working on a little library to do just that (control memory layout) although it&#x27;s more focused on 0-copy FFI w&#x2F;hsc2hs<p>You can also have the RTS manage the memory itself, but have complete access to a pointer to raw memory. That doesn&#x27;t work if you have pointers in the raw memory ofc, but it is a nice option if that&#x27;s not the case.')
