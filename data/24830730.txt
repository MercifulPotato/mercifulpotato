The moment discord starts becoming expensive , people will switch to mattermost or zulip or ircV3 by that time (ps or matrix). The privacy issues are real and the moat to exit is shallow. We already switched our community to mattermost because , discord doesnt seem sustainable for long term, and we also have control that can&#x27;t be taken away. It would be really nice if these teams focused on creating an interoperable standard for chat instead of trying to lock in users. Basic protocols like chat should be decentralized, and will probably end up being so.')
