Instead it is a particular flavor of centrist identitarians who couldn&#x27;t care less about freedom or class consciousness. They&#x27;re just striving for a bit of attention like everyone else. If you accused them of leftism they would probably take offense.<p>I&#x27;m not saying the far left don&#x27;t have it in them, because obviously they did USSR etc. But that was in that context, in which by some miracle they controlled the murderous tools of a nation-state. In USA they know very well that they&#x27;re in line for censorship (or whatever, really) immediately behind the pornographers. No one who appears on cable news is part of the &quot;far left&quot;, no matter how loudly they shriek.')
