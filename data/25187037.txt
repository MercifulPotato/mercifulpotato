Item(by='KineticLensman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606141643, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25186854, text='Stonehenge is approx 250 metres from the A303, which is one of the main routes into the South West UK. The A303 at the closest point is a single lane in each direction, and frequently very slow at that point, so isn&#x27;t massively obtrusive in the sense that a 6-lane motorway would be. That said, there is a plan to dig a tunnel nearby to get rid of the road completely.<p>Stonehenge is debatable as a visitor attraction, especially if you are in the UK only for a few days. By coach from London it is pretty much a full day, when there is a lot more history in London itself. In my opinion. Stonehenge itself (as opposed to the larger archaeological landscape) is small compared with Roman or Greek remains, so if you don&#x27;t have an appreciation of the history of the place, may be underwhelming. It also gets crowded very quickly, although the fact that a close approach to the stones isn&#x27;t usually possible means that everyone gets a view. Last time I went I arrived early, and got some great HDR images of the stones under an impressive moody sky.<p>[Edit - I also agree about Avebury being worth a visit. You can walk amongst the stones themselves, which are almost part of a historically pretty village. The really impressive structures in the nearby vicinity in my opinion are the hill forts such as Old Sarum [0] near Salisbury and Maiden Castle [1] near Dorchester. These are truly massive Iron Age earthworks.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Old_Sarum#Prehistory" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Old_Sarum#Prehistory</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Maiden_Castle,_Dorset" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Maiden_Castle,_Dorset</a>')
