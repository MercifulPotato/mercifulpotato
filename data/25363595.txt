You really don&#x27;t want to have to rewrite it all every couple of years because that&#x27;s not where your business&#x27;s value comes from. Also, updating will break a huge number of your customers&#x27; sites and apps, which will piss them off and bury your already slender profit margins in support costs.<p>Most of those hosting customers are not tech companies building fractionally &quot;innovative&quot; CRUD SaaS apps. They&#x27;re SMEs who use their apps and databases to do real work: organizing their employees, procurement, running payroll, managing delivery routes, order and stock management â€” boring stuff like that. They very much do not want to have to significantly rewrite the back-office systems their businesses rely on because the OS changed under them. They want it to keep working for decades with as little redevelopment as possible.')
