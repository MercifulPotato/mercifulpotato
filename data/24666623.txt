Item(by='cosmie', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601669919, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24665929, text='My pleasure! Feel free to reach out, you have any questions (email in profile).<p>I&#x27;m not an expert on it, but I am a technical person currently working on the business side of the IT fence. And I frequently do (data-engineering heavy) consulting for clients who are similarly on the business side of IT. So none of the nifty ETL tools, data storage capabilities, or computing environments I have available when I&#x27;m on the IT side.<p>Power Query is a godsend in that scenario. It&#x27;s a well featured ETL engine with integrations for a variety of systems, services, and databases (including generic JDBC&#x2F;ODBC support). And has the ability to use direct HTTP calls when that&#x27;s more appropriate&#x2F;useful.<p>It also stores the data internally in a highly-compressed and optimized columnar store, independent of the &quot;Excel data&quot; on sheets. Which you can then either sync to a worksheet, or leave it in a state where the raw data isn&#x27;t visible but can be accessed through a pivot table connected to it. So you can abuse it for <i>far</i> heavier work than you&#x27;d expect to be able to do in Excel.<p><i>And it&#x27;s already there</i>, sitting on virtually every business person&#x27;s computer everywhere. Completely sidesteps the security, IT, procurement, and legal hassles you have to jump through to get a proper system. Not to mention user training - you can architect things in a way where all users have to do is maybe tweak a cell or two, then hit the Refresh button that&#x27;s in the Ribbon. So the complexity of &quot;learning something new&quot; is completely absorbed on your side, and you&#x27;re free of pesky support questions and hassles since you isolated them from being the new stuff (also making it harder for &quot;accidental&#x2F;I didn&#x27;t press anything!&quot; changes from users).<p>It&#x27;s not perfect by any means and has a number of warts, usually falling short of more purpose-built solutions when those are options. But it&#x27;s still pretty solid, and on balance has saved me far more frustration than it&#x27;s caused. And without having to dip into the dreaded world of macros and VBA.')
