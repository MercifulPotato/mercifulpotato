My conclusion at the end of the article is that in retrospect nesting did more harm than good, and knowing that, I would have happily left it flat.<p>Incidentally, &quot;leave it flat&quot; is not my stance in all cases. For example, I gave a whole talk that could have been titled &quot;when to nest&quot; - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;DoA4Txr4GUs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;DoA4Txr4GUs</a> - and my most popular Elm project uses nesting in multiple places - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;RN2_NchjrJQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;RN2_NchjrJQ</a><p>But indeed, in this case, I&#x27;d happily leave Msg flat and not bother with all the lens stuff!')
