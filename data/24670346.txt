It also is about driving prices down for consumers for that commodity.<p>The iOS and Google platforms have barely existed more than a decade, and the platforms + app ecosystem are constantly evolving. New platforms and app ecosystems are emerging too, with Facebook&#x2F;Oculus, Valve&#x2F;Steam, Amazon with Fire&#x2F;Alexa, etc.<p>Enshrining today’s dominant app ecosystems as the government sanctioned ones will surely stifle their evolution and innovation, because that’s what declaring something a utility does: assumes there is no differentiation, so slow government regs &#x2F; bureaucracy can control it.<p>I don’t believe Apple and iOS are the end of history of ecosystems.  Atari wasn’t, Microsoft wasn’t, IBM wasn’t.')
