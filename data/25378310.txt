Proximity to customers (assuming US&#x2F;EU market) and angels&#x2F;VCs is worth something, and I would suggest that it is worth a lot.<p>I will also add that when you factor in plane tickets, visa runs, etc., it is probably easier and just as affordable to find a cheap place to stay in your home country.<p>If you’re bootstrapping a business, especially if you have some tie to Asia like manufacturing or labor (e.g., “virtual” assistants), then the digital nomad option may be better. But for a VC-trajectory business, I somehow doubt it.')
