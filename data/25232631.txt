Let&#x27;s also ignore the weirdness of 40% of the company&#x27;s Black employees being on a single seemingly small team.  That still leaves 7 other employees in other departments who left the company in a 6 month window due to feeling discriminated against.  35% is obviously a better number than 75%, but it doesn&#x27;t allow you to dismiss this problem.')
