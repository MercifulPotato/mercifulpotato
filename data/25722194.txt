You are just beating around the bush with all sorts of analogies.<p>It&#x27;s funny to see how the left wing was crying over censorship in Parler now suddenly says that Parler was banned because it wasn&#x27;t censoring anything. Isn&#x27;t this what leftists were saying just a year back:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techdirt.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20200627&#x2F;23551144803&#x2F;as-predicted-parler-is-banning-users-it-doesnt-like.shtml" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techdirt.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20200627&#x2F;23551144803&#x2F;as-pr...</a><p>Here is another quote from Amazon&#x27;s email which talks about Parler removing violent posts:<p>&quot;You remove some violent content when contacted by us or others, but not always with urgency.&quot;<p>This is Amazon crying about Parler removing violent posts but &quot;not always with urgency&quot;. What the actual fuck? Why should Parler do anything with &quot;urgency&quot; just because Amazon asked for it? Is Amazon the US Government? I have been reporting accounts and tweets for months on Twitter and it hasn&#x27;t yet been removed. But Amazon is greater than you, me and everyone else. If it asks something you better deliver immediately or else you&#x27;ll be booted from their platform.<p>But they are doing nothing about the low engagement violent tweets on Twitter which is hosted on AWS infrastructure. I haven&#x27;t seen a bigger bunch of hypocrites in my life!<p>Amazon doesn&#x27;t realise it but it has given so much ammunition for Parler to sue in a court case. They literally have admitted in the email that Parler is removing violent posts but not with the same urgency that it wants. Well news flash: no social media platform in the World removes any post with urgency. I sometimes get notifications for reports I had submitted months ago with &quot;Sorry we did not find it violating our policies and it cannot be taken down&quot;. On posts that are literally violent.<p>Unless you have used the garbage reporting system that these social media companies have in place and experienced it first hand you don&#x27;t have any right to talk about Parler and its efficacy in removing illegal content.')
