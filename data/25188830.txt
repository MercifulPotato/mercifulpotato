Niven (who wrote Ringworld) also co-wrote &quot;Lucifer&#x27;s Hammer&quot; with Jerry Pournelle, which was like a fun book version of a big-cast disaster movie, about a comet colliding with the earth in the mid-1970s.<p>Lucifer&#x27;s Hammer had some fairly realistic assessments of life in the following 5-10 years after the event, centred around restarting production. One big point was about some books very similar in concept to &quot;The Knowledge&quot; being used to preserve necessary information, and another was about recapturing some existing nuclear facilities to try to sustain life at all, given the big energy requirements for agriculture and basic personal heat after the event (because of e.g. huge amounts of atmospheric dust)<p>Reading this article also made me realize, with surprise, that I&#x27;ve never thought about this aspect of Fermi&#x27;s paradox! One of the many variables that led to our civilization&#x27;s rise may be the simple fact that we had hundreds of millions of years of abundant life before us that failed to industrialize. Imagine if human-like life had evolved a billion years ago, when the reservoirs of petrochemicals were a billion years less developed?<p>If it turns out that both life and sentient life are actually surprisingly common, it might be the case that most civilizations are borne unto planets not yet ready to support their technological advancement, and all they can do is burn out the wick before they reach a powderkeg moment. The great filter could work the other way -- we could be the rare success merely by dint of having shown up &#x27;late&#x27;.<p>Fun article!')
