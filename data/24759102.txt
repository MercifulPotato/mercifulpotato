Item(by='justinlloyd', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602534588, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24758621, text='Thursday: I should build an API package for OpenWRT that will track bandwidth usage per device over a calendar period, e.g. past 30 days. wrtbwmon is all very nice, but it simultaneously tries to do too much (offer a UI) and not enough (track data usage for all time). Let me just write that down in my notebook.<p>Friday: I can build a nice and simple API for OpenWRT that is API focused and provides easier access to the common functions that people want from OpenWRT, this would help mobile app developers create apps that talk to OpenWRT in a simple way. Let me just write that down in my notebook.<p>Saturday: Let me just sketch out this new design for a workshop cabinet that will let me combine my tablesaw, bandsaw, chop saw and tool storage in a single location.<p>Sunday: I want my security camera to combine all the detected motion in to a single multilayer video that lets me scrub through events like layers playing simultaneously rather than scrub through time. Let me just write that down.<p>Monday: OpenWRT should have a &quot;state&quot; that is queryable via a curl request that determines if OpenWRT still needs to be configured. I can build that as a simple API and package it. Let me just write that down in my notebook.<p>The ideas aren&#x27;t the problem.')
