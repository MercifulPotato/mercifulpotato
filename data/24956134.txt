That some people have internalised their childhood abuse and rationalised it as &#x27;it worked&#x27;, because they don&#x27;t want to recognise that their parents treated them wrong doesn&#x27;t change that. In fact it actually proves an important point, that it is important to always speak up against abuse, because a lot of people who have been abused often in an attempt to not deal with it rationalise it away.')
