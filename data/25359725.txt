Tech has no legitimate authority to decide what is true. The mindset and moral system that&#x27;s overwhelmingly dominant in tech is abhorrent to much of the rest of the country and the world. Why should this prominent but fringe Bay Area mentality dominate?<p>It&#x27;s simply not tech&#x27;s place to be making these calls.
