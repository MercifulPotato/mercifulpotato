One can be an advocate for the homeless without letting them sleep in your bedroom; one can be an advocate for immigrants without wanting instant citizenship for anyone; one can be an advocate for free speech while also not allowing objectionable rallies in your place of business. In the same vein, one can be an advocate for employees (giving them respect and fair working conditions) while also developing a business that lets one profit handsomely.')
