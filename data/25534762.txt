When I started learning programming I was overwhelmed because of c, c++ and JavaScript. Tried a bit of Python too. \nI thought I would never get a hold of any programming language ever. One day I tried this mysterious language from Japan(That&#x27;s how I knew Ruby at the time) on tryruby.org. Ruby was breath of a fresh air. Code read like English. I was making small CLIs which required so much work in every other language. That was enough to get me hooked. Then I learned about Rails and never looked back.\nHappy to see this language making new strides with this release. This is a thank you note to Matz and the community.')
