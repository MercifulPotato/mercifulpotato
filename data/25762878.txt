I agree with what you are saying.<p>Perhaps it can help to remember this: some of us here may not realize that even the term <i>identity politics</i> has a complex history. From Wikipedia:<p>&gt; The term was coined by the Combahee River Collective in 1977. The collective group of women saw identity politics as an analysis that introduced opportunity for Black women to be actively involved in politics, while simultaneously acting as a tool to authenticate Black women&#x27;s personal experiences. It took on widespread usage in the early 1980s, and in the ensuing decades has been employed in myriad cases with radically different connotations dependent upon the term&#x27;s context.')
