It’s an Alpine Linux shell in an x86 emulator and it’s on the App Store.<p>I just installed gcc, Java, and Python on my iPad Pro. I can also install Ruby, PHP, etc. I can do most of my work now from my iPad without using Remote Desktop. Game changer. This app should be included on iPad Pro by default.')
