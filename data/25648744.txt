Engineer for those who shared their password with their now-hated ex.<p>Those can&#x27;t be helped. We&#x27;re not talking about Geocities or MySpace here - we&#x27;re talking about a service that hosts a distributed version control system aimed at experienced users with a technical background.<p>The target audience is strictly not your average consumer and even then you shouldn&#x27;t insult the intelligence of your users.<p>2FA is intended to protect <i>all</i> users of the service and users <i>do</i> have a choice when it comes to selecting their 2nd factor. Doesn&#x27;t have to be an e-mail or phone. It can be an app-generated token as well.<p>And loosing everything at once is tragic (hence: keep backups!), but suggesting that the locksmith should be allowed to just open the door if you ask nicely and the owners don&#x27;t show up within an hour would be just as ridiculous as allowing to circumvent 2FA.')
