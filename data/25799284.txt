It explodes the attack surface. In safe languages like C# or Java there’s no unsafe anywhere, not even in standard libraries. These runtimes are safe all the way down. The only attack surface is the VM itself, but these are very small only a handful of instructions, and are tested and audited really well.<p>&gt; You can still have memory leaks in GC-d languages by reference cycles.<p>No, you can’t. All modern garbage collectors collect reference cycles just fine. They don’t just count references; they actually traverse these graphs.')
