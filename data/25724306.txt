CNN, MSNBC, etc are far from perfect, but let&#x27;s not pretend that &quot;both sides are as bad as each other&quot;.<p>Fox (to say nothing of the absolute swamp that is OANN or Newsmax) are an order of magnitude worse than the so called &quot;left&quot; channels (only in the US would CNN be considered a left wing news channel).<p>The reason that CNN, etc are &quot;biased&quot; against Trump is because <i>reality</i> is bisaed against Trump. He&#x27;s just a terrible president, a lousy business man and an awful human.<p>Again, only in the US would that be considered a controversial statement.')
