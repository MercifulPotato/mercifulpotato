Those figures were approximately a best-case cost for the rental and worst-case cost for mileage-induced depreciation at any point in the depreciation parameter space. If they only added 10k miles then they&#x27;d incur $5k or more in rental fees and $1.7k or less in mileage-induced depreciation by the above math.<p>I did misplace a zero though for what it&#x27;s worth. A budget rental would only cost $500 or so over 10k miles, not $5k, if they&#x27;re making the entire trip in a single day and returning it to the same place they picked it up. If that&#x27;s the case the budget rental would probably be worth it financially (unless they were planning to hold the Tesla for awhile so that it hits a more favorable point in the depreciation curve), and if not then the extra rental fees are likely such that especially counting gas vs supercharging it&#x27;s approximately a wash one way or the other.')
