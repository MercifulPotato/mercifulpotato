I wonder what the proportion of people watching extremist&#x2F;disinformation content on youtube because of suggestions is? In some ways it&#x27;s worse than TV, because if you publish shit on TV you get people writing to the regulator to complain (qv Janet Jackson superbowl nipple ridiculousness). On youtube you may never know what your fellow citizens are watching until they say &quot;of course the world is ruled by lizards, here&#x27;s the video that proves it&quot;.<p>I wonder if people would accept the compromise that youtube would <i>host</i> this content but force it to &quot;unlisted&quot;. After all, the recommendations are <i>their</i> speech, not yours.')
