This might be a news to Americans, as US propaganda efforts used to be more directed outwards, but us who grew up in (failed) socialism grew up knowing that most of political news are filtered lies and that you can&#x27;t ever trust just one source. And I think that&#x27;s the only viable solution, educating people to be skeptical of anything, on first ball at least. Check the multiple sources, wait a little for stories to be officially confirmed before reacting. It&#x27;s not that hard, and Internet actually makes it a lot more viable, just that we still haven&#x27;t really adapted emotionally to how the world works now. We still jump to conclusions, we still click the clickbait titles and the biggest problem, we&#x27;re all deeply biased on our own views of the world - and these biases are the glasses that we view the world through, they affect every single aspect of our perception, often on a subconscious level. People often believe in fake news simply because deep inside they already think that&#x27;s the case, they want it to be true.')
