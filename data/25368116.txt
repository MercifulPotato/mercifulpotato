Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607562369, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25367001, text='&gt; When journalists do it (especially poorly) it becomes just another facet of a the publication&#x27;s&#x2F;writer&#x27;s bias.<p>But that&#x27;s also why the condemnation of balance is misdirected. Facebook is not a journalist, it&#x27;s a communications platform. It isn&#x27;t choosing how to spend its own words in a newspaper with a finite number of pages or a news channel with a finite amount of airtime, it&#x27;s choosing what other people can say in a medium with effectively unlimited carrying capacity.<p>It also has a big problem because the platform is simultaneously a medium for the dissemination of information to the public and a medium for the debate of nascent ideas.<p>Suppose that tomorrow we got a claim of widespread election fraud that could actually be substantiated, given a sufficient amount of crowdsourcing or collaboration between experts in different fields. Now they can&#x27;t even discuss it because the effort to substantiate it involves putting forth a theory that hasn&#x27;t been substantiated yet?')
