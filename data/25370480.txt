However if the shop owner had lucrative infrastructure-nontrivial contracts with the mafia that would be mutually harmful if dissolved, and the resources and information necessary to apply real pressure to the policies and personnel of mafia leadership, then the new picture we&#x27;ve painted barely resembles its original form as you depicted in any meaningful way.')
