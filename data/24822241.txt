Uber team has full control and we are not part of Uber basically. Keep in mind Cadence is a project for Uber first and foremost. But Cadence and the team are super great.<p>The long answer is that we see Cadence as a great part of our lineage. We felt that our vision for the open-source of Temporal was much different than what Uber sees for the project.<p>Now that we have a production grade release, we are slowly phasing out Cadence support. We will still provide free support to any Cadence users who need help migrating to Temporal.<p>I canâ€™t speak to your situation without knowing more. I will say if you would ever like a hosted version of this tech, Temporal is the way to go. I am happy to answer any specific questions too!<p>ryland@temporal.io')
