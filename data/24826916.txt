And I basically ended up having a 28 hour &quot;day&quot; and spun round and round the clock. Not ideal long term(!)<p>The most comfortable configuration was going to sleep about 6am and waking about 1-2pm, but once I started having kids, etc. that obviously wasn&#x27;t going to be viable so now I get up at 9am which is tolerable but not super productive.')
