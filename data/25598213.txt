They pretended that he was not the subject of the investigation, so Flynn felt no need to have an attorney present while being questioned.<p>Afterward, the FBI agents themselves, on the form they filled out regarding the interview, stated that they did not think that Flynn lied.<p>Regardless of that, the DOJ continued to prosecute Flynn for doing something completely normal for an incoming National Security Advisor to do, speak with a foreign diplomat.  Only after bankrupting him with legal fees, which even forced him to sell his home, did they relent.<p>And then, when the DOJ refused to further prosecute Flynn, a federal judge refused to dismiss the case, a bizarre act forcing Flynn&#x27;s attorneys to file a plea with a superior court.  The judge even appointed his own prosecutor to continue prosecuting Flynn!<p>Now, why did all this happen?  Is it because the then-newly elected President&#x27;s incoming National Security Advisor spoke with a foreign diplomat?  Or is it because the Obama administration hated Flynn because of what he did while running DIA (which they fired him for), and the incoming President appointed him to be his National Security Advisor, and the DOJ is apparently full of &quot;#resist&quot;ers?<p>But that&#x27;s not a perspective you&#x27;ll hear from NYT, CNN, WaPo, etc.  From them, you hear, &quot;Treason!&quot;<p>The old saying applies: You can fool some of the people some of the time...')
