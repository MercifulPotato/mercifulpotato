I guess I have a feeling you like to lord it over other people with the help of victims of diseases. (Similar things tend to happen when somebody dies - there are always people who then order other people around on the basis of &quot;the deceased would want us to do x&quot;).<p>I never once said that the spoon women doesn&#x27;t have it hard, btw. That is your interpretation. I want to know why it annoys you if people are not sufficiently sad about it. I probably live at the other end of the world, so I just wonder why it is so important to you.<p>Btw there is also a story about Buddha who told one of his suffering disciples to find somebody who doesn&#x27;t have a hard fate, and they were unable to find somebody. I guess Buddha was a real asshole, according to you (he did exactly the thing you claim is a big no no).')
