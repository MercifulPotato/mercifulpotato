As much as I do agree with this, this is some hyperbolic writing. I&#x27;ve read so many articles just like this one, they show up on HN quite often it seems, and I&#x27;ve never seen one that had what seemed like a realistic fix to the problem. I don&#x27;t think there is a fix really. All social media platforms will be full of bots&#x2F;fakes that exist to spread garbage. All social media platforms will be full of real people doing the same. It also seems like the loudest people (and bots) are the most toxic and get the most engagement. It&#x27;s people, all the way down, and there will always be a bunch of people doing the wrong thing. Those people will be highly incentivized and motivated, while the rest of us will just be looking for something to read.<p>(Also, maybe interesting, the author of this is the executive editor of The Atlantic, not just some reporter.)')
