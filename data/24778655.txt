But isn&#x27;t it sad that we&#x27;ve got to the point that so much effort - and a whole industry - has to go into this very meta side of work, time that is not spent doing something that actually produces something? All of this just to get to the point where you can get an interview to get a job to <i>then</i> start doing something productive for the world?<p>Again, not to take anything away from the book itself, which looks great. Just a comment on the work world today, I guess.')
