One reason sometimes given is that linked lists are amenable to the &quot;move-to-front&quot; heuristic (move just-accessed element to the head of the list), but one can do the same thing in dynamic arrays by swapping the just-accessed element with the first element (a better heuristic though is to fix some k and swap with the kth element if the accessed element is outside the top k, or swap with the preceding element if it&#x27;s in the top k).')
