Item(by='sleavey', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607098875, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25303754, text='+1 for the point about the complexity of the German tax code. As a foreigner it&#x27;s even worse for me, given the frequent use of German words never encountered in every day language. When the majority of people either ignore it or employ an accountant to do their taxes for them, the system is broken. I came from the UK where it&#x27;s relatively simple and basically automatic if you&#x27;re not self employed.')
