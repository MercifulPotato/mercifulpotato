And it&#x27;s far more important that Discord on my phone should look and feel like Discord on my desktop than having it match my other phone apps or my other desktop apps. So people have got over the idea that the platform is important and that apps need to match the platform conventions (rightly IMO; the platform is there to support the applications, not the other way around - of course it would be better if the platform makers could come together and agree some consistent <i>cross-platform</i> UI conventions that every app could use everywhere, but they didn&#x27;t, so here we are).')
