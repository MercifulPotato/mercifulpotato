Shell is a domain-specific language for dealing with concurrent processes and the file system. But Python and Ruby have too much abstraction over these concepts, sometimes in the name of portability (e.g. to Windows).<p>Ruby has pretty good thing wrappers around running shell commands (e.g. using backticks to run a command and get the output as a string or calling system() on a string to execute as a command and get back the error code), and my understanding is that it doesn&#x27;t really have great Windows support. My impression here is that the author of this FAQ is probably not super familiar with Ruby based on the way they seem to equate the abstractions in both languages.')
