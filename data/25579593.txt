Now imagine the toilet came as a subscription service, with DRM restricting you to premium brands of toilet paper and cleaning products, and built-in sensors that secretly analyze the chemical composition of your excrement, collecting data which the vendor sends to advertisers. Oh, and the toilet is always connected, which means it&#x27;ll stop working if you lose power, Internet, or if the vendor abandons it or goes out of business.<p>That&#x27;s the problem I have with technology today.
