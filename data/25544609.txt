I can assure that whether or not you replace your tires four, two, or even just one at a time, there are absolutely zero visible&#x2F;immediately tangible repercussions and the issue described with the Tesla is absolutely not normal even under those circumstances.<p>As for the long term ramifications, you’ll definitely see increased wear&#x2F;camber on the opposing tire(a) and I’ve read it could theoretically cause issues with the diff, but I find that extremely hard to believe at least for the cats I’ve driven, because the front:back power ratio is dynamically recalculated and changed continuously depending on driving conditions. If it were 4WD rather than AWD, that might be the case though.')
