Item(by='adkadskhj', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607031729, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25293968, text='&gt; Why? Are you suggesting some form of subsidy? Transporting live animals is expensive, and pet ownership (let alone flying with them) is not a human right. If the market does not land on a safe and affordable option, then so be it, solely the pet owner should bare that cost.<p>Not at all lol. What is the option though currently, renting a private jet?<p><i>edit</i>: To think of it differently, the airlines <i>have chosen</i>, and that choice of theirs resulted in deaths of pets, repeatedly. They want to let pet owners pay for tickets but not give them the safety of traveling without killing their pet.<p>If they&#x27;re going to allow pet travel it should have safety regulations just like people - that don&#x27;t result in pets being left on a 130deg tarmac for literal hours, and dying.<p>The &quot;free market&quot; should not get to decide things that kill people, pets, etc.')
