They do this as they have a large labour advantage, very lax pollution laws and can make things for far cheaper then others can.  You can determne this for yourself once you realize that China doesnt only export to the USA.  When China exports to the EU for example they earn Euro notes.  They can convert Euro&#x27;s to USD if needed, but i dont think their primary goal is to accumulate USD, espeically given their massive USD Bond holdings.  If anything, they are probably looking to sell USD bonds to diversify.<p>3) removing the US as a reserve curency wont just make americans &quot;poorer&quot; - it will have a devistating impact on your ability to borrow.  Since the US gvt constantly runs a deficit who will finance this when other nations no longer want&#x2F;need USD?<p>4) The US needs to import because as the article stated, they no longer manufacture things.  Try going to a city like &quot;bridgeport, Connecticut&quot; and see the mothballed factories.  It will take decades to undue the damage outsourcing has caused.')
