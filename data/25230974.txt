It seems super relevant to this problem space. Will post to Show HN next week for more thoughts.<p>Amna is a fast way to do context switching. You write a task, and start working on it. Amna gives you a space with an editor and browser (more in the future), and saves your work. It makes information really easy to navigate. Though not great for general browsing, it’s perfect when you have a task to do. And you can easily come back to something at a later time.')
