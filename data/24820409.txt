These days 90% of Stack Overflow &quot;answers&quot; are of this form, where the respondent does not respect the possibility that the questioner knows what they are asking and why. It is not always a sunk cost fallacy, where the questioner &quot;might be attached to the steps they’ve taken so far&quot; as the article states.  That&#x27;s <i>also</i> condescending!')
