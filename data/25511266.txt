The current state-of-the-art emulation for melee is much more responsive than console melee; on a high-refresh-rate gaming monitor, you have 2 whole frames of extra input lag to play around with. For local play you can just set the appropriate buffer to match console melee; if you&#x27;re playing online, those frames are used to send inputs to your opponent(s), making online possible without any extra delay.')
