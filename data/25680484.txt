Georgia is confident the result is correct.<p>&gt; Nevertheless, Trump attempted to get the government of Georgia to commit election fraud for him. He wanted them to &quot;find&quot; an extra 11,780 votes for him.<p>Not quite true - that&#x27;s the misleading summary people have been spreading, started by an out-of-context clip of the conversation.  He wasn&#x27;t trying to find extra votes, he was trying to find and validate votes which he believed could add up to 11,780 disqualified.  Just re-counting the votes does not do this, those ballots would simply have been counted each time.<p>Two of the relevant quotes from the transcript:<p>&gt; You had out-of-state voters. They voted in Georgia but they were from out of state, of 4,925. You had absentee ballots sent to vacant, they were absentee ballots sent to vacant addresses. They had nothing on them about addresses, that&#x27;s 2,326.<p>&gt; The other thing, dead people. So dead people voted and I think the number is close to 5,000 people. And they went to obituaries. They went to all sorts of methods to come up with an accurate number and a minimum is close to about 5,000 voters.')
