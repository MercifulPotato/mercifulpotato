Dont judge it for what it can do but for how it does it. It is not as bloated as Electron and company because the author ditched some things from the DOM that are legacy carryovers. Additionally you dont use JS with Sciter but you plug your preferred language to it. It is purely a UI renderer that so happens to support HTML and CSS. I think the only one similar I have seen is potentially Azul.rs but I dont remember if Azul has HTML&#x2F;CSS support.<p>Edit: I realize why the authors doing a kickstarter. It is to ensure the income necessary to devote time and effort towards open sourcing the project itself.')
