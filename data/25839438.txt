A half-marathon (or near) distance was practically a light exercise for me for a long time there. A marathon would be a harder exercise, fatiguing, but not too challenging. Because I was prepared (running 5&#x2F;10&#x2F;15k regularly for several years). But I would never call it &quot;just running&quot; for anyone else.<p>The idea that hiking is &quot;just walking&quot; because <i>for you</i> it was, is similarly absurd. With elevation changes, gear on your back (10-40lbs depending on how lightweight you go, easier to be lighter than when I started with metal-framed packs), significant distances per day, potential time constraints requiring longer daily distances, you have similar &quot;heavy stressors&quot; in hiking.')
