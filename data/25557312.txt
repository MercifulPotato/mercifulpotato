It could very well be the case that even for a universe this large, it was a statistical anomaly for it to have life. Maybe out of 1000 similar universes only 1 would happen to have life. How can you tell the odds so confidently?<p>Maybe even out of 1,000,000,000 of similar universes only 1 would actually happen to have life. It&#x27;s similar with planets. If you only know of 1 planet within 1B to have life, how can you tell the odds are not low enough to have 1 universe out of 1B to have life?<p>This could be an awesome example of survivorship bias to assume because there&#x27;s life here, there must be life elsewhere in the universe too. We only have experience with a planet where there&#x27;s life, so we are innately biased to think that it might be more frequent occurrence than it really is.')
