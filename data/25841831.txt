If you actually didn&#x27;t and would in more normal times vote labor, I&#x27;d be interested in that because what you say very strongly speaks to me, of a prior dissent from the Andrews government. You are using libertarian language in a way which implies you are not a statist, and do not believe what Victoria did was legal, let alone justified<p>(btw in case it isn&#x27;t clear, I categorically disagree on both fronts)<p>I say this as a queenslander, where the overwhelming majority of the state backs what Labor has done, and thinks NSW can go jump, regarding who determines what happens at the borders.<p>I doubt any Westralian, or Tasmanian, or any of the aboriginal communities (who self isolated day #1) would agree with you over lockdown btw.')
