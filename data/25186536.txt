Item(by='josefresco', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606138224, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25186148, text='&gt; I donâ€™t think there is anything that suggests Apple is going to stop people from installing Apps outside their App Store. Rather it is about making sure it is easy for regular users to get Apps in a safe manner without malware and Trojan horses.<p>Sorry but I had to LOL (combined with grey-haired head shaking).  I&#x27;ve been a &quot;technologist&quot; for over 25 years.  Every time some corporate entity or government body adds similar &quot;security&quot; they trot out this same cliche line.  &quot;Oh no no no it&#x27;s not so we can CONTROL you, is so we can PROTECT you&quot;.  Yeah, sure buddy.')
