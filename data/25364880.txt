Kind of like putting someone in a wheel chair could be described as &quot;allowing them to tackle different challenges&quot;.<p>She was more than just let go, she was bullied, humiliated, demoted, threatened, retaliated against, and blackmailed among others. Evidence was tampered with, destroyed, or manufactured, along with quite the list of irregularities even judges observed.<p>There&#x27;s nothing to justify that except an incredibly toxic company culture coming straight from a brilliant but extremely toxic leader. But people like him don&#x27;t have to worry about any court. They can always buy their escape from a court of law with money, and buy their escape from the court of public opinion with charisma, PR, and their loyal following.')
