That&#x27;s a new use of `!` I haven&#x27;t seen :)  But I suppose we are saying completely opposite things.  I use rebinding only when I re-bind once.  In your example, I would use pipes with a single re-bind:<p><pre><code>  def foo(bar) do\n    bar =\n      bar\n      |&gt; decorate()\n      |&gt; some_more()\n\n    {:ok, bar}\n  end</code></pre>')
