They&#x27;re despondent because the Republican party these days is just fighting against the far-leftists that are taking over the Democrat party.  It&#x27;s basically a one-way ratchet leftward: the Democrats get power and move stuff, then the Republicans get power and just prevent movement for a few years.  The Libertarian party is the only one that&#x27;s truly fighting for a better future with things like small government, gun rights, and lower taxes.  The LP presents a positive vision of the future and a plan to get there that I like.  So I&#x27;ll keep voting Libertarian, even though I know we have no chance.')
