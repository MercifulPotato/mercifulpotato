The main function of the logarithm is to transform multiplication into addition, so log(x y) = log(x) + log(y) and log(x^k) = k log(x) are uniform and consistent with that idea.<p>Also exponentiation is a way more fundamental property than the logarithm so it&#x27;s weird to place its notation on the same footing.')
