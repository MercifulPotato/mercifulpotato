Apps aren&#x27;t as strongly sandboxed, much more data gets collected (by Google, but that means an account compromise is much worse than it would be otherwise), security overall is worse.<p>I remember when I had an Android phone and I took a peek at Google&#x27;s personal-data dashboard at one point. It had a line drawn on the map tracing my every footstep for the past several <i>years</i>. Vacations, commuting, visiting friends. Everything. It was neat at the time, but is a nightmare scenario for this kind of thing. You can disable some of that, I think, but Maps will constantly bug you about turning it back on.<p>At the very least I&#x27;d steer them away from installing any apps that don&#x27;t come from major global corporations. There&#x27;s a ton of malware on the Android store, especially games, and it&#x27;s not hard to imagine some of it collecting data to sell on the black market.')
