It may have started this way, back in the times where end users were also competent at working with computers. The point is that end users can delegate trust <i>on their own</i>.<p>It&#x27;s the same idea as with Right to Repair - the movement isn&#x27;t expecting everyone to learn how to use a soldering iron and a chip programmer; is to allow local communities to have their own specialists capable of repairing hardware. Similarly, with free software, my mother isn&#x27;t going to look or modify the code herself, but she may ask <i>me</i> to help with it. Or a different neighbourhood tech whiz, who may even take payment for the service.<p>Software freedom is in part enabling local markets to work.')
