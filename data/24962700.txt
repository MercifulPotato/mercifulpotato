A thermostat makes decisions.<p>&#x27;Makes a suprisingly sophisticated series of decisions&#x27; is more supportable. But whether you are surprised depends on your intuition about how complex a tiny machine with feedback from sensors and quite a lot of internal state can be. Since almost every biological system I&#x27;ve ever learned anything about is mind-bogglingly rich with complex dynamics, my default is to be unsurprised by rich externally-observable behavior.')
