Item(by='Arnavion', descendants=None, kids=[24889433, 24889234], score=None, time=1603649693, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24888218, text='Yes, Teams uses a function that is unsupported by Xwayland (XGetImage, if I remember the backtrace correctly), so it crashes. I worked around it with a rather convoluted setup that involves running Xephyr under Xwayland, then running Teams under Xephyr (via setting `DISPLAY`), and running vncviewer under Xephyr connected to a VNC server (wayvnc) sharing my screen on the parent wayland instance. Then I tell Teams to share the &quot;whole screen&quot; (ie the entire Xephyr window) and quickly maximize the vncviewer window (within the Xephyr window).<p>To be able to maximize vncviewer you do need a compositor running under Xephyr too. I picked i3 to be the most minimal. Again, i3 can be told to run in the Xephyr window by setting `DISPLAY`.<p>One caveat is that I still use Teams under Wayland to join calls for the audio, so this setup means I need two Teams instances to join the same call. This works for meetings but not for individual calls. Of course if you want to use the Xephyr&#x27;d Teams to do audio too there shouldn&#x27;t be any problem; I just prefer having easy access to the Teams window to mute myself, etc instead of having to reach into the Xephyr window and unmaximize the vncviewer window.<p>People on the #sway IRC channel on Freenode suggested an alternative might be to use v4l2loopback to create a &quot;camera&quot; device that is sourced from the screen and then have Teams use it as a webcam, but I couldn&#x27;t get v4l2 to work on my distro (it kept insisting my distro&#x27;s ffmpeg couldn&#x27;t encode video even though it could) so I didn&#x27;t investigate further.')
