Were these concerns already addressed at this stage?<p>Regardless of whether the mutations are significant enough to affect vaccine efficacy, it won&#x27;t likely be a problem. These new mRNA vaccines have a development&#x2F;production time measured in weeks and months, not years. It changes vaccines from a hardware problem to a software problem. Once the underlying delivery technology is proven safe and effective, reacting to new strains will be as swift as patching a codebase. It&#x27;s hard to overstate what a massive advance in vaccine tech is happening here.')
