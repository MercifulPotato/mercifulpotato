I upvoted your post even though I disagree. I dislike the HN tradition of &quot;dislike = downvote.&quot; We need more posts like yours, not less.<p><pre><code>    And this common force is to do only what the \n    individual forces have a natural and lawful \n    right to do: to protect persons, liberties, \n    and properties;\n</code></pre>\nProgressives&#x2F;liberals&#x2F;etc wouldn&#x27;t disagree much with this premise, but we&#x27;d differ mightily on what this premise means in practical terms.<p>- The FDA is far from perfect, but it generally does a good job of protecting my person from snake oil medicine and adulterated foods.<p>- A federal healthcare mandate&#x2F;provider protects my person against dying of curable diseases because if I have no job&#x2F;insurance at the moment<p>- Taxpayer-funded education gives me the liberty to become literate and obtain a basic level of education so that I may become employable and so forth even if my parents are unwilling or unable to educate me<p>And so on. There are a lot of ways for your person, properties, and liberties to be threatened, most of which are indirect.<p><pre><code>    It has converted plunder into a right, in order to \n    protect plunder\n</code></pre>\nSounds like unfettered capitalism to me. I would strongly argue history tells us this is precisely what happens when government has too little influence and corporations therefore become centers of power.<p>We would agree, at least, that equally bad things happen when governments have too much power. We would disagree on what &quot;too much&quot; means, obviously.')
