A deeper analysis of this and how software manages them would be more interesting.<p>When the CPU utilization ramps up on M1 MacBooks, the user interface always remains buttery smooth. I haven&#x27;t been able to make the M1 Air drop a frame yet no matter how hard I push it. Meanwhile doing anything remotely CPU intensive on an Intel MacBook will turn the user interface into a janky stuttery mess.<p>I suspect the heterogeneous cores are the &quot;secret&quot; behind this. Performance tasks are delegated to the performance cores, leaving the efficiency cores free to instantly respond to any UI-bound tasks.')
