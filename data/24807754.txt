I think the top three problems from a time sink perspective were:<p>- unlocking the laptop (knowing an existing password, Apple ID or firmware password). Probably 3 in 10 laptops are non-trivial. I have 5 laptops with unknown firmware passwords that I am planning on removing the SPI flash on to wipe out the password (just for funsies... seems like an interesting challenge!)<p>- upgrading to Catalina via USB installation image. If the OS image is jumping several versions (or actually being downgraded from a security patch release), here be dragons. Typically the USB installer pulls down another installer via Wi-Fi and then has to perform a random &quot;this disk needs an upgrade&quot; routine which 50% of the time results in bad thing happening and I&#x27;d be left with the flashing question mark. Then its time to start over again.<p>- After installing and setting up Catalina (so I can smoke test the functionality), I&#x27;d wipe the disk and reinstall from USB one last time so it was fresh. Randomly, the re-install would fail in a mysterious way and I&#x27;d have to go around a third time.')
