Got it. I&#x27;m sick of this whole schtick. Its impossible to argue with people who have set it up so that everything they disagree with is racism. I don&#x27;t care. All it is is a cudgel to go after anyone who is an enemy, as has been proven time and again.<p>&gt; Are you arguing that the bulk of modern political and social issues are caused by affirmative action?!?<p>No, I&#x27;m saying a society that doesn&#x27;t care about merit (and that is part of what affirmative action and now the more scary move away from test scores and merit altogether) leads to a bunch of political and social ills. They don&#x27;t do this in China, for instance. It would be considered insanity. Yet, now China has the top scores in the world (1) and China will be or already is the most powerful country in the world.
