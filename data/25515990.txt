Item(by='rleigh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608716089, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25511318, text='I&#x27;ve experienced several different universities which used different teaching styles both as an undergraduate and an employee.<p>In one university, absolutely everything was assessed, every bit of lab work, every tutorial, the lot.  Unfortunately, this means you&#x27;re being assessed on lab work which might fail due to your inexperience, and it makes it unnecessarily stressful.<p>In another, the lab work and tutorials were almost never assessed.  They were learning exercises, which you could try and fail at without any consequences.  I found that you learned a lot more here, because you could try stuff out and fail without it affecting anything, and it was much less stressful.<p>In the latter university, you did three modules per term (~10 weeks) and you had a closed exam for each every term.  New paper set every year.  No coursework.  No chance for cheating.<p>The exams were also not &quot;high-stakes&quot;.  Each one made up a small percentage of the course total, which increased through the three years of the course, so there was no problem with doing badly on one or more.  It meant the term time was pretty much all about learning, with assessment right at the end.  I&#x27;m very much in favour of this simplicity, and it makes academic misconduct almost impossible.')
