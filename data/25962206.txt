This is not as easy as you may think[1].<p>You say: &quot;Am I being detained?  Am I free to go?&quot;<p>If yes, leave, and find a lawyer.  If the answer is no (or non-committal), you are under custody of the police.  You will likely be forced to disclose your name but that and maybe your address should be what you disclose[2].<p>Now you need to make it clear that you are invoking your right to remain silent.  Current jurisprudence around Miranda[3] makes it clear that is something you <i>must</i> actively invoke.  It is <i>not enough</i> to remain silent, that will not stop an interrogation.<p>You say: &quot;I will not answer any questions until I have a lawyer present&quot;.<p>Those two statements + your name are all you say.  That is it.<p>As far as getting a lawyer, you&#x27;ll have an opportunity to contact one after the interview has been stopped.  If you need a public defender you can ask for one at that time but you&#x27;ll likely be better off contacting your state bar association and asking for a referral.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Terry_v._Ohio" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Terry_v._Ohio</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hiibel_v._Sixth_Judicial_District_Court_of_Nevada" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hiibel_v._Sixth_Judicial_Distr...</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Berghuis_v._Thompkins" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Berghuis_v._Thompkins</a>')
