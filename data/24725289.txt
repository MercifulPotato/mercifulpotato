Per the APA:<p>Individual racism is a personal belief in the superiority of oneâ€™s race over another. It is linked to racial prejudice and discriminatory behaviors, which can be an expression of implicit and explicit bias.<p>Institutionalized racism is a system of assigning value and allocating opportunity based on skin color. It unfairly privileges some individuals and groups over others and influences social institutions in our legal, educational, and governmental systems. It is reflected in disparities in, but not limited to, wealth, income, justice, employment, housing, medicine, education, and voting. It can be expressed implicitly or explicitly and occurs when a certain group is targeted and discriminated against based on race.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apa.org&#x2F;topics&#x2F;racism-bias-discrimination" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apa.org&#x2F;topics&#x2F;racism-bias-discrimination</a>')
