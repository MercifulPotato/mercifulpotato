You need $100 to put your App in the store; you need to pay $1000 to use more than 10% of CPU performance; you need to pay $10000 to have an app bundle more than 10MB; and so on -- charging ridiculous amounts for access to high-performance battery-draining features. For dealing with app developers with deep pockets like Google -- you could charge the developer something egregious like $10 per install. At some point the screws are tight enough that you just build your app to behave better.<p>It would be absolutely dastardly -- but could actually have the effect of forcing app developers to care about performance :) They won&#x27;t care unless they have to. Web developers have to care about performance because of SEO (and click metrics...) but it only goes so far because it&#x27;s not forced.<p>I disagree completely with the walled garden model of iOS (and the direction of macOS) but, if it nonetheless exists,  I&#x27;d like to see them do something hardcore like this. The performance and battery gains would be out of this world.')
