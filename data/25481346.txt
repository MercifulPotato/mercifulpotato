I&#x27;ve been using Bevy to experiment with some accessible game mechanics for the past few months now. The speed from which I can go from &quot;I really want map exploration to report this and that detail on an entity, based on this and that characteristic,&quot; to code that just works and does what I want, is astounding. The degree to which I can then optimize that code, to only run it when this or that component changes value for instance, is also amazing. And when some Bevy subsystem or other isn&#x27;t up to my standards, I can plug in some other library, add a few components in my game, and more or less forget about the details of the lower-level integration. It&#x27;s an amazingly productive engine. If it&#x27;d launched a year earlier, I&#x27;d probably have built my just released game in Bevy rather than Godot.')
