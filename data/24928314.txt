Obviously there&#x27;s a demand for CoCs coming from somewhere, or there wouldn&#x27;t be a supply of them. What is driving this demand?<p>Is this demand driven by good intentions? By a genuine desire to improve diversity? To attract those who might otherwise feel less safe?<p>Is this demand driven by a &quot;fear of being left out&quot; because big names in tech are setting an example?<p>Is this demand entirely artificial, driven by power hungry people wallowing in self importance?<p>I don&#x27;t have any answers here. I&#x27;m just curious. I can certainly agree with wanting to help rid the world of sexism and racism. I&#x27;m not sure whether a tech conference or open source project is the best forum for that change.')
