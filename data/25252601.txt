The MD file is just to highlight the code correctly on VS Code on a single file. The PHP script interprets each section and processes it accordingly. This way I am not limited to markdown.<p>For example, for documentation, I use markdown, but for the website, that I want to control the layout better, I use JSON only, and when I need to create complex operation (as a consult to an external database), I use PHP. The markdown is very limiting, this was the motivation to create my own.')
