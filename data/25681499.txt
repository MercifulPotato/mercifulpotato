I don&#x27;t have much to offer here except some resources for further exploration. Currently I am reading &quot;Thinking Fast and Slow&quot; which explores related ideas to what Wallace is getting at here but with the rigour of psychology (for all the caveats that come with that).<p>You could also try Sam Harris&#x27; &quot;waking up&quot; app which claims to achieve what is talked about in Wallace&#x27;s essay through meditation. From my dabbling with it, it is somewhat true if not entirely true.<p>Finally you could explore broader works on the mind. I have been listening to audiobooks on animal intelligence (&quot;Other Minds&quot; and &quot;The Genius of Birds&quot;) and have made a start on a history of psychology&#x2F;psychiatry - &quot;The Mind Fixers&quot;, which is a bit dry but also filled with wonderful anecdotes and stories.')
