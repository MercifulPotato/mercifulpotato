I have the same setup at work. I don’t carry my dev environment with me. When I need to work I go to the ’do work stuff’ place.</i><p>This is exactly what I&#x27;ve returned to as well, and I&#x27;d forgotten for a while (or maybe didn&#x27;t understand) what was so good about this setup. Working only in my own &quot;do work stuff&quot; office at my own desk means when I&#x27;m not working, I&#x27;m free to enjoy things without technology getting in the way, and I find that when I do get to my desk I&#x27;m a lot more focused, energized, and ready to go. Best of all, I don&#x27;t have to deal with obscure laptop config issues.<p>I have a Linux box: it&#x27;s an ATX tower, a 40&quot; monitor, an Apple Magic Trackpad 2, and most significantly a mechanical keyboard. The importance of the latter can&#x27;t be overstated: having good key travel, Cherry MX switches, and tactile feedback makes development a vastly better experience.')
