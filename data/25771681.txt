The two companies have tried to publicly distance themselves from each other at times, but the Paradise Papers leak revealed that the two companies are, in fact, closely related ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.bitcoin.com&#x2F;paradise-papers-reveal-bitfinexs-devasini-and-potter-established-tether-already-back-in-2014&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.bitcoin.com&#x2F;paradise-papers-reveal-bitfinexs-de...</a> )<p>Keep in mind that Bitfinex profits from trading activity. They benefit substantially from both increased prices and increased volume, both of which occur after each Tether-driven surge in Bitcoin. The concern is that the Bitfinex operators are using Tether as a convenient pump to drive the market into a frenzy, from which they profit greatly by skimming trading fees off of the top. If only a fraction of people ever try to withdraw Tether, it&#x27;s entirely possible that they could cash out those few requests from trading profits, indirectly. If they can continue to pump the value of Bitcoin higher and higher, any potential fraud may never be exposed.')
