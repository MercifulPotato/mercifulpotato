Some burning will be replaced by other fuels sources, and as more alternatives are ramped up less and less of that moved gas will be burned. Whereas if it’s a stove, you’re committing to 20+ years of 100% gas burning on that stove. If you think ÇA can’t make a dent in gas consumption in 20 years then we just disagree about that.')
