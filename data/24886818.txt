HTTP is used to bootstrap the player, not to feed the content. The content itself is served over another protocol such as RTMP and that protocol is a streaming protocol (it sends chunked data) and it wasn&#x27;t intended for downloading files and writing them to disk as a singular binary blob. Obviously it can be used that way but it&#x27;s fair to say services like youtube-dl are using the protocol in ways it wasn&#x27;t originally intended to be used rather than content owners serving content on a protocol that was always designed for distributing files.<p>Not true at all, most YouTube videos are offered as plain webm files.<p>Also, keep in mind that recording TV&#x27;s is legal.')
