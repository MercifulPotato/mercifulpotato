For example the environment where I can buy a gas guzzler from you and drive away polluting the environment. There you need intervention but the framework of intervention and has to meet some specific criteria. I don&#x27;t want to digress.<p>Other than that I have yet to see a problem that isn&#x27;t solved by this scheme: increase the set of choices available to the person, and in some corner cases give them money so they are free to choose.<p>You have to bear in mind that the alternative to the free market approach is for someone else to come in an constrain either the buyer and seller in some way. Ths may work for a limited time and for a specific set of buyers and sellers but  it won&#x27;t work beyond that. Given that people have diverse and evolving needs the forced solution causes long term harm. Then you&#x27;ll need some kind of propoganda machine to either exagerate the good or down play the harm.<p>To be clear I do not believe that we have a free market in the US in a lot of areas and what people conceive of as free market -- or rather what has been shoved down their throat as free market is anything but that.')
