They&#x27;re not paying me for how many hours I was at my desk, they&#x27;re paying me for my economic output and my impact on the organization.<p>I get not every single job can have this level of flexibility, but the amount of &quot;theft of time&quot; and &quot;employee shoplifting&quot; that occur throughout America?
