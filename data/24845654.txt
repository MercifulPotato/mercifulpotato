C&#x2F;C++ libraries aren&#x27;t really hard, all you need is &quot;root directory&quot; with the common {&#x2F;include,&#x2F;lib} layout. For C you could even have binary libraries, but for C++ binary libraries are gonna be quite a problem, because there&#x27;s no ABI compatiblity and even different compiler flags can cause ABI incompatibility.')
