Biden did not pressure Ukraine to fire a prosecutor that was investigating Burisma. It&#x27;s something Trump has repeated countless times and something that&#x27;s been proven false countless times, but the Post still stated it as fact in the article.<p>Besides, the burden of proof applies here. &quot;You can&#x27;t prove it&#x27;s not fake&quot; is not a sensible approach. The burden is on the accuser to prove that the story is true, and the Post story does not do that.')
