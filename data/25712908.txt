If I go to a bar and start loudly suggesting I’m going to attempt to kill someone, surely the police if they hear about this will step in to find out if the threat is credible. Now if my bar has people discussing murdering people all the time, it’s become my bar that the police are going to close down. Freedom of speech has always been about criticism of government, it’s not a right to be able to say whatever mad illegal stuff pops into your head.')
