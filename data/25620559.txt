If you are a native and asking something even legal according the law (like double payment for working in weekend), your boss could fire you and there&#x27;re plenty of people want that job. Also suing that company for wrongful termination takes much time and effort, many blue collar workers even do not know how to do it. With all being said, the working condition is getting better comparing that decades ago, but it&#x27;s not because of government, it&#x27;s only because the economy are growing and it takes more money to hire people.')
