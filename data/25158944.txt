And the warmup time takes weeks. So rebooting has a major performance impact.<p>For the last 10 years, I have been using FreeBSD with ZFS. This has been working perfectly with good performance. But now I want to take advantage of even faster network speeds, with RoCE&#x2F;RDMA. And FreeBSD support for iSER, NVMe-OF is non-existant, while Linux has excellent support for these technologies.')
