I love learning about operating systems, compilers, and databases. In my free time, I&#x27;m writing my own C compiler in Rust, which you can find on my GitHub.<p>I&#x27;m looking for opportunities that inspire my passions, so internal infrastructure that handles big data sets, high throughput, or low latency are areas I&#x27;m super interested in. I&#x27;m mostly looking for work in either C++, Go, or Rust. I&#x27;ve been using Rust for hobby projects since 2014 and I love its ethos. I have used C++ in several professional opportunities, but it&#x27;s not quite as fun to write in your free time ;) I don&#x27;t have much experience with Go, but it would be very easy to pick up for the right opportunity.<p>I will be graduating from MIT this semester. Looking for full time work starting in early 2021.')
