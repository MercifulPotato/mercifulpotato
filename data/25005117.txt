In winter you can expect down to -30 and a whipping wind from the Baltic sea. Summers are only 2-3 months when it can be pleasant.<p>On the plus side it&#x27;s actually quite international. Some 20% of Helsinki residents are foreigners. So you can easily get by by not speaking Finnish. It&#x27;s also very walkable and public transportation is adequate so no car needed (also that&#x27;d cost you an arm and a leg)')
