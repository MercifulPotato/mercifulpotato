Item(by='refurb', descendants=None, kids=[25789513], score=None, time=1610708488, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25784763, text='Haha... look at how you’re framing it.<p>“Tussle with the cops” and “launch fireworks at federal buildings” and of course who is to blame? “The cops who did a terrible job of diffusing that energy”.<p>Why are you framing it in such soft terms?  I mean, cops had higher powered lasers aimed at their eyes.  Molotov cocktails throw at officers and federal buildings (I think most people call that arson).  Night, after night, after night.<p>Yet let me guess, you label the people that shoved their way into the Capitol building “seditionists” and “domestic terrorists”?<p>Why not couch their actions in the same soft terms?  Why does one riot at the Capitol deserve such condemnation when dozens of nights of rioting in Portland are waved away?  Why not blame the DC cops for not “diffusing the energy”?<p>I have no problem condemning what happened at the Capitol building.  I’m just tired of hypocrisy when judging the other side.')
