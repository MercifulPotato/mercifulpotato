Item(by='jiggawatts', descendants=None, kids=[25398262, 25398155], score=None, time=1607771972, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25397507, text='First: Here in Australia no major ISPs provide a native IPv6 service, and if they do, they don&#x27;t provide it to business. It&#x27;s obscenely difficult to obtain IPv6 in Australia. None of the major telcos do it, you have to go down the list to like the 5th or 6th biggest ones before it becomes an &quot;experimental option&quot; for residential connections only.<p>Second: Ever since IPv6 has been a thing, I&#x27;ve offered to customers the option to turn it on <i>for free</i>. No added charge. We&#x27;ll just flip the switches and it&#x27;s there. Not one customer, ever, has said &quot;yes&quot;. They&#x27;ve all actively <i>refused</i> to turn it on, for any purpose.<p>Third: The few times IPv6 has been forced upon our customers, mostly due to Microsoft Windows DirectAccess, it was the <i>network administrators</i> frothing at the mouth, ranting and raving about how they don&#x27;t want to do it, that DirectAccess should use IPv4 (I&#x27;ll call Redmond and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll get right on it!), etc...<p>Fourth: As you&#x27;ve mentioned, AWS, Azure, and GCP had practically zero IPv6 support until very recently. Now, they have <i>broken</i> IPv6 support which is worse than useless, because it gives the impression that the problem is with IPv6, not with the people holding on to an appreciating asset of IPv4 addresses that they intend to use to lock out the competition.<p>TL;DR: IPv6 is held back by a combination of bad ISPs, lazy network admins, and monopoly seeking public cloud providers.')
