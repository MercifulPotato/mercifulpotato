(Not every frame, but upon receiving an event.)  With modern GPUs, redrawing a whole frame is <i>super cheap</i>, even with integrated graphics.<p>The gain, then, is going to come from not having to rebuild the scene graph every frame.  And modern imgui implementations will cache the scene graph+layout anyway, and only rebuild the parts they need to.  Which is <i>slightly</i> more CPU-intensive, but not appreciably so.')
