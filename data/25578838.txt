Social media has been a thing for almost a hundred years starting with the telephone, then SMS, then online with IRC, video games, forums and early versions of social networks including Facebook.<p>Social media works well as long as its operator&#x27;s interests are aligned with its users&#x27;, which includes Facebook during its early days. Things start going bad when ads and &quot;engagement&quot; enters the picture; suddenly the operator&#x27;s intent is no longer to facilitate communication but to milk out as much &quot;engagement&quot; out of their users as possible, even if it means turning them against each other.<p>The telephone, despite being a form of &quot;social media&quot; still works fine (robocalling isn&#x27;t an issue in most EU countries). Forums still work fine. Hacker News still work fine. Why? Because in all these cases the incentives are either aligned (the phone company wants you to pay them) or at the very least not adversary (YCombinator doesn&#x27;t directly make money off people on HN, but still maintains it to foster good startup-related discussions that could benefit them later if those reading are involved in YC-backed startups in one way or another).<p>The solution seems to simply put some regulation around online advertising, whether it&#x27;s about privacy regarding targeting (like actually enforcing the GDPR) or liability for the ads (there are a lot of scam ads) as to make ad-supported social media unsustainable and force them to switch to an alternate business model where the incentives align with the users (people will have to pay for an account).')
