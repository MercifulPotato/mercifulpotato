Forget the camera boom height, or the time it might take to scan and process, there&#x27;s no sensor that will give you that kind of accuracy. The stereo baseline would be huge, and leave you entirely at the mercy of whatever texture or not a given part of the martian surface has to offer. LIDAR is OK if you definition of &quot;long range sensing&quot; is larger objects at 200m. The time cost for shipping back all the raw data for processing would kill performance as well, and if you wanted to process it locally the compute requirements would be just as high as doing the planning locally as well.<p>Onboard, or at least much closer,compute is the only way forward in autonomy. Honestly, the best bet on improving local compute would be to send a robot bulldozer, some C4, a rack full of milspec servers, and a big RTG. Blow a nice crater, push the servers to the bottom, and bury them in dirt for shielding. If you get really lucky, you could find some old cave or lava tube.')
