When Google decided to make a run at Kubernetes, we decided to switch, despite having quite a few larger customers (financial, animation studios) urging us to go down the Mesos path. For us it was less history and accumulated baggage, the opportunity to learn from previous systems, to make the container spec a bit more core to the platform (since Mesos already had fairly opinionated choices in place), and to be less “high scale scheduling” and more “application infrastructure for the masses”.<p>I respected the choices and commitment the Mesosphere team had made, and their execution always reminds me that sometimes you have to commit, sometimes you have to pivot, and sometimes you don’t know which way is going to pay off.  We might have gone down this path as well, and sometimes you’re not in the right place despite everything.')
