With a persistent widget tree which is only manipulated by diffing it against the current frame&#x27;s UI description provided by the user code?<p>The important feature of immediate mode UIs is that there&#x27;s only one sequential piece of code for UI creation, updating and input handling. All I&#x27;m saying as the framework user is basically &quot;this is what I want the UI to look like in the current frame&quot;.<p>E.g. if the UI that&#x27;s described in the current frame by user code is completely identical to the last frame&#x27;s UI, exactly &quot;nothing&quot; would happen, the internal widget tree wouldn&#x27;t change, and nothing would be rendered.')
