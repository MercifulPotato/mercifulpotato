But the developers of the language and libraries made it simple and nice enough that its constructs are very close to what you would call a high-level language. I have been using rust for my company&#x27;s project backend server and even though I don&#x27;t have all the libs that I need as crates, they are simple enough that I can code them myself. I wouldn&#x27;t choose any other language, the sheer peace-of-mind Rust and its compiler gives me when my build is successful and my tests pass is hard to give up. Rust is awesome and I expect most of the web dev frameworks to be built in the next 5 years, I hope my company is able to help with that :)')
