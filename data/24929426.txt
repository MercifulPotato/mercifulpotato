The first has things like &quot;adapt a style guide&quot;, &quot;Decide on comments or no comments in code&quot; and &quot;Admin user&quot;. The second one has things like &quot;Implement a performance evaluation and career development system,&quot; and proposes you do these things iteratively over 90 days.<p>If you&#x27;re the head of a new startup, you&#x27;re lucky if you have more than one person writing code after 90 days.<p>The most practical checklist I&#x27;ve seen is Steve Blank and Bob Dorf&#x27;s The Startup Owner&#x27;s Manual. It&#x27;s still not very practical, but it highlights very important things like landing sales, getting product market fit, and common mistakes. A lot of these other checklists will have you spend all your time doing busywork but at the end of your 90 days, you&#x27;ll have your organization charts but still won&#x27;t make a cent.')
