I have to say that after buying a good mouse I don&#x27;t deal with random disconnects of a mouse, of a cord in the way, mouse responding poorly on some surface where I have to work and an awesome way to scroll quickly with that special scroll wheel that MX Master has. It just works and I can concentrate on work. For the keyboard it feels so much better to feel the response of the keyboard, I enjoy typing on it and as I spend most of my day typing, it is quite important for me to feel right.\nI would compare this to having more expensive comfortable good looking clothes instead of some itchy, not well fitting mediocre looking clothes. They cover you the same, but you feel so much better in the former.')
