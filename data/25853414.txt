Methane has a half life of 10 years, as compared to carbon dioxide&#x27;s thousands or tens of thousands.<p>Also take care to inspect, carefully, what these figures represent. This graph only counts transportation of final food product to stores under the &quot;transportation&quot; category:  &quot;Emissions from energy use in the transport of food items&quot;. In other words, the emissions from taking the packets of meat from a slaughterhouse to grocery store shelves. Not shipping loads of grain to ranches. The actual article [1] this image comes from explains this more clearly, &quot;Food transport accounted for only 5% of this. This means that if we were to take the case where we assume a household sources all of their food locally, the maximum reduction in their footprint would be 5%&quot;. Transportation of feed to ranches is categorized under feed, not transportation.<p>This is why estimates for the amount of carbon emissions meat is responsible often vary by a large margin. Some place meat, alone, as responsible for 14-19% of emissions. Others place all food production (not just meat) as under 5%. It largely depends on whether you include things like transportation, nitrogen fixing via the haber process, and land conversion under the umbrella of food production or in their own separate categories.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;food-choice-vs-eating-local" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;food-choice-vs-eating-local</a>')
