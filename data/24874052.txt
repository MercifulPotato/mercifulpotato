I gleaned a new appreciation for stuff I&#x27;ve hated for a long time. npm helped me realize that maven is merely bad, no unforgivable. For instance.<p>I still can&#x27;t believe the nodejs universe doesn&#x27;t have back pressure (eg caolan&#x2F;async) baked into the stack. Those were some pretty difficult conversations. My teammates had <i>no idea</i> what I was talking about or why my fixes worked.<p>Absolute paths for importing modules (requires) still makes me laugh.<p>But criticizing nodejs, js, etc is rather pointless. Like PHP, it&#x27;s fractally wrong.')
