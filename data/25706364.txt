It means the Postal Service can&#x27;t refuse to deliver his letters. In fact, Trump can - and should - be prosecuted for inciting an attempted coup d&#x27;etat. He should be, because, had the coup been successful, he wouldn&#x27;t, and the US would be under a new form of government that could no longer be called a democracy (and don&#x27;t even start saying it&#x27;s not because &quot;it&#x27;s a Republic&quot;).<p>Twitter is a private company. As are Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest and others and they have every right do deny service to users they deem undesirable, for whatever terms of service those users agreed to respect when signing up. In fact, as a user, I think they have the obligation of removing such users from the platform and to enforce equally the terms of service, regardless of said user&#x27;s popularity and&#x2F;or profitability.')
