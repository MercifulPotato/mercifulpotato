A decent house in the less swanky areas of Tokyo&#x27;s 23 districts runs about $ 0.5 M IIRC.<p>Food costs about the same - a ramen is about ~400-500 å†† (~ a Chipotle burrito ?), and food at restaurants would cost about the same as the US. Groceries, and Electronics cost slightly higher. Finding Vegan&#x2F;Vegetarian food is like coming across an Oasis in a desert.<p>Nevertheless, Japan is a far more interesting place.')
