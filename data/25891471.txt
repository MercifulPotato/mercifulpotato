I wonâ€™t settle for anything less than 1.0 mm nib and black color, so that the writing should stand out in contrast to the white page.<p>Last year a similar discussion [1] had cropped up on HN, and based on the suggestions I got there, I finalized Uniball Gel Impact. It&#x27;s smooth, has good thickness, and feels like an almost 1.0 mm thicc pen. The writing stands out on the paper and also the contrast is unmissable. The only downside I feel is that I runs out quickly, within a couple of hours. It&#x27;s quite a departure from my used to feeling of having ball pens which last for weeks and even months. Smudge is there, and the ink takes about 4-5 seconds to dry.<p>The only other gel pen which I find competitive to Uniball Gel Impact is Pilot V10 and Baoke. Pilot V10 ain&#x27;t that smooth but lasts longer. Baoke is almost as same as Uniball, just 10% less. If Uniball Gel Impact = 10&#x2F;10 then Baoke = 9&#x2F;10.<p>If anyone here knows any other decent black gel pen that&#x27;s 1.0 mm in nib thickness, please let me know.<p>Ref. \n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24963031" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24963031</a>')
