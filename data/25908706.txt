When you start earning vast sums of money very quickly, and see other people do the same, you start getting a sense that money isn’t really worth working all that hard for.<p>I’ve been making about 5k or 6k a week regularly this past year in the stock market with little effort, through stock appreciation and selling options. It definitely makes me feel less motivated to do my job, but the one thing that keeps me going is that I know this situation is not forever and the market goes through feast and famine cycles, so I need to maintain a job. But certainly nothing more ambitious than that, I have no plans to ascend into management or whatever bullshit that has me taking more work and responsibility for slightly more pay. Once I have a resilient source of passive income I’m off to be a gentleman hacker. Working hard for money is a waste of life.')
