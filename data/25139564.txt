It&#x27;s like the switch to natural language search means that Google fixates on the most generic terms in my query and returns the most generic results - often shopping&#x2F;blog-spam based. Adding insult to injury, advanced search methods don&#x27;t seem to work anymore. I have little success when trying to be explicit with quotes and NOT operators. I also feel like I can&#x27;t trust Google search results because they&#x27;re trying to tailor them to what they <i>think</i> I want to see. It&#x27;s troubling that when I tell someone to google something they probably won&#x27;t be seeing the same results as I do.<p>And the worst part about this is the fact that other search engines are taking Google&#x27;s lead and results from alternative engines like Bing and DuckDuckGo are also declining in utility. Does anyone know of a search engine that doesn&#x27;t use natural language processing?')
