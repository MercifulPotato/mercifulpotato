They are <i>literally the ones trying to oppress their political enemies</i>. They are attempting to steal a legitimate democratic election with astonishingly absurd claims of widespread fraud. Do not weasel around this or try to rewrite history - what these people did was treason.<p>These people are domestic terrorists, white supremacists, racists and far-right extremist militia members. The time for dialog with these tinfoil hat conspiracy theorists is over. They committed an armed insurrection against the United States government.<p>This is not a time for forgiveness or debate. It&#x27;s time for severe consequences for these terrorists.')
