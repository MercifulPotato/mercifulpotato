I would think one off-the-shelf NAS is firmly within the scope of an unlimited data storage plan.<p>A typical home NAS is probably on the order of 10TB. I have a feeling that would be OK for &quot;unlimited&quot; cloud storage, even if the provider took a loss on those customers. The problem users are certainly storing hundreds or thousands of TB. In the age of inexpensive 1GBit home internet connections, one could theoretically store ~10TB <i>per day</i>.')
