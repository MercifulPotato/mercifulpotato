This isn&#x27;t normal, but on markets, it is.<p>If you treat starving kids as important then you will have more starving kids. If you treat starving kids as unimportant or undesirable you will try your best to prevent them from being created in the first place.<p>The vast majority of necessary policies that you need to change in the relevant countries have absolutely nothing to do with individual charity. A lot of what is needed is simple infrastructure projects. People waste their time acquiring water on foot instead of getting a water truck delivery. You can drive a water truck for 600 miles and it&#x27;s still more economical than walking. The problem is often that there are no roads suitable for 20 ton trucks. You&#x27;ll get stuck on the dirt roads so no delivery happens at all.<p>People think of complicated solutions like drone delivery of medicine because the government fails to maintain or set up basic infrastructure. It all boils down to government corruption and people&#x27;s desire to work around it. It&#x27;s not going to work out.')
