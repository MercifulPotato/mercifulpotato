That isn&#x27;t to say sanctions are morally pure: they exact a huge cost on the regular people who live in the countries subject to them. However, they&#x27;re still probably better than being bombed.<p>The more things that are not settled in dollars means the reduced effectiveness of sanctions and the higher likelyhood conflicts will escalate into hot wars.<p>On the other hand, the US not being able to dictate to everyone else is probably a good thing itself, so I&#x27;m not sure on net what the best outcome is.')
