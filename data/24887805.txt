Item(by='Klinky', descendants=None, kids=[24887876], score=None, time=1603645504, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24887633, text='If you&#x27;re cooking anything with meat or imported produce, you&#x27;re still damaging the environment, regardless of where it&#x27;s cooked. Also your leftovers need to be put into something(often plastic) and stored in a refrigerated or frozen environment(electric&#x2F;carbon costs), then reheated(electric&#x2F;carbon cost). If you get tired of eating the same thing after 3 days and the rest rots away in your fridge, you&#x27;ve just created a ton of waste, or if you think to yourself you&#x27;re going to spend 3 hours doing weekly meal-prep, but then flake out and don&#x27;t do it, you just wasted everything. Some people are just terrible chefs or do not have the energy for it after working 50 - 60 hours in the week.<p>Also you could make a case that large houses with nice kitchens also have environmental costs to build and maintain, and living in small apartments with communal kitchens or restaurants nearby is better.')
