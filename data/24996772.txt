Regardless of what the problems of the client are or even if they have any problems.<p>This makes the job of the management consultants easier - they know what the answer is, they just need to gather some plausible sounding data to support it (or make it up).<p>The amazing thing is that this, from the viewpoint of an executive, will actually work for a few years - numbers will look great and the company will survive long enough for the executives to move on based on their track record of being &quot;turn around&quot; experts at their last company.')
