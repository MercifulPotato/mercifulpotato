Roughly 2 years ago vega20 and tu10 series have around 13 billion.\n4 years ago most common models +-7m and if you look further back it roughly doubles every 2 years.\nIn 2031 we will have mainstream GPUs with 1 trillion transistors. Compare that with the 1996 voodoo 1 with just 1 million transistors.')
