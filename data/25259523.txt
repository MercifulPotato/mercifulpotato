Gold and silver generals move one tile at a time.<p>There is 1 bishop and 1 rook per player and no queen. And as a result pieces are not constantly crossing the whole board.<p>Pawns are more consistent too. The move forward, one tile at a time. No conditionally diagonal moves or 2 tile moves or en-passant.')
