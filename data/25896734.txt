They ask &quot;what framework should I build this on?&quot; and start their tiny portfolio site built upon a massively overpowered suite of enterprise-level software with a million features they&#x27;ll never, ever need.<p>Then they might drop in ten or fifteen separate external libraries because using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is just &quot;so 1995&quot;.<p>Then they start thinking about AJAX and microservices because rendering an entire page on the server side is utterly unthinkable in 2021.<p>Then they cram the site full of third-party services (because your tiny home-brew website will definitely benefit from Newrelic monitoring).<p>Then they might start on unit testing.<p>Finally they package everything up using at least seven different dependency managers, because a Github project without 100 useless ancillary files (<i>grunt.js</i>, app.yaml, travis.yml, composer.json, .gitignore, etc. etc.) is obviously not acceptable.<p>And this is why I hate modern web development.')
