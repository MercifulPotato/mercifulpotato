VR isn&#x27;t new at all and besides gaming it really didn&#x27;t pick up speed in any other industry. If anything AR could be a &quot;revolution&quot;, if miniaturised enough (contact lenses size).<p>I received a free HTC vive after participating to a conference in 2016, used it a month and it&#x27;s in a drawer since then. None of what the speakers were promising happened, VR is still the thing you get out once every 6 months to show it to a friend, the wow factor lasts 30 mins.')
