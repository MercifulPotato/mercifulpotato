Our exams are usually about 2 hours long and have about 4-5 problems to solve. After this particular exam, a friend of mine was surprised that I hadn&#x27;t seen the last problem with the answer in our professor&#x27;s book (she has seen it the night before. Looks like all her friends had too). Ina mathematics exam with 4 problems, I can&#x27;t exaggerate the relief one would feel if one of the problems is already solved for you. Not sure how often this happens, but it seems like it&#x27;s quite common. I was in a special scholar&#x27;s group. I was more into going to the library, exploring related theorems and stuff while except for a handful of others, most my peers were just doing past papers and practice questions for the exam. I did okay, but I felt like trying to learn more and explore things in university was a liability as far as exams concerned. I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to do it. Felt like a waste of time.')
