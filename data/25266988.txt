Front End Engineers | Cambridge, MA, USA (Boston area) | Full Time and Co-Op&#x2F;INTERNS\nBiology has talented PhD Biologists spend 5 hours a day on hard to reproduce, unoptimized minutia that isnâ€™t innovative. Radix Labs hopes to accelerate biotech innovation like early compilers did for computing by enabling lab protocols to seamlessly operate and be optimized across physical labs. Our software makes biology reproducible, faster, more efficient, and lets smart biologists focus on the science instead of managing the implementation. We do this by developing a compiler, operating system, scheduler, and device drivers for biology labs and protocols. We have funding from Ycombinator (S18), Firstminute Capital, MIT&#x27;s The Engine, and Nikesh Arora.<p>Technologies: 100% Scala code base but we don&#x27;t require you know it already. (It&#x27;s helpful if you have past functional programming experience with Erlang, Ocaml, Prolog, Haskell, or similar.) Other tech: HashiCorp stack (Nomad, Consul, &amp; Terraform), Apache Kafka, Akka, ScalaJS React, Z3, Cats, Bazel w&#x2F; rules_scala, (some) AWS.<p>We&#x27;ll hire smart, good people who are interested in working with us regardless of openings. Right now we&#x27;re especially looking for a brave, experienced front end developer to lead developing our front end visual programming language that biologists use to describe their protocols to the rest of our software. We&#x27;re also happy to hire people who are interested in working on compilers and virtual machines for biology labs. Come join our world-class diverse, inclusive, and caring team! You won&#x27;t be the only woman, trans person, POC, latino&#x2F;a&#x2F;x, non-US citizen, wearer of silly hats, or parakeet! We will consider remote candidates and those who need visa sponsorship on a case-by-case basis. We offer equity, great salary, unlimited PTO, medical, dental, and vision insurance, mechanical keyboard budget, and flexible work hours.
