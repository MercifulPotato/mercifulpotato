If I see their contribution but I don&#x27;t want to accept it, I&#x27;m forced to come up with a new creative solution that a court would (maybe, hopefully) consider original.<p>This is especially important for CC0&#x2F;public-domain projects, where many contributors will not fully understand the implications of contributing and may not be in a position to release code into the public domain.')
