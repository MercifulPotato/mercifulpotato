They always wanted Q. But Google made a fundamental breakthrough in business logic, discovering that P -&gt; ¬Q.<p>It should be noted that ¬P -&gt; Q is not automatically implied. Plenty of companies are ¬P ∧ ¬Q. Perhaps they are not ¬P enough? Perhaps they are too much ¬P? But very few manage to be purely P ∧ Q.')
