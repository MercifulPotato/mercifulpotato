Mutation makes things like `cfg.tabs[2].title = &quot;Suspended&quot;` possible to write in one line. Trying to achieve the same thing with only immutable data structures forces you to clone title, then clone cfg.tabs[2] with a new title, then clone cfg.tabs with a new [2], then clone cfg with a new tabs.')
