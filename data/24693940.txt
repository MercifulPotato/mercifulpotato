In practice, changing that away from the distribution default can break other people&#x27;s code, and the win of an LTS is not spending time on that stuff.<p>But you can get yourself a Python 3.8, then you can build venvs, run a Jupyter kernel in it, whatever you like. If you can download or rebuild all the modules you want in a 3.8 venv, you&#x27;re pretty set. And everything wanting Python 3.6 on your LTS still works.')
