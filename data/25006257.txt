What if you have a field on class &quot;Zoo&quot; named &quot;containers&quot; and you want to replace it with &quot;animal_containers&quot;, but only for the &quot;Zoo&quot; class? There are probably other usages of &quot;containers&quot; in the code, with no easy way for something like sed to distinguish between &quot;zoo_instance.containers&quot; and &quot;car_instance.containers&quot;.<p>You need an editor that can understand &quot;this usage of &#x27;containers&#x27; refers only to class &#x27;Zoo&#x27;, so I should find all variables of type &#x27;Zoo&#x27; which reference the &#x27;containers&#x27; field and change those.&quot;')
