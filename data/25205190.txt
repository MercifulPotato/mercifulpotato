I know the contracts proposals have been shot down several times, but those I think would help a lot.  People will only really code defensively if there is a some gain.  Having the compiler enforce and use contracts for optimization would be the only way to ensure adoption.  If people thought they could get a 5% speed boost, they would annotate their code with more of their assumptions.')
