Every official website in the country is in the four languages.\nPublic education is delivered in the local language without exception.\nPolitics is done in the local language. Justice also.\nAll public signs are in both spanish and the local language everywhere.\nLocal versions of names (eg Sanxenxo instead of spanish San Genjo, Girona instead of Gerona) are always used in TV even when speaking in spanish. You get fined if your restaurant menu is only in spanish, at least in Catalonia.<p>Honest question: what else do you need? To be able to speak solely in basque when in Murcia?')
