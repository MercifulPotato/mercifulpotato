You can put a bed and a night stand and that&#x27;s it.<p>Also a lot of 700 sq ft apartment with 3-4 bedrooms have 2 bathrooms which further reduces the total available space. It&#x27;s quite common for a family of 5-6 (2 kids, parents plus grand parents) + 1 live-in helper to live in such an apartment. The live-in helper usually gets a windowless closet for her room (so around 21 sq ft) that&#x27;s next to the kitchen (I have a hard time with the kind of living conditions offered to helpers but I guess it&#x27;s really a shitty situation in terms of space for everyone). This is the living situation of a middle class family able to afford a 4,500 usd&#x2F;month apartment and a 700 usd&#x2F;month live-in helper (there&#x27;s no daycare available in hk which is why a lot end up getting a live-in helper after having kids).<p>With covid, schools have been closed and people had to work from home making things much harder.')
