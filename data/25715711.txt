President Trump’s Twitter account and Free Speech are two completely disconnected, unrelated concepts.<p>It requires fascism-sympathizing and racism-sympathizing to even suggest otherwise.<p>At this point, anything of the vein like, “Banning Trump from Twitter is unfair censorship” or “Banning Parler from app stores is unfair censorship” is just hate speech disguised as if it’s an attempt to uphold freedom.')
