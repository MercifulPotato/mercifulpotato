My guess is that Nokia would likely subcontract some of the electronics to companies that have experience in making rad-hard versions of existing technologies like BAE Systems or 3d Plus.<p>Thermal management is definitely hard, but this would be pretty run-of-the-mill thermal management for most space companies. I know this still means expensive but it&#x27;s not an extreme thermal challenge like the Parker Solar Probe (keep things normal temps in a REALLY hot environment) or JWST (keep a very large structure at a VERY cold temperature)')
