Strictly on the value proposition of the dollar and discussing economics, the savings of common folks in any amount cannot be invested into production assets meaningfully with real yields as prices rise = they are worthless.  Meanwhile homes, auto, healthcare, education, all rise and what you are holding has less purchasing power.  Inflation is very real even if the price of specific items like your socks are not rising substantially.  Also CPI is a basket created by the fed to sell bonds, it has no other purpose.')
