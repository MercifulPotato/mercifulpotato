So go make your research before you getting heavily invested in bitcoin<p>Anyways, I am still in bitcoin, but everyday im thinking more about getting out, it baffles me how with certain volume, the price goes down 10% in the course of 3 days and then with 1&#x2F;8 of that very same volume it recovers the % lost plus additional %.<p>I am starting to enjoy betting money on markets, thus im visiting WSB every other day and picking up the trends there and betting them on robinhood, it hasnt gone bad at all for me, it&#x27;s a steady income if you don&#x27;t really depend on it or risk anything you can&#x27;t lose, but I am not getting that feeling from bitcoin at all, everytime I check the coinbase APP when I wake up, my hands literally shake because of the fear that while I slept the price went down some insane %')
