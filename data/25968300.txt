If yes, then did you set randrepeat to 0? I&#x27;m asking this because fio by default uses the same sequence of offsets for each job, in which case there might be data re-used across jobs. I had verified that with blktrace a few years back, but it might have changed recently.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usenix.org&#x2F;conference&#x2F;fast19&#x2F;presentation&#x2F;kourtis" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usenix.org&#x2F;conference&#x2F;fast19&#x2F;presentation&#x2F;kourti...</a><p>edit: fixed typo')
