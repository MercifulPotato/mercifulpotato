They export subsidized Nuclear at a loss and import rentable and fossil fuel generated power.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Electricity_sector_in_France#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:Echg_internx_élec_France.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Electricity_sector_in_France#&#x2F;...</a><p>Frances issue is the demand curve isn’t a steady state so Nuclear needs on average more supplemental power than solar to make up the difference. Unless you leave plants mostly idle at extreme cost or have vast energy storage you can’t get to even 50%.  Consumer rates are heavily subsidized and their close ties with Europe’s grid mostly hides these issues.  However power plant utilization still hovers around 80% which means the country pays significantly more for nuclear than countries with better utilization.<p>Things would look much worse for France if surrounding countries increased Nuclear generation as the seasonal, night time, and weekend surplus would increase.')
