Should it be legal for a rich parent to sell their car to their offspring for below market value? How much below market value?<p>In fact, this is already illegal, but there&#x27;s no enforcement. (Enforcement would be challenging in any realistic scenario; it always is when every party to a transaction benefits from it.)<p>According to the law, whenever you obtain anything from anyone (not just relatives) at a price below market value, you have to pay taxes on the difference.')
