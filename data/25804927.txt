In fact DO could have written their auth logic <i>in rails</i> with Tyk&#x27;s gRPC plugin support.<p>It also has the same performance curve as OpenResty these days as it&#x27;s been around for over 5 years and used in critical high-performance infrastructure projects.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tyk.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tyk.io</a><p>&#x2F;Shill')
