I have a hacked-together solution including 2x GPUs, an HDMI 2.0 KVM, a &quot;USB switch&quot; which is flaky as hell (because the KVM emulates HID devices &#x2F; doesn&#x27;t support USB 3.0.), the guest (Windows) and host (Linux) share memory to avoid latency in the audio path, a second NVMe drive so the guest can have native access to storage, a second USB controller so I can pass USB 3.0 devices to the guest, and I bought an entire new motherboard and CPU (AMD TR 3960x + TRX40) because the Intel non-server silicon doesn&#x27;t do PCIe ACS[1] and I got sick of building a custom kernel, etc.<p>All this so that I can essentially play two games on Windows that I can&#x27;t&#x2F;won&#x27;t play on Linux. One is Stellaris: which runs on Linux but has massive issues w&#x2F; Wayland. The other is FFXIV (an MMO) which I&#x27;m sure you could coax into running w&#x2F; Wine, but I don&#x27;t want to get banned from an online-only game because of some overzealous anti-cheat thinking Wine is a hack.<p>At this point I think I&#x27;m a slave to the sunk-cost fallacy. I&#x27;ve entertained buying a 300$ KVM[2] just to simplify this setup a tiny bit. I&#x27;m severely constrained in terms of case&#x2F;motherboard&#x2F;CPU options because of the insane amount (&amp; spacing) of PCIe I&#x2F;O required, before getting a proper system that supports ACS I would constantly run into weird QEMU&#x2F;KVM&#x2F;kernel bugs, etc.<p>I want off Mr. Bone&#x27;s Wild Ride.<p>[1]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vfio.blogspot.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;08&#x2F;vfiovga-faq.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vfio.blogspot.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;08&#x2F;vfiovga-faq.html</a>\n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.level1techs.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;kvm-switch-single-monitor-model" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.level1techs.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;kvm-switch-single-mon...</a>')
