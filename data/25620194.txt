Item(by='bronikowski', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609658586, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25616945, text='1) fully remote now, after first lockdown I only went in when I wanted (a day or two a week)<p>2) about 30 minutes of brisk walk<p>3) No major changes, I worked outside of the offices for most of last 10 years. Lack of hiking hurted me far more<p>4) Pros: I enjoy quiet of my home vs. noise of the office Cons: people are not good at communicating. I enjoy async-remote more than replicating everything that happened in the office.<p>5) Nope<p>6) I hope for the sake of non-tech people offices will be back. Most of people I work with live in small spaces and have small kids. I also enjoy quick back and forth face to face meeting and webcams can not replace that for me.')
