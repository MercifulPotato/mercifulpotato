It’s a genuine inquiry and one I share. They’re a fascinating subject of study that I feel needs to continue.<p>I sincerely hope the trend that we’ve been seeing where compounds like DMT, MDMA, and Psilocybin are getting the proper scientific attention they severely lacked for over 50 years. I understand why that is, but it’s a shame that it happened at all. Imagine where we would be if we had had that time to study and put these and other substances to good use.')
