The documentation was non existent and reliability was abysmal.\nThe product was used in hospitals non the less. I still have nightmares about it. Granted, the functionality was non essential (it wasn&#x27;t anything remotely related to life support. But still, it was used in a freaking hospital). I tried convincing the management to at least switch to RPi, but RPi was three times more expensive and according to my tests was not reliable enough to convince them. Cheap ARM boards are at best interesting toys and you should not even try to make any products with them. Ignoring this will be your downfall. The company was bleeding money left and right for fixing the already sold products. That&#x27;s were I gtfo')
