It took 11 months to design a vaccine from scratch, conduct phase I safety trials, phase 2 human safety and dosage trials, and a phase 3 trial to determine efficacy.</i><p>The standards for the phase 1-3 trials are largely set by the FDA. Further, the whole idea that I can&#x27;t weigh my own risks, and sign a paper saying &quot;I acknowledge that this treatment is not fully tested, and choose to take my chances&quot; is driven by the FDA. So yes, the time span before the public had access was driven by the FDA.')
