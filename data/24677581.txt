They have their own strengths but usability isn&#x27;t one of them IMO.<p>&gt; the whole app ecosystem is a shock, where it&#x27;s normal that basic tools (like FTP Client) cost 50EUR or come crippled (Like FileZilla). It&#x27;s a horrible feeling coming from OSS world.<p>OSS versions of tools like FTP clients exist in the macOS world as well[0]. Theres a small but high quality ecosystem of independant mac software thats been around for a long time.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cyberduck.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cyberduck.io&#x2F;</a> <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;serhii-londar&#x2F;open-source-mac-os-apps" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;serhii-londar&#x2F;open-source-mac-os-apps</a><p>Edit: added a link and removed a sentence.')
