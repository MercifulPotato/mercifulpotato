As a language for explorative tools and analysis is on par of python (strict preference between the two according to taste).<p>To me the biggest flaw currently is the poor &quot;catch&quot; syntax for exception handling. There are countless spots where exceptions are incorrectly caught at random points due to the catch-all semantics hiding&#x2F;masking&#x2F;breaking stuff. This is one area where I really find the syntax has been chosen poorly and it&#x27;s causing real damage.')
