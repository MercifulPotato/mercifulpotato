Whether the results they present periodically are actually still impressive given all that burn rate, I&#x27;ll leave it for the reader to decide.</i><p>Why would the burn rate make the results unimpressive? The author just made a comparison to MIT, which has a burn rate 3 times as large, and no one questions if their results are impressive or not each year.<p>It also seems like a cheap criticism of AlphaFold to say it hasn&#x27;t solved protein folding by citing the NP-hardness of the problem. There&#x27;s widespread expert consensus that DeepMind made a spectacular advance in the area, and the author characterizes it by saying, &quot;well, they didn&#x27;t solve an NP-hard problem...&quot;?<p>The author seems pretty abrasive to be honest. This is a disingenuous &quot;AI Update&quot; for 2020.')
