You place them backs-up and have to announce what they are (you only announce the part that matches - like &quot;three aces&quot;) and you&#x27;re allowed to cheat (putting more cards than you said or placing other cards than you said you did) but if someone checks you immediately after your turn - either he or you take all the cards from the stack depending on who was right.<p>There are lots of other variants but that was what we found the most interesting.<p>It&#x27;s a very good simulator of lying because there is hidden information and people might be able to tell when you lie (if you announce three aces and somebody has two for example). But then people can also ask around if others have aces to check you. But other people might lie to make them take cards.<p>There&#x27;s lots of strategies including pretending to lie and pretending to pretend to lie etc. It goes many levels deep. Simple strategies like &quot;provide many details to show you don&#x27;t lie&quot; or &quot;provide few details to pretend you lie&quot; usually lose to more sophisticated ones.')
