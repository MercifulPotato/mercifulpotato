We were wrong only by 20 years. Good times.<p>Yeah that was a very long running joke about ray tracing: “real-time ray tracing is only five years away... and always will be”. ;)<p>&gt; The problem with ray tracing isn’t writing one, the problem is its usability, to get the most realistic AND fast enough.<p>Times sure have changed eh? 640x480&#x2F;30s is ~ 10k rays&#x2F;sec. Now we have ray tracing GPUs that can do well over 10B rays&#x2F;sec with full floating point. More than a million times faster, not even counting precision &amp; scene size, crazy right?! I’m working in the field and still blown away by what people are doing in real time in the last few years, fully path traced scenes with global illumination that are hard to distinguish from photographs...')
