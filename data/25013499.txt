Item(by='Impossible', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604730032, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25010213, text='wgpu and bgfx might be good options. Creative coding frameworks might be work looking at also (Processing, Cinder, Three.js, etc). Also lightweight &quot;engines&quot; like Sokol, Oryol, Raylib and Macroquad might be good options. There are a lot of options just not well known. Someone wanting the perfect high level but not too low level graphics API, where high and low are kind of arbitrary (don&#x27;t want an engine, no or minimal boilerplate, most work done with code instead of a editor&#x2F;gui, etc) is a common theme.')
