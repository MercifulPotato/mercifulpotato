One of the issues these smaller sites&#x2F;services face is recall. News like this helps raise awareness, but it&#x27;s difficult for people to remember and actually start using this habitually. We included bookshop.org prices in our browser plugin ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbboookkksss.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbboookkksss.com&#x2F;</a>) so you can actually see the price (and buy) on bookshop, even if you happen to be browsing on amazon (which I imagine is the most common default)')
