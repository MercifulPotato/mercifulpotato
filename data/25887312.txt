If I put some money in a smart contract, it behaves <i>exactly</i> as specified in the smart contract. If I decide to invest in some overly complicated ICO (for which I can fully read the programmatic contract before I invest), and I lose money, and then I say &quot;I am a poor unsophisticated investor who was taken advantage of, I want my money back,&quot; doesn&#x27;t that fundamentally imperil the value proposition of having a smart, programmatic contract? Now only <i>most</i> of the contract is on the blockchain and there&#x27;s also some hidden caselaw - and &quot;mostly deterministic&quot; means nondeterministic.<p>That is - shouldn&#x27;t people who believe in cryptocurrency be saying this is fine and good and working as intended, and not a problem to &quot;fix&quot;?')
