It may be due to increased liquidity, it might be stimulus checks, it might be all sorts of stuff. You&#x27;re speculating, and if you&#x27;re going to make a claim like that we&#x27;re gonna need a citation.<p>I&#x27;m not saying these things don&#x27;t matter, I&#x27;m saying [citation needed] that it&#x27;s got anything to do with the Fed.<p>If I&#x27;m the only doctor in town and I charge $1000 one day for a surgery and $2000 the next because I feel like it, that&#x27;s not inflation.<p>&gt; I account for inflation as it relates to the basket of goods and services most important in my life.<p>Feel free but the rest of us are talking about a specific meaning of inflation which is not the same as yours, and so should be addressed in a different thread to avoid confusing people.<p>1. Yes, medicine is getting more expensive.<p>2. It&#x27;s going up faster than inflation.<p>3. This is not inflation.')
