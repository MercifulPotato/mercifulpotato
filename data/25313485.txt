And then migrated to PDP-11s circa 1972 when someone at Bell Labs wanted a typesetting system.<p>Back then, digital computers were only 25-28 years old. There was no such thing as legacy hardware back then, in our terms. Designing for a 68 year lifespan -- nearly three times the entire duration of the industry to that date -- probably seemed excessive!')
