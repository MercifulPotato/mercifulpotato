Operators meet or exceed what Gmail offers both in terms of speed and features.<p>Neomutt probably has better integration. I&#x27;ve never tried because I switched to the Emacs Notmuch MUA package.<p>I find the integration of Emacs packages much better than ncurses CLIs which, unlike non-interactive Unix applications, tend to compose badly.
