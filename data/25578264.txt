Item(by='jsnell', descendants=None, kids=[25578424], score=None, time=1609300151, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25578139, text='The best evidence right now suggests that B.1.1.7 is significantly more trasmissible, but doesn&#x27;t produce less (or more!) serious cases. (See the cohort matching study in this week&#x27;s PHE report on the variant[0]). Maybe a statistically significant difference will emerge once we have more data, but at least for now it&#x27;s better to not assume that.<p>But let&#x27;s say for argument&#x27;s sake that the new variant is indeed half as serious, while being 70% more transmissive. That gives you one single multiplicative change in hospital utilization, but a permanent change to the exponent of the epidemic growth curve. The multiplicative benefit will basically get nullified by the increased growth in a week or two, and after that it is all downside.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.publishing.service.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;system&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;attachment_data&#x2F;file&#x2F;948152&#x2F;Technical_Briefing_VOC202012-2_Briefing_2_FINAL.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.publishing.service.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;...</a>')
