The cap on sales is only on production assets and could easily be 2xed using the same methods and more lenient sales tactics.<p>Most clients could care less about technology, but most of our projects are in Umbraco which allows us to not be apples to apples to your run of the mill wordpress providers (im personally a fan of wordpress and have hundreds of WP sites from my affiliate marketing and webdesign background)<p>I reviewed your portfolio, if I was hiring or looking for a web provider, it wouldn&#x27;t work for me because nothing in the portfolio is complete. You should determine your audience also as most of your portfolio language is heavy with design terms, business owners (if that is  your audience) should be talked to in their own language.')
