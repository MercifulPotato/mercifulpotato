If a vehicle&#x27;s automated systems caused or contributed to an accident or a road rule violation, the car manufacturer should be held responsible.<p>If your company&#x27;s automated emergency braking, or lane assist, or adaptive cruise control - causes or contributes to a problem, someone from that company should be in court next to the driver facing judgement for the consequences.<p>(I&#x27;d even go so far as to suggest if the existence of a system leads to a situation where an incident occurred because of the driver&#x27;s assumption that the automated system would prevent it, then the company should need to justify why the driver should be held responsible instead of the software. If your advertising claims &quot;autopilot!&quot;, you&#x27;re going to be apportioned a significant portion of liability even if your fine print says &quot;Drivers must keep alert and ready to take control at all times&quot; - you should be judged based on a reasonable persons expectation from the language you use to promote your vehicles, not some w4easel words in your T&amp;Cs.)')
