Disregarding bugginess, the previews are a lot better than what was possible with IBDesignables.<p>The integration with UIKit is actually quite well made, and for most part not needed.<p>&gt; there&#x27;s no new hardware forcing its adoption.<p>While there is no explicit new hardware, there are several popular features that are only doable using SwiftUI: home screen widgets and complications. It will also become the language in which to write universal iOS&#x2F;macOS programs.<p>&gt; when server-side Swift is stillborn, Rust is more appealing as a better bare metal language<p>I agree with this, at least from Apple&#x27;s part most effort is clearly done on &quot;application level&quot; and usefulness of Swift outside there seems more exploratory at the moment. Personally I&#x27;d like them to start adding higher, rather than lower level functionality, and steer towards scripting.')
