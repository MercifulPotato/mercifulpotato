In anything using video, UI elements apparently need to be hidden as much as possible. In virtual meetings, Youtube, and it&#x27;s often an option in games.<p>And sometimes it&#x27;s great, because you get to focus on the content, and sometimes it&#x27;s not, because you lose control. It&#x27;s something that should be optional or configurable. It&#x27;s great to have shortcuts for the most common commands (like space for pause in youtube), and I guess it would make a lot of sense if video conferencing tools also had such a shortcut for mute&#x2F;unmute.<p>But again, give people more control over their UI. There are too many applications that mess this up one way or another.')
