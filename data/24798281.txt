They register to read other people.<p>Making Twitter a publisher increases costs a lot. Especially portion of the cost that’s proportional to count of users and volumes of content.<p>On-line ads don’t pay much per view, the only reason these companies are making so much money is they got crazy count of views with very low (in comparison) costs. They’ll have to find other sources of income.<p>They can charge readers, like newspapers did for centuries.<p>They can charge for publishing, I remember couple decades ago I was paying some reasonable subscription fee for a paid livejournal account, just to get rid of ads.<p>Either model is fine. They both fix the current outrage culture, by removing the incentive. These companies will stop optimizing content for count of views, and will start listening to users who became their customers.')
