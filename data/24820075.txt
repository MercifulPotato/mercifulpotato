Probably because they&#x27;re easy to acquire, refurbish and transport.<p>Refurbished home appliances like washers&#x2F;fridges&#x2F;dryers&#x2F;dishwashers&#x2F;ovens are a good product to sell, there are lots of small shops that buy dozens or hundreds of them for resale, and of course, lots of individuals furnishing their own place.<p>Energy efficiency for them is not going up anytime soon, they&#x27;ve been stuck in the same ratings for <i>more than a decade</i>. They&#x27;re simply as efficient as possible already.<p>Liability and warranty would be handled by the resellers, and if agreed, by us. Mostly by return and replacement, but it could be feasible to create an on-site repair service. We can provide the necessary parts, too.<p>The thing is, a properly fixed appliance will last just as long as a new one. In fact, the failure rate on used electronics can often be lower - newer models that use a new internal design fail more than older, &quot;proven&quot; appliances. The saving grace for them are the warranty and return policies.<p>Customers will still give 4-5 stars even if their first purchase was a dud, but it was swiftly replaced with another one. That always surprises me, btw. It&#x27;s like, &quot;oh my new Indesit fridge was DOA, but they replaced it the next day. 5 stars.&quot;<p>Anyway, a big downside is that transportation costs are rather high. And they can only be loaded by forklifts with special attachments, or several people at the same time.<p>However, the more thoroughly they&#x27;re checked, repaired and cleaned, the fewer returns, the less money spent on transportation.')
