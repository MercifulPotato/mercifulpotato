Real life as usual is more complicated.<p>Braking in AWD scenario and traction are not same as your example and depends on the power split between the front and rear and how the 2 are coupled together.  In 4WD with the 50&#x2F;50 split, the drive shafts are locked together through the differential and braking is much more effective in part due to the fact that the braking is more evenly distributed among the 4 wheels since the drive shafts are locked.  Also when you lock up the brakes in 4WD usually 2 wheels on the diagonal keep turning, again due to how the differentials work.   This is not the case in FWD.')
