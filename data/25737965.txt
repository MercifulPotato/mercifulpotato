I&#x27;m a moderate liberal, but I&#x27;m aware enough to realize that NPR only frames debates in terms I agree with (and increasingly only in terms that people more progressive than myself agree with). Which strikes me as profoundly unjust considering they are government-funded. I guess I can&#x27;t muster the short-sightedness required to celebrate the government&#x27;s wildly disproportional endorsement of my own position. Of course, someone will make some dichotomous argument that it&#x27;s the progressive position or literal Nazism.')
