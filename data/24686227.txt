It sounds like you might just be unfamiliar with overlapped I&#x2F;O? ReadFile(), WSARecvMsg(), etc. all take OVERLAPPED structures that let you pass a HANDLE to an event object that gets signaled. There&#x27;s also RegisterWaitForSingleObject, WSAAsyncSelect, WSAEventSelect, CreateIoCompletionPort... you name it. Heck, if you just have a thread select() the old-fashioned way, I think it should still wake up when the data comes, without introducing a delay at all. Nowhere should it matter how fast the data is coming, or to force you to wait more than you need to. Am I missing something?')
