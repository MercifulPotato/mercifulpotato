The way I understand it GitHub is really putting their money where their mouth is.  The easy way out is to push the liability onto the user by making them file a counter-notice.  This way GitHub is taking on some liability.<p>I&#x27;m guessing youtube-dl might be a really strong case for GitHub if they&#x27;d happen to get sued, so it makes a lot of business sense to take a stand on it.
