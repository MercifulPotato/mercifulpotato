I don&#x27;t think &quot;it&#x27;s okay because everybody does it&quot; arguments are sound. However, if there is no evidence for such behavior, then I&#x27;m against the ban.<p>So far I haven&#x27;t seen any evidence, but it&#x27;s unfortunately not hard to imagine how the Chinese government would abuse a large social network for their purposes. They certainly do that domestically.')
