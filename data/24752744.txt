When files get larger the performance starts improving, but when you&#x27;re doing many operations on small files there&#x27;s a two to three times speed improvement if you switch to NFS.<p>There&#x27;s also the fact that macOS, Linux and Windows all have official support for NFS while SMB is achieved through analysing and reverse engineering Windows&#x27; protocols. There&#x27;s no stability guarantee from Microsoft that SAMBA will keep working with the next update of Windows 10 while the NFS standard does maintain a minimum level of compatibility.<p>I can&#x27;t think of another way to share files over the network outside of NFS and SMB with cross-OS support. Perhaps you know a file sharing mechanism that has similar small file performance with similar OS support?')
