My strong advice is to only use Django for API calls (DRF) and the built in admin UI. Do not use Django for ANY client facing static site rendering.<p>1. Deploy the React static pages and JS&#x2F;CSS resources completely separately from Django. Cloudfront&#x2F;S3 is my personal choice. You will need to tweak the CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST and CORS_ALLOW_HEADERS in the django settings but that&#x27;s relatively easy.<p>2. Use Gatsy or something similar to help you with static site generation using react. Remember: React is in charge of HTML&#x2F;JS&#x2F;CSS of any type and Django should not get involved.<p>3. Use <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ctrlplusb&#x2F;react-async-component" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ctrlplusb&#x2F;react-async-component</a> or something similar to help break up your SPA so the browser doesn&#x27;t have to load all of it at once and only loads smaller components on an as needed basis.<p>Don&#x27;t mess with webpack and eject unless you have a very specialized need that cannot be addressed with everything out there.')
