This is also why specific risk is not compensated for by higher returns: only non-diversifiable risk such as market risk carries a risk premium.<p>Of course this is a quantitative perspective that is not shared by high concentration discretionary investors like Buffet. Buffet needs to pick stocks with low idiosyncratic risk because he is not being paid a risk premium for it.')
