We also don&#x27;t have huge rates compared to other causes, e.g. there are under 2,000 road deaths each year but suicides top 6,500 per year.<p>&gt;&gt; Are you proposing something concrete that would be better to spend our time on<p>Yes - the solution for 0 road deaths does not exist purely in speed. Further, focussing only on speed has detrimental cost to the country. It&#x27;s impossible to measure this cost so people ignore it. It is not sound methodology to ignore something simply because it can&#x27;t be measured.<p>As i stated upfront, enforcement of inappropriate speed should not be stopped, however, the biggest cause of road fatalaties - inattention - should now become a priority for enforcement.<p>There is no technical gizmo available today for this therefore this means simply investing in more traffic police. No more complicated than that. I would expect though that some budget diverted from speed enforcement (which is a cost activity to the country despite the revenue it generates) would also be directed to figuring out more efficient ways of enforcing inattention. As i also said up front - this doesn&#x27;t have to be in penalties, it might be better invested in making it less likely for drivers to be inattentive.')
