The US should not have any colonial territories or federal districts where US citizens live who have second-class rights compared to citizens of the 50 states.<p>That means DC, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa (collectively 3.8 million US citizens) should all be made states.<p>There are undoubtedly lots of issues and hiccups with implementing that, but fundamentally I think that having classes of citizens with abridged rights is wrong.')
