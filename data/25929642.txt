She exclaimed: &quot;You are endangering your daughter! Where is your wife?&quot;. To which I said, &quot;I&#x27;m the father. My daughter is being safe.&quot; She then wanted to know where my wife was... and threatened to call the police. I told her: &quot;We live in the yellow house down the street, my wife is home.&quot;<p>After a few days, her son was climbing the ladder too; the woman became good playground company. I think there&#x27;s all sorts of things people can learn from each other.')
