The fellow from twitter told me they will never suspend Trump because despite what he says, Twitter makes few million dollars daily (!!) off of his feed. The reason you see him being booted out is because my buddy from Amazon told me they may be ready to drop Twitter as a client altogether (mostly because of Trump) and the way their contract is designed is that Twitter would still be up for tens of millions of (now unfulfilled) hosting contract fees. And that something they wonâ€™t digest. So really the decision to boot Trump had nothing to do with freedom of speech - its AWS who thretened to withdraw, and Twitter folks did some simple math and realized the loss from AWS contract would cost more than gains from RealDonaldTrump feed.')
