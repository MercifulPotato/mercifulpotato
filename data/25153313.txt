I often envy people who can focus on one thing and if they are good at it then they are set. People like athletes, artists or actors. A lot of normal workers don’t have that luxury. In a lot of jobs it doesn’t really matter how good you are as long as you fulfill some minimum requirements. Or you have a ton of tasks you aren’t good at but can’t get rid of. I became tech lead because I am a good programmer but now I have to do a lot of stuff I don’t like and am not good at as much as I try. Focusing only on programming would unfortunately cause a significant pay cut because you are not paid by excellence but by job title.')
