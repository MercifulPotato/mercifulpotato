Item(by='dangus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604677861, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24978090, text='&gt; Since Apple decided to split up iTunes into different apps (I haven&#x27;t upgraded my Mac yet, to keep iTunes), I&#x27;m also fine with switching to a new app to manage podcasts.<p>Just an FYI, you don’t have to hold out on updating your Mac to sync your podcasts. Apple Podcasts still syncs with classic iPods.<p>There’s really very little difference between iTunes and Apple Music and Apple Podcasts, it’s just split out. Audiobooks are also moved to the Books app but otherwise the functionality is really similar to iTunes.<p>Whether you like the new podcasts UI is another matter entirely.')
