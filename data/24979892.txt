Why wouldn&#x27;t they want to make bank over theses Pi, even the ones actually in a grey area.<p>Let&#x27;s be honest, this is coherent with Ebay, they want to make cash, like any other business, and something would cause them to make less of it if they were to sell Raspberry Pi.<p>Someone else mentioned RIAA&#x2F;MPAA, which would make sense with the copyright stuff, but why wouldn&#x27;t RIAA&#x2F;MPAA fight all the other ones too?<p>So here I am, asking myself, who would want to stop Raspberry Pi from being sold, or for Little Bird Company to stop selling stuff.')
