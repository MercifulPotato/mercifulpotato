Good times.  Then there was the NYT board member whose namesake cancer charity foundation was shut down by the state attorney general&#x27;s office because it turned out to be a front for his own business and political interests.  What a con artist, huh.  Not to forget the time the chairman of the Democratic National Committee stiffed his contractors for $70 million on a casino project that later went bankrupt.  There oughta be a law.')
