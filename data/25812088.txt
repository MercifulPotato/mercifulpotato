People don&#x27;t sit in a conference room saying &quot;ftoscano didn&#x27;t come to the bar last night, let&#x27;s ostracize him&quot; - it&#x27;s just that the more opportunities to bond with your team that you pass up, the worse your communication with them is (compared to what it could have been if you invested in it) which legitimately makes you less impactful at work.<p>&gt;&gt; And that&#x27;s assuming that the corporate event is good at all. Which, quite frankly, most aren&#x27;t.<p>Debatable but not the point. The point is that these things already exist and they are opportunities for you to build up your career (and maybe even allow yourself to have fun.) You can chose to hate it and not participate but like I said, that&#x27;s strictly worse for you so why adopt that attitude?')
