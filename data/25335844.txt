They genuinely are fundamentally different.  It&#x27;s a bit like the difference between SVG and Canvas.  Sure, you can use both to draw pretty vector artwork.  But one&#x27;s an object graph, and the other&#x27;s immediate mode.<p>In terms of Matrix having money: yup, it&#x27;s true that folks have generously donated to Matrix over the years to keep the project afloat, and more recently Element has funnelled most of its VC funding into supporting Matrix.  However, the whole &quot;marketing, exposure and time to defend their work to the depth of the deepest reddit thread&quot; trope is hilarious, given Matrix&#x27;s marketing department is... me, the project lead? and I&#x27;m doing this in my spare time with my FOSS hat on. (technically there&#x27;s benpa, our dev evangelist too, but he&#x27;s ended up being hijacked by Element business this year).<p>Finally, &quot;Matrix - the standard for open, decentralised communication&quot; is like saying &quot;Rugby - the game&quot;.  It&#x27;s not saying that Matrix is the one and only standard for open, decentralised communication any more than Rugby is the one and only game; it&#x27;s disambiguating it from &quot;Matrix - the mathematical construct&quot;.<p>Meanwhile, comically, xmpp.org declares itself &quot;The universal messaging standard&quot; and &quot;XMPP is the open standard for messaging and presence&quot;.<p>¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯')
