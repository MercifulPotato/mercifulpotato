I also find that I tend to view social interactions that I do have as more significant than the others involved if they&#x27;re not also loners. I have to remember that most people go to lunch with others, have small gatherings, etc fairly often (outside the pandemic times). It&#x27;s not generally as memorable or significant to them. I&#x27;ll think back fondly on an evening dinner party and remember every detail, friends that go to such things every weekend remember them less significantly. I also sometimes think of people I haven&#x27;t spoken to in a long time as still being relevant to me, and have to remember they likely don&#x27;t think of me at all - I don&#x27;t mean that in a self deprecating or sad way. It&#x27;s been a good thing to be aware of, sometimes someone will cross my mind and I&#x27;ll do a sort of social inventory and file them away as &quot;dormant&quot; lol')
