And it should be the primary check. We shouldn&#x27;t turn onto one-way streets, of course! Just like we shouldn&#x27;t swerve off streets when we detect something that can be spoofed ... such as the false positives shown in the article and the false negatives given by other Tesla crashes.<p>You <i>can</i> actually correct those instances by using reliable ranging devices with dense enough sampling to ensure flat surfaces without intermediate obstacles.<p>To say that there are no other factors at play is foolish, of course, but it&#x27;s also foolish to say that somehow we <i>shouldn&#x27;t be doing this</i>.')
