But talking to the right registry still requires that the image name includes the hostname of the registry.<p>The docker daemon has a registry-mirrors option; you can already use that to point to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mirror.gcr.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mirror.gcr.io</a> . But you can use it only to cache the special &quot;docker hub&quot; images.<p>This seems to be a self-inflicted problem. Docker the company possibly wanted to be in the critical path')
