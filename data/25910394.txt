So, not sweep oar.<p>Most rowing machines in gyms are set too &quot;hard&quot; water resistance does not mimic the setting most people use.<p>There is a rotational aspect in two planes no rowing machine i use mimics: the rotation around the oar gate, an arc of about 120 degrees, as you move forward and backwards, and the throttle twist of feathering the oars.<p>These limit the utility of dry rowing to me.<p>I&#x27;ve rowed in a static tank and its more &quot;real&quot; because your push is against water (you basically circulate water in a tank) and you get both feathering, and rowlock plane  rotations<p>(In real rowing, your arm sweeps out a circular arc of the radius from the rowlock to your hands)')
