It&#x27;s also possible that other sources of pollution, for example pesticides, pay a role in it but that&#x27;s something I know less about.<p>Good luck getting anything done about the ubiquity of endocrine disrupters in our food and water supply though. The lack of an acute effect and the difficulty in even assigning causality for something like this makes regulatory action pretty difficult.')
