That is,  without 10nm chips on the market in a meaningful way they&#x27;ve been able to raise prices for 14nm parts -- Intel put up better financial numbers than ever in a time when it has not been investing in future success.<p>VMWare was a big thing in 1998 but it was obsolete by the time Pat got involved -- a hypervisor is naturally part of the kernel and there is no way cloud providers are going to spend their margin on VMWare.  Yes,  many people in business are terrified of open source software and want a proprietary product so they have somebody to sue (VMWare) or they need somebody to hold their hand (Pivotal.)  Either way,  VMWare and Pivotal are units that can be merged and spun off whenever a company based in Texas (Dell) or Massachusetts (EMC) wants to look like it has a presence in San Francisco -- you see the vmware logo on CNBC every morning and somebody thinks the king is on the throne and a pound is worth a pound but that doesn&#x27;t mean anything in the trenches.<p>Like Intel in the past 10 years,  VMWare is entirely based on a harvesting business model.  In the short term Intel made profits by pandering to cloud providers;  but in the long term cloud providers invested their profits in better chips.  (What if Southwest Airlines had developed a 737 replacement designed from the ground up for a low cost airline?)<p>Pat might be able to keep the game of soaking enterprise customers going for longer,  but someday the enterprise customers will be running ARM and the clients will be running ARM and the coders will be thinking &quot;did they add all of those AMX registers just to put dead space on the die to make it easier to cool?&quot; and falling in love again with AVR8.')
