They seem to have mostly vanished, other than the old LG one that Apple still sometimes has in stock (I’ve heard bad things about it). I also love my first-gen 5K iMac display, but can’t use it for my work MacBook. I’d love to find a solid 5K display but until then I’m still on a 1440p ultrawide.')
