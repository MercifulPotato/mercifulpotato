For general policing, as in keeping the population safe and dampening crime, they don&#x27;t need spy planes, they need legs; they don&#x27;t need pistols, they need communication skills; they don&#x27;t need body armor, they need to earn the trust of the people that pay them.<p>If 99% of police encounters don&#x27;t involve violence, then 99% of police don&#x27;t need to be equipped for violence.
