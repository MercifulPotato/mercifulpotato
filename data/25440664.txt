The AI (the term was not used, it was an &quot;artificial brain&quot; IIRC) used the researcher himself to send messages to another AI. I cannot find the story right now but it somehow hacked the researcher&#x27;s brain, so that he unconsciously tapped the messages with his fingers when visiting the other AI.')
