It felt like someone had kicked me in the crotch about 10 minutes ago, all day every day. I&#x27;ve been in more pain from some injuries I&#x27;ve had (bike accident), but this lasted for much, much longer.<p>It also made sleeping difficult, as for some reason lying down was extremely uncomfortable. I ended up sleeping in a chair for several months.<p>I ended up cancelling a conference visit and talks just because I felt so awful and I wasn&#x27;t even sure I could sleep in a hotel away from home.<p>One thing I look back on and realize now is that it really changed my behavior. My temper was shorter and my judgement about how to interact with others was much poorer.<p>Fortunately, it eventually resolved itself. I used to have flareups for a week or two every few months, then for a few days less often, and now it&#x27;s been a few years since I&#x27;ve felt it.<p>All of which is to say I feel for the author. This sort of thing sucks. For anyone else who&#x27;s experienced any sort of similar pain, I would encourage you to continue looking for solutions. If you can, enlist family or friends to help you do so.<p>I think that after a while you forget what it feels to be pain free, and it becomes easier to accept your current state. But once my pain resolved itself I realized how much of a difference it made in my life.')
