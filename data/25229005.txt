People seem to enjoy the repetition.<p>The success of the Marvel movies is obvious in retrospect, but nothing like them had ever been done before.<p>Thor, Iron Man and Captain America were not considered among the popular Marvel Characters.  Spider Man, X-Men and Fantastic Four had already been licensed by other companies, but no one cared to do the same with what became the foundation characters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<p>Having a cinematic universe where major characters had their own movies, plus movies where they banded together, was common in comics, but never on the big screen.<p>Keeping the characterizations largely true to the comics, when many directors had wanted to make them more &quot;sophisticated&quot; or &quot;adult&quot;, also displays independent minded thinking.<p>Would anyone have predicted a sci-fi romp with a talking squirrel and walking tree the general public had no familiarity with would be a massive success?<p>Making Thanos the protagonist of the &quot;Hero&#x27;s Journey&quot; in the climax of the whole series I think was a bold decision.<p>There are many other ways these movies were bold and creative and, yes, independent minded, leading to success that would have been impossible with conventional thinking.')
