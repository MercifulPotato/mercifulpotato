Basically wasm in all browsers reuse the same codegen from JS. But this will improved in the future.<p>Also, don&#x27;t forget about SIMD, multi-threading with stared buffers and atomics and multi-values, a lot of special instructions like popcnt, ctz, clz, rotl&#x2F;rotr and etc which not supported by JS and usually emulate not in the best way that complicates or make impossible to optimize this by the JS compiler.<p>In some points JS is really fast, so much that it is not inferior, for example, to the C language with the LLVM compiler without vectorization (-O2). Obviously\nWebAssembly can&#x27;t outperform JS in such cases.')
