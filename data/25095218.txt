Linus has said something like &quot;I&#x27;m not even a programmer anymore&quot; recently.  And Guido said something like &quot;I&#x27;m not the best Python coder by far - on a scale of 1-10 I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m at most a 6&quot;.  Not because they&#x27;re lousy coders of course.  Just that (in recent years) they&#x27;ve had far, far, far bigger fish to fry.<p>So they go in, and &quot;fail&quot; the contrived Sudoku &#x2F; Knapsack &#x2F; &quot;build me an Instagram clone, please&quot; problem... then get strung along and gaslit for a while, before receiving an email 6 weeks later tell them that they&#x27;re &quot;not a fit&quot;.<p>That would be lots, and lots of fun to see.')
