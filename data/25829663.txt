The government isn&#x27;t a tech company or an infrastructure provider. You wouldn&#x27;t ask the government to build their own roads or bridges, so like everything else software and services need to be contracted out as well. Of course that doesn&#x27;t mean they should use AWS by default, but asking every single government agency to build their own data centers and CDNs is foolish.')
