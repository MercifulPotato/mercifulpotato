Apartheid? Set up bubbles where only people of certain colours or orientations can go, work, etc?<p>Why would anyone actually want this? I&#x27;ve met a lot of different people from a lot of different places, the things i&#x27;ve found the least important for determining the character of a person are their colour or orientation or any other equally superficial thing like the colour of their hair, or eyes or how tall they are or any of these other things that have absolutely nothing to do with the character and personality of a person.<p>Dividing, segregating, judging or making any kind of decisions based on a person&#x27;s skin colour just overall makes you a shitty person. Regardless of who you are or how much privilege you think that person has over you.')
