They want to be told what they want to hear, and they want people who have different thoughts to be silenced and tucked away for their own psychological comfort. America will not become a dictatorship thru force, people will let it come with open arms because it does not challenge their views and strokes their fragile egos with validation.<p>Take my country Turkey for example, Erdogan gives them stories of Europe being envious of Turks and blames the economy on the West because &quot;we are becoming too strong for them&quot; and other stories like that. When I tell them that our economy is weakening due to foreign policy I am attacked because I am implying that the leaders might not be perfect or that our country is not 100% great which they cannot handle.')
