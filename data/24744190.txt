Code is like language. You can  make it readable for everyone by using the most easy to comprehend and least ambiguous language. But doing so decreases efficiency for both &quot;advanced&quot; writers and readers. &quot;Advanced&quot; grammar and vocabulary exists for a reason - it allows to express thoughts more succinct and concise and can decrease the time to understand something in great level of detail and context by magnitudes. But it requires knowledge and shared context between writer and reader.<p>It&#x27;s the same for using a very efficient compression algorithm vs. plaintext. You cannot have the advantages of both at the same time. Pick your poison.<p>(I assume you understand &quot;pick your poison&quot;, a non-native reader might not. It&#x27;s so nice and concise, isn&#x27;t it? :)')
