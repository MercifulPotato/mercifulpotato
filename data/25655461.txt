Item(by='oarsinsync', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609918730, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25654963, text='&gt; Moving to Apple Maps is basically stabbing yourself in the face.<p>After doing some basic A&#x2F;B testing (checking Google Maps, Waze and Apple Maps for routing guidance) and establishing that Apple Maps has been giving me earlier arrival times through different routing guidance (and actually delivering on that earlier arrival time, by means of actually using it), I&#x27;ve determined that&#x27;s less likely to be true, <i>if</i> you&#x27;re in a city that has been refreshed recently.<p>Combined with the (potentially anti-competitive) use of private APIs on both the iPhone and Apple Watch, enabling the phone lockscreen to always display routing guidance, and the watch to provide haptic feedback for routing guidance, Apple Maps has become a superior experience as far as driving goes.<p>This is all <i>if</i> you&#x27;re already a sucker in their eco-system, and happen to live in a city they care about, which I am.<p>EDIT: At the same time..<p>&gt; Moving to Apple Maps is basically stabbing yourself in the face.<p>If you&#x27;re taking this from the perspective of moving from one megacorp to another, rather than quality of service, then yes, there&#x27;s basically no difference here. Apple today is claiming to care, in a similar manner to Google&#x27;s old mission statement of &quot;dont be evil&quot;. Apple have been pretty clear that their interest in your privacy only extends as far as lip service goes, given the lack of E2E encryption on iCloud storage for the majority of your data.<p>2 decades ago Google was &quot;don&#x27;t be evil&quot; and here we are today. Where do we think Apple will be in a decade or two from now?<p>So yes, in that respect, don&#x27;t stab yourself in the face, and don&#x27;t use any megacorp products.')
