It&#x27;s normal for games to unlock more powerful weapons as the player progresses, but it&#x27;s generally the case in non-RPG games, particularly single session action games, that it&#x27;s a good idea to give the player powerful gear immediately or early.<p>Ie, Doom&#x27;s shotgun.<p>RoR doesn&#x27;t do this, despite being a single session action game. RoR makes the player grind excessively to unlock powerful abilities, rewarding players who play many sessions or who have high skill. This doesn&#x27;t serve players with little free time or without high skill.<p>It&#x27;s not wrong, just a particular style of design that many prefer; kinda a &quot;Soulslike&quot;, but it&#x27;s worth being aware of.')
