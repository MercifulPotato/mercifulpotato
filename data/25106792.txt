The fact that Joe Bob lives in a rural parish that wont apply for grants is on your team, not those sneaky lefties.<p>“800 polling places”<p>Why do people loathe making voting accessible? What does it matter how many there are? That’s the best you can do on a site that loathes Zuck?<p>Has the Moonie Times found Obama’s Kenyan birth certificate yet? See, I do read it, and I have a very long memory. Thx for playing.')
