The propaganda industry renamed itself as the &quot;public relations&quot; industry (Bernays quite literally coined the term.) After that &quot;propaganda&quot; meant &quot;public relations that I disapprove of i.e. communists.&quot;<p>The overused term is &quot;unbiased&quot; which doesn&#x27;t mean anything. The closest meaningful word to it is &quot;disinterested&quot; which means that the person conveying the information doesn&#x27;t particularly care about it.')
