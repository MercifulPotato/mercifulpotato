That&#x27;s your negative spin. The positive spin is it&#x27;s just 2&#x2F;26th pre-payment of the rent for 2 years. You then pay 1&#x2F;26th every month for 2 years, repeat when you renew your contract. Do I like having to pay 2&#x2F;26th up front (2 months rent?) no. But I also would prefer not to have to put down payments on cars&#x2F;houses.')
