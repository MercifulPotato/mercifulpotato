Item(by='mapt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611718674, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25909873, text='The link between neighboring satellites in a 22-satellite-per-plane constellation at 550km altitude comes at its closest 480km above the ground.  The link between next-farthest-neighbors comes at its closest 270km from the ground.  The link to the second-farthest-neighbor is not in line of sight.  Optical effects at 270km or 480km altitude are negligible; 99% of the atmosphere&#x27;s mass is below 30km altitude.  In theory you could go all the way down to an 8-satellite plane at 550km and still maintain line of sight and freedom from most of the atmosphere&#x27;s interference.<p>Satellite-to-ground optical laser links are another matter, but you can always route a few hops around weather systems.')
