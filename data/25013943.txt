Hit some issues around channels and blocking reads and buffering, but worked around them easily enough using pointers and locks where channels weren&#x27;t appropriate)<p>But aside from the limitations of Golang, over all it was a rather straight-forward experience. Stuff worked, tools worked, Intellij IDEA integration worked, Go&#x27;s module system worked (DIAF $GOPATH), code ran, no worries.<p>Will say though, Go logging realllllly needs some work from the community. An SLF4J equivalent at least. I used logrus as my logging library as it gave me the easiest route to making my logs go to Kafka in Logstash format, but it has some insane defaults - like the log event timestamp defaulting to &quot;seconds since start-up&quot;.<p>Oh, and be very careful with named returns. Naming a return, but then assigning nothing to it, will compile. Which is, to say the least, rather contrary to how most of Go works.')
