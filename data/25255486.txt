What does it even mean? Browsers now run in their own sandboxes and it&#x27;s quite hard to run arbitrary untrusted code in a browser (but still possible). Do bad actors burn browser-0days just to inject junk DNA creating sort of mutant pathogens? It would be a great opportunity to create a honeypot and capture those exploits in the wild.')
