Saunaing is doing something. Lying on the beach is doing something. They&#x27;re all activities driven by desire, and the desire exists to distract you from inner contemplation.<p>When you&#x27;re finally just thinking about yourself, your &quot;desirable surroundings&quot; will disappear. You&#x27;ll be trapped in the discomfort of your mind. You&#x27;ll then try to escape these thoughts by focusing on the picnic, sauna, beach.<p>Sitting in a room alone is just a metaphor for only thinking about your inner self. You can do that anywhere. And most people can&#x27;t stand it, so they do something else. So, your conclusion is right, in that people would always prefer to do anything else other than focus on their inner thoughts. Like being in a place that distracts them.')
