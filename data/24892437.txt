I believe the spent fuel is put into &quot;casks&quot; which is then loaded onto ships or jumbo jets and flown around the world.<p>Planes crash and ships sink, but we judge the risk (with proper pre-cautions) to be low enough when transporting radioactive waste. To me this shows that people generally accept transporting nuclear waste when the danger of catastrophe is low enough - importantly this signals that the risk only has to be low enough, it doesn&#x27;t actually have to be 0.<p>Presumably as rocket technology advances we will eventually enter a stage similar to that in air travel, where the risk of a crash is measured in 1-per-billions rather than 1-per-hundreds or 1-per-dozens.<p>At that point, would we accept launching radioactive waste into space?')
