Item(by='skynet-9000', descendants=None, kids=[25687433], score=None, time=1610127353, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25686678, text='Userify (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;userify.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;userify.com</a>) is similar; meetings are rare (except probably with customers). Most communication occurs in one-on-ones, with a strong bias toward the minimum number of team members for any project.<p>Most team members are contractors, even those working on new top-secret products, which might be because the core team is small and based in Texas and most devs are geographically elsewhere. It does seem to take up some time to build trust on new commits, which is a bit discouraging at first, but reviews are usually within 24 hours. Pay is based on deliverables, not hourly or salaried, so you don&#x27;t get paid for time spent learning or experimenting, but free training and classes.<p>The core team seems a bit old school and conservative in tech choices (not much in the way of k8s, for example), and there&#x27;s not much in the way of &quot;team&quot; tools like you might expect for a geographically distributed team, which seems to slow things down a bit and reduce communication velocity, but they&#x27;re very responsive (this might be because it&#x27;s a smaller, security-focused company). Also a rather complex 10-page NDA.')
