Item(by='leonardoeloy', descendants=None, kids=[25296232, 25296533], score=None, time=1607033297, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25287076, text='&gt; Public policy and morality should be the domain of reason, evidence, freedom, experience, and compassion.<p>What if scientists don&#x27;t understand reason? Do they see science is subject to reason, considering that the matter of science is something of which can only be described through a reasoning process? There is no science without reason; there is reason without science.<p>It is also interesting to see the continual replication nature of philosophical mistakes, even though they have been refuted by decades. The author confuses vaccine for polio as a scientific breakthrough, where that&#x27;s just the effect. The scientific breakthrough is the study of pathology, which only happens in a total abstract world (the definition of science) -- that&#x27;s _the_ cause.  It&#x27;s like proclaiming the end of murder just by enacting a law stating murder is over. Reminds me of the mistakes made by Comte&#x27;s positivism (or Bush&#x27;s &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot;), the obvious Kant confusion (form over matter), and, why not?, the devilish conclusions made by Heidegger (won&#x27;t describe them here on purpose and would love to hear otherwise).')
