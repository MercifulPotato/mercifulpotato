Then, we learned how to use electricity and started putting it into everything.  Then, and only then, did we start developing government regulation to make sure that your new device for sale didn&#x27;t broadcast EM waves that interfered with any other devices in the vicinity.<p>We are getting to the point where we will need an Underwriter Labs-style independent body to say, to anybody selling an internet-connected device, &quot;your device is not secure enough to be sold; you are forbidden to sell it until you get your security house in order&quot;.<p>This wouldn&#x27;t solve every problem, but it would solve a lot of it, simply because the cost required to pay for good security would cause most IoT devices that don&#x27;t really need it, to get rid of it, in order to cut cost and reduce time to market.  Only if it if really added a lot of value would the maker be willing to pay for good security; that does not include most IoT today.')
