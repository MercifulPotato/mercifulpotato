But is it really ever the same? One of my previous workplaces insisted on everyone having bloody openshift locally, so your dev env supposed to be closer to prod. Guess what, it still wasn&#x27;t by a long stretch, yet it ate half of usable laptop&#x27;s RAM and was slow like hell.<p>Most people quietly switched to docker-compose templates shared through private repos within a month for quick local runs and then tested end-to-end in dev cluster when it was mature enough.<p>What I&#x27;m saying here is that architecture mismatch is really just another variable, and purpose of docker locally nowadays is not to replicate prod. That is unachievable and the sooner one accepts it the better. Still it&#x27;s the best way so far to keep DLL hell at bay.')
