I tend to think of North as being up, so North should be at the top of a map. I never realized that that is cultural until I learned that many ancient societies considered East (the direction of the rising sun) to be up, so you find ancient maps with East as the top.<p>Another example is their view of history. We tend to see history as needing to describe what is &quot;true&quot;, that is what actually happened if we had been there with multiple cameras recording the events as they happened. Many ancient peoples would have thought that is a bizarre and alien view of history. For them history was more about the stories that they could tell and if the stories differed significantly from what actually happened, well, so what? Why would anyone possibly want history to describe what actually happened? Who cares? The story is what is true.')
