This one actually followed the proper protocol for a meta-analysis for one. The results here are better stratified, the data more solid (because they did their meta-analysis properly), and the justifications better.<p>For those not familiar with biostatistics and meta-analysis. There is a standard and well defined pathway for doing a meta-analysis. It exists for a reason. Namely that it is really easy to misinterpret the results of aggregated studies if you do it wrong. The fact that the Ionnadis&#x27; article does not follow these procedures is enough to disregard it and instead focus on understand the studies that have done proper meta-analysis.')
