The Inquirer was written like a British tabloid (in fact they were split from The Register.)<p>As for his grudge, it probably stem from Intel&#x27;s underhanded tactics. AMD had the Athlon XP that buried Intel&#x27;s Pentium 4 in every measure.<p>Intel made some very backhanded and immoral moves- \n* Bribed Dell to not use AMD\n* Threatened Taiwanese mobo manufacturers to not build Athlon mobo by withholding North bridge chips\n* Blackmailed the said manufacturers to not even show up for product conventions held by AMD\n* Forced RAMBUS down everyone&#x27;s throat until Athlon forced them to release the i815 chipset (finally supports DDR1!)<p>As a result AMD never managed to grow their revenue to a level that can sustain their R&amp;D. When the Intel&#x27;s Core arch arrived 4 years later it was over for AMD.<p>The Inquirer had a lot of contacts that suffered greatly, and it must have left quite an impression on Charlie. I remember that one of his reports was that during a trade show, a Taiwanese mobo rep had to meet Charlie in secret in a hotel room to talk about AMD, in fear of Intel catching wind and retaliate.<p>BTW Charlie also has a grudge against Nvidia for similar reasons, but Nvidia has been competent enough for the last decade that Charlie couldn&#x27;t find anything to complain about.')
