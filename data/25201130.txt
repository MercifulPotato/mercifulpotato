So it ends up that the people hurt the <i>most</i> by common flat tax proposals are the middle and lower-middle class. Upper-middle is basically the same effective tax rate and beyond that pays substantially less. The only time I&#x27;ve seen the upper brackets pay a higher ETR under a flat tax is if it includes all unearned income which is almost never the case.')
