It&#x27;s a new kind of thing. I&#x27;m happy to be a EU citizen, but certainly not proud of it - that&#x27;s just nonsense, I did nothing to achieve that.<p>And that attitude, plus deep curiosity and empathy for the ways of life of people who grew up differently is exactly how you <i>do</i> end up with what to me is close enough to a universal society.')
