Its not anymore, price inflation, particularly consumer price inflation is the most common general use.<p>&gt; measuring inflation by rising prices isn&#x27;t ideal<p>It certainly is if you are doing for a purpose to which price levels are most directly relevant, which is quite commonly the case. There&#x27;s nothing mystical about the word &quot;inflation&quot; that creates an all-purpose best measure (and, in fact, &quot;inflation&quot; is a name for lots of different things, which have complex interrelationships.)')
