Item(by='furyofantares', descendants=None, kids=[24956114, 24954753], score=None, time=1604173441, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24952571, text='&gt; The bad rep is totally deserved.<p>This sentence really got me thinking. &quot;Deserved&quot; is some sort of moralistic word, I&#x27;m not sure how it applies to a tool, unless it means to apply to the makers and&#x2F;or users of the tool.<p>And I guess it makes some sense. A bad reputation is a sort of social communication utilizing shame and stigma. Maybe it causes people not to use PHP without having to pay the cost of really understanding why, which is likely only accessible with lots of experience and&#x2F;or study.<p>This is basically by definition an inaccurate bias, of lacking nuance, but perhaps a net good. If PHP was such a poor tool for productivity and security then it was probably good if shame and stigma were helping people to use better tools without paying the cost themselves first.<p>But it&#x27;s always very frustrating if you actually know what&#x27;s bad and what&#x27;s good about a thing, or even just know that it has both bad and good parts (even if you don&#x27;t know precisely which is which), and you see a memetic belief held up as truth rather than acknowledged as a useful heuristic.<p>And while it feels dirty, maybe this shame and stigma also serves to influence the creators of the language and its ecosystem to make it better. I don&#x27;t know. I hope there are better ways than shame and stigma but I&#x27;m just a d00d writing a post on a web forum.<p>What does seem clear to me, though, is if is a good tool NOW, as a result of years of work by the people who kept at it, then a bad reputation is no good anymore; no longer a positive force but a negative one.')
