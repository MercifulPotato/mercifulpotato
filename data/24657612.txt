Now that I have a Tesla and I actually like driving again, I am willing to drive upwards of 12 hours to avoid getting on a flight.<p>If it’s too far to drive I have to fly first class. The security is still a pain in the ass but at least you don’t have to be stuffed in coach like cattle, people lining up to use the bathroom while farting 2 inches from your face. If that ticket is too expensive then wherever I’m going is not worth the trouble.<p>This was my opinion long before covid and needless to say I haven’t warmed up to flying in the last 6 months.')
