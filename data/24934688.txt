Item(by='giantrobot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604000281, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24932177, text='&gt; There&#x27;s only very few projects (that I know of) that are really addressing resilient, organized, curated content dissemination, and they&#x27;re essentially divorced from the pirate scene. Too bad I guess.<p>Why would someone trying to build something like PeerTube Or IPFS want to explicitly support piracy? All that does is bring <i>negative</i> pressure down on them and we see in this very discussion, the MAFIAA is more than happy to abuse laws they wrote to bring pressure. Just because someone is interested in or supportive of peer to peer communication doesn&#x27;t automatically mean they support piracy.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to say piracy is <i>bad</i>, it is just illegal. As shitty as those laws might be they&#x27;re still on the books and people face penalties for breaking them.')
