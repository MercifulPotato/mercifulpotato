But from my point of view you are a true pain to work with because you do not containerise your work. Anytime I&#x27;d have to work with one of your creations I&#x27;d have to go figure what you are using, set it up and make sure it works. That&#x27;s a waste of time and you are promoting that very fact because you were unable to figure any usage for it. I doubt OP has only &quot;read some blog post about it somehwere&quot; It&#x27;s literally wide in usage by a lot of companies. &quot;People who like Docker often seem to be working in larger teams, which is totally fine and they&#x27;re probably right to use Docker.&quot; -&gt; it&#x27;s actually about that, it is useful is scaling that&#x27;s true, but it&#x27;s also very useful just to share the env your software should work with. And I&#x27;d dare to say that giving a Dockerfile is now standard practice.')
