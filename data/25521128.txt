That helicopter had a radio altimeter, and it surely wasn&#x27;t being jammed.  And before hitting the ground, the helicopter was descending at 20 m&#x2F;s.  The last known intent of the pilot was to climb, not descend.  Some witnesses on the ground report that the helicopter sounded like it was malfunctioning before the crash.  I do not particularly credit eye witnesses, but their story seems to fit with the rapid descent of the helicopter more than an altimeter issue.')
