If none are charged, consider the US a defunct superpower. We don&#x27;t possess a huge population (relative to the globe) and if the rule of law has failed so dramatically we will lose whatever remains of our political standing within the world.<p>But I still think it&#x27;s unlikely that this will happen. At least on a statewide level. I could see some voting precincts doing something completely moronic like this.')
