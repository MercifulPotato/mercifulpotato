In practice, we&#x27;ve already begun an experiment in mass-scale terraforming of our environment by emitting vast amounts of CO2. Since we don&#x27;t know exactly what this will do, but every indication is that the outcome will be catastrophic, we should be working as hard as possible to halt our emissions now.
