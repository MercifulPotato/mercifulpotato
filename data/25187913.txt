Does anyone know any more about this? It would suck to lose it.<p>Recently I&#x27;ve seen multiple people mention wiby.org as a search engine replacement for the &quot;slow web&quot;. I&#x27;ve been using it as my homepage, and it&#x27;s really nice: Every time I do a &quot;surprise me&quot; I end up happier than when I started, and I&#x27;ve found so many great rabbit holes to explore!<p>Now it is showing the message &quot;Unfortunately this proxy service will be ending soon as I cannot afford to run it. I apologize for the inconvenience caused to those who regularly used it.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s a button to donate, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s too late now they&#x27;ve announced the end.
