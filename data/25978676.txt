I too have a Gen8 and my only real complaints are: max 16GB of RAM, and only 4 drive bays which sorta limits you to RAID10 as a best compromise. In the newest model they&#x27;ve rotated the bays to be horizontal and made it half the height; but I&#x27;d love to see that same idea at the original height with a few more bays. It&#x27;d be a cracking little machine that way.<p>My MicroServer has the E3 Xeon (which was a pain to find in the UK, had to buy the chip off eBay in the end) and for a home server it&#x27;s pretty stellar. I do want something more powerful for a headless workstation though.')
