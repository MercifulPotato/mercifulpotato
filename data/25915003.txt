That&#x27;s one thing I thought really worked about the EU, when we were in we had opt outs on all sorts of things. Schengen, the Euro, various employment legislation, it was very flexible. The only things we were &#x27;forced&#x27; into were a few marginal issues like the details of the contents of labels on tin cans and such. I thought two speed Europe, really multi-speed Europe worked pretty well. It&#x27;s been rather sad watching so many Brexiteers complaining about EU regulations and agreements we weren&#x27;t even part of.')
