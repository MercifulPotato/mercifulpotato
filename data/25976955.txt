If the valuation is too low they will just buy it out and pay out more dividends.<p>3)The company may buy its own stock. If the value is too low they will buy a lot of it and issue dividends later at big multiplier.<p>I am not sure why you&#x27;re feeling so strongly about that point. It&#x27;s about the first thing you learn when dealing with equities.\nIf anything paying significant dividends right now means the business is unlikely to grow anymore.')
