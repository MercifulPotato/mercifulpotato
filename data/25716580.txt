One thing cast iron isn&#x27;t good for is when you have to change temps mid cooking. If doing something that needs mid heat then going to low heat cast iron will fail you as it won&#x27;t go to the lower heat easily.<p>When oiling the pans take the time to try to wipe out all the oil you applied. This leaves just a tiny layer of oil and your pans won&#x27;t get sticky. I clean with diluted Dawn and a sponge - dry on burner - then oil &#x2F; wipe out each use.')
