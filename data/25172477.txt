As gas taxes decline, there becomes a hole in the budget.<p>Yes EVs are better than ICE vehicles on CO2 emissions, so of course we should pivot to that, but beyond that cars are still harmful and need to go away as much as they can. EVs create toxic road dust (brake pads + tire wear), congest the roads and kill pedestrians just like regular ICE cars.<p>Better for the taxpayer, the pedestrian, and the environment would be to fund roads and public transit through other, more stable means that don&#x27;t rely on stable&#x2F;increasing car ownership (eg. income taxes, wealth taxes), and then save money by limiting road expansion and taking cars off the road as we improve active and public transport.')
