You are not pathetic or anything, could get a real girl if you wanted to. Just don&#x27;t have time. Have to focus on your career for now. &quot;Build your empire then build your family&quot;, that&#x27;s your motto.<p>You strap on the headset and see an adversarial generated girlfriend designed by world-class ML to maximize engagement.<p>She starts off as a generically beautiful young women; over the course of weeks she gradually molds both her appearance and your preferences such that competing products just won&#x27;t do.<p>In her final form, she is just a grotesque undulating array of psychedelic colors perfectly optimized to introduce self-limiting microseizures in the pleasure center of the your brain.
