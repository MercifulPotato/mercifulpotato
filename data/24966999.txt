You need plenty of calories to sustain that and I never got out of the habit. That combined with 20 year old metabolism and a free canteen at work meant that in addition to a big dinner, I was having a full hot lunch with dessert. This habit of a big lunch (although maybe not with dessert) carried on into my thirties and after I stopped rowing.<p>I&#x27;d tried to &#x27;just have less lunch&#x27; and proved to be bad at resisting the options in the canteen. I took the opportunity of starting to work from home a couple of years ago to set a habit of having Huel for lunch. It meant that it was a very consistent amount of food and I just cheat by having a larger portion. I didn&#x27;t have any problem with patience as long as I saw the weight continuing to trend down, which it did from 95Kg to the low eighties.<p>While I still have Huel sometimes, I&#x27;ve stopped using it consistently as I&#x27;m pretty sure I was experiencing the testosterone depressing effect of all the flax seed. A year of it reset my expectations over lunch portions that I can cope without it though.<p>In terms of variations on weight measurements, I&#x27;ve found that weighing myself first thing in the morning, after shower and visit to the toilet (but before breakfast) reduced the noise significantly to the extent it was rarely more than +&#x2F;1 1kg')
