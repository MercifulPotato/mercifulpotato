While they are much maligned, the 8 bit PIC chips are still available, and are extremely bare bones. I think there&#x27;s a good reason why they were the favorite of hobbyists for a long time, before Arduino came along.<p>My college physics curriculum included building a 4 bit minicomputer from TTL (in the early 80s). While we were given the design, we still had to understand it in order to make it work, because nobody&#x27;s machine ever came up on the first try.')
