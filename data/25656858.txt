He was visibly taken aback from it, I think he didn&#x27;t expect it. It went something along the lines of &quot;I&#x27;ve never heard of this language, does anyone even use it, what&#x27;s the motivation for wasting a term on it&quot; (yes, it was one of my more douchebaggy moments...). He had to go do market research and come up with an answer in the next lecture, hahah.<p>Yet, once it all clicked, I loved it, and it opened up a new way of thinking for me, which was different from both imperative and, dare I say, functional paradigms.<p>I also learned that, while fairly specialised, it has very real industrial applications (e.g. there&#x27;s a super important critical infrastructure component in Microsoft built entirely on prolog if I remember correctly). Though, admittedly, I think most prolog finds uses as &#x27;pluggable components to larger non-prolog projects&#x27; these days.<p>Also, another interesting direction in Prolog is its fuzzy &#x2F; probabilistic derivatives. Very cool stuff.')
