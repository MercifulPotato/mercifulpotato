They can only avoid these stops because they are only carrying their passengers part of the way on their journey. No one is flying just to get to an airport. They have to leave the airport to go somewhere else. Also, heavy cargo is typically carried on trains, barges and trucks for energy trade off reasons.<p>2. Flying cars would not necessarily have the same safety record as commercial airlines. These airlines are regulated and each plane is meticulously maintained. Each pilot is extensively trained. A mass market flying vehicle would not have these benefits.<p>The energy trade off problem is just physics. It does take a lot of energy to keep mass suspended above earth for any length of time. Unless someone develops antigravity tech or we discover a more dense form of energy storage than jet fuel, it&#x27;s unlikely to happen.')
