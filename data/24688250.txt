Customers just don&#x27;t have the time or technical knowledge to understand the issues, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s reasonable to expect them to.<p>In cases like this where there&#x27;s a huge imbalance in power and technical knowledge between suppliers and users, I think it&#x27;s perfectly reasonable for the government to legislate on the behalf of it&#x27;s constituents to protect their interests.<p>I think at this point it&#x27;s been clearly demonstrated that DRM is simply not necessary to protect functioning markets in digital goods. Apple showed this with iTunes, arguing forcefully for DRM free music downloads. I&#x27;m a gamer and there&#x27;s a very vibrant and successful market in DRM free PDFs in the tabletop gaming industry. I&#x27;m no extremist, I don&#x27;t object to all DRM in every case, but I think arbitrary lockouts like this are clearly wrong, and a right to DRM free copies of material you have bought if a service expires or closes is perfectly fair.')
