If they are incompetent they will decide to use the GPL code with sloppy oversight, violate the terms of the GPL, then they will hold a little grudge against you for the advice that got them in trouble. Sloppy companies have no internal accountability, so it&#x27;s your fault.<p>I use GPL code all the time at home and I would license many things GPL, but there&#x27;s no reason to push GPL software at corporations.
