Let protocols specify what how it has to be serialized. This will serve as a baseline against which libraries will be measured. It significantly reduces questions on how to represent datetime, and libraries handling this have a significantly reduced space for caveats and errors.<p>You: no-no-no, it won&#x27;t work, let us make it significantly worse. Let us <i>not</i> specify this, and let everyone specify their own ad-hoc solutions with manual parsing and checks which will fail in every which way imaginable and let people serialise datetimes as `&quot;\\&#x2F;Date(1320825600000-0800)\\&#x2F;&quot;` for all I care because ... ?')
