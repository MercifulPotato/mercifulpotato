Only nginx installed via nixos conf on the base system.<p>I use podman containers since I could not find a way to have user-namespaced containers, or even just containers that don&#x27;t share the whole &#x2F;nix, which I find as a huge security risk. I really don&#x27;t care about disk space. Duplicate everything but let me isolate those containers as much as possible. Podman containers give me read-only filesystem, too. Maybe nixops might have helped, but it would have prevented me from going read-only filesystem<p>I tried using the declarative part of nixos to configure nginx, but I ended up dumping all the nginx conf on the single &quot;extra&quot; conf variable since proper declarative nginx vhosting with more than one location just does not let you do what you want (and is broken: do NOT reader my locations!!).<p>Manual dump of the conf also for the cni network management of podman.<p>wpa_supplicant most of the times starts too early and I didn&#x27;t manage to make it run later, crashed. I am using ethernet without problems.<p>So for me Big Kudos to the Nix(,Os,Ops) teams for the work done, I believe that is the future we should work towards. But we are still a far way off on many things. Documentation is also really scarce (and at rare times wrong), which increase the already steep learning curve.<p>So sorry for the &#x27;bad&#x27; review, but know that I still do not lose faith and will keep learning and trying. The basic idea is really <i>that</i> good for a sysadmin like me.')
