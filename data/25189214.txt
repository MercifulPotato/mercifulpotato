They made money, were expanding slowly and profitably, and followed the laws.<p>They were driven out of business by Uber who still (ten years later) have not made any money, and have been subsidised by deluded pension funds looking to juice their returns.<p>Whatever that is, it&#x27;s not capitalism, which at base is a system designed for people to invest money in the hope of getting more money back in the future.<p>Hailo was capitalistic, Uber is some kind of weird mishmash of communism and hipsterism. It&#x27;s like the performance art of capitalism; all of the trappings and none of the substance.<p>(For Uber, substitute your least favourite unprofitable unicorn).')
