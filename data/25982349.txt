Nationalistic swipes are not a topic.<p>The issue is that you have a long pattern of nationalistic swipes in your posts to HN (to the point where I brace myself when I see your username, because I expect to run into yet another).

The same rule holds for every user, regardless of which country anyone has a problem with.')
