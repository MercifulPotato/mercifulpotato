I had one with permanent heads.  Less than 100 sheets in, it jammed (this ream was fine with the printer before and after it).<p>It failed to put the head back on top of the seal that keeps it from drying out.  I didn’t notice the jam, and a few days later it was permanently ruined.<p>I do recommend the brother ADS line (standalone USB document scanners), with the caveat that the Linux drivers on my old one are x86-only.<p>Inkjets suck.  Don’t even think about it.  Dye sublimation is (was?) nice.<p>We have a Samsung laser, which is great, except there’s a “disable the wifi until you plug me into ethernet” button labeled WPS on the top that the cats like to press.<p>Also their printer business was acquired by HP, so it’s only a matter of time until HP manages to somehow remote brick it or stop selling consumables.')
