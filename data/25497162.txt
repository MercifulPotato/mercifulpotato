A liberal arts education is not and has never been intended to be a job-training program.<p>The trope that kids should &quot;go to college so they can get a job&quot; has elements of truth but is wildly misleading when most interpret it to be a causal relationship.  I don&#x27;t blame post-secondary academics for this -- this is mostly a cultural problem.  The last couple generations have been raised with a cultural expectation that &#x27;success&#x27; equals &#x27;college-bound&#x27;, and secondary school advisors are not willing to rock the boat by suggesting anything otherwise.')
