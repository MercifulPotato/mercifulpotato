Not everyone should save and invest the same way. Someone who&#x27;s closer to retirement shouldn&#x27;t necessarily be investing like an &quot;optimist&quot; (i.e. more risky long-term portfolio), and they&#x27;ll probably want more liquid assets than someone who&#x27;s in their 20s with very limited obligations.<p>Having an emergency fund can benefit everyone but beyond that your portfolio should ideally be driven by your goals and their timeline. If you have no goals and you&#x27;re just trying to make as much money as possible in the stock market like a lot of new retail investors, this definitely should be given some thought.<p>I think most could be better served by learning and applying goal-based investing and modern portfolio theory to achieve what this article is clumsily trying to suggest.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Goal-based_investing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Goal-based_investing</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Modern_portfolio_theory" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Modern_portfolio_theory</a>')
