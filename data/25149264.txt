In fact some already do. Nobody is making them take employment, earning a guaranteed salary regardless of the success of the business as a whole. They can take the work or not, its a straight forward tradeoff.<p>This is the problem I have with this anti-capitalism rhetoric. There&#x27;s nothing to stop people forming worker owned cooperatives, creator owned companies, etc if they want. In fact some people do exactly that and can be very successful, so clearly the regulatory framework isn&#x27;t inimical to that sort of organisation. It&#x27;s a perfectly legal ownership structure. So go and do it, and let the rest of us exercise our freedoms to do otherwise if we choose.')
