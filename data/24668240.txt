A legitimate pattern you&#x27;d see an email open event, email click event, then successful reset in that order. An illegitimate one might have no email open or click before the reset, or clicks from multiple places or something like that. That could narrow down the list significantly.<p>Of course, not all email clients allow send these events.')
