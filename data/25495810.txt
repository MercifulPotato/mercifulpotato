Item(by='the_only_law', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608564808, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25495259, text='I&#x27;ve looked at some degree programs recently, and while I&#x27;m mostly disappointed at online offerings, I&#x27;m now seriously beating a program from a flagship state school, that has an insanely affordable price for in-state students, that I could pay for out of pocket without worry. This is only due to the grace of how much in-state students are subsidized (at the cost of out of state students). I&#x27;m still unlikely to be admitted, due to the static, bureaucratic policies,  but in my past research the past couple years, there&#x27;s no way in hell I&#x27;d pay for what most colleges charge for online programs.')
