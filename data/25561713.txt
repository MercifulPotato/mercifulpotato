In many markets right now, there is just no way they are going to rent that out.<p>The only explanation I have heard is that lenders allow a certain amount of vacancy increases in the terms without triggering a reevaluation of the property value. Whereas lowering the rent will more quickly trigger that new valuation.<p>And the way many commercial loans are setup, they may require immediate payment of the difference of the value of the property if it drops.<p>But this just seems short sided on the part of the banks. And why do seemingly so many of them have this policy? If I am assessing property value and vacancy sky-rockets, I&#x27;m going to be a lot more concerned than if rent has to drop a bit.')
