If you download your FB data the text instructions of all the PDF raw contents streams actually have a null character between EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER!<p>I found it extremely annoying at first cause I was trying to copy&#x2F;paste the stream chunks around and it wouldn&#x27;t copy anything after the fist null. Then I realized this was probably a security hack in the hopes that people couldn&#x27;t copy the data around (I can&#x27;t think of any other reason to add these nulls like this otherwise). Funny enough, I opened the PDF in chrome and copy&#x2F;paste of the selected text works fine. So clearly some readers strip these bad characters, but I can imagine others might not.')
