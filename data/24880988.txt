In addition, locks don&#x27;t compose. I worked on a relatively straightforward trading app with charting and realtime rates. There were so many bugs from direct updates that interfered with rendering that it was best to restructure it as world-in, apply function(s), world-out. Then the renderer only had to deal with one frame of the world. Some items had a smaller &#x27;world&#x27;, like a single price tile. Whether done in a functional language or a procedural one this functional pattern is a common one.')
