Earlier this week, Citadel provided rescue financing to Melvin Capital, a hedge fund targeted by retail traders on Reddit.<p>I, for one, believe that Citadel Securities the market maker stands to gain more than Citadel the hedge fund ever stood to lose. And I would note that Citadel (the hedge fund) invested in Melvin; presumably to close out their shorts, not double down. Melvin claims to be out of GME, per FT reporting. FT is generally quite reputable, and it is not clear to me whether Melvin lying on this matter would be a crime?')
