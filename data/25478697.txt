Both are slow and at times lagging on this hardware. In the end I just use Rider on that laptop since if it&#x27;s lagging either way, Rider is still a more complete C# ide for me.\nMy laptop from work is a Dell Precision (Core i7-7820HQ, 32GB RAM, NVMe SSD) and is more powerful: it&#x27;s a pleasure to use Rider on that machine.')
