USB-C is only one aspect.<p>If you look at specs from Apple, Nintendo and random-knock of brands from aliba.com, you will see that they only mention the ports. nothing else. Apple will sometime use a vague spec, like the wattage.<p>Now look at USB-C specs from HP and other more reputable sources. They will specify all the PD profiles, which thunderbolt version is supported, how many lanes, etc.<p>The same happens with WiFi devices. You will be lucky if lesser brands even mention the protocol, let alone antennae and MIMO details!<p>Same can be said of Bluetooth (from cars to headsets!) which will not say if they implement a specific profile or not, but will plaster &quot;BLUETOOTH 5.0&quot; on the box.<p>The irony, is that consumers see Apple and other offenders as having better products. Just look at this thread on how the very top voted comment is someone glad that it is convenient, even though the first reply to it is trying to explain how they can fry their devices, only to be replied by someone saying &quot;i don&#x27;t care, it worked fine with the one charger i tried&quot;.')
