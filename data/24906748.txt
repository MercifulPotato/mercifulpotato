I’m Jon, co-founder of TrueContour (truecontourmasks.com). We’re making custom masks using 3D face scans that can be taken on any iPhone with a TrueDepth camera.<p>Having a custom mask allows it to be incredibly comfortable and protective while also being transparent and reusable. Today we’re launching our first mask, the TC1, on Kickstarter: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kickstarter.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;truecontourmasks&#x2F;truecontour-custom-and-transparent-face-masks.<p>I’ve been using 3D printers for a long time now. My last company, Voodoo Manufacturing, ran a 200+ 3D printer factory where we made all sorts of stuff. I’ve always looked for opportunities to apply digital design&#x2F;mfg tools to products in order to make them significantly better than they were before. When the pandemic hit, there was a lot of speculation around using 3D printing to make custom face masks. However, at the end of the day, I never thought it made a ton of sense. But then I realized that 3D printing could be used as just a step in the process, which would open up new materials.<p>After a few months of prototyping, we arrived at the TC1 Mask. I can tell you from wearing one for a while now that it’s significantly more comfortable than any other mask I’ve worn. And having it be transparent makes a big difference in my ability to communicate with others.<p>We hope that with the TC1 Mask people can keep themselves and those around them safe while maintaining closer-to-normal human connection and communication. Beyond casual use, we think the TC1 could be impactful for people across a variety of professions - teachers, nurses, restaurant workers, flight attendants and many more.<p>We’re excited to put our mask out into the world and want to hear what people think. We have lots of ideas for where this can go, but want first-hand feedback from customers before we make any major decisions. Thanks for taking the time to read this - we’d love to hear what HN thinks and are happy to answer questions. Thanks!')
