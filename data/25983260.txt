Specifically, could it work with a low resolution-ish video feed?<p>I&#x27;m specifically thinking of a very niche type of device, specifically an inexpensive VGA&#x2F;analog video capture usb &quot;stick&quot; called &quot;EasyCap&quot;. This particular name has been re-used by many manufacturers who all sell EasyCaps with different chips in them, which makes finding a working driver a complete nightmare across almost all operating systems.<p>After much research, it turns out that Linux had native support for the chip in my EasyCap, and I was able to capture video using ffmpeg (under VirtualBox running on macOS). Happy to share notes!

EasyCAP devices and clones are vastly sold in onlineshops at low prices.&quot;)')
