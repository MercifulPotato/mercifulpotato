Speed Limit +10% assuming good conditions. It keeps me from being a hazard when other drivers wish to go faster while pretty closely adhering to the whole point of speed limits. 7 mph over the limit on the freeway is still pretty safe. 7 mph over on a narrow residential street can be quite dangerous.<p>This rule of thumb means I really don&#x27;t have to waste any mental energy keeping an eye out for police, since someone else is almost always going faster and I find it doesn&#x27;t significantly impact my trip times since traffic and stop lights tend to cancel out most potential gains from driving any faster.')
