Ninety percent went to Canada, where after some initial controversy they were eventually welcomed as immigrants. Still others hid inside the United States. In addition to those who avoided the draft, a relatively small number–about 1,000–of deserters from the U.S. armed forces also headed to Canada. While the Canadian government technically reserved the right to prosecute deserters, in practice they left them alone, even instructing border guards not to ask too many questions.</i><p>&lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.history.com&#x2F;this-day-in-history&#x2F;president-carter-pardons-draft-dodgers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.history.com&#x2F;this-day-in-history&#x2F;president-carter...</a>&gt;<p>(Not an endorsement of a mass pardon of all Parler members.)')
