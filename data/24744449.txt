How is this really different to government-mandated microphones and cameras in your house, school, workplace, etc?<p>Could you explain this question to someone who doesn&#x27;t have a Facebook account?<p>As far as I understand, US phone companies are required to provide law enforcement with the ability to tap phone calls going through their exchanges, yet it doesn&#x27;t seem that is on the same level as a government mandated microphone.
