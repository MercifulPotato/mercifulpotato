It might be problematic for ReactOS to try to market their software commercially, but not for someone downloading it to use it commercially. (The latter of which is governed solely by ReactOS&#x27; own license, which takes no issue with that.)<p>The first thing to understand about fair use is that it applies to copyright infringement, so first, someone has to complain about the infringement and then you utilize fair use as a defense. And second, that fair use has some guidelines&#x2F;rules to test whether or not fair use should apply, but they are open to some interpretation.<p>So it wouldn&#x27;t be &quot;illegal&quot; to commercialize ReactOS... but it&#x27;d probably make it a lot harder for ReactOS to use fair use as a shield going forward, because it would weaken their case on one of the pillars of the fair use test.')
