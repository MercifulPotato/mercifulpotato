Citadel Securities is making money hand over fist from GME. As they always do during periods of high volume and volatility. Robinhood shutting down trading in GME almost certainly cost Citadel Securities a fortune in lost profits.<p>Nor is there even any real evidence that Citadel the hedge fund has a very significant exposure to GME. For the entire month of January the main funds have only lost 1% in GME and 3% total.[1] Probably less in total than the amount Citadel Securities has made off the trading.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2021-01-31&#x2F;the-citadel-link-what-ken-griffin-has-to-do-with-gamestop" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2021-01-31&#x2F;the-citad...</a>')
