But also you&#x27;re not allowed to use exceptions. So it&#x27;s the worst of both worlds.<p>I wasn&#x27;t aware that this is a real problem in Go land, thanks for the explanation. I wouldn&#x27;t say the language is &quot;great&quot;, was just using it as an example of a modern language where there is a consensus that &quot;they got it right&quot; and not using exceptions, even though error handling is still tedious right now.<p>I think in Rust you have to consciously fuck up the panic handler to cause similar issues, but I&#x27;m not sure.')
