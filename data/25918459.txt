Collect metrics, filter, apply rules, alert.<p>The problem is, people try to put all of those pieces into a single product.  This sometimes works, other times not.  &quot;Filter&quot; and &quot;apply rules&quot; is the real work, and it&#x27;s rather intractable.  Some products embed a DSL to attempt to empower users to create these bits themselves.<p>Presumably the &quot;AI&quot; could write the filters and rules by &quot;training&quot; on some data.  The AI can&#x27;t automatically deduce the dimensions of your data like &#x27;consider the time and day of this request&#x27; without instruction from the human.  It can&#x27;t conceptualize &#x27;is a holiday&#x2F;is not a holiday&#x27; without input from a human.<p>At the end of the day, just collect the metrics and write a small application with whatever alerting rules you want.  This might not scale, but it might not need to.')
