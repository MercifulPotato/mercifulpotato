The standard just specifies something; you still have to implement it, unless the standard supplies a reference implementation which you can make work with your code. There&#x27;s a reason why the quasi-standards for extensions to Scheme are called Scheme Requests for <i>Implementation</i>.<p>Neither R6RS nor any other RnRS standard contain a reference implementation, so whether it&#x27;s in R6RS or not, the Racket developers have to implement it. RnRS standards do tend to have a description of Scheme&#x27;s formal semantics, and SRFI documents, by convention, contain a reference implementation of the proposed API where possible.')
