This type of bet is called shorting.<p>The people on Reddit started betting the opposite way, which means the big investors might start losing on their shorts. The price of GameStop stock went up dramatically.<p>Robinhood is the main app that the Redditors used because it doesnâ€™t charge a fee to make trades. Robinhood has some legal obligations that it could no longer meet because of the amount of trading happening. They stopped people from buying GameStop, which means people could no longer bet against the big investors.<p>Some people think Robinhood and other companies stopped buys in collusion with the big investors. I doubt that is the case, but the situation is functionally the same as if Robinhood had engaged in a conspiracy to help the big investors.')
