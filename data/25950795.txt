Their rage has been manifesting in events such as Brexit &amp; the election of Trump. Currently the most visible expression is the GME saga, but the undercurrent of rage is the common factor &amp; I expect it will be more common &amp; more obvious over the next few years, as the elites try to pretend it’s back to business as usual.')
