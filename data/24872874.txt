I was eager to learn, humble, willing to put in extra work, and wanted the respect and pay that would come with promotions.<p>Over the past few years I have become jaded by the company passing me over, screwing me over, the double speak, the double standards, and even the outright lies they&#x27;ve told. This has destroyed my old perspective&#x2F;attitude. I pretty much put in the minimum hours and view everything they say as if it is a lie or a trap. I say pretty much, because I do still have an innate desire to finish things I start and to do a quality job (at any job I&#x27;ve had, and at home). This internal struggle is probably the most painful part of the experience.')
