Investing into a quick setup for CI&#x2F;CD in the beginning of a project pays of really quickly. Every time someone comes up with a &quot;simpler&quot; suggestion to deploy things, I find it always tricky and not-so-simple because of the following questions:\n- which machine do I deploy my code to? should I use an existing VM or should I get a new one? \n- what dependencies do I need to have on the machine? do I install them manually for each project?\n- how do I deploy multiple projects on this machine? what if the dependencies conflict?\n- how do I get the code to the instance? Should I use SCP, or Git, or some other method?\n- once the code is in the machine, how do I start it? how do I ensure it is running?\n- how do I securely expose it to the internet?\n- how do I serve multiple projects from the same instance?<p>Obviously, each of these questions have answers and they can be solved, potentially &quot;simply&quot; for some; but for myself, I found these to be way harder to deal with then a few lines of Kubernetes configuration. I use Docker for packaging the application, I build everything on GitLab CI, and just deploy to the same Kubernetes cluster for all of my projects. With this setup, I still use a single instance and have very low stable costs, and I can deploy 10+ projects on the same cluster since they have small load for now. Everything is standardized, and I can get to live in minutes even for a new project.<p>I believe the idea that these tools overcomplicate things need to ba taken on a case-by-case basis. For some, it works; for others, it won&#x27;t, just like any other custom script or &quot;simple&quot; solution.')
