Item(by='vinay427', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607197589, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25308001, text='&gt; Samsung is not a flagship company, their high pricing has nothing to do with performance. At best they are mid tier.<p>Their high pricing has to do with the slew of software and hardware features they include, many of which are executed at least reasonably well and later trickle down to mid-tier brands like Google&#x27;s Pixel line or more conservative high-end brands like Apple. For instance: DeX, more flexible fast USB C and wireless charging than most manufacturers, pen&#x2F;remote support with in-device charging and corresponding apps, Samsung Pay with magnetic stripe emulation, etc.<p>Samsung isn&#x27;t focused on raw computing power, because they largely depend on the same chips as most of their manufacturers, but if you&#x27;ve used a newer Galaxy S&#x2F;Note device the level of hardware polish and random &quot;gimmicky&quot; but occasionally useful features far outpaces a Pixel or similar.<p>Disclaimer: I currently own a Pixel (because there are other things that Google competes on) but last owned a Note 9.')
