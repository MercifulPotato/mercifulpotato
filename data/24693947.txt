This mortality is a product of\nacute drought compounded by the long-established removal of a key ecosystem process: frequent, low- to moderate-intensity fire.  ...\n The scale of present tree mortality is so large that greater potential for “mass fire” exists in the coming decades, driven by\nthe amount and continuity of dry, combustible, large woody material that could produce large, severe fires. For long-term adaptation to climate\nchange, we highlight the importance of moving beyond triage of dead and dying trees to making “green” (live) forests more resilient.')
