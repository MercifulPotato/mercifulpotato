I have been offered bribes to change reviews for products as a precursor to getting replacements sent out. I had to demand Amazon refund me that one as they didn&#x27;t have an issue with it!<p>I have been exposed to it a lot over the past few months trying to buy a 3080 graphics card. Three sellers have been executing a scam I don&#x27;t quite understand, beyond a data grab, but I am just not seeing how they benefit. They list the card, you buy it and then they cancel the order 5 minutes later. Then they put the cards up again the next day and the next and keep doing the same thing each time getting 5-10 peoples worth of data. They never actually sell the cards. So far Amazon has done nothing about those companies either. I have been receiving a feisty set of new spam on my amazon email address though so I think it may just be a GDPR breach thing to spam emails but I can&#x27;t see it being valuable for so few people a day.<p>Then there is the &quot;we have shipped your product and it will be with you at December 21st&quot; on a new 5800x from launch day. The mail came along with a DPD delivery number that wasn&#x27;t even the right length. I can&#x27;t cancel it because its been shipped, except shipping within the EU even by donkey doesn&#x27;t take 2 months. Amazon hasn&#x27;t done anything about them either.<p>Clearly blatant fraud when reported to Amazon is not dealt with so it isn&#x27;t a wonder the entire platform is now full of fraudsters everywhere. I have been a long time Amazon prime customer, their service was second to none. But the past year even before human malware kicked off has been an increasing problem and its time I stopped. In the instances where I have come across fraud Amazon didn&#x27;t deal with it, that is my experience of it.')
