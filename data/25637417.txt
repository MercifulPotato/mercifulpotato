I think in retrospect it was an attempt to turn my philosophical inclinations to a practical purpose. But it quickly became clear, in my opinion, that the field does not fully understand itself; it is based on more unproven premises than probably any other field of science, or even &#x27;social science&#x27;. With the exception of some kinds of disease (possibly schizophrenia), a psychiatrist&#x27;s ability seems to vary independently of his education. Success comes from being wise and understanding human nature, knowing how to talk to people.<p>Psychiatry doesn&#x27;t understand that people have been caring about mental health for millennia, even if it wasn&#x27;t called mental health, and so the field is not lindy at all. This sounds crazy but they should really be looking back to the roles&#x2F;practices of priests, even shamans, just to try and get some semblance of an idea of what works and what doesn&#x27;t...because they currently have absolutely no idea.<p>I would except CBT from this critique...it does actually seem to be a remarkable treatment (it is also lindy).')
