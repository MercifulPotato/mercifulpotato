Certainly not minimal dependencies, and you will hit a webpack wall if you need to change the build. That said, I’m working on simplifying this for my own site (Preact instead of React, static Markdown content, separate style loading, hopefully soon automatic partial hydration for whatever JS does end up on the wire) and I plan to break it all out into simple libraries so people can do similar with the same toolchain without the webpack nightmares I’ve experienced.')
