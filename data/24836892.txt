Nor does it get me anywhere close to my grandparents.  I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to visit my now wife while dating without a car.<p>I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re not American, but if you haven&#x27;t visited for a while, I suspect you&#x27;re just wrong about any sense of scale you might have.  Atlanta alone has a metro area of 8400 square miles. Houston is 10,000 square miles.<p>My wife&#x27;s family has this problem.  They&#x27;re from Taiwan. When I first visited they warned me about a long car ride to see some family in the country.  Long meant 40 minutes.<p>40 minutes barely gets you across Atlanta. 2 hours gets you to Athens if traffic is decent.  2 hours 30 minutes the a different direction will get you to my family in north GA (and Atlanta is already well in the north half of GA).  I can drive south at 80 mph for 4 freaking hours and still be in GA.')
