Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=[25272541], score=None, time=1606864417, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25271198, text='<i>&gt; the answer is not some kind of local unaccountable justice system</i><p>There is no reason why a local justice system can&#x27;t be accountable to the people who live in the community. But, as I said in another comment upthread, if the people in the community aren&#x27;t good people, you aren&#x27;t going to have good outcomes no matter what kind of system you set up, or what kind of laws you write.<p><i>&gt; It&#x27;s like the person who wrote the article literally never contemplated the reason for written law to exist in the first place.</i><p>Sure they did; they just recognize that written laws are attempts to achieve an unachievable ideal. It is impossible to capture &quot;fairness&quot; and &quot;justice&quot; in any written set of rules. There will always be human judgment required in individual cases, and human judgment is (a) subjective, and (b) depends on the humans doing the judging. If you have corrupt humans, you will get corrupt outcomes, and you can&#x27;t fix that by writing laws, because corrupt people will just figure out loopholes in the laws, and writing guaranteed loophole-free laws is impossible.')
