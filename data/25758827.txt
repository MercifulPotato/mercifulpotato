The best summary Iâ€™ve found is the staff&#x2F;principal engineer archetypes article[1] by Will Larson. He identified 4 archetypes: Team Leader, Architect, Solver and Right Hand. This categorisation broadly matches my own observations &amp; experience at Uber - even if the formal, internal company definition does not put these as such.<p>This comes after he interviewed close to a dozen staff&#x2F;principal engineers at various companies of the likes of Stripe, Mailchimp, Fastly, Slack, Split and others. The stories&#x2F;interviews[2] are worth reading to get a better picture of exactly what staff&#x2F;principal looks at each of these companies.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lethain.com&#x2F;staff-engineer-archetypes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lethain.com&#x2F;staff-engineer-archetypes&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;staffeng.com&#x2F;stories" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;staffeng.com&#x2F;stories</a>')
