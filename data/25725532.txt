Just buy a _V-for-Vendetta_ Guy Fawkes mask and you&#x27;re in. Wanna be in Antifa? Just go to a demonstration and hang-out with other people who simply look like they&#x27;re in Antifa - though that doesn&#x27;t give anyone permission to fight or act aggressively: there is a degree of mutual-acknowledgement amongst &quot;members&quot;: if someone acts aggressively or fights on the offensive (as opposed to fighting <i>defensively</i> against other people who were aggressors[1]) then you wont&#x27; find many future allies to witness in your defence in court.<p>[1] Yes, I&#x27;m aware of how murky that sounds.')
