It has an error correction mechanism which blocks the majority of mutations. By contrast influenza lacks that error correction and mutates much faster, which is why we need a reformulated vaccine every year.<p>The human species already has a significant level of herd immunity against four other endemic coronaviruses. The same thing will eventually happen with SARS-CoV-2 one way or another, but hopefully we will have an effective vaccine soon enough to accelerate that process while minimizing the death toll.')
