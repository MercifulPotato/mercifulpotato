LXD does not have the same feature set as docker or k8s.<p>If all you want is a more secure docker then podman got you covered.<p>If you want more secure k8s then you will have to wait a bit I guess for <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rootless-containers&#x2F;usernetes" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rootless-containers&#x2F;usernetes</a> but the cri-o runtime for k8s does have a rootless mode.<p>LXD is not a replacement for docker or for k8s as it offers a different feature set from both of those.<p>Last I wanted what one of the features it offered, which is a persistent whole OS container, I tried to install LXD on fedora, and after trying to get lxc running, failing to do so and seeing it&#x27;s horror show of a systemd setup while debugging [1], I looked elsewhere and instead settled for rootless podman with --rootfs.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lxc&#x2F;lxc&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;config&#x2F;init&#x2F;systemd&#x2F;lxc.service.in" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lxc&#x2F;lxc&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;config&#x2F;init&#x2F;systemd&#x2F;l...</a> does something which ubuntu is very fond off and is the main reason why I stopped using it. They call sysv-style init scripts like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lxc&#x2F;lxc&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;config&#x2F;init&#x2F;sysvinit&#x2F;lxc-containers.in" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lxc&#x2F;lxc&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;config&#x2F;init&#x2F;sysvinit&#x2F;...</a> from systemd and in my experience this obsecures errors as somethign ends up failing but via systemd it still looks like it is running.')
