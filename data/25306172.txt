I&#x27;m not a scientist or a researcher but I realize that researching is a really valuable skill and process. I&#x27;m certain people have various definitions or what it means to them to do research; but in this note I&#x27;m thinking of it as the application of the scientific process. We can research _ANYTHING_--even in our daily lives. For instance, diet, exercises, or technical things. The research process must have similarities across such topics.<p>The concept that I&#x27;m trying to get more insight to, and perhaps this essay will enlightenment me on, is the PROCESS of enduring and long term research. How do you methodically go from not knowing to insight over a LONG period of time where iteration in a necessity.<p>Are there biographies on scientists,researchers, or technologies that I can read to get this type of insight? An articulation of and detailed execution of the scientific process.')
