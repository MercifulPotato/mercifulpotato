Item(by='colanderman', descendants=None, kids=[25289937], score=None, time=1607007579, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25288307, text='I agree about the social aspects, but smart kids emphatically do <i>not</i> do well when mixed with academically average social peers. They get bored with the material, develop disdain for those who can&#x27;t keep up with them (including teachers), and overall develop an unhealthy relationship with society and schooling itself.<p>Better is to get said kids into programs with other smart kids their age, where they can be intellectually stimulated, but continue to develop normally socially.  The younger the better; suddenly being tossed into such a program after being the smartest (and possibly most isolated) kid in the room for a decade doesn&#x27;t bode well for one&#x27;s psyche either.<p>Wealthy families effectively have access to such programs via private schools, whose curriculum is often a year or two ahead of public schools.  Good luck finding such a setup in a public school system, or even finding public school teachers who can provide adequate individual instruction of advanced students: the pay to retain such teachers isn&#x27;t there.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the solution is, but I think it at least involves funding public school better.')
