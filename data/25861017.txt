Is this too complicated mathematically (even for machine-learning), or does such a thing actually exist (and I just don’t know about it)?<p>Imagine you want to write a regex that captures hex values such as 0xC0D3. You enter a few sample values (the more you enter, the more concise the regex which the generator will spit out) and the generator should easily discover that all your values start with 0x followed by exactly four digits 0-9 or a-f and give you a (albeit maybe not the best, or several) expression it can. Bonus points if it indeed explains in natural language each part of the regex it generated...<p>I’d imagine this would also be a great tool for learning regex, a sort-of “learning by reverse-engineering” if you will.<p>I seem to need regex only once every two years or so, which is not enough to learn it properly or, if I did, to retain it. So such a tool would be awesome.')
