Not everyone is willing&#x2F;able to live without technology.<p>It&#x27;s also very hard to figure out what exactly they do before making the purchase, and many vendors <i>change</i> their stance with devices already in the field. Look at TP-Link for example: They suddenly stopped allowing local access to their Kasa switches 2 weeks ago. No more integration with Home Assistant. Yes, they have decided to revert it already. That doesn&#x27;t mean they can&#x27;t do it again. I had bought 7 of these plugs <i>because</i> they offered local access. Now I&#x27;m a lot less sure of this brand.
