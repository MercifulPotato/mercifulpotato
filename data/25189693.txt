For instance, we have a &quot;white sand&quot; shortage (for making chips). (Vastly) more energy would mean more kinds of sand would be perfectly fine for production.<p>So energy is special: it is the <i>universal</i> input to industrial processes. Unlimited energy would make almost anything (more) plentiful. We&#x27;d essentially have more of what people want, whatever that is. So yes, more and cheaper housing in dense cities, but it&#x27;s probably easier to see that faster and better transport options would result. That limits everything, not just manufacturing.')
