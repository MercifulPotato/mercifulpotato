When they are finally applied that doesn&#x27;t make said application invalid or incorrect.<p>I think that some cases whereby $importantperson isn&#x27;t banned because they&#x27;re important are valid. It helps to have a public and verifiable record of a public office holder making provably false claims, particularly when a warning is then slathered over said bullshit. But the thought of a government body deciding when a company may and may not enforce its rules is chilling.')
