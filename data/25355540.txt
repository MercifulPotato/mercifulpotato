Cost around $100 on sale, battery lasts for days and I wear them 8 hrs a day for work and several hours after work listening to music or streaming video. Sound quality and active noise cancelling are both quite good for the price point. Only complaint I have is the built in microphone sounds terrible, and they always try to connect to my laptops as a headset.')
