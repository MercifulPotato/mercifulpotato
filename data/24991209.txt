Imagine a popular opinion that’s right around 50%, fluctuating by epsilon every year. If every time it went from 50+epsilon to 50-epsilon, the law changed, it would be too hard to get anything done, so a little bit of friction isn’t a terrible thing (a little bit). A system where it takes a 7&#x2F;8 vote has this anti-fickleness property, where 7&#x2F;8+epsilon can pass, but 7&#x2F;8-epsilon can’t undo (though 7&#x2F;8 is way too much friction).')
