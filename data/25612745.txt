Robotics requires a strong foundation in mathematics, control, embedded and similar, something that is unheard in typical software engineering roles. Plus, there is a &quot;real-world effect&quot; - if something works in simulation there is no guarantee it will work in the real-world (especially if the simulation is not properly designed). The software has to written in multiple programming languages, often minimum is C, C++ and Python. And everything stated here are software challenges, there are also mechanics, electronics and expensive equipment.<p>In summary, it requires more than a few tutorials to get started, it is multidisciplinary, and you have to deal with the unpredictable real-world.')
