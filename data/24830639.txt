Apple does not have your face or fingerprints.<p>FaceID and TouchID both record any data they need in parts of the enclave that can&#x27;t be used for anything else, and cannot be extracted. The information that they do store is not a picture, and cannot be reversed even in the case where someone does manage to get that data.<p>They have repeatedly documented how these features work.<p>Similarly touchid and faceid aren&#x27;t sending your touchid&#x2F;faceid data to a third party (because again, even if they wanted to, they can&#x27;t), they&#x27;re simply gating access to credential data on successful local authentication.')
