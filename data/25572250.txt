Your comment about increasing the price on old things seems like a reference to Giffen Goods? But the actual existence of such goods is somewhat unverified&#x2F;contentious, I understand.<p>One shouldn&#x27;t assume this is zero sum. Increased labor participation should (given consistent productivity) driven economic growthâ€”i.e. GDP should go up; everyone should get richer.<p>Increased workforce participation can of course drive down wages. That could explain the weakened status of the middle class. But that doesn&#x27;t explain declining labor productivity.<p>I doubt there&#x27;s one single cause. Women entering the workforce was probably a reaction to labor insecurity and also conceivably a driver of it; that resulting insecurity probably also is attributable to various policy changes (weakening of unions, decreasing political power of the working class, the increasing role of capital). I don&#x27;t have a good one-sentence summary, nor have I even made up my own mind on this.')
