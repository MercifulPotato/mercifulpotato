I have a Model 3, and trust it pretty well on highways. However it does not do turns at all, and other &#x27;city driving&#x27; type tasks well. It can now do stop signs and traffic lights, which seems to be good so far too.<p>However, not living in an area with many sidewalks, I do not trust it for one second to navigate around pedestrians or bicycles. I don&#x27;t think it will actually try to go around a bike but, I have never given it the opportunity to either. I take full control back and give them a very wide berth myself.')
