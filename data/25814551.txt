But that wasn&#x27;t the point. The solution is to go to the right site. You were supposed to use your imagination to come up with ways that might be caused to happen. The article and commenters here suggested password managers that discriminate between the right site and the wrong site, that&#x27;s an example. &quot;OH SURE BLAME THE VICTIM FOR NOT INSTALLING A PASSWORD MANAGER!&quot; If you&#x27;re looking for a solution that doesn&#x27;t whatsoever require the participation of the user, you may meet with some degree of disappointment.<p>There may be viable solutions that include still going to the wrong site, but I know for a fact that going to the wrong site does not happen if you go to the right site. It&#x27;s a tautology just like your disingenuous Twitter-style reductionist accusatory re-interpretation of my comment suggests. Speaking of which, if you want to blame the victim, go right ahead (that was your idea), but I don&#x27;t think the computer cares who gets blamed, unless and until it affects what gets typed in or clicked.')
