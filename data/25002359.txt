The tax would not apply to Twitter, and the Mid-Market tax break was tiny at about ~$50m over its entire life. In addition, all the inequality issues in San Francisco are of its own making: the city began pricing out median income households 40 years ago while the Federal government was simultaneously subsidizing long commutes. Therefore, the only people left are those who benefit from proximity to high paying jobs or those who benefit from the city&#x27;s social services more than they value moving to lower COL places like, e.g., Phoenix.')
