If I remember right, the statistical evidence shows that accidents involving mechanical issues are the same between states that require an inspection and those which don&#x27;t. The vast majority of accidents are driver error. And in my opinion, most of those are because the driver&#x27;s test is a joke.<p>&quot;The stopping distance fetish is weird in any case, whatever benefit you got from stopping faster is obviated by the outsized inflation in vehicle weights.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by this. I have actually weighed vehicles in the past and the weight was very close to the specs. If we are talking about sports cars (where the majority of spec discussions occur), then I would gladly see people talking about stopping distance opposed&#x2F;in addition to the horsepower &quot;fetish&quot; - you have to be able to stop those ponies.')
