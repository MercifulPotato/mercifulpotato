Fashion targeting older&#x2F; fatter people will have smaller sizing to flatter the customers.<p>I think buying clothes that don&#x27;t fit just because you want to say it&#x27;s a particular size is far more a part of female culture (in my social circles in the UK): womens&#x27; clothes are in &quot;sizes&quot;, men&#x27;s clothes are in measurements (inches&#x2F;cms).<p>I don&#x27;t think the industry, nor many of the customers for female fashion want accurate measurement-based sizing.')
