The work one puts into becoming a housewife isn&#x27;t about working to become a housewife, it&#x27;s about finding a spouse. There is a massive amount of media depicting romance, including domestic fantasies, it just isn&#x27;t targeted at the same audience as many here fall under. A lot of these stories even involve said person not knowing what they want to become and choosing a domestic life out of passion for the romantic interest.')
