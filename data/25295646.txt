If that&#x27;s the assumption you&#x27;re using for your investments though (everything has been going up, so it&#x27;ll keep going up) then DCA still probably isn&#x27;t what you want -- it&#x27;ll underperform even dead simple strategies like a diversified buy and hold nearly always. My point is that when choosing investments if you have any theory at all as to what the market might do (and if you don&#x27;t, why are you investing?), you ought to choose a strategy which based on that information brings you close to your goals, and secondarily it&#x27;s worth pointing out that in a broad variety of pretty ordinary market conditions DCA is not a good choice.')
