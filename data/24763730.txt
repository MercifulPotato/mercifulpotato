C++ was intended to be hardware-independent.  Java is even more intentionally and explicitly hardware-independent.  Early Python was POSIX-centric, but not hardware-centric.<p>There were Lisp machines by Symbolics, LMI, and others, but in these cases the hardware was bent to the language instead of the language to the hardware.  Common Lisp and Scheme are intentionally hardware-independent.<p>I think Cray had a Fortran dialect that exposed vector operations, but I&#x27;m not sure how many people would consider that a new language.<p>I think programmer ergonomics&#x2F;productivity and program correctness&#x2F;safety are the two most common drivers for new (non-hobby) language creation, where the former is often expressed as a matter of taste&#x2F;preference.  (I suspect personal hobby languages far outnumber other languages, but we have no way of knowing how many of these exist.)')
