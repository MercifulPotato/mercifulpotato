PHP has support for it built-in (php-sqlite3 package in Debian) and you wouldn&#x27;t have to manage a database server. Concurrent requests <i>should</i> be fine since SQLite does R&#x2F;W locking and supports transactions.<p>I can&#x27;t personally comment on how well it works for websites but I have used PHP+SQLite for local ad-hoc GUI apps and it was a pretty nice experience.')
