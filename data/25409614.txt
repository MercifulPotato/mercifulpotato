Basically they are using insights from behavioral psychology to try to encourage people to make smart financial decisions. So for every $25 you save you get a weekly lottery ticket with 7 numbers. Each night at 9pm EST they draw a new number and if you match all 7 in a week you win the $10 million jackpot. You can also win small prizes from a few cents all the way up to a Tesla.<p>I think this idea of gamifying activities that are otherwise totally boring, such as saving money, is really powerful because it&#x27;s fundamentally different from so many of the popular apps that exploit psychology to get people to take actions that are beneficial to the company instead of the user.<p>The company also is somehow able to offer a very competitive APY (currently I think it&#x27;s 20 basis points) without even factoring in the potential games from prizes.<p>I&#x27;m very curious to know what people think of this concept. What am I missing that could make this company fail? I&#x27;d also love to know if you can think of any other companies that are similar. I do know the insurance company Lemonade has used a bunch of behavioral economics principles to flip the insurance model on its head (they don&#x27;t make more money by denying claims). I think this model could be used for many different types of products.<p>Not here to push this app on anyone, but if you are interested in trying it you can use my referral code SEAN5 and we both get 100 tickets.<p>Hope people find this interesting!')
