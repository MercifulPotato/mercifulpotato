A downstream job uses these files as input, sees a new directory, and pulls all the files in the new directory.<p>Because s3 was not strongly consistent, you would have the downstream job see a arbitrary subset of the files for a short while after creation, and not just the oldest files. This could cause your job to skip processing input files unless you provided some sort of manifest of all the files it would expect in that batch. So then you&#x27;d have to load the manifest, then keep retrying until all the input files showed up in whatever s3 node you were hitting.')
