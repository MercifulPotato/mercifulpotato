Item(by='wraptile', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604987738, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25038053, text='&gt; and who goes to McDonald&#x27;s for health food?<p>This is such a weird statement, especially when McDonald&#x27;s constantly markets itself as a hangout&#x2F;social&#x2F;party food and is often perceived as such culturally everywhere around the world. So limiting variety seems like an awful contradiction here.<p>When I was teen we&#x27;d hit mcdonald&#x27;s constantly as a group of friends, that was pretty much the only time any of us would eat mcdonalds. Now that vegetarianism is becoming more popular mcdonald quickly dropped out of the menu since they don&#x27;t have a single valid option.<p>To me it&#x27;s just so mind blowing that mcdonald&#x27;s didn&#x27;t carry a single vegetarian meal other than salad, fries or desserts; what a rookie business mistake.')
