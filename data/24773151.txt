For example, by being more rigorous in defining an approach to a problem you can more easily identify roadblocks. Also I think some people I work with prefer articulating themselves over text as opposed to face to face, so for them serendipity (in terms of creative output) is probably actually improved.<p>We have tried to &quot;manufacture serendipity&quot; by having unstructured video chats but it usually ends up feeling cliquey (too small groups of friends, people feel excluded) or too awkward (too many people, not enough rapport for conversation to flow easily). I think the problem of building rapport is the biggest issue.')
