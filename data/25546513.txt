There are a handful that I feel I would not have missed as a programmer. I&#x27;ve been a computer scientist and software engineer for over 45 years, here are the mathematical subjects I&#x27;ve taken college classes in divided into two groups:<p>Useful for at least some programming or work I&#x27;ve done in the past:<p>* Linear Algebra<p>* Geometry<p>* Calculus and Vector Calculus<p>* Differential Equations, Partial Differential Equations, and Control Theory<p>* Logic<p>* Combinatorics and Graph Theory<p>* Number Theory<p>* Fourier Analysis and Laplace Transforms<p>* Operations Research<p>* Discrete Math<p>* Computability<p>* Probability<p>* Statistics<p>* Numerical Methods<p>Classes that I haven&#x27;t needed for programming yet:<p>* higher levels of Abstract Algebra, Non-Commutative Ring Theory<p>* Real Analysis, Complex Analysis, Measure Theory<p>* General Topology (I suppose some concepts are useful in category theory and perhaps kernel transformations in machine learning are superficially similar to the subjects covered in Topology)<p>The world is full of programs so some don&#x27;t require much math, but mathematical sophistication is needed for advanced programming and young programmers should do their best in school to learn math well.')
