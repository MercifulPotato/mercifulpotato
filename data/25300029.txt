But pip does have a subtle involvement here: Many Python packages available to Conda are packaged based on installations made by pip, and (IMO lazily and incorrectly) inherits a lot of pip characteristics. This makes the packages “appear” to be installed by pip, and sometimes induce interpolation inconsistencies.')
