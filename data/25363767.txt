Item(by='doublerabbit', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607543838, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25362954, text='&gt; I also have a litter picker, and re: &quot;the likes of you&quot;: no, I don&#x27;t consciously throw litter away on the street. I even keep plastic with me to recycle at home.<p>While I&#x27;ve not read the book you linked but I saw at as attempt of as strike &#x2F;for&#x2F; meat. My assumption is that this is the internet those who use social media enjoy being vindictive on the basis there is more evil then good on the internet. It enlightens me that your someone who does care to which I will take back my remark and apologize. Sorry.<p>I too don&#x27;t like the word activist. It has a horrible concatenation to it. I normally just stick around with environmentalist.<p>&gt; You said vegans eat less avocado than non-vegans.<p>I go on my view of products used in commercial food. Guacamole and the likes are all unnecessarily products sold to the supermarket consumer I would view as high amount. Personally I dislike the taste.<p>&gt; I actually do care but I try to be realistic and practical. My approach is long-term. Most people eat meat, and they&#x27;re not going to change that. They like the taste, they like the structure. If lab meat is a 1:1 copy of that, and it can be priced competitively, there&#x27;s no more need for the bio industry. Its going to be a massive blow for animal suffering, world-wide. More impact than all of the people who are vegan combined.<p>I agree wholly and I work on the same basis. I can&#x27;t convert someone, why should they listen to me? And I am not someone who is for preaching. I&#x27;ll express my concerns above allowing the other person to take and think. I of-course listen and understand those to who do eat meat. And those who do, I won&#x27;t shame, life is made of choices, you do you. But for me, I don&#x27;t partly because my moral compass says no, like for the reasons above. I don&#x27;t eat sugar either as that again is an destructive product of the devil.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s akin to the question why we still use fossil fuels. Because it has its advantages.<p>Money is a large factor but I don&#x27;t have the time to debate, but I would argue that the advantages given are themselves disadvantages. I would argue that the con&#x27;s outweighs the pro&#x27;s and that it&#x27;s destructive all around. From manufacturing to usage.<p>Thank you for the civil discussion :).')
