Having now transitioned to more of a road bike, the difference in rideability is pretty stark.<p>I guess it could be the derailleur, but I assumed it was the tires and gearset that made it a pain to get places. I also have noticed a night and day difference when my tires are properly inflated. I just replaced the tubes and tires so maybe I&#x27;ll have better luck now, but previously I needed to refill the tires basically daily to keep them in the right range.')
