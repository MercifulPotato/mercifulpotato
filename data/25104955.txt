But there are some key components that everyone misses. You can&#x27;t replace facebook. People complain about facebook, but those of us who steer clear from it are a minority. And if potentially I were to create a facebook which solves the problems I have with the existing one, I&#x27;d be making a facebook clone that fits the requirements of a small subset of those who aren&#x27;t on facebook. Basically insignificant market share and it would be a catastrophic waste of time, effort and money. Hence the reason why I&#x27;m not doing it(also because I find social networks inherently boring).<p>The second big misconception is that in order to make a billion or even a million dollar product, you need to focus on a personal problem you are trying to solve. Essentially your product should solve your problem. And this lures people into an entirely different rabbit hole - convincing themselves that &quot;X&quot; is their problem and that many other people have that problem. Often no one has that problem or it&#x27;s so insignificant that no one will even bother giving it a thought.<p>The next big rabbit hole are apps. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, apps are great and I rely on my phone heavily. However the Pareto rule is in full effect here. People will have 60 apps installed, and will use around 20% of those. And they will use heavily 20% of that subset. Say the average human being spends, say, an hour and a half on his or her phone a day. 80% of which will be messaging&#x2F;social media, where you can&#x27;t compete. So you are left competing with 10 other apps for the user&#x27;s attention for a portion of the remaining 36 minutes. Sure, you could get a few thousand users out of several billion people. But again, Pareto&#x27;s rule: most of your revenue will come from a small subset of those. Which often defeats the purpose. It&#x27;s really hard to compete as a startup or an indie developer, when thousands of companies have thousands of astonishing developers at their disposal + the finances to back up any new project.<p>In addition, an idea in itself is worth nothing. It&#x27;s what you do with it and how you market it that counts.<p>Which leads me to my final point. Billion dollar ideas are really hard to execute because the bar has been set very high. It&#x27;s not something a single person or a small team can pull off. Those who do are the black swans. On a semi-related note, when the pandemic started, I was pretty convinced that many people will step up their game and come up with relevant products which will help the world adapt to the new normal. Which didn&#x27;t happen to my big surprise. And I&#x27;m kind of disappointed that I didn&#x27;t take on the challenge either(too much on my plate already + it&#x27;s hard to work alone on a project). There were so many opportunities that were entirely missed... Shame but oh well... Next time maybe...')
