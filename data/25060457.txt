In practice, job training has a poor track record [1]. College aid mostly helped middle- and high-income families [2]. Universal health care is an unknown.<p>A high-income New Yorker and rural Obama-Trump Alabaman will prioritise different things in a healthcare bill. The latter don&#x27;t trust the former. For good reason. We have ignored them.<p>We then dressed up that ignorance by pretending our interests are identical. Those who checked found uncomfortable truths. A healthcare bill fighting for support in Texas can&#x27;t fund abortions and transition surgery and drug rehabilitation. But without those things it is a non-starter in New York and California.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.com&#x2F;books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=5n7j_-EhB3IC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=nafta+job+training&amp;ots=UjTEvdoa7I&amp;sig=RG-M5UdYQSo2JLxOCxPj0O_twRY#v=onepage&amp;q=nafta%20job%20training&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.com&#x2F;books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=5n7j_-EhB3IC&amp;oi=...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nber.org&#x2F;system&#x2F;files&#x2F;working_papers&#x2F;w7756&#x2F;w7756.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nber.org&#x2F;system&#x2F;files&#x2F;working_papers&#x2F;w7756&#x2F;w7756...</a>')
