There are many official documents you have to print, sign, scan and send. Just yesterday I had to fill out a mail order so that my office can send WFH equipment to my residence. For those who are recommending running to the nearby print-shop, it doesn&#x27;t matter how close the store is, nothing beats the convenience of having a printer-scanner right next to my desk especially when it&#x27;s raining or sub zero outside. These days kids are doing school from home, so I scan their art-work and upload (turns out better than taking a picture). My ten year old Brother laser printer works well with CUPS and if it were to die I&#x27;ll buy a laser printer-scanner in a heartbeat. It makes life so easy having a printer-scanner at home.')
