Two wikipedia articles, one seemingly reputable blog, and.... gwern.net, the ravings of a racist crank whose shtick involves routinely cites racist psychologists to make false arguments about whether IQ is &quot;impossible to improve.&quot;<p>In general idea that IQ has biological significance, and linking to anyone who approvingly cites The Bell Curve&#x27;s most controversial parts, are both dangerous. More to the point - it&#x27;s not dangerous because it&#x27;s &quot;taboo facts,&quot; it&#x27;s dangerous because it&#x27;s misinformation which has been discredited by decades of science.<p>If Slava is being &quot;ironic&quot; or &quot;satirical&quot; with this garbage then he needs to make it more clear, or just delete the entire section.')
