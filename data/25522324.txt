That&#x27;s the one thing Google&#x27;s lawyers would insist Google <i>cannot</i> do.<p>Presumably neither one of us are the experts on EEOC and employment litigation strategies. So instead I&#x27;m going to take the statements at face value. And at face value: Google is no longer willing to state that Dr.Gebru resigned. Anything else is spin.')
