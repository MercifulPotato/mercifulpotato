One day I expect to see the PlayStation 6 for example, and one day I expect to see an update to the MacBook, and so on.<p>One day, do I expect to see an unveiling of a new Gmail UI? None of it is predictable because it feels like they do some serious a&#x2F;b tests and just silently roll stuff out. They lack a structured presentation timeline. Currently users have no predictable expectations.<p>When that’s the case, just rename stuff, rebrand stuff, get rid of stuff, who the fuck cares. We didn’t promise the user updates, or even iterations, we simply promised them a one time product.<p>That’s the only thing that I can think of behind all of this. The simpler answer could just be their product team is not the best of the best for a company that works pretty hard at getting the best.')
