There are different levels of trade offs they can make as they become more secure. What you’re describing is the top level of security but it’s not very convenient to use. It also uses private keys which makes establishing a new connection challenging.<p>There are as I see it a few main security modes: stopping automated surveillance and hacking, stopping low effort surveillance and hacking, and being “perfectly” secure from the most motivated adversary.<p>Being perfectly secure on a networked computer is basically impossible. Governments likely have access to back doors and  0days that can compromise anyone (and keep in mind if the person on the other end has bad opsec, you’ve already lost). But they’re probably not going to unleash the fire and fury on Joe Schmo, and would probably be reluctant to target someone security-minded who might identify how they got pwned and publicize the vulnerability unless they have a damned good reason.<p>Most people don’t need never-crackable, they just need to be reasonably assured that only a very motivated adversary could crack them.')
