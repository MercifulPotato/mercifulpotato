In some other fork I posted an example where Russian govt has extra-legally shut down a live opposition broadcast by cutting power to the studio.<p>This is not a switch, but a spectrum. Monopolies&#x2F;oligopolies should be either broken down or regulated. Electrical companies should be more regulated, cloud providers less regulated, social networks perhaps much less regulated.<p>I frankly don&#x27;t think social networks are that important at all, but I am trying to account for my biases. For many people and organizations, they are not really like a newspaper, a comparison many make here - they are more like a printing press, or a radio transmitter or something. If one company owns the entire radio spectrum or all the printing presses, it ought to be regulated.')
