Also, being USB, there are many possible subsets and no such thing as a “universal cable”.  The silicon is still immature and the analog issues are fiendishly complex.<p>The cheapo vendors will implement the minimal standard (or less).  The higher end devices will be more compliant, but bugs remain (as I said, still early days).<p>But last year I switched to buying type C devices whenever I had the choice (even electric toothbrush) and so far it’s been fine.')
