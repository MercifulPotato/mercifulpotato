As of now on an average 33000 ppl are killed in road accidents in USA. Lets say Tesla&#x27;s or other ICE makers&#x27; autopilot reduces this to 20000 deaths. But of those 20000 deaths, say 2000 were purely because of autopilot alogrithm which wouldn&#x27;t have happened if there was no autopilot. As a regulator what will you do. Approve autopilot because it saved 13000 people or ban it because 2000 were killed just because of it? I know how this will play in media. Unfortunately autopilot will be demonized and most likely will get banned.')
