And even after the 4 years of gaslighting and bigotry, they almost did it again.\nI wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the democrats who make topics like wearing a mask or the destruction of the environment political.<p>Now you have democrats who play that game too, but since they have the facts &quot;in their favor&quot; it&#x27;s to their detriment (I&#x27;m putting quotes here because covid and global warming being real isn&#x27;t to anyone&#x27;s favor, but it&#x27;s facts). Mud fights benefit those without good arguments.<p>That said, I agree with your post, antagonizing people doesn&#x27;t help changing minds.')
