It cites three of the authors&#x27; papers that each contain empirical results. The abstract of the first ends:<p>&quot;We formally show that this iterated supervised learning procedure optimizes a bound on the RL objective, derive performance bounds of the learned policy, and empirically demonstrate improved goal-reaching performance and robustness over current RL algorithms in several benchmark tasks.&quot;')
