Shannon entropy in particular. Of course you can encode information up to the time granularity, but if you&#x27;re talking about that then you&#x27;re not talking about the content in transmission anymore--which we are--hence why you and others are confused why we&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s still 1 bit.<p>If you want to get into the topic of Shannon entropy, then that&#x27;s another conversation.')
