I believe demonstrated science is fact, but that&#x27;s still a belief about the world. My parents are in scientific fields, I received a science and engineering based education, and generally have faith in the scientific method as performed by most scientists.<p>But we DO have to convince people, we have to convince people by showing them how it works, and letting them decide that that makes sense, you can&#x27;t just mandate belief as a science authoritarian.<p>And science is still performed by humans, and we&#x27;re fallible, and our incentives aren&#x27;t always good, and every time there&#x27;s a public failure of the process, and every time a scientist goes on record to shill for a company&#x27;s chosen viewpoint, it dings the general public&#x27;s faith in science and scientific experts in general.')
