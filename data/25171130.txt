It&#x27;s very difficult to do that with bare bones notes and underlined keywords&#x2F;phrases. It skips over the necessary mental processes involved in moving information from short to long-term memory, and for understanding. Highlighting keywords&#x2F;phrases doesn&#x27;t aid in retention or understanding, it avoids it.')
