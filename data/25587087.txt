A probabilistic analysis shows the proximity to a major coronavirus lab and anomalies in the genetic code are too unlikely for SARS-CoV-2 to have developed naturally.<p>They&#x27;re stating the facts of the results of the probabilistic analysis, not the facts of the actual situation. Their only comment about the actual situation is that it&#x27;s &quot;likely&quot;.<p>I can see how it could be interpreted in the way you suggest, but if you read it from the perspective of discussing the probabilistic analysis, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re intending to mislead. But, again, I also don&#x27;t know how strong the analysis is. It could be that the analysis is weak, in which case I still wouldn&#x27;t think the tweet is likely deliberately misleading, but simply wrong.')
