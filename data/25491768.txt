You could have joined in 2010 and your equity today would be in the seven figures.<p>I’d bet on stripe being similar (though I don’t know the specifics of their offer letters).

For most people it&#x27;s a losing proposition.”<p>People on HN can keep repeating this to feel better about themselves, but those that ignore it are the ones that’ll make seven figure (or higher) returns.<p>Edit: SpaceX (Starlink) are other bets I’d be happy to make.')
