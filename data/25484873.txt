But it matches on &quot;Management&quot;! It&#x27;s not that it didn&#x27;t index it, it&#x27;s just that it couldn&#x27;t be bothered <i>fully</i> indexing it... or something.<p>Type &quot;Internet&quot; and you won&#x27;t see Internet Options. Sometimes it won&#x27;t show up even if you&#x27;ve typed &quot;Internet Opt&quot;. You have to complete the search to &quot;Internet Options&quot;, character-for-character to reveal that it exists.<p>Etc...<p>It blows my mind that this could be fucked up, not just once, but for every single Windows release since Vista, in similar but different ways.')
