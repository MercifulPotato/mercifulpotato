Item(by='onecommentman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604273960, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24962748, text='Is there a way to prototype the idea on a smaller set of postings?  Perhaps have a setting by user name.  When making a downvote, you would be presented with an option for reason if the poster has that setting for their account.<p>I think of this forum as a well-moderated “put a penny in the pot” sort of place.  You say your piece and move on.  You put your penny in because you’ve gotten pennies in the past.  Nice to know you’re generally making a positive rather than a negative contribution, but ultimately it’s just pixels on a screen.<p>But others quite reasonably want more feedback.  Perhaps to refine their ideas, or to improve on their presentation or persuasion skills.  Be nice for them to have the option to get that feedback.<p>Perhaps the setting would also be enforced on the first five postings from new accounts, or if the user is an obvious troll or shill.  For the new account, the feedback should be softened as they ease into the culture.  Perhaps with helpful tips.<p>In-groups are everywhere, sadly.  Easier to address if you have a solid sense of self-esteem and a proven track record in life to support you if you are swimming against the stream.  Perhaps the movie “Twelve Angry Men” might be of service.  Outsider status can be quite powerful in its own way...')
