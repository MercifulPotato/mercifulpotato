They&#x27;re all Samsungs, oddly enough. A 50&quot;, a 55&quot;, and a 60&quot;. My only hope is that they last long enough to come out the other side of the only-Smart-TVs tunnel.<p>Yeah, they&#x27;re &quot;only&quot; 1080p, but then again, my movie collection is mostly standard definition anyway. I realized that I don&#x27;t need higher than that if I&#x27;m enjoying a movie&#x2F;TV show: I stop noticing the picture quality once the story quality surpasses it.')
