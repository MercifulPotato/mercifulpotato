They&#x27;re still plotting all the same violence, but instead of being protected by a promise from the founder, they&#x27;re protected by the design of the app itself. There&#x27;s no argument to use against Parler that can&#x27;t be used against Signal. They need to be shut down <i>now</i>, before people die again.<p>Signal is a threat to our core tenets of freedom, security and democracy. Parler could change its moderation policy tomorrow but Signal can&#x27;t change how it works.')
