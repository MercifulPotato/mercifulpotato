This is just the worst type of union, because members are implicitly assumed to agree with the unionâ€™s political ideals (can you imagine conservatives joining this union in large numbers?) and also because if it grows large enough, it may make moves to become certified. That will put paid to Googles chances of  doing business as it sees fit without any regard to the politics of what they do. How would collective bargaining work at Google? What would be the demands of such a bargaining group, aside from purely political items?')
