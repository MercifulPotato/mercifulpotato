No one you know grew up hunting them. Killing a (still) endangered species is not about conservation, in fact, it&#x27;s closer to the opposite based on everything we know.<p>I&#x27;m talking about killing for sport, which is what wolf hunting is all about on an individual level (on a government level, it&#x27;s about the political showmanship of protecting rancher interests).<p>And as a sidenote, I live in Montana; I am very familiar with hunting. To generalize hunting without considering the animal being hunted is disingenuous and entirely self-serving. Should we talk about hunting horses and dogs in the same breath?')
