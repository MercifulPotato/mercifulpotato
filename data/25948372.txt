Melvin Capital stated they had closed out their short position on GameStop, but those are huge losses to cover no one knows how true that is.  There is a lot of rumor that Citadel&#x2F;Melvin Capital re-bought short positions yesterday before Citadel restricted trades to manipulate the market.  If this is true it is highly illegal, but this effectively allow Citadel&#x2F;Melvin to make back their losses if they can force market prices down.<p>TL&#x2F;DR, Citadel&#x2F;Melvin are breaking the law, all the retail traders are getting fucked, but when this is done Citadel&#x2F;Melvin ends up having more cash than ever.')
