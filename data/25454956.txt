Letâ€™s just turn him into a total renegade who disregards authority and gets into bar fights while jamming to 20th century hip hop and end the trilogy with Kirk on a motorcycle...while jamming to 20th century hip hop.<p>And I know: the movies were trying to give us younger versions of the crew but sheesh..</i><p>Agreeing with your general point, but I found this depiction  actually believable for Kirk <i>in his 20s</i>.<p>Take a look at real-life celebrities in their 30s&#x2F;40s who have an &quot;edgy&quot; reputation. They often were a lot more extreme in their youth.<p>Seems to me they wanted to portrait Kirk as a bored rich kid who doesn&#x27;t really know yet what direction to take in his life. That&#x27;s not that unusual, even for persons who later found a very strong direction.<p>Even Obama writes about such a phase in his bio.')
