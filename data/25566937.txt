They both are about &quot;mapping&quot; things to other things. So because they are conceptually related one would assume that their names are somewhat similar as well.<p>What is unfortunate I think is that JavaScript Object does not have the method &quot;map()&quot; like Array does. Therefore you can not &quot;map() over Maps&quot; (or Objects in general).')
