For your own benefit - shut up about bias. Seriously, hear me out. I&#x27;m not just ragging on you.<p>Sure, bias exists, but you&#x27;re getting awful at identifying it. More importantly, railing about bias won&#x27;t get what you want, which is bringing grief to center-&gt;left people in power.<p>I have something better for that.<p>What you want is a Meaningfully Competent Press Corps - something that mostly doesn&#x27;t exist now.<p>An MCPC never hesitates to target anyone in power. It knows government and corporations are dangerous by default - that harm is only averted thru ceaseless, aggressive, public oversight. It lives to expose powerful corruption and it doesn&#x27;t care who&#x27;s it is. A MCPC knows that secrecy is generally about hiding misdeeds and it never, ever assumes powerful people are being truthful.<p>Will a MCPC routinely ding powerful people you like? Sure, but isn&#x27;t that what you see happening now? Wouldn&#x27;t it be gratifying to see powerful people you dislike get dinged?<p>How about Pelosi going down for protecting horrific CIA abuses? Sweet. Imagine Obama being justly shamed for prosecuting more whistleblowers than all previous PotUS combined. An MCPC could deliver that for you.<p>Consider how golden that could be.<p>Seriously conservative dudes. Forget bias. An MCPC will cost you nothing that you aren&#x27;t already paying and it is uniquely positioned to give you rich, satisfying payback - which, truthfully, is what you want.')
