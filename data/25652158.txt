Example, I donated to a particular children&#x27;s hospital because it was the dying wish of a friend that donations be made to that specific charity instead of sending flowers to the funeral. I don&#x27;t care about or have a connection to that charity in any other way and I&#x27;m not going to dontate to them again but they hound me incessantly for more money.')
