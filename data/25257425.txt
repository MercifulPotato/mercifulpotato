Apologies if that was what it felt like<p>My point is that even when you do not want to give people what they expect (and you have good reasons for not doing so, as you sum up here), you still need to meet them where their expectations are and lead them out of it. Because that&#x27;s the best way to make sure that they find their way to where you are coming from and where you want them to end up too.')
