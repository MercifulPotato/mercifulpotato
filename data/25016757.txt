Libraries are uniquely cross-platform, <i>cross-computer</i>, and tested to scale comfortably to 500k+ assets. You can run the windows desktop edition, put your library on an external drive, move the drive to your Mac, automatically import whatever&#x27;s on that computer, and sweep all your photos (JPEG and RAW) and videos (with auto-transcoding) into one tidy, de-duplicated folder hierarchy.<p>The UI is web-based and mobile-friendly. The docker image runs happily on NASes and anywhere else docker runs.')
