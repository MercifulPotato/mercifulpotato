The extent they care is directly linked to the amount of money they will make from caring. They won&#x27;t sell more macs if macs can run Linux better; but they will sell more Apple Music subscriptions if macs keep running macOS.<p><i>&gt; They know Linux is important</i><p>No, they know Linux is <i>a pain in the ass</i>. The bootloader option assuages the executives&#x27; conscience enough to be able to talk to a journalist and keep a straight face when asked about &quot;openness&quot; or being &quot;hacker-friendly&quot;, stuff those 1980s-style Linux hobbyists keep talking about and nobody else gives a shit about.<p>Apple makes money by selling iDevices to consumers and selling Macs to enough developers to build apps for iDevices. Everything else is a bonus, and not worth spending much time on. They do the minimum and leave it as that. There is no inconsistency or secret motive. They just don&#x27;t care. When they cared, in the early &#x27;00s, they did a bit more; now they do less. The attitude is the same.')
