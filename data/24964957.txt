Tapping that cable, however, was almost impossible without the help of the Danes, so the NSA asked the FE for access to the cable.<p>This was revealed in details about 20 - 30 years ago in the Danish publication &quot;MÃ¥nedsbladet Press&quot;. I remember they had an insert, looked like a small newspaper, containing all the details about this.  I remember this because this was the first time I heard the term &quot;echelon&quot;. I my memory serves me correct I think that insert in the magazine was the first story or source of Echelon operating outside of the US so there is some kind of historical significance to this story.<p>If I recall correctly they did this wiretapping in a underground bunker in the middle of Copenhagen. The bunker had no toilet and they got spotted by the journalists that wonder why more people was coming out of that bunker everyday to go the bathroom than people going in. Something like that.<p>I don&#x27;t have the magazine anymore but I know that the main library in Copenhagen has a copy as I checked several years later.<p>If any historians around here want the backstory behind all this you should contact the library and get a copy of that publication. The publication stopped long ago, but that was the only newspaper-like insert they every had so it should be easy to locate in the archives.')
