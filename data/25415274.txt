Their beliefs don&#x27;t come from their life experience or that of their family handed down to them. It comes from marketing material. Therefore they&#x27;re highly inconsistent in their beliefs and what they believe they believe does not have anything to do with them or how they actually live their lives.<p>So, if you want to understand what they think they&#x27;re about, you can just watch the &quot;news&quot; or read other PR material targeted to them. That is now more difficult because it&#x27;s a bit more targeted because of social media marketing but it is still possible.<p>But if you want to know what they actually believe without even knowing that they do, you have to look at what they actually do and how they live their lives.')
