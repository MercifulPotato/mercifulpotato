But the standard library isn&#x27;t optimised for that use case, so you need to avoid most of it.<p>Use `UnsafeBuffer` instead of the standard library `String` or `Array`, unsafe mathematical operators (`&amp;*` instead of checked multiplication `*`) and use neither `class` nor existentials (because they involve reference counting and heap allocation).<p>That leaves you with the same language constructs as C and LLVM compiles it to the same instructions.')
