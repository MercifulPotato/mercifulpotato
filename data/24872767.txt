Currencies are issued by sovereign governments, and don&#x27;t exhibit network effects within that sovereign jurisdiction, <i>because they don&#x27;t need to.</i> They&#x27;re legal tender; you&#x27;re required to accept them, and everyone needs them to pay taxes.<p>If you mean money as in wealth, that&#x27;s an entirely different topic.')
