And while you&#x27;re waiting for a vaccine to get ready, it kind of makes sense to spread things out.<p>Who benefits from fear? I&#x27;d guess weapons companies.<p>Who benefits from lockdowns? No idea. Pro gamers?<p>I can&#x27;t really decide if you&#x27;re posting here to stir up a reaction or if you are strongly convinced that seroconversion is a good idea. But just for the sake of discussion, you should consider that the chance of side effects is high enough that many people would actively resist seroconversion. So my guess would be that people who consider that to be a great idea are a 5% minority. That&#x27;s why governments will likely not do it.')
