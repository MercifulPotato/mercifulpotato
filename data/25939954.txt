Item(by='Traster', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611826379, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25939841, text='There are many coffee shops in the city and there are plenty of social media platforms online (Youtube, Facebook, Tiktok, Reddit, Twitter, Whatsapp, Telegram, Twitch, Pinterest, WeChat, Snapchat). Also, there&#x27;s really no evidence they&#x27;re coordinating. If the guys I kick out of my coffee shop walk down the road and start shouting Retard at each other in a different coffee shop they&#x27;re going to get kicked out of that one too. Not because we&#x27;re in some big cabal to censor these people, but because actually most people have a fairly similar definition of offensive language, and most coffee shop owners know what&#x27;s going to drive customers away. At no point does that suddenly turn into censorship.')
