Item(by='dundarious', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608048640, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25431369, text='Twitter&#x27;s character limit certainly begs for hot takes, but I find Twitter to be as filled with cat photos, Simpsons memes, movie rankings, and whatnot. Nevertheless, I do enjoy the political sparring there as well.<p>My qualm with the &quot;Twitter is toxic&quot; discourse is that it often (not accusing you of doing this) points the finger at people with opposing beliefs who are making _fun_ of each other, or being &quot;snarky&quot; as HN guidelines put it. Certainly HN isn&#x27;t the place for that, nor should it be, but I don&#x27;t see why Twitter should stop being a place for that. Of course there are users who do incite violence as you say, and I don&#x27;t have a problem with calling them toxic, and moderating them.<p>I should also add that Twitter is far easier to curate -- there is no social obligation to follow people in your real world social circle.')
