Aside, unlocking an app should just be an `apps:unlock` call.<p>&gt; Let’s Encrypt integration not working properly without dokku-event-listener, which must be built &amp; installed from source and is basically undocumented.<p>That shouldn&#x27;t be the case - the letsencrypt plugin was available long before the dokku-event-listener project was, and the latter has been built&#x2F;released automatically since April[1] (though didn&#x27;t have documentation on it&#x27;s internals till recently, as that wasn&#x27;t really necessary for end users as there isn&#x27;t any configuration).<p>&gt; At the time I used it, blue&#x2F;green deployments were not available. (I see this is now supported, great to see that.)<p>Not sure what youre referencing here. We don&#x27;t have anything specific for blue&#x2F;green deployments, but we have had zero-downtime checks for a while. If you can point out to me where you found this (or what you were expecting) that would be awesome :)<p>&gt; To be fair, I didn’t report any of these issues, so I may have done something wrong or there may have been solutions that I missed. This was also 6+ months ago.<p>Reporting issues is always appreciated as its almost certain there were bugs on our end, but it seems you&#x27;ve found your solution :)<p>&gt; I also think that with all the major cloud providers now supporting Kubernetes as a first-class primitive, and with there being an abundance of CI&#x2F;CD tools that can trivially deploy to Kubernetes, the PaaS concept is no longer as attractive as it once was.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is quite true. Kubernetes is still a large system that doesn&#x27;t come &quot;batteries included&quot;, and every setup is at least subtly different from the next. I think a large number of teams spend a disproportionate amount of time configuring their preferred toolchain - and then maintaining it - once you get to a certain scale. Additionally, a kubernetes manifest is much lower-level than is necessary for the general app developer who just wants to get things done.<p>I&#x27;m personally hoping that Kubernetes distributions begin to mature more (Tanzu and Openshift are examples, but not the only ones) so that folks start worrying less about operating and maintaining clusters and more on either the underlying infra or the end developer experience.')
