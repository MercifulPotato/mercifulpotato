The problem is I want something different from what seemingly the entire space of game developers is willing to make, even when there are no economics at stake. When I see a little game like this, which clearly came from a place of inspiration and was positioned to break the mold, and then it&#x27;s <i>still</i> spoiled by just a tiny piece of needless gamification, it&#x27;s doubly frustrating specifically <i>because</i> it came so close to escaping that trope.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to come off as demanding - people can make what they want to make - I just feel like sometimes people tack this kind of mechanic onto a game not because it&#x27;s essential, but because (consciously or subconsciously) they&#x27;re afraid people won&#x27;t know what to do with a video game that <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> give you a dopamine kick in the form of a number going up. Of course I don&#x27;t know if that was the case here (though I suspect it might be), it&#x27;s just that this game touches on a much bigger story of exasperation with the world of game design, for me.')
