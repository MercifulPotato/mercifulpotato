Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607994855, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25420414, text='&gt; scale.<p>This is the error. The problem isn&#x27;t <i>scale</i>. If YouTube has 500 hours of video uploaded per minute and some other site has only one minute of video uploaded per minute, the smaller site is no better able to handle it, because they don&#x27;t have <i>proportionally</i> any more staff than YouTube.<p>The actual problem is marginal cost.<p>If you have a Walmart store, it probably costs over a million dollars to construct it, and takes in several million dollars a year in revenue. A $10,000 fire suppression system may be expensive, but it&#x27;s manageable. And if there are a thousand Walmart stores all over the country that each need a $10,000 fire suppression system, that <i>scales</i> just fine. You have a choice between an unsafe Walmart and a safe Walmart whose proprietors make slightly less profit.<p>The marginal profit from hosting a given video is pennies. That means any solution that costs more than pennies isn&#x27;t a choice between unsafe and safe video hosting, it&#x27;s a choice between having video hosting and not having it. Scale has nothing to do with it; greater or lesser scale doesn&#x27;t save you from a cost that exceeds your entire margin.')
