You have to put the liquid in the hole and turn the key and keep pressing the floor-thing and hold the circle thing all while looking out the window to make sure no one gets in your way and the car stays on the hard paths.<p>What they really want is to just be able to jump in the back seat and state their destination then go back to chuckling at tik-toks and messaging friends until they&#x27;re there. That&#x27;s the kind of car assembly they want, complete with the commensurate salary and benefits. Is it really so much to ask to have that delivered to them?')
