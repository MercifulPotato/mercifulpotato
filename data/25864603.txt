Meaning: it&#x27;s relevant because it&#x27;s particularly insecure, and a bad idea to implement a browser inside a browser (which is what you do when you develop a &quot;browser&quot; in Electron, implementing GUI using web-technologies).<p>And they didn&#x27;t migrate to CEF (which is another embedded framework), but built Brave on top of Chromium AFAIK.<p>As you can see linked [0] in another thread here, what I&#x27;m describing above makes sense in the context of Google blocking anything that&#x27;s implemented in an embedded framework (e.g. Electron, CEF, webviews) which does not use browser-based OAuth authentication.<p>I agree – The suggestion you mention doesn&#x27;t make any sense from a security perspective, but from a purely functional perspective it would seem to solve the problem at hand.<p>And while I agree that the end result is bad, I frankly find it weird to complain that Google won&#x27;t just fork over their proprietary DRM-implementation on someone else&#x27;s terms. And it&#x27;s not very surprising that it&#x27;s closed source, or handled this way; It&#x27;s typically how DRM works, after all – which is why the inclusion of DRM in webstandards was widely debated in the first place.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;security.googleblog.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;04&#x2F;better-protection-against-man-in-middle.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;security.googleblog.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;04&#x2F;better-protection-ag...</a>')
