Whereas any React tutorial starts with code. You don&#x27;t really start by laying things out and connecting the dots as such, you start by typing.</i><p>I agree, this is a good point and a strong contrast.<p>Given how the React model is a relatively simple and specific one (DOM being a tree, data bindings forming a DAG), I&#x27;m somewhat surprised how little we seem to have in terms of UI builders. React seems to yield itself to visually constructing working, interactive sites out of pieces. And yet, as you note, everything about it starts with code.<p>(I guess we may be in the &quot;startup phase&quot;, where all GUI builders are SaaS tools made by companies, who try to vendor lock you.)<p>&gt; <i>I think this is the promise of computing that we&#x27;ve failed to reach yet. Any person has a problem, and with a little effort, they can code up a fix. Coding as a skill like putting up some shelves, rather than engineering an entire house.</i><p>100% agree. That&#x27;s why I cheer people who solve their personal and professional problems with an Excel sheet, or a half-baked mix of scripts. That&#x27;s why I love tools like AutoHotkey (Windows) and Tasker (Android). Coding is a specific mindset, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that you have to be either helpless about computers, or a software professional. Much as a carpenter or a remodeler would cringe at the way I fix up things around the house with judicious application of duct tape and power drill, but as long as they work, are safe, and my wife doesn&#x27;t complain about aesthetics, I&#x27;m happy (and get to save money).')
