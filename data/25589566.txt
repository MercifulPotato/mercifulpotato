And it was HTML5 boosters who said that when Flash died nothing of value would be lost, I&#x27;m pointing out their comparing a platform &amp; authoring tools with a narrow tech stack.<p>And the Flash Authorship tools were absolutely NOT free. You had to pay hundreds of dollars for the Flash IDE (not that it stopped people from pirating it).<p>FlashDevelop was free, but that was not an Adobe product.')
