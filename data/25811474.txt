To someone like me, you also can&#x27;t make false medical claims or falsely advertise your services or falsely label food.<p>To someone further away from free speech absolutism, private companies should have a department of censorship that responds to the government, the zeitgeist, whatever.<p>To someone like me, though, there&#x27;s a lot of knobs and dials to turn on the &quot;what amount of speech lets people thrive and not die&quot; machine and I&#x27;m content to have society keep fiddling with them in various ways, as a process and not an end-point.')
