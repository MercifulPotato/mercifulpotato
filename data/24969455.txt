Google comes closest (for me personally), but the privacy implications and vendor lock-in always end up scaring me away.<p>Fastmail has really outstanding mail support, but their calendar service definitely leaves a lot to be desired (i.e. if you want to share a calendar with a spouse with any sort of authentication, spouse needs an account too), and their file support is minimal.<p>I think the answer is diversification and make sure you&#x27;re a paying customer for whatever service you use. Use your own domain, spread your data around, use standard formats (text, etc.), and keep backups. Otherwise, you&#x27;re just asking for trouble.')
