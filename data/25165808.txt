Since there&#x27;s no daemon, there wasn&#x27;t a way to do that. I think people are working on it, but I haven&#x27;t tried recently.<p>Work also uses a special docker RUN command that can use the host&#x27;s ssh keyring to, eg. Install something from a private github repo. Doesn&#x27;t seem to exist in podman.')
