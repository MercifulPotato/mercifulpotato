But there was no planets or stars, just a massive void, and my tiny speck of consciousness.<p>Finally, the void &quot;burst&quot;&#x2F;exploded and the energy from it caused me to feel &quot;pain&quot; the likes of which I can&#x27;t even describe. It was like being hit with a laser beam that tore every atom in your being apart.<p>When I did, I realized it was the birth&#x2F;creation of the universe, the &quot;Big Bang&quot; (except it&#x27;s not one bang, it&#x27;s a never-ending cycle) and I woke up in my bed.<p>I once experienced existing in multiple points in history as multiple people (no clue who they were) of all ages&#x2F;ethnicities&#x2F;gender simultaneously.<p>The other ones are things that felt related to various religions, except I wasn&#x27;t aware of what they were until afterwards. But I have never been exposed to religion, and don&#x27;t have any beliefs.<p>There are two that stand out to me.<p>1. I had an experience where my partner at the time, it felt like we were the same being. Two sides of the same coin. This experience wasn&#x27;t going so well, and I was trapped in bed (not physically restrained, just that I couldn&#x27;t get myself to move).<p>And the gist of it was that, I was trapped in time and forced into a choice, and it was to either let myself die and stay there eternally, or create the universe.<p>The theme was essentially this two-sided entity that wanted to create and then experience the universe to entertain itself, but in doing so would also unleash all the pain that would ever exist.<p>Later on I wound up running across the concept of the &quot;Demiurge&quot; in Gnosticism, and that aligned pretty nearly with my experience.<p>2. Nearing ego-death and in my head having the phrase &quot;I am Who I am&quot; repeating endlessly. It had several meanings. &quot;I am&quot;, &quot;I am who?&quot; &quot;Who am I?&quot; &quot;I am who I am.&quot; At some point I woke up and was speaking some very foreign sounding language that I couldn&#x27;t stop and I had never heard in my life. I want to write it off as gibberish but the way the sentences flowed grammatically and my voice inflection was not something I could off-my-head improvise in a made up language and sound that natural.<p>Later found out that phrase has some religious meaning.<p>Alright, there&#x27;s most of the batshit crazy stuff you won&#x27;t believe haha.')
