Running on bunker fuel, used as floating towns for people&#x27;s amusement, polluting more than all of Europe&#x27;s cars combined.<p>There is no excuse for them. I believe they should be banned, and any leisure ships should be sail-powered. I bet they would be more fun for the tourists, too.<p>I understand international shipping is vital, that&#x27;s why cargo ships get a pass, but cruise ships simply have no place if we actually care about the environment. Sadly, money trumps everything.')
