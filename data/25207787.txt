Add to it that the M1 is proprietary, only developed for one OS and one company, it feels less like innovation for the industry and more like Apple-specific innovation.<p>Also, the argument that only $5000 could edit high-res footage is false even without the invention of GPU editing. Proxy clips been around for as long as I&#x27;ve done video editing, even though the experience is worse, it&#x27;s been possible to edit at reduced resolutions for a long time.')
