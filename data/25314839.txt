In classical mechanics, if you knew the exact state of every particle then you could predict everything.<p>But superdeterminism is nothing like that. It&#x27;s determinism not based on past states, but based on future states, where the universe prevents anyone from making decisions that would cause them to learn a certain type of information. How would that work?')
