This starts with areas where hydrogen is already used today - but it&#x27;s hydrogen made from fossil fuels - like ammonia production and includes areas like steel production where hydrogen really is the only game in town for a low-carbon production.<p>We&#x27;ll need all the clean hydrogen we can get, and probably more than that. There&#x27;s no plausible scenario where we&#x27;ll have excess hydrogen that we can waste in an area where it&#x27;s just vastly less efficient than the available alternative.')
