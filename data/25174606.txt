I&#x27;m sure that was cheap as dirt to make, and reactive enough to pull off the effect. But still awkward as anything I&#x27;d imagine.<p>Almost reminds me of the Data Glove, the prototype idea for the power glove controller for the NES, using fingers and tilt sensors as button inputs to the console.<p>The idea was prototyped in a few days by an engineer by attaching drinkings straws from your wrist to the end of your finger, shining a light on one end, and having a photo resistor to read it on the other end to see how far you&#x27;ve bent a finger. Super cheap low latency finger movement detection. It was later replaced with fiber optics for reliability sake.')
