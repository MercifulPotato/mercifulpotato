A VAX 11&#x2F;780 was enough compute power for a small academic department in the 1980s, and would have dozens of Terminals attached, with people doing real work. It was almost exactly 1 MIPS.  Can you live within that constraint?<p>Let&#x27;s make it easy, and assume I&#x2F;O is as fast as modern hardware, and terminal&#x2F;keyboard management isn&#x27;t part of your 1 MIPS. (But SHOULD be counted, somehow)<p>Could you constrain yourself to fit in that box, yet still get work done?<p>Pick your favorite CPU, give yourself as much memory as you think is necessary, and chose how much disk space you think is enough. Then try to work within that box.<p>How would a web server in that environment fair?')
