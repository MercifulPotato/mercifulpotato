It was the only one that provided large enough storage quotas for my Gmail inbox at a reasonable price. 5€&#x2F;month for 30GB of storage + domain aliases + native iOS application.<p>Protonmail is SuperSecure and all that, but they only have 5GB of storage and for the 4€&#x2F;month account, getting it close to 30GB would be 6x that. (The quota was much lower when I evaluated the services around 4-5 years ago)')
