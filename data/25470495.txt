The problem as I see it is that in order for a judge to not immediately dismiss a case the aggrieved party needs to have some evidence that these statements were made falsely. Considering the CISA opsec guidelines, there should not be a corporate paper trail detailing officials knowledge, so where and how do you get evidence that can be admitted to court? Witnesses would presumably be under similar NATSEC restrictions, have questionable custody of the evidence, or worse, they can only provide hearsay.')
