But your initial post was complaining about &quot;the Rust developers.&quot; These are two (or three) effectively disjoint sets of people. I think that&#x27;s where we got off the rails.<p>If you had said &quot;Mozilla&quot; in your post, I would still disagree, but for completely different reasons. Complaining about a &quot;focus&quot; on a team of ~20ish people in an organization of 1500 people doesn&#x27;t make a ton of sense to me.<p>And I&#x27;m still not clear why you&#x27;re drawing conclusions about Rust generally from one single project, that&#x27;s not even its most popular or widely used exemplar project.')
