To be clear, our work does not speak to these issues and should not be used to support such statements. We take full responsibility for not being careful enough with the inferences made in our original report, as this directly led to the misunderstanding of our research.<p>edit: It&#x27;s also, IMO, misleading to claim &quot;PNAS has also looked at the statistics&quot; based on their publication of a submitted article. It passed peer-review and they saw fit to publish it; it doesn&#x27;t mean the National Academy of Sciences feels it&#x27;s the last or only word on the subject.')
