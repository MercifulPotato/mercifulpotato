Like if my employer threatens to fire me unless I vote a certain way, they&#x27;ll accept me giving them my receipt saying I voted the way they wanted.  Now, they can&#x27;t prove that the receipt actually belonged to me, but it&#x27;s certainly harder to procure someone else&#x27;s receipt (from someone who voted the way the employer wanted).')
