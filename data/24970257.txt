It&#x27;s definitely popular with quite educated audience in developed countries.<p>However, is Pi offering indeed reaching out to the developing countries? Are there any sources that substantiate the adoption of Pi platform in such communities, especially whether there&#x27;re any lasting effects beyond the inaugural opening and ribbon-cutting, so to speak?<p>It&#x27;s tempting to seek the BBC Micro effect from Pi platform, and I hope it can be achieved.
