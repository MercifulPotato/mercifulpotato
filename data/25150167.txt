Everyone wants to put every bit of information in a 10+ min long video b&#x2F;c 10 min videos get better ad rates. So they spend the first 4 min w&#x2F; a long ass &#x27;intro&#x27; sequence on all videos, then pleading you subscribe and &#x27;hit the bell&#x27; then plugging patreon, then some long backstory, then the gem of info you came for that could have been a tweet. Oh and all this is broken up by ads at the beginning and middle of the videos, it&#x27;s a cesspool I refuse to pay for. &#x2F;rant')
