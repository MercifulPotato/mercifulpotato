It also has pretty good sharing features. Photoprism on the other hand is horrible for pre-curated photos.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;photoprism.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;photoprism.org&#x2F;</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;piwigo.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;piwigo.org&#x2F;</a>')
