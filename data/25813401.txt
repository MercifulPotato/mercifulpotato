Your authenticator won&#x27;t recognise this ID and it doesn&#x27;t work<p>* Proxy your real ID from github.com and present that from githubverification.com asking you to sign in. Your authenticator won&#x27;t recognise this ID because it&#x27;s for the wrong site, though it doesn&#x27;t know that&#x27;s why. It doesn&#x27;t work.<p>* Proxy the ID from github.com and insist <i>this</i> is github.com. Your browser says &quot;Er, no? This isn&#x27;t github.com fool&quot; and the UX doesn&#x27;t fire.<p>Notice that the attacker not only doesn&#x27;t get working credentials for signing into GitHub, they don&#x27;t even get broken failed credentials that don&#x27;t work, they just get a Javascript error at best.')
