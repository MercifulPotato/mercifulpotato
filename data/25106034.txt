It was wonderful.<p>To put it bluntly, the isolation was marvellous and I&#x27;m not looking foreword to returning to normal one little bit after COVID-19 has gone.<p>Moreover, I know I&#x27;m not alone in holding this view. After equating out necessary and practical inconveniences of not having ready access to certain things due to lockdown, almost everyone who I know had positive things to say about the forced isolation.  Only in the last few days I&#x27;ve had two separate phone calls from longstanding friends who&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve not had any contact since February and they both agreed with my sentiments completely. The same goes for others who I have had more recent contact.<p>This raises what&#x27;s clearly become a serious issue.  Why is it that some people are so troubled by isolation that it&#x27;s sending them crazy even to the extent of suicide whereas people like me have absolutely no problems with it whatsoever - to the extent that we&#x27;ll miss it when it&#x27;s gone? What is it about the character and lifestyle of some people that leaves them content with their own company or that of their immediate family whereas others behave like caged wild animals who must seek the company of many others at any cost?<p><i>(I witnessed instances of such behavior earlier year and it put others at risk of catching COVID-19. The fact that the craving of these people to break loose and seek the company of others is so strong that they have complete disregard for the safety of others is, in my opinion, a serious problem. Thus, for the safety of others, we need proper management policies in place well before any future pandemic arrives.)</i><p>Moreover, why is it that resilience to life&#x27;s knocks is so horribly low in modern society when say compared to the people of my parents&#x27; generation (those of the depression and WWII era)? I&#x27;d note that I&#x27;m far from being the first person to notice this trend.<p>It seems to me the reason may be that in modern society many have never experienced ongoing hardship from a young age and thus have never deveoped any resilience, and or that these days they have much higher expectations and sense of entitlement than was once the norm.<p>This problem didn&#x27;t just happen with COVID-19, I noticed this lack of resilience in people with respect to other issues well before the pandemic arrived.<p>It seems to me that even after COVID-19, society will need to do a great deal of soul searching in respect of these matters.')
