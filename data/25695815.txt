It seems fine.<p>Smashed car windows are frustrating and disappointing (there are clearly some organized groups fencing laptops or whatever, and the police should get off their butts and do some more serious investigatory work). But the city does not feel at all physically unsafe, relative to other places in the USA. Cars are the biggest danger by far, just like everywhere else in the USA.<p>We have some mentally ill homeless neighbors. When (rarely) someone is shouting obscenities into thin air we cross the street and stay out of their way. The rest are harmless, though still sad to see. I don&#x27;t chat with them as much as I used to, because they aren&#x27;t the best at wearing masks or respecting social distancing during the pandemic, and we haven&#x27;t been walking around the neighborhood nearly as much.<p>&gt; <i>picture perfect place</i><p>Yeah, this is the problem. People care about things being picture perfect way more than they care about where their kids will enjoy living, or where they will grow into the most kind, resilient, and capable adults.<p>Yuppies often have a pathological fear of dirt and poverty, and have conditioned themselves to feel discomfort or even nausea when thinking about it. If your kid steps on dog poop sometime, or has to sit near a smelly person on the bus, or has a weird conversation with a homeless guy at the park, it isn&#x27;t going to do them any serious or permanent damage.')
