I&#x27;d recommend that smartphone users who have more than just a casual interest in smartphone security download or read it.<p>I&#x27;d particularly recommend the paper to Android users who&#x27;ve root their phones or those who develop tools for rooted phones.  Whilst you&#x27;re unlikely to gain any additional insight into the specifics of rooting any phone from the paper, you will get a good overview of how unlocked bootloaders&#x2F;rooted phones fit into the grand schema of Android security (i.e.:  how Google, phone and app manufactures deal with security including matters relating to the SafetyNet issue, electronic fuse trips, etc.).  Essentially, discussion isn&#x27;t at a nuts-and-bolts level but rather how these techniques are viewed from a security&#x2F;policy level.')
