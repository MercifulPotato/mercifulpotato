It would likely also be wise to pad the whole vehicle with some dense material - but to do that, you&#x27;d really want to have some sort of manufacturing capability in cislunar space, to avoid having to lift all that mass upwell.<p>As for bases on Moon and&#x2F;or Mars, the best solution is probably to <i>dig in</i> - find a cave or make a tunnel, set up there, and develop underground. Ground is a very good radiation shield.')
