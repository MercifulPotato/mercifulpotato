Some of the examples of clean templates given in the comments here pull down 2MB over the wire, ~500k-1MB of which is frequently JS, and that&#x27;s before I&#x27;ve written a single line of custom functionality myself. For reference, React + react-dom is ~35kb gzipped.<p>Does anyone have any examples of templates that focus on clean, lean code as well as final layout? I&#x27;m thinking framework-agnostic low-to-no JS, coupled with something that doesn&#x27;t use thousands of lines of CSS for a homepage layout.')
