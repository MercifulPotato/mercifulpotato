There seems to be a running premise that SARS-2 infection provides short term immunity at best, based on titre of antibodies. There is no immediate way to confirm or deny such a hypothesis, other than compare SARS-1 survivors to non SARS-1 survivors that have been recently exposed to the SARS pathogen. This would provide two points of comparison spaced 17 years apart.<p>I was infected with SARS-1 in 2003 and recently with SARS-2\nduring the SARS-2 infection [asymptomatic] i was tested for antibodies. the results indicated &quot;one of the highest scores observed in my region&quot; .<p>32 weeks post infection i am still providing antibodies for use in local infusion centres, and fortuitously i am a universal dOnor blood type.<p>clearly in my case SARS-1 infection and recovery has provided protection 17 years later.<p>I have since had long term repeated proximity contact with sars-2 positive individuals numerous times, without testing positive for the virus, and continue to provide serum.<p>bear in mind i maintain self isolation from people not testing positive, and in one case have provided a direct transfusion to a fellow professional in a non clinical setting, and they kicked the virus to pieces in the space of a week.

Importantly, these T cells were shown to cross-react with the SARS-CoV-2 virus 17 years later [10], but the extent to which they can provide protection is not known. Most importantly, the early global sharing of scientific data is vitally important to understand the complexities of the B cell and T cell responses in COVID-19 and to elucidate which immune responses provide protection from both the initial infection and reinfection.&quot;')
