What you call the chemicals is also different, but everything (including water) is a chemical in the end.  Organic just chooses to limit modern chemicals that often are much safer. Organic is a one way conversation: conventional farmers do use organic chemicals when they are the best for the job.<p>If they use less herbicides it is because they are not counting diesel fuel to run their tractor as herbicide. Sure they don&#x27;t apply roundup, but they spend a lot more money and emit a lot more CO2 pulling steel through the ground to destroy weeds because they are not allowed to use a good herbicide.<p>Also beware of less inputs in other ways: you can mine the land for nutrients by not putting fertilizer on it as well. Fertilizer isn&#x27;t only about more crops, it is also about the fact that everything you take off the land includes a certain amount of various nutrients that are forever taken off too.  This isn&#x27;t a problem for pure subsistence farming (subsistence farmers carefully save their poop), but as soon as anything leaves the farm you need to replace what is lost.')
