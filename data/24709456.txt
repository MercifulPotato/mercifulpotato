If something costs me $100 to buy, and $10 every year to maintain for 20 years, that is not the equivalent of costing me $300 dollars today - because most of those dollars are spent in the future and need to be discounted by inflation and opportunity-cost investment rates. So it might actually only have a net present value cost of $200 in today&#x27;s dollars.  Somehow you have to account for the time-value-of-money factor in order to properly combine the up-front cost with ongoing operation&#x2F;maintenance costs.')
