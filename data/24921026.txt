The cost of putting something into orbit is likely to drop by a factor of 100-1000 when SpaceX&#x27;s next rocket is up and running sometime in the next few years.<p>It seems like such a waste of time for people to try and debunk these claims from people who are very competent and have access to the best in people and technology. Do they want a world where people don&#x27;t try new things and make great improvements? One should really encourage people with a track record of getting people together to do amazing things to continue to do so. Elon Musk has stated that he thought that SpaceX had a 10% chance of success. I&#x27;m glad he could look at that chance of failure and tried anyway.')
