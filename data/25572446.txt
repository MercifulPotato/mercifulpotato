Where should they start? I would think it’s easiest in richer countries, where it’s easier to obtain reliable data, and updates thereof.<p>Also, denser population areas likely give them most bang for the buck (getting many happy users as fast as possible seems necessary to me when discussing the success of the Maps app with senior management)<p>Because of those arguments, I don’t see whether that would look much different from what’s happening now.<p>So, I don’t see how one can conclude they aren’t serious about the Maps app or cycle paths.<p>Of course, things would be different if we had data telling us they don’t plan to get large coverage, slowed down or even stopped data gathering. I am not aware of either, though.
