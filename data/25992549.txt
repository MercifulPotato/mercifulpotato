We believe that the future of product development is in smart, easy-to-use analytics that helps you make good decisions and invest in the right areas. We&#x27;re a 400-person company (60 engineers), and we raised our Series E last year. We&#x27;ve gotten incredible traction helping customers like Square, Atlassian, Dropbox, Twitter, Twitch, and Capital One change the way they build products. We were recognized in Wealthfront&#x27;s Career-Launching Companies (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.wealthfront.com&#x2F;career-launching-companies-list&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.wealthfront.com&#x2F;career-launching-companies-list...</a>), Forbes&#x27; Cloud 100 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;cloud100&#x2F;list&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;cloud100&#x2F;list&#x2F;</a>), and YC&#x27;s top companies (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;topcompanies&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;topcompanies&#x2F;</a>).<p>We have many open positions that can be found here (we&#x27;re growing fast!): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;amplitude" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;amplitude</a>.
