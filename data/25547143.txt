Item(by='fiddlerwoaroof', descendants=None, kids=[25547577], score=None, time=1609023620, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25546067, text='&gt;&gt; These are not my words, that&#x27;s exactly what Tesla said after the &quot;trailer across a highway&quot; accident<p>&gt;&gt; Read up on it, I&#x27;m sure the upper limit for this function is when the delta speed is &lt;50km&#x2F;h. It won&#x27;t work with a delta of 150km&#x2F;h because it&#x27;s physically not possible.<p>I think both of these have the same explanation: if you want to release a feature like this specced at a 50kph delta, you design for a safety factor of 2-3 (100-150) so that you can be confident that it’s safe at 50kph. The claim that “it’s physically impossible” doesn’t make sense to me: humans drive safely with such deltas using only “a video feed” and sound.<p>Anyways, I’m fairly certain I’ve come to a stop on autopilot from at least 60mph (100kph).')
