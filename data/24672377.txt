I&#x27;m 43 right now.<p>It really HAS changed my life.  What I&#x27;ve found is that over the long term you&#x27;re able to perform much much better.<p>By the time I was in my 30s I had developed coping skills which worked for the most part but I would find myself getting demotivated and defocused sometimes on long term priorities and sometimes unable to recommit to them.<p>Adderall totally changed that. I&#x27;m able to focus on tasks long term AND even if something bad happens in my life I&#x27;m able to keep right on track.<p>It&#x27;s also helped me stay more positive knowing that projects get completed and there&#x27;s nothing preventing me from accomplishing what I want to accomplish.<p>There are some downsides though:<p>- Adderall is illegal in most countries so you&#x27;re not even allowed to travel with it in some places. I didn&#x27;t really know this at first and I wish they would tell you.  Most countries will overlook it but if you&#x27;re China they could totally use it as an excuse to harass you if they wanted.<p>- It&#x27;s very addictive. If I forget my meds it&#x27;s basically impossible to function.<p>- It&#x27;s VERY hard to get since it&#x27;s a controlled substance. I&#x27;m only able to get it 72 hours ahead of time and if they&#x27;re out of stock sometimes I have to wait. DO NOT wait until the last minute.  Get it as early as possible.<p>- Some people have problems with off brands of XR (extended release) that has a different formulation.  There&#x27;s no standardization on the XR process and I think it&#x27;s vendor specific.')
