I don&#x27;t know whether this is actually true, but it&#x27;s one of the main reasons people give. the other (and more persuasive, imo) reason is simply to prevent the dog from procreating. there are already far more dogs and cats in the world than people are willing to home. unless you&#x27;re able to keep your dog away from any females or are willing to take in more puppies, you probably ought to get him fixed.<p>whatever you choose, I recommend you make a decision soon and act on it promptly. my dad wavered over this decision with our family dog for a few years and when he finally decided to get him fixed at age three or four, I do think it was worse for him than if it had been done at a younger age.')
