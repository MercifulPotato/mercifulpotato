If they didn&#x27;t like either then I didn&#x27;t get my question answered. This forced me to have to go learn and memorize everything about all aspects of technology just so I didn&#x27;t get roadblocked by someone having a bad day. Today Google is more of a convenient way to jog my memory - I can function just fine when the internet goes out, read a map if my GPS loses its signal, etc. I don&#x27;t ever want to be one of those blank people who just stand there and stares when the screen blinks out.')
