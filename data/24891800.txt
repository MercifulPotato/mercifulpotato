Without the hydrogen the core wouldn&#x27;t be able to cool itself and would melt down. There are however NTR core designs with closed circuit cooling. The core would be kept at a low critical state (hot but not melting) and circulate a coolant through the core and into a generator and from there to radiator panels. When the NTR wasn&#x27;t providing thrust it would provide electrical power. When thrust is needed the coolant loop would cut off and hydrogen would be pumped through the core. Provided no mechanical breakdown in the coolant&#x2F;generator loop an NTR could provide power for years.')
