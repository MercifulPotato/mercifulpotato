A screen said &quot;Walk up to the camera and we&#x27;ll tell you which way to your gate.&quot;. I did so, the screen highlighted my face on the camera feed, showed me my name and my gate. Geezus Christ, they don&#x27;t hide the fact that they&#x27;re tracking faces...<p>When you first enter China, you have to let a machine scan your face (IIRC fingerprints too?), and locals have to scan their (RFID-enabled) IDs to enter airports or train stations; so they seem to really have total control.')
