You can&#x27;t make a country richer by enslaving part of the population, and you don&#x27;t need slavery to make a country rich<p>Correct, but I didn&#x27;t claim either of these things. I asked if the immense wealth among white Americans didn&#x27;t grow out of the subjugation of slaves. Imagine 100 people who are equally wealthy. Now, imagine you take 1&#x2F;6 of the people, remove all of their wealth, and disperse it among the remaining 5&#x2F;6. Perhaps you skim a few percent off the top due to inefficiencies of the scheme. Are you saying the 5&#x2F;6 people here didn&#x27;t benefit? Sure seems like they did!<p>&gt; The claim isn&#x27;t directed to one group&#x27;s heritage and its contribution. On its face, it is directed at &quot;nearly everything that has truly made American exceptional.&quot; It literally ties the entirety of the American story (or nearly all of it) to slavery.<p>You...you read the full quote, right?<p>&gt; Almost none of those things grew out of slavery. Our &quot;legal system&quot; for example was imported wholesale from England--based on principles of the Magna Carta dating back to 1215. Any slave trade into England itself was banned in 1102. Are there imprints on our legal system from slavery? Sure. But its factually incorrect to say our legal system &quot;grew out of slavery.&quot;<p>There are a number of uniquenesses to the American legal system that trace themselves to slavery and racism. And I&#x27;d argue that many of those things are the things that make the American legal system &quot;exceptional&quot; and <i>unique</i>.<p>&gt; The founding principles weren&#x27;t fulfilled in 1776, but the history of the country has been one of progress in that direction. That was conventional wisdom among Democratic political leadership when I was growing up (and I&#x27;m only 37) and almost certainly still is the conventional wisdom among most rank-and-file Democrats.<p>See, I read the opposite from this. &quot;Consent of the governed&quot; is incompatible with slavery. You say that this was simply the principles &quot;not being fulfilled&quot; at the time, but then how can you say that we were founded on a set of values that the constitution then proceeds to explicitly reject? The constitution provides for the 3&#x2F;5ths compromise, but didn&#x27;t encode a right to vote (for <i>anyone</i>, that was left up to the individual states) until reconstruction.<p>&gt; but the history of the country has been one of progress in that direction<p>This is sort of a meaningless platitude. &quot;Sure you still don&#x27;t have the rights to life, liberty, and happiness yet, like most people do, but you&#x27;re closer now than your ancestors were 150 years ago&quot; isn&#x27;t exactly a ringing endorsement of the US.')
