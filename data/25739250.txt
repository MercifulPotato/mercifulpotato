It has been everything from:<p>1. SQL&#x2F;analytics wizard, capable of building out dashboards and quickly finding insights in structured data. Oracle&#x2F;MSSQL&#x2F;PostGres etc. Maybe even capable of FE development.<p>2. Pipeline expert, capable of building out data pipelines for transforming data, Flink, Spark, Beam on top of  Kafka&#x2F;Kinesis&#x2F;Pubsub run from an orchestration engine like Airflow. Even this could span from using mostly pre-built tools wiring together things with a bit of python to move data from A to B, to the other exteme of full fledge Scala engineer writing complex applications that run on these pipelines.<p>3. Writing infrastructure software for big data pipelines, customizing Spark&#x2F;Beam&#x2F;Flink&#x2F;Kafka and&#x2F;or writing custom big data tools when out of the box solutions don&#x27;t work or scale. Some overlap with 2, but really distinguished by it being a full fledged software engineer specializing in the big data ecosystem.<p>So, are all three of these appropriate to call Data Engineer?  Is it mainly #1 and people are getting confused?  I would certainly fall into the #3, so I&#x27;m always surprised when people approach me about &#x27;SQL transform&#x27; type jobs.')
