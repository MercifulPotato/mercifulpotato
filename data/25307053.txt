Not the threadripper in your desktop.<p>Although I appreciate the ability as a software developer to &quot;work anywhere&quot;, if I was restricted to working only the Y700 I can guarantee you that certain development avenues would happen very differently, if at all. The laptop works fine as a machine to use &quot;when I have to&quot;, but if I&#x27;m doing &quot;deep&quot; development, it&#x27;s a PITA and makes me lose focus too much because of the delays in the edit-compile-test cycle.<p>I have absolutely no doubt that the M1 macbooks will easily outperform the Y700, along with most other computers I&#x27;ve ever owned.<p>It remains true, for now, that if you actually care about maxCPU (with a linearly parallelizable workload) (which I do for at least half of my development work), the current M1 machines are not the top of the line. I would tend to agree with anyone who suggests that this will likely change in the near future.')
