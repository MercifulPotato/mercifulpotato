It consists of<p>1. logic blocks which can be configured by the designer to perform a multitude of functions (some FPGAs do contain some dedicated blocks such as DSPs multipliers, etc),<p>2. I&#x2F;O blocks that can be configured by the designer as interfaces to practically any external device, and<p>3. an interconnect fabric that allows the designer to connect the blocks as needed.<p>Here’s an example of a<p><i>CGRA (Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architecture).</i><p>It consists of<p><i>Logic Units that are similar to the simple ALUs found in processors</i><p>(but no out of order processing, pipelining, microcode, etc)\nan interconnect mechanism that connects to nearest neighbors. This allows the FUs to be connected into pipelines to perform complex calculations<p>FPGAs are more flexible but are difficult to program, and programming takes more time. FPGAs can be configured to perform the functions of CGRAs, but in general cannot be reconfigured as easily and quickly.<p>CGRAs are more targeted at specific applications such as High Performance Computing.<p>I have read that Intel and Xilinx are or will produce FPGAs that can be reprogrammed such that only differences between old and new configuration need be done…. this allows equivalent function blocks ton be established and only the interconnects to be changed.&quot;')
