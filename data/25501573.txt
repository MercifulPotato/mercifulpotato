I&#x27;m an organizer of the New York Emacs meetup (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emacsnyc.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emacsnyc.org&#x2F;</a>), and we had had &quot;Hack Night&quot; meetups as one of our formats. Those worked ok, letting people work on things either together or alone. We did a standup at the beginning, where people said what they wanted to work on, or could help with.<p>I like the idea of putting this on a whiteboard; it makes it far easier to remember what people are interested in -- and more importantly, _who_ is interested in a topic.')
