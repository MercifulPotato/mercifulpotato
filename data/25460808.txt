Two different things.<p>In German for example every job ad title need to be suffixed with (m&#x2F;w). It would be handy if it was gender neutral. I don&#x27;t understand how the grammatical gender of a random noun e.g. wine, that happens to be masculine in German, is comparable to something that&#x27;s referring to actual persons.<p>In Swedish for example there are the pronouns &quot;han&quot; (he) and &quot;hon&quot; (she), and now there&#x27;s a gender neutral &quot;hen&quot;. The latter being very handy when you don&#x27;t know the gender of the person that&#x27;s being talked about. But of course this addition has made culture warring people (a.k.a right-wing folks) very upset in Sweden too.')
