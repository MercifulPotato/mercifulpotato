Item(by='chrononaut', descendants=None, kids=[24783168], score=None, time=1602716333, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24782553, text='IANAL but I thought the idea of directing an email or communication to a colleague and CC&#x27;ing counsel and adding &quot;privileged communication&quot; doesn&#x27;t actually make it privileged communication unless it&#x27;s also truly an attempt to get legal advice. Although maybe that&#x27;s your point, because then it would be discoverable? If it&#x27;s privileged communication and remains as such than it cannot be discovered, so I am not sure what paper trail is being left? I am confused.')
