And remember that hospitals can&#x27;t work at anywhere close to 100% ICU occupancy for extended periods of time, so if the high inflow persists, mortality is likely to increase much more.<p>The vast difference between Covid19 and influenza is anyway plain to see if you look at ICU rates, even with all the lockdowns.<p>So even though your analysis sounds convincing at first read, it is a very bad interpretation of the data. The reality is that Covid19 is a much worse disease than Influenza, and that drastic measures are required to keep it under control (barely).')
