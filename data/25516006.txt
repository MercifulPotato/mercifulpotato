Item(by='belorn', descendants=None, kids=[25516032], score=None, time=1608716314, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25511315, text='The article mention that swedes are more responsible with their pets and thus do not have a problem with feral dogs, but I find the actually reason a bit more nuanced.<p>Sweden did had a catch-and-kill program about a hundred years ago. It is mostly forgotten here, but it had two parts. A law was made that all dogs must be ear marked (today chipped) and listed in the national registry with their owner, and any dog that did not have a marking was killed. When a puppy is sold it must also have a veterinarian checkup, and the first thing any vet will do is to chip it and fill in the register data.<p>If a registered dog run away and get lost it will likely end up at the police, and the owner will get a bill for housing and handling. If you sell a dog, a breeder better make sure the registration papers get signed or the seller will be held liable. This way there are not much room for a feral dog population to get started.')
