Does he have experience living the lifestyle of suburb house + car or is he just trying to justify his own choice of living downtown?<p>Having done both, I can tell you they are very different lifestyles. There are certainly perks to the downtown lifestyle, but it isn&#x27;t all peaches and roses.<p>Taking the bus is a huge mixed bag and depends a lot on the transit system layout. Taking a newborn on the subway and transferring to a bus to see a pediatrician sucks. Hyperactive kids fighting all day when you&#x27;re trying to work from home from a shoebox apartment sucks. You don&#x27;t get as much leeway in your choice of schools (and btw, the highest ranking ones often aren&#x27;t downtown). Etc.<p>By contrast, the north american suburb lifestyle generally involves driving kids around pretty much all the time: they might go to a nicer school that is a bit farther out (did I mention good school areas have expensive real estate?) One might drive out virtually every weekend because getting ice cream at ikea takes as long as it does to walk&#x2F;bus to the nearby supermarket. When one drives, they can also pack more activities in one day: Going for groceries then checking out a dozen books from the library in a single outing isn&#x27;t a recipe for back pain. And you can actually get home before lunch time. Etc.<p>With a bigger house, your parents can come stay for a few months (this is very common in many cultures).<p>Yes, you can save money by living the downtown lifestyle, but there&#x27;s certainly a hit in various aspects of quality of life.')
