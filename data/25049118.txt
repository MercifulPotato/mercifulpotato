Then there are other groups like HFT&#x2F;Prop trading&#x2F;Hedge Funds but those are probably only a few thousand or maybe ten thousand.<p>Sorry, I meant these companies have experienced (10-20 years) engineers at $500k where younger employees could expect to rise up to that level, not that every employee at these companies are making $500k.')
