My note on times wasn’t to brag, but to say that I never thought I’d run that far or that fast. Before this whole ordeal, my fastest mile was in fourth grade and it was 9:12.<p>And my favorite part of running is waving to other runners running the opposite way. I assume it’s the same way motorcycle people feel when they wave to each other.')
