The source is published and you can build your own binary. But given that you can&#x27;t distribute Signal outside of official stores and can&#x27;t pin the version in those official stores (unless you turn off updates on your phone entirely), it&#x27;s not actually practical to run an audited version, yet alone to make your own changes to the code.<p>&gt; and that is was allowed to run your own servers. Are the servers even open source?<p>EDIT: apparently there is now (purported) server source available, not that that means much when there&#x27;s no way to even know which code a given server is running, yet alone run a server with different code. They claim that their E2E encryption means control of their servers doesn&#x27;t matter, but their protocol analyses doesn&#x27;t actually think about what an attacker might be able to do at the server level, IME.<p>&gt; Are there lirerature regarding the technical&#x2F;conceptional bits Element&#x2F;Matrix? What is the tradeoff there?<p>It uses either the same ratchet protocol as Signal or a very similar one. E2E for group chats is more complicated but I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re giving up anything.')
