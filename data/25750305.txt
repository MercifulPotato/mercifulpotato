Mill was a proponent of the &#x27;marketplace of ideas&#x27; delusion that has been shown over the past few decades to be an illusion; Mill seems to think that knowledge, and only knowledge, emerges from arguments between dedicated opponents.  These quaint bon mots from twee English gentlemen of the Victorian period are about as relevant to modern life as are their opinions about medicine, hygiene, education, and the role of women.  Interesting as a historical artifact but not for much more.')
