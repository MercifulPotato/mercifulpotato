Item(by='KineticLensman', descendants=None, kids=[25651224], score=None, time=1609878289, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25649019, text='&gt; Talented and capable people who end up working low impact non profit jobs at low pay<p>I currently volunteer at a raptor conservation charity. For no pay at all. They cannot afford to pay anyone but their trained bird team and a small office staff. Volunteers like myself are a force multiplier for the trained permanent staff. By doing mundane jobs for them, we free them to apply their expertise where it matters. Pre-COVID, these mundane tasks included basic animal husbandry, grounds work and infrastructure maintenance. Good skill fits for these role include carpentry, building, &#x27;roady&#x27; type knowledge (how to build and wire-up outdoor structures) and many others. Post-COVID, new tasks include cleaning, sanitization and crowd management (facilitating social distancing).<p>&gt; If you had a real job and donated half your income to the cause, both you and the cause would be better off.<p>I used to provide financial support to them before I retired. Now I only work intermittently, and I&#x27;m using my income to fund my own time working for them, for free.<p>This is genuinely the best way I can help them. Especially now that their income has been decimated by COVID lockdowns.<p>[Edit] The flaw in the parent&#x27;s line of reasoning is assuming that all a non-profit organisation needs is money. Sometimes they need actual stuff doing (such as building a new aviary) and volunteers let them reduce or even eliminate the not-insignificant labour and contracting costs.')
