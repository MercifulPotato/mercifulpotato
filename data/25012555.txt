These are pretty much exactly analogous to the steps in the current series. The only difference is that the Haskell standards change less frequently, so more &quot;from __future__&quot; imports (LANGUAGE pragmas) are required. (Note that the latest Haskell is from 2010, while the latest Python is from 31 days ago; see how many future imports you need to get a modern Python web app to work with a ten year old Python release)<p>This is not evidence that day-to-day tasks like running a web app are difficult or impossible in Python.')
