It had a load of code samples, so after the game loaded and after i got board, i ended up writing and playing with the code samples.  few years later, i got a &quot;proper&quot; PC, got a copy of Borland Delphi on the front of a magazine, and started developing Windows apps there. Then on to C++, VB, VB.NET and now C#... so... waiting times got me into it!')
