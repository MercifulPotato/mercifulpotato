Plenty of people lost trust in the media following their focus on the Hillary Clinton email scandal, which amounted to nothing but likely swayed the election.<p>There seems to be some sort of paradox of tolerance to trust and the news media.<p>In principle, we should allow all information. However, bad faith actors can easily take advantage of this principle, and flood the airwaves with dubious and ultimately-overblown stories (see Clinton&#x27;s emails). If bad-faith actors are afoot (which seems the case here), then at some point an editor needs to step in and refuse to print the storyâ€”the question though, is when? And is there anyway to step in, and have it not look like censorship?')
