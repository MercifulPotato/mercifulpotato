There are all sorts of laws about your conduct over a phone. Owning a phone isn’t a constitutional right. And a phone doesn’t amplify your voice - you can only call one person at a time.<p>I accept your point that people want to hear the message. But that’s irrelevant. There is no legal or historical basis for forcing a company to give someone a platform.<p>You might not agree with that in principal, but the <i>legal</i> argument is about the right to speak without being punished, not the right to be heard.')
