Are you looking to continually apply the best practices of your craft with peers from multiple areas of Software Development across multiple internal and external partners? Partner Engineering is a role focused on improving our software ecosystem. Some of the ways it can be improved is by working closely with our partner external software developers, helping them land technology transitions and stay modern with platform best practices. Our team listens to their requirements, goals and enhancement requests and translates those into improvements in our own APIs or features when applicable. We work with our internal teams to understand what’s needed of our external partners as we develop new technologies and products, and then work with those partners to find the most efficient way to meet those needs. Translating this knowledge into more clearly defined features, APIs, samples, patches or new direction are possible paths to success in the team!<p>Apply online (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.apple.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;details&#x2F;200205851&#x2F;partner-engineering?team=SFTWR)or" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.apple.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;details&#x2F;200205851&#x2F;partner-engin...</a> send a resume to DeveloperEcosystemEngineering (at) apple.com')
