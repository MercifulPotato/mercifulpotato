Remember, joining a Matrix room means that your server needs to handle all of the room&#x27;s traffic. And 25 users can easily be in a lot of large rooms. However, each room only needs to be handled once, so if more of my users join a room in which my server is already participating, the cost doesn&#x27;t increase.<p>That said, this isn&#x27;t an average but a spot value. It frequently falls below 8% (though typically stays above 5%). Note that this is a cheap and relatively weak VPS.<p>I&#x27;m not saying Matrix is terribly lightweight. I&#x27;m saying you can easily run a small personal instance on a cheap machine without any performance problems.')
