If a non-ML solution is that close to non-ML then I would just stick with that - the advantages in terms of predictability and ease of maintenance would likely outweigh small performance gains.<p>A model that can&#x27;t be continuously trained inevitably rots due to data, interface or environment changes (and the code is typically very difficult to maintain across team members - if the author leaves it&#x27;s often a ticking time bomb). If you&#x27;re OK with the model rotting then it wasn&#x27;t that important to your business to begin with. This is not true for all businesses.')
