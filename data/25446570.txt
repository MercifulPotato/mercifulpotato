Working in tech now, good money, but man do I wish for those &quot;boring&quot; days sometimes. It&#x27;s meetings and craziness every day now, always having to prove myself vs. being a stable cog in a machine. Overall I find that the added money is commensurate with the added stress &#x2F; life burden.')
