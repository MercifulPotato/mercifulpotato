If houses produced zero carbon emissions, we would build even more!\nAnd it doesn&#x27;t stop there: he is considering buying a newer vehicle and investing in an even more powerful recharging system. See where the problem lies?<p>For now, the solution lies in reduction and common sense, not in mass overconsumption. Maybe one day we will be able to build without taxing our resources or producing waste, but for now this is not the case.<p>Reducing our consumption of meat, produce to last longer, reducing tourism, avoiding airplanes, boats and cars, buying less clothing and manufactured goods from abroad, installing a thermal curfew at night would, among other things, be much more effective. But this requires other sacrifices.<p>Destroying ecosystems through chemical pollution or to find rare materials also means increasing the number of invasive species and reducing the living space of other living species that find it difficult to coexist, spread more disease or simply disappear. We are nevertheless experiencing the 6th mass extinction and this has a direct impact on what makes us live. \nThe Maya emitted very little carbon, yet, the traces of their massive deforestation still have a significant impact on the fixation of carbon 4000 years later!<p>Afterwards, this is only my point of view.\nI willingly admit that I found it difficult to respect some of these good behaviors myself. But at least I&#x27;m trying, and have been since a long time now.')
