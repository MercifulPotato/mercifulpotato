Case in point: discussion about indoor v.s. outdoor activity risk was <i>everywhere</i> I looked back in April&#x2F;May, whereas the author makes it clear that wasn&#x27;t the case for them.<p>Do we have any resources which are aimed at helping people inform themselves of the risks associated with some choice they need to make? For example, sufficient information in just three areas could have made every relevant personal choice I&#x27;ve faced since March clear cut:<p>- Risks (death, hospitalization, long-term side-effects) _by demographic_.<p>- % chance of transmission for various common interactions (passing someone on the sidewalk, stopping to chat with someone on the sidewalk, grocery shopping, eating&#x2F;drinking indoors&#x2F;outdoors, etc).<p>- % spread by asymptomatic carriers v.s. symptomatic carriers.<p>Caveats abound, but I bet a skilled designer could find a way to present this information in an honest way which takes &lt; 15 minutes to digest.')
