Just about every university in the US has a policy that all official school business must be communicated through your institutional email address- be it a question about the class or setting up an appointment for office hours. Most of my instructors have explicitly told us they will ignore any emails not sent from an @uni.edu email.<p>On a different note, how many schools set up a different email address structure for students versus faculty&#x2F;staff? For my community college, students were first.last@g.communitycollege.edu and at my current uni students are FirstLast@my.university.edu. Is this standard practice?')
