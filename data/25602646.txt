Free money (donations) is the only thing that has worked for me so far. Most of my income in the past few years has been donations.<p>BTW, Facebook reached out for an interview recently but I didn&#x27;t follow through... So if someone reading this comment buys Facebook shares and makes a ton of money, please think of me and give me some free money.')
