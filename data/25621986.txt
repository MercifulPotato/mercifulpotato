I donâ€™t see how a REPL would help there.</i><p>Because the right way of programming in the large is programming in the small and combining things (e.g. functions, components, classes, whatever, etc.), not building some huge monolithic monstrocity (this is orthogonal to monoliths vs microservices btw).<p>Plus, this &quot;programming in the large&quot;, when it gets to, say, 10.000.000 lines of code will still have bugs and behavior you need to check&#x2F;search for&#x2F;and fix in individual parts, and this &quot;restarting&#x2F;dynamic change&quot; REPL will still be a great tool here.')
