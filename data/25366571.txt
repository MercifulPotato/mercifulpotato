It&#x27;s not any more complicated than that. If you need someone to tell you what you should or shouldn&#x27;t be watching, then that&#x27;s your problem, and they should make a product specifically for you rather than forcing it on everyone that participated in building their product and participating in their business and making them money. This is a total slap in the face. It is amazing to me that there are so many people here discussing why they need Youtube to tell them which videos to watch.')
