I use it periodically and know the basics. I prefer it over nano and pico by a mile.<p>600 lines seems pretty long to me. I don&#x27;t even know what I would put in a .vimrc file. Obviously I don&#x27;t use it enough to even have annoyances.<p>The nice thing about have no config is that I can hop into vim on any computer or server anywhere and be able to use the editor. I don&#x27;t have to worry about having muscle memory of using keybindings&#x2F;aliases that don&#x27;t exist.')
