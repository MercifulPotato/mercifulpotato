Names can tell me about the gender and often the ethnicity of the applicant, which are both also ripe for discriminating against. With an online application, we can just replace the applicant&#x27;s name with an ID number and associate the two in some database that the employer doesn&#x27;t see until the applicant is hired.<p>Actually, now with remote work, even after the applicant is hired, we still never have to see or hear them at all! We can just keep referring to them as Employee #1672378623, use a randomly-generated avatar for our Zoom meetings, and filter everyone&#x27;s voice through voice-changer software. Bias-be-gone!')
