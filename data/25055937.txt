The main drawback another sibling mentioned is lack experience. I think a good combination is &#x27;sortition &amp; incumbency&#x27;. Elections occur in two phases:<p>1. If an incumbent wants to keep their seat, they keep their seat with a K% chance, say 50&#x2F;50; and,<p>2. All remaining seats are chosen at random from the eligible (see below) that apply for the position.<p>An additional tweak is to require &#x27;previous experience&#x27; by having statesfolk work in lower level representative positions. For instance: anyone qualifies for city council (maybe not metropolises) or county level positions; a person just puts their name in the hat to get started. Once a statesperson has successfully had a complete term at city&#x2F;county level they can move to the state level, then the Federal level. It could even be lateral: lower-house to upper-house. There are 10s-of-thousands of county &amp; city level positions, giving a sizable pool of new statesfolk to draw from.<p>The incumbency mechanism allows a subset of representatives to maintain stability &amp; gain experience &quot;in situ&quot;; the pipelining provides a naturally trained pool of statesfolk. The sortition mechanism is a robust anti-gerrymandering, anti-corruption, anti-just-about-everything-we-don&#x27;t-like-in-government mechanism.')
