In this case, however, both sudo and doas have sufficient exposure to estimate their relative security using CVEs. We can also use the CVEs to characterize the kinds of vulnerabilities each has internally, without comparing them to each other. In general, the CVEs that are discovered for sudo are more severe and damning than those discovered for doas, without respect to their relative occurance.')
