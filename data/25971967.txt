They would also know that sell orders were still coming in.<p>This would allow Citadel to profit massively on the backs of the RH customers even if there was no direct collusion.<p>The thing is, RH isn’t stupid. They knew that Citadel (their biggest customer) would see that orders went to zero before anyone else and could move accordingly. RH didn’t need to explicitly warn Citadel in advance - the very nature of their relationship meant that they would be told in advance.')
