As typically happens when there&#x27;s a video  programmer around, the audio timing is considered less important, and there&#x27;s a belief that &quot;we can always get the audio we need for the video&quot;. Ergo, not much need for buffering. In this case, the odd&#x2F;incorrect behavior of the thread scheduler exposed the optimistic assumption that you can rely on waking up every 15ms and handling the audio.')
