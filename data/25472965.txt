I suppose this is why everyone gets so caught up in the language specifics and think they&#x27;re trivial. Design patterns are common _design decisions_. The strategy pattern isn&#x27;t saying &quot;you can have callbacks&quot;, it&#x27;s saying &quot;sometimes you should allow a policy to be supplied by the user&quot;. Every day, in every language, even the ones with first class functions and people posting on the internet that design patterns aren&#x27;t needed, people still use libraries with massive &#x27;options&#x27; arguments to functions, instead of internalising the actual lesson of the strategy pattern which is to allow executable specifications of behaviour.<p>So yes, there are trivial things which you can argue the toss on, but in the last month I&#x27;ve used HTTP libraries that don&#x27;t allow you to supply a strategy for retry logic and machine learning libraries that don&#x27;t allow a strategy for early stopping.')
