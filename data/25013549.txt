Item(by='smsm42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604731162, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25011922, text='&gt; The court will assume that no reasonable person would agree to a contract without reading the contents and consulting with a lawyer<p>That&#x27;s what I always do when I go to the grocery store to buy eggs and to Office Depot to buy printer ink. I call my lawyer and say &quot;It&#x27;s that time again, I have to buy some printer paper, ink, carrots, eggs and cheese, so that&#x27;s five contracts for you to read and verify, we should be done in less than a day!&quot;.  With very reasonable price of $400 per hour, I don&#x27;t even have to ask what the actual items cost, compared to the expense for the contact reading it&#x27;s peanuts anyway. Oh, btw, need to call the lawyer about the contract for peanuts, I&#x27;m almost out!')
