But your liberal strawman is as expected as it is tedious.<p>Not calling you are liar, but yours was the easiest lie I&#x27;ve ever spotted. You didn&#x27;t think he stole? You didn&#x27;t think russians got him elected? Or any of the other democratic talking points? Sure.<p>&gt; No, the &quot;both-sides are equal&quot; thing isn&#x27;t going to work.<p>It works because it&#x27;s true. Both sides are hypocrites and both sides are liars. You and your &quot;crazies&quot; are just as cringey as the &quot;crazies&quot; on trump&#x27;s side.<p>&gt; On the one hand, you have a quote by Hillary Clinton ...<p>And the past 4 years of neverending 24&#x2F;7 effort by a political party and the corporate media to delegitimize. Were you in a coma the last 4 years?<p>&gt;  which is proving kind of correct in hindsight<p>So you are saying it&#x27;s true that Trump stole the election? Jesus you can&#x27;t help yourself can you?<p>&gt; on the other, literal armed mobs of Trump supporters threatening to stop the counting of votes by force, lawsuits, attempts to &quot;override&quot; the vote, and hoaxes perpetrated by Trump&#x27;s own family.<p>You are right. There&#x27;s no armed mobs on the anti-trump side. There have been no attempts to override the vote. No hoaxes. It&#x27;s all just one side. Hypocrisy is truly the ugliest human trait.<p>I&#x27;ll make a prediction. If Trump somehow wins, you&#x27;ll be the first to whine about stolen election.')
