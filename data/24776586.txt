Item(by='mindslight', descendants=None, kids=[24777401], score=None, time=1602683976, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24773087, text='I see where you&#x27;re coming from, and this proposed law doesn&#x27;t seem super useful in isolation. But consider:<p>1. Publishing the same data over OBD-2 ends up being an afterthought. Without even looking at the specifics, I guarantee that there is data transmitted through telemetry that is not output through OBD-2. That&#x27;s just how embedded development works - focus on making the main feature work, then forget about the rest. It seems quite hard to apply the law to the details of a technical system (&quot;Sorry, when developing we didn&#x27;t consider that type of data necessary for repairing the car, even though we are using it to diagnose. Anyway we&#x27;ll fix it in the model year after next&quot;). Whereas it&#x27;s straightforward to say that no matter how many different interfaces automakers develop, independent auto repair has to be able to access all of them.<p>2. If we&#x27;re concerned with privacy (<i>and we should be</i>), then we need an orthogonal privacy law that prohibits automakers from backhauling this information without consent, and selling this information without consent (eg to insurance companies). Letting them unilaterally collect and only make it accessible to their dealers, practically guarantees a terrible security implementation - something like one master login for each &quot;trusted&quot; dealer, that can access any car&#x27;s data by VIN. Mandating access for third parties will actually result in the attack surface being properly designed and audited.<p>3. Once you&#x27;re taking the privacy hit, then there is a stored history that won&#x27;t be available over OBD-2. Imagine going to a repair shop and they tell you to borrow a dongle and drive around for two weeks, where a dealer can help you immediately. This ties into data ownership, in that you should be able to retrieve your own records.<p>4. Imagine a hypothetical service that keeps tabs on your car&#x27;s metrics and alerts you to developing conditions. With mandated access, this can be done as a simple web service. Without that, you&#x27;ll need a separate dongle, probably specific to your car if things advance beyond OBD-2. I&#x27;d personally rather have a dongle and a local service that I control (coupled with a privacy law or pulling the cell modem), but unfortunately that&#x27;s not how the consumer market works.')
