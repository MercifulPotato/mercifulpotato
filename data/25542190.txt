It&#x27;s very easy, vegetables and staple carbohydrates - pasta, rice and potatoes - are all inexpensive, and I&#x27;m a vegetarian so I bought pulses, beans, eggs, soy and nuts for protein. You just buy what you strictly need, and nothing more. It does come at the expense of some enjoyment, but I still spend no more than US$50 a week now - even though I don&#x27;t really have to think about the cost of my groceries anymore. US$150 seems high to me, I&#x27;d struggle to spend that much with my partner if I tried?')
