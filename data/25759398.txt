It&#x27;s not new, and it&#x27;s often important for auditing purposes and because mistakes happen.<p>What&#x27;s new is the ease with which databases can be accessed and hacked over a global public network.<p>&gt; Or an errant database migration isn&#x27;t going to transfer it properly. Or the database will be leaked, and all of the &quot;deleted&quot; content will still be there<p>Backups are a thing, you know.
