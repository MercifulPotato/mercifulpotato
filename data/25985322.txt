There&#x27;s no reason sharing on the web has to be somehow limited to whatever the website author chose to support.<p>My problem is that this just isn&#x27;t a pragmatic choice right now. The chicken-and-egg problem is somewhat true, but the carrot was already there for web devs - iOS and Android implement web share. And it&#x27;s an excellent UX - better than anything you can make yourself.<p>The problem with the desktop share experience is that it is strictly worse than putting 2-3 social buttons &amp; copy link for 95% of people. Neither Facebook nor WhatsApp support the share target API right now (quick post-edit: Twitter does though). Even if they did, there&#x27;s another hurdle [1]:<p><pre><code>  To register your app as a share target, it needs to meet Chrome&#x27;s installability criteria. In addition, before a user can share to your app, they must add it to their home screen.\n</code></pre>\nSo, again, pragmatically what people are going to start doing is - change from &quot;if (navigation.share)&quot; to &quot;if (navigator.share &amp;&amp; isMobile)&quot;. And I think that sucks - there will have to be another slow-moving wave of change once the desktop share is &quot;good enough&quot; to enable for everyone.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.dev&#x2F;web-share-target&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.dev&#x2F;web-share-target&#x2F;</a>')
