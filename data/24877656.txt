I&#x27;ve been to Portland recently. Plenty of people were outside eating at restaurants. The &quot;anarchy&quot; is greatly overblown by the media.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to downplay the impact of either movement, but to dismiss QAnon as &quot;liberal conspiracy&quot; when simultaneously only getting news from, what seems like a Twitter agitator, AndyNgo is concerning.')
