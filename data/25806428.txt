I&#x27;ve been using PCs since Windows 3.1. With &quot;good software&quot;, I intuitively know how to use it and how it will behave. Of course, new concepts arrive every now and then, like ribbons or the hamburger menu or whatever. However, what&#x27;s behind them is in the end still the same.<p>When I am faced with the challenge of designing an interaction in software, I always try to make it fit established patterns.<p>Now I&#x27;m working with a UX expert. The interaction designs I receive are just <i>not right</i>. They are not intuitive. I am rather disappointed. My impression is that this expert is simply not an expert PC user. Of course, that&#x27;s N=1 as far as my professional work is concerned.<p>Furthermore, in the lastâ€¦ 12-15 years, more and more software seems to change just for the sake of change. My personal opinion is that this is because of designers trying to justify their existence.')
