You need massive clean rooms and a huge laser. Afterwards you need to scale up and actually become profitable, which is even harder. One EUV machine costs 145 million dollars, and you are not going to buy a second one before the first one works well enough. That is why TSMC has now half of all the machines. Many manufacturers gave up making fabs and went to TSMC for production.<p>I do think the proximity of Taiwan to China is a huge help for both fast turnaround of tools&#x2F;machines as in workers. China themselves are banned from having the latest chip technology. Taiwan is often used as a proxy for western countries to be near China.')
