This always caused consternation among scrummasters and product managers, and there always had to be a discussion about it. But it sped things up tremendously, because the engineer could do things like say &quot;well, what if we did this other thing instead, which would give you what you need, and also solve another problem we have&quot;. In almost all cases the other engineer was happy to talk to our engineer, and very easy to work with.\nThis needed to be a private conversation as well, so that both parties not need to worry about optics. Preferably phone.\nOnce a scrum-master tried to insist that these conversations take place on a public slack channel so that we could &quot;capture&quot; it! And yes I understand why, but it would have skewed the process into something less effective.')
