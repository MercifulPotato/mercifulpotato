A person like that will in all likelihood be working for an employer that offers access to equal or _better_ health insurance than they would have access to in Canada. If it&#x27;s a big tech company the employer will pay virtually all of the premiums beyond some token amount, and out-of-pocket maximums are dramatically lower than the incremental pay raise. And even if the employer didn&#x27;t pay that, the premiums would still be dwarfed by the pay raise.<p>Rent is certainly higher in the Bay Area, though less higher now vs. a year ago, and even so, at the income levels we&#x27;re talking here (especially if going to FAANG or a unicorn), there is very little chance you&#x27;ll end up with less disposable income after rent and health care.<p>If you want to buy a property, you have your work cut out for you since real estate is insanely expensive, though. It&#x27;s not too hard if you&#x27;re a dual-income high earner couple but very hard otherwise and will take a number of years of savings. This is worse than the Vancouver&#x2F;Toronto housing markets, but it&#x27;s less worse than you think given how crazy they are now.')
