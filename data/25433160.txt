Is that assault, stabbing, kidnapping? They don&#x27;t say. The context of the types of attacks is missing some context.<p>In the 1980&#x27;s &amp; 90&#x27;s there were so many hot spots in the world where it was insanely dangerous just to travel to if you were an American let alone a journalist reporting on it. I don&#x27;t know that abroad its as dangerous as it used to be back then, or maybe with all the of problems here, the stuff in Somalia or Turkey isn&#x27;t making the headlines anymore? I&#x27;m just not queued into a lot of the civil unrest in other areas of the world right now where its still very dangerous to report on as a freelance journalist.<p>I feel like a lot of the physical violence has been replaced by online and social media mob culture that has taken over. People you never heard of just getting stampeded online. Gamer Gate is a great example of a social media war that left a ton of people&#x27;s lives (many journalists included) destroyed. Most of the people I had no idea who they were before Gamer Gate, but as I fell into the wormhole, you saw a lot of journalists getting mixed up and then destroyed when the mob came from them.')
