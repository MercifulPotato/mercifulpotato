I consider myself to be an average coder, no formal education, and yet it behooves me why I&#x27;m sitting next to Stanford and Harvard grads at work doing the same grunt-work coding that I&#x27;m doing.<p>Not anything original, not anything H1B worthy, just building front-end UIs and basic BE stuff. There&#x27;s of course H1Bs working on the more complex things too like machine learning (complex to me) but I&#x27;m just astounded by the number of &quot;brilliant&quot; H1Bs that I have to stand shoulder to shoulder with when doing my average (at best?) coding.')
