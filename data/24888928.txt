But I don’t expect go2 to significantly reduce our codebase size, even if we replaced the aforementioned components.<p>I agree that some form of static typing is critical to scale a codebase, or an ecosystem. Let’s also not forget the importance of a packaging system with robust version management. Go modules and proxy.golang.org are also critical to Go’s success at (code) scale.')
