I can&#x27;t remember) was sold to Palm for $11m at the end of Be, Inc&#x27;s life.  Palm actually ended up suing Microsoft for anti-competitive behaviour (on the now defunct Be&#x27;s behalf), and that law suit was settled a few years later for $23m.  I don&#x27;t think Microsoft had to admit any wrong doing, they just paid the money to settle the situation.')
