My host machine is a Kubuntu VM running on my Proxmox server, and I switch between using a desktop and laptop as guests, also connecting in remotely via wireguard when away from home (which honestly isn&#x27;t very much these days).<p>I tried using xrdp before, but, at least at the time I tried it a few years back, personally felt I got better performance with nomachine vs. xrdp, although perhaps this has changed now.  I&#x27;ve tried x2go with individual applications before, but never the entire desktop, perhaps I&#x27;ll have to give that a try sometime.')
