While there are still some votes left to count, there are not enough to shift the margin of victory for Joe Biden in the states that matter.  The lawsuits are becoming an embarrassment and recounts never shift the totals significantly; given the fact that the morons on team Trump spent months telegraphing this move everyone was prepared for it and so I expect there was extra diligence in getting an accurate count -- a recount will not make major changes to the total.  These are facts.')
