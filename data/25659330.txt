After approx 15 years as a developer, I decided to get a degree, because it was becoming a problem (Australia is very sensitive to qualifications). I decided to get an MBA because all the hard problems I&#x27;d met were people and&#x2F;or business problems.<p>The tech is generally easy in commercial coding. There is usually a definitive answer, and if not then the trade-offs are generally well-known. It&#x27;s rare to run into a problem that requires complex technical knowledge, and in those cases it&#x27;s fine to hire a consultant to help.<p>But the people problems are hard. Getting clued-up on these is important.')
