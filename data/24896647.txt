The problem is that the people who paid for the development of the product should also hold rights over the product. If the vaccine was developed with public money, it should be publicly available -- not necessarily (but yes, also to) non-profit startups, but also to any other manufacturer in the pharmaceutical industry, since they (allegedly, in any case...) pay taxes, too, and have therefore invested in this product.<p>If Merck wants to use their proven manufacturing base with an excellent delivery track record (which nobody is denying, after all), that&#x27;s great. They can:<p>1. Put their money into the development of said vaccine, or<p>2. Acquire the license to manufacture it, at a reasonable price, like they do with any technology that <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> developed using public money, or<p>3. If we don&#x27;t want stuff that&#x27;s already been paid for with public money to be <i>sold</i> to manufacturers, which I don&#x27;t disagree with at all, then, sure, they should get it for free -- but in that case they shouldn&#x27;t be the sole owner of the rights towards that product, either.<p>(Edit: FWIW, I&#x27;m all for 3. I&#x27;ve worked in the medical industry and I know full well that there&#x27;s a great deal of work that goes between first-stage research and final production, and that it&#x27;s incredibly hard and expensive to take the result of a publicly-funded research program and turn it into a product. That doesn&#x27;t change the fact that said research programs are <i>publicly-funded</i> -- their results should be available to anyone who paid for them. If someone wants exclusive rights to the result of some research program, then they&#x27;re welcome to pay for it themselves.)<p>As it stands now, they own the rights (including licensing rights!) to a bunch of products that they haven&#x27;t paid for at all.<p>All the suits blabber on and on and on about how the government should keep its nose out of their business. How about they tell the government where to stick it when it&#x27;s about paying for their research, too?')
