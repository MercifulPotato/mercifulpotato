Few years ago i got back deep into C++ after 18 years of mostly Java, and i&#x27;m amazed, it is like travel back in time - we (a large C++ platform) are looping over vectors instead of using hashtables&#x2F;maps, copying strings all the time (we have 4 major types of strings plus some minor ones), and don&#x27;t get me started on multithreading and locking&#x2F;synchronization - such an easy and natural thing in Java - even these days the people in C++ world is still seem to be hesitant to use locking and as result of that hesitance push themselves into a myriad of multithreading issues when they risk and&#x2F;or are forced to use threads.<p>&gt;pointer indirection<p>30+ years ago, a student at University, i loved how pointers  allowed to code algorithms efficiently and expressively compare to the non-pointer languages of the time.
