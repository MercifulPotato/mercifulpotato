AMD and Intel are putting out new chips every year (even if they&#x27;re just Skylake refreshes), so it&#x27;s not too big of a deal to change the memory interface, and they are capable of putting in two flavors of DDR support when some flexibility is needed. For IBM, I don&#x27;t think they release incremental chip designs each year, so it makes more sense for them to take the tradeoff of a flexible interface, so they can get onboard with newer ram faster.')
