Also Australia is an island, but Victoria (my state) peaked over 700 cases&#x2F;day and other states during the same period managed to keep their case numbers controlled at the same time (~10 cases &#x2F; day in NSW iirc). It wasn&#x27;t magic. We closed the state borders, making each state basically its own island. Victoria imposed strict lockdowns to get the case numbers down and the rest of the country went about business as usual.<p>I don&#x27;t see why the same strategy wasn&#x27;t used in Europe or the US. Its hard to control a virus when there&#x27;s a constant stream of new cases coming over the border. I suppose its way too late for that now.')
