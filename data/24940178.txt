It&#x27;s meant to be a dreg journal with low reputation; it&#x27;s a feature, not a bug. The idea is to allow people to publish their work (e.g. to finish their PhD), but everyone knows that further investigation is needed before stuff should be called a proper finding. I think of it as the &quot;workshop&quot; version of a journal.')
