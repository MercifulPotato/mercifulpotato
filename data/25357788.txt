Which is why I stated that it&#x27;s about time we changed that too.<p>No, I don&#x27;t own a car. Yes I do walk. Yes I do drive, and yes I do my best to protect the environment. I even have my own litter picker and go out every-night picking up trash off the streets from those of the likes of you dropping it.<p>Animal slaughter for anything is wrong. Animals have long-been put as second class and that&#x27;s what needs to change. Why?, why not. And your a prime example of someone who&#x27;s first class who clearly shows; you don&#x27;t really care.<p>That&#x27;s what needs to change in the world. You. How much meat do you eat? Cut that amount in half. You don&#x27;t need to stop but with demand so stupidly high because of people demanding it for convenience is what&#x27;s wrong with this planet. Having meat for special occasions, I have no issue with that. If the animal is your own cattle and used for dinner, okay if the animal hasn&#x27;t been abused. Cows need to be milked otherwise they get ill. That&#x27;s fine.<p>The issues I have is that when an animal are bred deliberately, tortured and inhumanely treated for your self-indulgence. Sold for greed and profit or used as painful experiments (cosmetics) that&#x27;s where it&#x27;s wrong.<p>I&#x27;m a environmentalist activist which vegan is only just a sub-category of.<p>Being all-out honest I don&#x27;t even like vegan products, they taste crap. Cheese is icky, their butter is meh. It has a long-way to go before it can come to anything. But I still hold to my views of it&#x27;s time to stop eating animals, using animals for ones selflessness. Why are we still using animals, that&#x27;s a question which no one can ever seem to answer.')
