By wasting time I mean using their time to either gain more knowledge and to better themselves. For example, I would like to study subjects x, y, and z throughout the day. But my inability to focus on the task prevents me from advancing in subject x, let alone y and z.<p>What are techniques you use to not waste time? I have tried the pomodoro technique, but the five minute break turns into an hour break, and so on. It may be that I am spreading myself too thin trying to learn so many various different things, that it overwhelms my mind and the mind retaliates by doing nothing.<p>I believe this is an important topic for many people, especially in the HN community. Many aspire to accomplish lofty goals, but the giant obstacle is time. If only we could not waste our time, and work on that side project one was always wanting to do, or study that subject you always wanted to know more about.')
