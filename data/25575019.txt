The top 20% of salesmen bring in 80% of the business.<p>In customer support, the top 20% of customers take up 80% of a company’s time.<p>According to this article, the total wealth in this country is 112 trillion. If you applied the 20&#x2F;80 rule to this figure, and then keep applying the 20&#x2F;80 rule until you have 1% remaining, then the “natural” outcome should be that the top 1% control over 70 trillion in wealth. That’s twice as high as what we actually have.')
