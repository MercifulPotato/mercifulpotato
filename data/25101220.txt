Also, overeating or eating when I&#x27;m not hungry does much harm. It took me about two weeks to notice benefits from nofap and I&#x27;m never looking back. Coffee was the last thing to quit and it was impossible without nofap. If I do anything against these rules my perceived sleep quality degrades significantly and I feel like sh*t next day. YMMV.')
