It is just shared memory so you have zero connection overhead.\nFor example, connecting through sockets to pgBouncer saves 50% CPU.<p>Unfortunately there are some kernel tuneables (buffer sizes) which you have to set at compile time to support massive data transfers on sockets.<p>Obviously this only works if you are on the same machine and if you connect directly to Postgres this way, it will happily spawn a process for every query :(.')
