Traditional Labour seats were lost based on Brexit fence-sitting. They will revert, especially as those constituents are slowly realising that getting Brexit done meant screwing them over. Johnson&#x27;s Tories didn&#x27;t so much win, it was essentially a one horse race.<p>*Edit: That said, speaking as a staunch remainer, as much as we need to accept that we can&#x27;t have our cake and eat it, the EU must recognise the same. It&#x27;s their own fault that they&#x27;re in this position.')
