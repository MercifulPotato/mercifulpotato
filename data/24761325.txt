They are a horticultural variety that was produced through traditional breeding practices to increase the sugar content, reduce tartness, and add the hint of vanilla flavor. Those all come from traditional crossing of other genetic lines of grapes. The process was more difficult because cotton candy grapes are seedless, so each generation had to be propagated using tissue culture.')
