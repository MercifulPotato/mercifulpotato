This situation is probably long-term worse for morale because there&#x27;s no collective sense of accomplishment and instead everyone&#x27;s betting their stability on one person.<p>If someone&#x27;s too far ahead of everyone else in terms of skill (through their own work or talents), they should be given opportunities to find or create a team with similar skills. Just because you happened to join a team with different skill levels does not mean you&#x27;re now obligated to teach everyone else. It&#x27;s great when people decide to teach others when there&#x27;s a large skill gap, but that should be a personal choice.')
