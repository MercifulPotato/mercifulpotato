I brought an uncomfortable number of (deer) ticks home in the spring and again in recent weeks. This is every bit or more frightening personally than Covid is. At this point I know every skin tag and mole on my body from doing thorough check downs every time I get home from hiking. In Pa. we have the East Stroudsberg U Tick Research Laboratory who will take a specimen of any tick found embedded or not and run a basic pathogen panel free. The few I&#x27;ve sent in have been clean but being familiar with my bestie&#x27;s dad&#x27;s experience with Lyme there&#x27;s no chance I&#x27;m not being as proactive as possible.')
