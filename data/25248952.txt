Yes there&#x27;s always corruption and there&#x27;s always economic bubbles bursting all the time, but no the world is definitely not crumbling.<p>The actual problem is that kids nowadays are insulated by parents and school from facing real hard problems. So when you face a real problem, your picture of a perfect world that only exists in your bubble crumbles. But the world is not crumbling, and actually the kind of challenges you&#x27;re facing are absolutely nothing in comparison to what people had to face 20, 50 or 100 years ago.')
