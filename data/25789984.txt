I can imagine a PM looking at the collaboration flow, UX researcher finding friction in initiating collaboration, testing mockups where Dropbox &quot;magically&quot; knows your colleagues, and it getting great reception from users. Most users still don&#x27;t care about privacy, most users assume email addresses are essentially fully public.<p>This part is a better UX for the majority of users.<p>The problem comes when there&#x27;s a data leak, or when the marketing team decide to email those contacts, or some time later that could really easily be argued as &quot;this will never happen&quot;, and may often not, but it&#x27;s possible.<p>It&#x27;s details like this that differentiate the &quot;good&quot; product companies from the &quot;great&quot; product companies, specifically because the detail of &quot;not collecting email addresses&quot; would never be noticed by those users, by construction.')
