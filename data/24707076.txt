Blocking low paid neurosurgeons from coming into your country, never translates to allowing barbers to operate on your head.<p>It probably means you either go into a wait queue to get your operation done, or you fly to a different country where those doctors are present. Either way the operation will be more expensive, and your country will have less know-how at the end. You also have to now deal with the consequences of having awesome things getting done outside your country, which means the next generation of neurosurgeons won&#x27;t be coming out of your country. At least not all of them.<p>Now Google or any other company isn&#x27;t going lower the bar for hiring, they&#x27;ll just happily open offices outside US to get the cream of the those countries. The fact that it could hurt your feelings is just irrelevant here.<p>Its very much like getting hired to Navy SEALs or some into some other elite unit. They have their criteria, they really don&#x27;t mind rejecting you if you don&#x27;t measure up.')
