Item(by='marcinzm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605220770, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25072139, text='&gt;I feel like if I reached the FIRE point, I would continue to work, but entirely on my own terms, not as an employee of somebody else.<p>If you want do to something that impacts or depends on other people then it will never be solely on your own terms. Plenty of people burn out of OSS because they think otherwise and then the angry users eat away at them. Likewise being FIRE doesn&#x27;t mean you have unlimited resources so if you want more resource you will need to get them on someone else&#x27;s terms.<p>I&#x27;ve known a number of senior people at these companies that basically get to do whatever they want, pitch projects and then have teams whose job is to work out the details. Their name provides so much political clout that the org bends around them rather than the other way around.<p>Personally I work at startups as a hands on manager so generally haven&#x27;t had much red tape, institutional slowness, upper management, etc. hassles to deal with. Would continue doing so if I reached FIRE although might cut down my hours.')
