Private citizens having “nothing to hide” in their personal lives is disimilar to public officials having nothing to hide in relation to their official duties. Blackmail related to embarrassing sexual proclivities or anything like that is unfortunate, but kindly asking politicians to be transparent isn’t a realistic answer. Of course they will use official channels and be transparent about everything they _should_ be doing, but it’s exactly the things they want hidden that will go over alternate channels.<p>What I think is most shocking in this age of political hacks and leaks is the fact that people are outraged by it when it’s their side. Sure, the timing can be unfortunate when it harms their chances of re-election, but I’m surprised that I hear more about that, and calling it election interference, than I do about the actual contents of the leaks. Don’t like it when your side’s dirty laundry hurts their campaign? Solution: nominate candidates with less dirty laundry.')
