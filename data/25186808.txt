It&#x27;s not even near 1050 Ti in the real world, check any game, M1 gets destroyed by that 4 year old 1050 Ti GPU. For example, Shadow of the Tomb Raider 45 fps 1080p medium vs 26 fps on M1.<p>You might say it&#x27;s because of Rosetta (not that it makes any difference because probably most games will never be ported anyway, so Rosetta is all you get when talking about current games), but there&#x27;s another game which has Apple Sillicon support - World of Warcraft. That one measures high 30s to mid 40s fps on ultra 1080p vs 58.1 avg fps on 1050 Ti. Comparisons are from userbenchmark.com regarding 1050 Ti and youtuber tests regarding M1.<p>So all those claims &quot;30 % better&quot; were just a manipulative scam using benchmarks nobody cares about.')
