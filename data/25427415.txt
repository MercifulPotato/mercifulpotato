I&#x27;ve gotten addicted separately on different forms and it is all the same. Fine in moderation (like a cig or a dip a day), but once you start ramping up beyond a certain baseline you will get a hell of a headache trying to claw it back. Feels exactly the same as a heavy caffeine addiction but it hits a half hour after the nicotine when its bad.')
