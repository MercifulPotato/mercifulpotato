Canada seems to do it the worst.  Unless you pay for the premium stuff, it comes in 1-lb blocks.  Well, 454g blocks, but they aren&#x27;t fooling anybody.  The block is a huge square extrusion about the size of 4 American sticks of butter.  It&#x27;s utterly unweildly and in the decade I&#x27;ve lived here, I haven&#x27;t seen a butter dish made for these bricks.  I&#x27;d love to hear from other Canadians how they manage these things.')
