At best the efficacy of HCQ is inconclusive.<p>The author’s overall point was that corrupt right-wing politicization of HCQ was a huge diversion of resources and public attention... as illustrated by your zeroing in on a single term from the the blog post and waving a contrary study from a small patient group. Your comment really doesn’t add much except distraction and confusion.')
