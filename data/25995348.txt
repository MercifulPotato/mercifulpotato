I still think this needs to be evaluated on a case by case basis. Google doesn&#x27;t want to kill things off, they just realize the ROI doesn&#x27;t make sense in terms of profits they can capture. I think specifically in the case of Stadia, there are lots of things in Google&#x27;s favor that make this something they will succeed at and capture lots of profit&#x2F;value from. The market is huge too. It also is a beachhead into a consumer product (TV) that Apple hasn&#x27;t really invested in yet. Console-class couch&#x2F;TV gaming is an important use case that Apple, Amazon and Google will battle for in their &quot;home&quot; product lines. This transformation is only beginning so as long as Google sticks with it they&#x27;ll do fine.')
