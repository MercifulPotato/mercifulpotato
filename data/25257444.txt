The larger and more complex a project becomes, the more these delays compound. A sub $1k laptop with the the computational power of a workstation that costs many times that, and isn&#x27;t portable is an absolute game changer in many areas. If I worked for National Geographic or the New York times as a photographer and needed to preprocess several thousand images or 4&#x2F;8k footage  from the field so I could make print deadlines, 3 hours vs overnight means everthing.And more importantly, the amount of power consumed by the cycles is far from trivial. An x86 mobile workstation can&#x27;t even complete certain render tasks on a single charge that the macbook air can do on less than a quarter of a battery charge.<p>As for compile times, believe it or not, lots of projects are written in something other than highly optimized C code and compile time is a real pain point. You don&#x27;t always have a choice of what language or dependencies you work with.<p>Just because there is an alternative way to do something, or a way that takes longer doesn&#x27;t mean its viable. Performance improvements matter, a lot. Power consumption improvements matter, a lot.')
