If by landlord you mean the typical NIMBY homeowner then sure it&#x27;s true. But in practice landlords can make more money off of building more units vs squeezing out more profit from a smaller amount of units. So if you were a politician and followed the advice of the greediest landlord you would not end up with scarcity. The political environment doesn&#x27;t listen to the greediest landlord though. It primarily listens to the homeowner type of landlord.')
