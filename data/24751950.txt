Unity&#x27;s Scene&#x2F;Prefab load&#x2F;instantiation is already a form of DI. Using another causes issues with juggling multiple lifecycles.<p>You also lose the ability for Unity to prefetch assets because Unity can&#x27;t inspect the dependency graph if it&#x27;s not done through the asset system.  Instead you hit situations where you&#x27;re loading several objects and running DI code over several frames when unity could have loaded everything at once.')
