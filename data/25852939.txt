Texas is red, ESPECIALLY the areas that produce that oil - but let&#x27;s set aside the intra-state conflicts on this. None of the states mentioned are &#x27;ideologically&#x27; self sufficient in their needs (CA for Oil, despite being a major food and oil producer, Texas for food - among literally millions of major and minor needs), and NY State or NYC are most decisively not in either category.<p>[<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ers.usda.gov&#x2F;data-products&#x2F;chart-gallery&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;chart-detail&#x2F;?chartId=58315" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ers.usda.gov&#x2F;data-products&#x2F;chart-gallery&#x2F;gallery...</a>]<p>If you look at your own chart, you&#x27;ll also see that ~90% of all of the remaining entries following California (who make up the bulk of production) would be called midwest, near midwest (definitely not blue), or &#x27;flyover territory&#x27;.<p>If you go to the link you had and filter by staples (as compared to expensive-per-calorie foods like almonds or strawberries), you&#x27;ll see this reflected even more strongly [<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.ers.usda.gov&#x2F;reports.aspx?ID=17844#P7521943176f048808983cfea6a2afc0a_2_251iT0R0x57" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.ers.usda.gov&#x2F;reports.aspx?ID=17844#P7521943176f...</a>]<p>California has a LOT of people in it. 11% of the nation. While they might not personally feel the brunt of a major famine right away - running out of fuel for the harvesters, or the steel products to repair their equipment, or the equipment itself (predominantly produced in &#x27;red&#x27; areas or imported), would mean it wouldn&#x27;t be that long either.<p>If we look at the wider context, losing 50%+ of the agricultural products aka inland &#x27;flyover&#x27; areas and the midwest would definitely cause catastrophic famine. And that is at least how much is there from your own links.')
