I did find a few ones I hadn&#x27;t seen before but it seems that none that have the same range as Amazon. So I&#x27;d still end up having to order from several places and dealing with different postage costs, return policies, etc. Amazon has the advantage of setting that baseline for a very wide range of products, which removes a lot of friction from the experience. Newegg could probably gain a lot more business if it had a competitive offer with EU shipping, like it does in the US.')
