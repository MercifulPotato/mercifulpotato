The benefit to the open source arena is that these changes can easily be analyzed and tested.<p>In Microsoft&#x27;s case, the source being visible but not editable is still a real risk (assuming the bad actor is able to extract the data they&#x27;re viewing for further analysis), because they can use the source to determine avenues for attack.<p>The fact that is was read-only does help ensure that no new attack vectors were created, but it still increases the chance of new attack vectors being found&#x2F;used in the future.')
