But as their business depends on software, it&#x27;s worrisome that rather than understanding what was wrong, they just switched software. That doesn&#x27;t seem inspiring to me.<p>Nobody said they had to fix the problems, but identifying them, and checking if they were fixed upstream seems like a good idea. Sometimes upgrading is a nightmare and doesn&#x27;t fix anything, sometimes it fixes a major issue and drops cpu usage from 90% to 5%. If you know what the problem areas are, it should take less than a day to look at the changes and see if that area was addressed. Even if not, reading the changelogs and version notes should give some idea. It&#x27;s fine if they didn&#x27;t test upgrading, but again, I&#x27;m not inspired about their engineering talent and processes when it looks like they didn&#x27;t even look to see if it would have been likely too help.')
