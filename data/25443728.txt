I used to do this with GIMP a long time ago, before it had single-window mode.  Now I just use it as a single maximized window, and don&#x27;t bother with that.<p>I make popup windows float, so those will appear centered and disappear without changing my window layout, as one would expect of popup windows.<p>Occasionally I&#x27;ll manually float a window, when I want the kind of control you&#x27;re talking about, or when I want it to overlap my default maximized window for some reason, but that&#x27;s pretty rare.')
