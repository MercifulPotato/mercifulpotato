On the face of it, their &quot;about&quot; page[1] sounds appealing (not least because it resonates with my open source values):<p><i>One web page for every book ever published. It&#x27;s a lofty but achievable goal.</i><p><i>To build Open Library, we need hundreds of millions of book records, a wiki interface, and lots of people who are willing to contribute their time and effort to building the site.</i><p><i>To date, we have gathered over 20 million records from a variety of large catalogs as well as single contributions, with more on the way.</i><p><i>Open Library is an open project: the software is open, the data are open, the documentation is open, and we welcome your contribution. Whether you fix a typo, add a book, or write a widget--it&#x27;s all welcome. We have a small team of fantastic programmers who have accomplished a lot, but we can&#x27;t do it alone!</i><p>---<p>They also seem to provide an API[2].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openlibrary.org&#x2F;about" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openlibrary.org&#x2F;about</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openlibrary.org&#x2F;developers&#x2F;api" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openlibrary.org&#x2F;developers&#x2F;api</a>')
