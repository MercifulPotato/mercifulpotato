In other words, the aircraft must always be moving through the air. If its speed drops below some minimum value, it will stall and drop out of the sky like a rock. This is also why they need runways in order to take off. They need to accelerate to a minimum speed in order to even get airborne.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;V_speeds" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;V_speeds</a><p>Rotary wing aircraft use their engines to constantly move <i>the wings</i> through the air instead of moving the aircraft itself. So the wings are always generating lift and the aircraft is free to move in much more flexible patterns. A very useful maneuver is hovering in place: the aircraft is able to simply hold its position in the air. Since only the wings need to move to generate lift, the aircraft itself does not need to accelerate in order to take off and therefore a long runway is not necessary.<p>Civilian drones usually have rotary wings because this allows people to do useful things like having the drone stay in one place in order to film or photograph something. A fixed wing aircraft would have to establish a loitering pattern around an area in order to do the same thing. In other words, rotary wings can just hover in place while a fixed wing would have to fly around in circles.<p>Fixed wing aircraft are more fuel efficient. Rotary wing aircraft must constantly spend fuel in order to keep their wings spinning. They lose lift otherwise. A fixed wing aircraft would probably be able to glide great distances and even land safely even if it lost all engines in the middle of its flight.')
