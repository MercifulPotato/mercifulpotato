The two are not the same. The 1925 Geneva protocol has exceptions for riot control agents to be used in various circumstances specifically because its wording is otherwise overly broad. Tear gas is a non lethal tool to bring crowds under control. The alternative is to let crime happen or to put both the police and criminals at greater risk.<p>In case of Seattle’s attempt at banning use of tear gas, the federal judge also didn’t say “the police might get significantly more violent”. Do you have a source on that, because it feels like editorializing.
