I can edit and compose emails in my favourite editor<p>2. Near instantaneous launch<p>3. Can launch multiple instances, allowing for viewing&#x2F;searching to happen concurrently<p>4. Rapid search with advanced searching features - i.e. find all emails that have 1 or more attachments sent to me from within a month of 1&#x2F;1&#x2F;2019 from someone with a &quot;csu&quot; email - would be l ~f csu ~X &gt; 0 ~d 1&#x2F;1&#x2F;2019*1m<p>5. Deal rapidly with emails - I have &#x27;d&#x27; for delete and move to next and &#x27;y&#x27; for archive and move to next, I can zip through emails quicker than on any other email client I have used<p>6. I can work effectively when I&#x27;m offline or have patchy internet&#x2F;signal (i.e. on a train) using mbsync or similar to store emails locally and sync up with my gmail account when I have internet.<p>7. Highly configurable - custom set-up for what data I want to see in my inbox, and what colours to use and what to highlight<p>8. Intelligent reply-all - it knows I have several email aliases that belong to me so I don&#x27;t reply to myself')
