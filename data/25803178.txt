Bruce correctly sees being locked into Gradle as a way to need his expertise, but that is not a reason to follow him down the rabbit hole.<p>The correct response to discovering the nature of Gradle is to abandon it, immediately. (Similarly Waf, and Scons.) The world does not need yet another one-or-two-language-target build system, or another build system as full general scripting language. Things work better when you don&#x27;t need expertise. A build system should be just <i>barely</i> powerful enough to do builds, but not powerful enough to mystify. A build system should work equally well for all the languages you might find you need to use. A build system should not need to be studied to be understood: isolated examples should suffice for each need.<p>Similarly, the build for a project should not need to be understood: everything you need to know about what you are looking at should be right there, or (failing that) in a single, central place for the project. The build should be the <i>least</i> interesting or engaging part of the project; the project itself inevitably demands more attention than you can spare. A build system that demands attention is a child screaming when you need to work.')
