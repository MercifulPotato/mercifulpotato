Consensus certainly has its place, particularly in democratic institutions. But IMHO it&#x27;s an anti-feature for a forum. It&#x27;s exactly the counter-consensus opinions that I find most valuable. To the extent that they are suppressed the forum simply loses my interest. Yes, it&#x27;s useful to see where the consensus is heading. But mostly it&#x27;s a snooze, and the compelling content is the stuff that challenges it.<p>A better use of this data would be to highlight the counter-consensus speakers so that I can have a listen.')
