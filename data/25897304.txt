But the solvent and gaseous behavior can be similar to hydrocarbons while being non-flammable instead.\nFluorocarbons are very stable compounds and after you have inhaled an anesthetic amount of volatile fluorocarbon compound under clinical conditions, it is expected that the material will wear off by evaporating back out of your system completely unmetabolized and leaving no fluorine behind.  I accept that and it&#x27;s probably not even harmful compared to ether or cyclopropane.<p>If the carbon skeleton of the molecule is not completely saturated with fluorine but instead has an organic acid group in one of the positions, then it&#x27;s no longer a plain fluorocarbon since now there&#x27;s a bit of oxygens in the molecule and their associated hydrogen so you call it a perfluorinated organic acid.<p>These correspond to the same hydrocarbon skeleton having the same acid group, which are just called plain ordinary organic acids.  Many of which are biochemicals such as acetic acid which is the active ingredient in common vinegar.<p>Except the presence of fluorine can make the corresponding acid much stronger and not behave so much like its nonfluorinated counterpart.<p>Sometimes the more fluorine the worse until you reach full perfluorination.<p>You just can&#x27;t always wash this stuff off.  Don&#x27;t ask me how I know.<p>Such perfluorinated acids can theoretically react with things that are not even considered alkalis, it would be possible to take a permanent place in a metabolic pathway which millions of years of evolution have arrived at based on organic acids which bond and unbond at a characteristic pH and no permanent members are expected to remain at all times.<p>The fluorine can become a permanent part of you.<p>That wouldn&#x27;t be the best way to strive for millions more years of continuity.<p>There were so many other chemicals to choose from.<p>But it&#x27;s a little too late now.<p>What&#x27;s the digital equivalent?<p>Is there some toxic product or byproduct that has permeated further &amp; deeper than it was actually safe to do, and now it looks like it could be impossible to recover to the pre-toxic condition?<p>Is it just a matter of unbridled greed, unlimited scale, or are these things that should never be touched at all?')
