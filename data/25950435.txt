I made a similar argument when this recalcitrant doctor was pulled of a United plane a few years back, justified in my view, and in line with the conditions of carriage. But, yeah, HN crowd wasn&#x27;t pleased.<p>(Many said they&#x27;d never fly United again, and most people wouldn&#x27;t... United share price dropped a bit, then went straight back up to where it was and beyond. Well, until COVID-19.)<p>Edit to add: BTW, the point is not that you should always read the TOS. The point is that you should read the TOS before complaining if something unexpected happens.')
