Just that the <i>book</i> focuses on getting you practice curiosity without telling you that the point of these questions is to spark curiosity, which leads to empathy.<p>The problem the author had with the example is the response has a little too much mirroring. Your response:<p>&gt; I would say that it&#x27;s pretty clear that the person is feeling furious because their need for support isn&#x27;t being met.<p>Is better as it is rephrased, and mentions support.')
