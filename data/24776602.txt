Not so much now.<p>&gt;Democratization of culture and media means that it will be much harder for most (except for the tiny few) from making any sort of living from it.<p>Democratization of culture means that culture becomes confused with entertainment. They&#x27;re actually <i>not identical.</i><p>IG, YT, and the rest are now purely about marketing strategies. The content - which used to have to speak for itself - is now secondary to bikini ass shots and other eyeball acquisition systems.<p>There is something rather weird and culty about this. It&#x27;s almost as if everyone who produces content is being forced to participate in a competitive reality TV show where they Market Their Brand Really Hardâ„¢ - and the content is increasingly irrelevant.<p>&gt;Every single series that Netflix invests means they have to pass on countless others.<p>Then they need to start monitoring their pilots more effectively, and also spend a little more on up-front development so that the shows that make it out of the slush pile have some prospect of getting to the end of a natural arc.<p>This is the paradox that most people don&#x27;t seem to understand. NF claims to be data driven, and supposedly it&#x27;s economically pragmatic to cut off shows early.<p>It isn&#x27;t at all. It&#x27;s actually unbelievably inefficient, economically and also in terms of customer loyalty.<p>The <i>efficient</i> solution is to produce consistently great content. This pays off over the long-haul - because <i>a successful series can keep generating significant income for decades</i>.')
