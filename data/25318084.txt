You could just as easily argue that this means you are bad at predicting billionaires. YC is 8 for 1000 in the billionaire prediction game. Maybe that is good enough to claim expertise, but I think you have to actually make that argument and not assume it.<p><i>If the key to becoming a billionaire — the defining feature of billionaires — was to exploit people, then I, as a professional billionaire scout, would surely realize this.</i><p>This does not follow. First, &quot;if this was true, I would know&quot; is not an argument.
