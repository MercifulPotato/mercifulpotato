They have a tiny &quot;continue without supporting us&quot; link that blends in nicely with the text around it. The weird thing is I always see that link while my wife never does. I don&#x27;t mean she can&#x27;t find it; it simply isn&#x27;t there. This is using Chrome on Android. No root or anything special. Doesn&#x27;t matter if her phone is on wifi or mobile. On the other hand, I see that link every time. It&#x27;s been that way for about a year and I have never been able to figure it out -- although admittedly, I haven&#x27;t tried that hard.')
