While my mind is honestly saying &quot;seriously, fuck off&quot;, I&#x27;ll try to put this in a more constructive response.<p>It&#x27;s not about &quot;rolling over&quot;. It&#x27;s about having the maturity to realize when you are dealing with management, if by your demands you put them in an absolute no-win situation, then you&#x27;ve only screwed over yourself. That no-win situation was the demands by Gebru and the ethical AI team that management throw their colleagues under the bus. Management simply <i>can&#x27;t</i> accede to that demand without saying to a huge portion of their employees &quot;We&#x27;re going to trash the reputations of other employees based on who yells the loudest&quot;.<p>Gebru and the ethical AI team most probably could have gotten huge portions of what they wanted (perhaps not all, but most), and especially would have better <i>actually</i> implemented the organizational change they say they want, if they hadn&#x27;t handled the situation so extremely unprofessionally.')
