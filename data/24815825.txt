Fixed calibration targets could help compensate for broad nonlinearity and also drift from, e.g., temperature variation. Varying focus as you home on the target with a spiral path forgives a lot of initial inaccuracy. The system could refine its response curves with each kill, to home in faster; calibration targets might not be needed if unfocused illumination is forgiving enough.<p>It doesn&#x27;t need a 100% kill rate in the first 10 minutes. Indeed, in a usefully big volume it gets plenty of attempts on each target. So, there is plenty of time for the system to tune itself to its own hardware.')
