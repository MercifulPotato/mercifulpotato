The correct statement is that the external observer never <i>sees</i> the material cross the event horizon, because, heuristically, it would take an infinite time for light emitted exactly on the event horizon to get out to the external observer. However, this does <i>not</i> equate to the external observer being able to assign an &quot;infinite time&quot; to the material crossing the horizon. The notion of &quot;time&quot; the external observer would have to use to do that is mathematically undefined on the horizon.<p><i>&gt; there is matter that starts out inside the horizon</i><p>No, there isn&#x27;t. When an ordinary object like a star collapses to a black hole, there is no horizon at all to start with, and there is no matter starting out inside any horizon.')
