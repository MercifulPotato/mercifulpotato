It implements only parts of Jekyll that I use and nothing more: theme and markdown-based content with front matter. It&#x27;s implemented in Flask using Frozen-Flask and didn&#x27;t took long to write. I think I spent a weekend to write, tweaked the theme and migrate my contents to it.<p>I don&#x27;t have the same need as the author though. If I want to post something that is not a blog post (e.g. a page that showcase a particular personal project), I&#x27;ll just post it as a standalone page and add whatever custom stuff the standalone page needs in the theme.')
