I feel as if since 2016 they&#x27;ve lost a lot of credibility. Their reporting feels like editorials, and their internal issues often become public. It seems like a highly political newsroom (i.e., &quot;what facts ought we to report&quot; instead of &quot;what are the facts to report&quot;). I subscribe to a more local newspaper now instead.')
