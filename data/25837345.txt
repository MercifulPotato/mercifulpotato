If we were able to go out and socialize outside of working from home, I&#x27;m sure many people would be faring and feeling much better than what our current situation is.<p>I have only been around family for the entirety of the last year, and as much as being close and connected with them is, not being able to go out to eat or do anything else does take it&#x27;s toll.<p>I have been staying connected with friends and strangers online through things such as discord, etc. and I would have to say it has helped tremendously. Getting regular interaction with others even if it&#x27;s just over audio or video goes a long way through all of this.')
