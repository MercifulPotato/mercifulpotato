Not to mention free availability of tons of over-complicated &quot;does it all&quot; frameworks that dont really fit to solving any particular problem perfectly, but are good enough to avoid solving complex problem where you have no workforce that would actually be able to solve it.<p>And guess who profits - engineers certainly not.<p>Actually we are denominating our work by giving it out for free (try to get someone to paint your walls, to lay down some ceramic tiles, to fix your car,... for a price of mentioning who did it behind the bumper, under a tile,...)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.buzzfeed.com&#x2F;chrisstokelwalker&#x2F;the-internet-is-being-protected-by-two-guys-named-st" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.buzzfeed.com&#x2F;chrisstokelwalker&#x2F;the-internet-is-b...</a>')
