In the dropbox case I have to trust those that are counting. I don&#x27;t think we can get away from this trust level. In the hidden&#x2F;automatic dropbox I have to trust the counters <i>and</i> the machine. I can&#x27;t verify that the machine prints the same thing for me and the dropbox. Without that verification it, to me, undermines the entire point of a receipt in the first place. Maybe you see something I don&#x27;t? I&#x27;m certainty not an expert so I&#x27;m open to me misunderstanding something and don&#x27;t take my word as expertise either haha.')
