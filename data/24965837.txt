Specifically that they keep techauthority open to aftermarket. Less so that they&#x27;d drop support for 20 year old cars on their dealerships.<p>WiTECH isn&#x27;t entirely brand new here. This release (WiTECH 2.0) is a continuation of WiTech 1.0 (installed software) that has existed for decades with full support for all OBD2 model years up to 2017. v2.0 is all web based so you can print off whatever you feel is important while you have an active subscription.<p>You can still get a haynes, chilton, etc manual but I feel we&#x27;re comparing apples to oranges there. Those sorts of things are not shop manuals + dealer tools even on a 30 year old car. I&#x27;m pointing out that the dealer tools are starting to be within grasp of a shade tree mechanic and they&#x27;re letting YOU service the modules. You don&#x27;t have to settle for a reverse engineered manual based on a teardown or 3rd party tools. But they aren&#x27;t stopping you from using those either. I appreciate it with how computerized cars are getting. Who else lets aftermarket flash modules with OEM firmware updates? This is the exact opposite direction tesla has been going in.<p>All that said. I very much respect a carbureted vehicle that only needs a dull spark on 6 out of 8 cyls to get you down the road. No question about it.')
