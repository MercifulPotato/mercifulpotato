Clearly, not objective reality. Do you think that this is<p>a) the result of Google or<p>b) the result of FoxNews, and other Mercer&#x2F;Koch&#x2F;Murdoch owned media&#x2F;radio continuously amplifying and echoing these claims?<p>If Google has so much power, why can&#x27;t they convince 3&#x2F;4s of Republicans that water is wet? Like literally, 42 lost court cases, court dockets where the Republican governors and secretaries of states conducted investigations and debunked all of the specious &quot;evidence&quot; (e.g. the &quot;suitcases from under the table&quot; video), and yet this gaslighting continues.<p>The Trump administration has undermined the credibility of all of our institutions, the latest being the scientific &#x2F; medical community and democratic institutions. He does this by spreading baseless lies on social media with made up facts, some of them so preposterous that they&#x27;ve essentially 8chan&#x2F;8kun posts. This then gets spread far and wide on social media and conservative TV and Radio as a mind virus.<p>And yet, the problem is Google has too much power to fact check this motherlode of bullshit.<p>Well clearly, this power sucks, because for all of its scary capability, it clearly can&#x27;t burst the bubble of people who have been gaslit into a shitgibbon&#x27;s cult.')
