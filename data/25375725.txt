I personally prefer first person in games, and first person only games. My steam library is almost completely dominated by first person games... but some games clearly have been built for a certain perspective, wether that is first or third, and I consider cyberpunk to be one of them made for first person. Especially when it comes to multiplayer, thirdperson is so often abused as a mechanic, and there are other issues I could cite, that my main criticism of this comment is why should devs change their entire design just to suit someone who has an edge case issue?<p>That said, I never really thought about first person causing sickness for some people, so my condolences for the vast swath of amazing games you must miss out on.')
