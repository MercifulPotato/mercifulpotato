I think the majority of the slowness is just down to old&#x2F;legacy systems, and the sheer volume of stuff that has to be touched to make upgrades.  I&#x27;m not saying upgrades&#x2F;changes <i>never</i> happen, but it&#x27;s a big effort.  Why do we still have relatively poor security around a lot of financial stuff?  Because the cost of just writing off fraud is still usually much cheaper than the long-term effort of systemic upgrades.<p>Other countries didn&#x27;t have as much infrastructure to upgrade, and have been able to leap frog the US in many ways.')
