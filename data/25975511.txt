You&#x27;re telling me that what I both saw and experienced, with verified fact and video evidence, <i>isn&#x27;t real</i>.  Your conviction that you know more about me and my life, than me, and your insistence on how invalid it is, makes you sound, frankly, like some sort of political zealot.<p>I tend not to waste my time convincing other people of things to this degree. I will share my experience, but beyond that, it would be unreasonable for me to tell someone else that their experience isn&#x27;t even real, which is what you&#x27;re doing.')
