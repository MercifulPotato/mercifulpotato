It has a 4 exposure stacking mode, but only in JPEG mode, and the stabilization is sufficient that I can get quite sharp images at 0.8x4 handled, especially at the 35-28mm equivalent focal lengths of an iPhone.<p>I can share some pics, if you want. It does require a steady hand.<p>But then again, the iPhone doesn&#x27;t really do a 3 second exposure, it rejects a lot of frame so it&#x27;s more like 1.5-2 seconds, which I can do reliably.')
