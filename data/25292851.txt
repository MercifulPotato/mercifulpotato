I would be curious how they manage that.<p>1. You put your stored procedures in git.<p>2. You write tests for your stored procedures and have them run as part of your CI.<p>3. You put your stored procedures in separate schema(s) and deploy them by dropping and recreating the schema(s). You never log into the server and change things by hand.')
