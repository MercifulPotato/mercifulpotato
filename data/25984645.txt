They have little interest in blogs, forums, detailed discussions on deep topics, botherations about  privacy, any technical details. They just want to talk to their relatives, share some vacation photos, listen to music, watch videos of funny cats. This is the norm. This is fine.<p>When the 99% moved in, the old internet did not disappear, it just was shown the scale: &quot;nerds&quot; (not necessarily computer nerds) vs &quot;the rest of the population&quot;.<p>Deal with it.')
