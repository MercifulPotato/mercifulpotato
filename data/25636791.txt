That would be an existential threat to the single-party system.<p>(Also, the last time the party allowed public dissent, it grew out of control and turned into the Tiananmen Square protests. The party&#x27;s current leaders remember that time well, and the lesson they took from it is that allowing dissent was a serious miscalculation.)')
