This is why the VW Group is now launching EVs on a near monthly basis, why Mercedes-Benz has launched multiple EVs in the past year, why PSA has, etc.<p>If they want to hit their goals, and avoid fines in the EU market, they need to drastically reduce the CO2 emissions of the cars they&#x27;re selling.
