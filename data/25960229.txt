Because plenty of people had opinions on Gamestop, that maybe the SEC would halt trading altogether etc, but not a single person mentioned this clearing house liquidity issues until it happened. And I still really can&#x27;t get a good explanation for why if I had 10k in my non-margin account that cleared over a year ago I can&#x27;t use that to buy a stock(or withdraw for that matter, though hopefully that&#x27;s temporary). OR, if people were allowed to sell stock, who were they selling to?? Clearly SOMEONE was allowed to buy! A lot of misdirection around things like margin accounts.<p>Robinhood didn&#x27;t give any real explanation until many hours later. But they&#x27;re apparently just &quot;poor communicators.&quot; Amazing how a billion dollar company filled with conflicts of interest making a totally unprecedented restriction that actively helps their hedge fund investor simply can&#x27;t possibly be committing any sort of fraud.<p>Because nobody&#x27;s ever committed fraud before, a Robinhood press release must be treated as the &quot;facts&quot;. This is insanity . Robinhood are not the &quot;experts&quot; in this case, their version of truth is probably the least reliable of all parties.')
