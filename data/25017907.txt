If they already know how they&#x27;re going to vote, it can only damage the president and the senators to expose any facts that go against that.<p>Maybe in a case where the president did something even more extreme, it wouldn&#x27;t work this way. But the sequence appears to be that the president&#x27;s party would first decide they want him out, then do the trial to make it happen, not the other way around.')
