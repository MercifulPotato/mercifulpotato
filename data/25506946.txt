So, I traced the traffic to the Chromebooks my kids in public school were using. About that time, my son was unable to access his drum lessons (Steven&#x27;s Drum Shed, highly recommend) because safety software provided by the school was blocking him. After analyzing the chromebook more, I discovered the traffic going to China was requesting ads and then requesting the hyperlink for the ad (ok, so ad fraud it is). I also noticed that the safety software was logging all HTTP requests to their server. So, I went to the school district and requested they remove it. They initially said, &quot;if we remove it, your kids won&#x27;t be able to access their academic work.&quot; So, I sent a letter to the Superintendent that politely asked they remove the safety software from my family&#x27;s chromebook as it violated my children&#x27;s and my family&#x27;s rights (unreasonable search, get a warrant). I also told them I would hold them responsible for the cost of having the software removed by an expert (which my lawyer suggested would be the thing that got their attention and we&#x27;d be able to win in small claims court). The next day, they removed the &quot;safety&quot; software.')
