You need to have fallback IPs in your clients, that they can connect to in case DNS fails.<p>But that also means you need to have IPs that will last for as long as your client lasts. Which means you need to have a defined lifetime for your client. And you need to have some mechanism to validate the IPs are still your servers and not been taken over by someone else (mutual authentication).')
