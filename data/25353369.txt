I was looking for a fairly niche item in November (something that would likely be handmade), and everything I saw was essentially a drop-shipped mass production item.<p>That is not what I wanted.  I wound up buying from an Amazon shop because... well :shrug:<p>Now, 3 years ago it was not even close to that. Maybe 10%, 20% of sellers. Today it seems like 95% of it is drop-shipped goods.<p>If I wanted that, I&#x27;d go to Aliexpress.<p>I think, tbh, Etsy will have to kick these shippers out, or rebrand. I know it used to be real rough to move goods in enough volume to have substantial success, but this is wildly different.')
