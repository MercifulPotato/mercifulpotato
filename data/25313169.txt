That&#x27;s the world the OP lives now and he&#x27;s arguing against it.<p>The &quot;status quo&quot; in the dark ages was: bigotry, fanaticism, supremacism, conspiratorial theories, anti-science, slavery, and so on. At this time, writing anything against the masses beliefs would lead to persecution and death. People died trying to educate others and at the same time others extremist ideas were born but the society learned to ignore them. The good ideas were victorious.<p>Remember: On May 10, 1933 around 25,000 books from 34 university towns in Germany were burned! Some of those books were unique, their ideas will never be known by society.<p>If you go back in time, 50 years, 100 years, 1000 years back, whatever, the society always approved horrendous ideas and few people fought back. You should never trust the &quot;status quo&quot; or the &quot;justice warriors&quot; of the internet, as they could easily be on the wrong side of history. The access to information is the solution not the problem.<p>In my opinion, asking for censorship shows no respect for the ones that died trying to change the world.')
