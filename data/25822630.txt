At that point, they will quickly become your &quot;friend&quot; in order to get all of the dirt on that person, and then once the deed is done, it&#x27;ll be like you never existed to them.&quot;<p>This one hits hard. I was just a developer at the time, but I had a co-founder get really chummy with me, and I eventually discovered it was for exactly this reason: to get &quot;ammo&quot; against the CTO to force him out. I got fired shortly after the whole situation played out.')
