Item(by='khalilravanna', descendants=None, kids=[25472876], score=None, time=1608326025, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25470961, text='Fallout 4 is a great comparison point. It had the bones of something great but the soul was gone. No factions, no interesting NPCs or side quests, no lore. Just a big empty sandbox to shoot stuff in.<p>This seems better than that at least in that the soul is a lot better. And it has cool lore and factions and NPCs. But where Fallout 4 had fun shooting and RPG mechanics this seems to have pretty poor shooting. Poor driving. Unbalanced RPG mechanics.<p>Ultimately I think they need to do three things:<p>1) Fix bugs<p>2) Rebalance and improve core gameplay (shooting, RPG mechanics, NPC AI, etc.)<p>3) Add a bunch more content<p>And it will be an absolutely fantastic game. No Man’s Sky turned the ship around. Can CDPR do it? I’m hopeful. Maybe if they get rid of the people who pushed for this premature release they’ll have a shot...')
