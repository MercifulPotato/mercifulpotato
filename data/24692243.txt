Not OP, but I experience the same thing. Driving just makes me tired. I&#x27;ve tried running A&#x2F;C at full cold, caffeine, loud music, audiobooks, etc. Nothing helps. The strange thing is, outside of driving I don&#x27;t get tired or want to fall asleep except at bedtime. I don&#x27;t drive when I&#x27;m drowsy. Driving make me drowsy. The bad thing about it is I usually don&#x27;t realize that I&#x27;m getting sleepy until after I&#x27;ve dozed off once. Then I&#x27;ve got to keep myself awake long enough to get to the next rest stop. 20 minute nap and I&#x27;m good to go for another few hours.')
