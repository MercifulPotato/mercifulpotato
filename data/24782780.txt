I feel these are minor minor complaints. You hear this kind of stuff for lisp too. For example, keeping track of parens is just as annoying as keeping track of indentation.<p>Also the migration from python 2 to 3 is actually the best migration ever. Breaking changes on a code that has a massive library around it. All code is migrated along with the libraries. I haven&#x27;t heard of any migration done as successfully as python. It required movement of the language and the entire community to make it happen.<p>Most migrations refrain from breaking changes and instead they take the less risky route and make the language backwards compatible at the cost of being more bloated. See C++ 17 and C++ 20.<p>But despite this, yeah these are complaints that I&#x27;ve heard, but this is totally unrelated to the hate I see. Like parentheses in lisp is something to complain about but not something to hate lisp for.<p>The hate I believe is more egotistical than anything. One interviewer told me I could code in any language other than python because python makes things too simple. The hate is because they believe python programmers are stupider than normal programmers.<p>That being said my favorite language is not python. It&#x27;s my least favorite language out of all the languages I know well but not a language I hate.')
