We came together as a world to ban them, and the hole in the ozone is largely healing. It&#x27;s a great story.<p>But with one wrinkle: We had a good alternative to CFCs that cost about the same.<p>With oil and gas, we kinda don&#x27;t have a good alternative yet. Sure, sure, solar is very cheap nowadays. But from a carbon footprint viewpoint? Solar is still pretty high when you remember you have to melt down all that silicon before you go soak up the sun.<p>Nuclear? Pebble Bed? Thorium? Public&#x27;s got a very bad smell about that stuff. Besides, you just can&#x27;t let all the autocrats out there get their hands on it otherwise they start making up things about having a-bombs and then things get invasion-y. Not cheap, those invasions.<p>Hydro? Wind? Great if you live in Vancouver or Nepal, but in Arkansas or Uttar Pradesh?<p>Unlike with CFCs, we just don&#x27;t have a single power source that meet the requirements wherever you go. It&#x27;s got to be a mosaic of power, and that&#x27;s hard (read expensive) to manage and make.')
