In my country, India, at least, Apple charges absurd amounts for out of warranty repairs. 10 out of 10 cases i know, it would maker more economical sense to buy new rather than repair at authorized service centers. Sometimes the Apple service centers give the same advice.<p>Luckily the 3rd party networks provide good and affordable support for Apple phones at least. But Apple is fighting tooth and nail to shut these guys out. Pushing up the cost of repair with every new generation.<p>On laptops its worse. Apple is really pushing hard to shorten their useful life. Worst part is that they&#x27;re setting  the path for the rest of the industry to follow. Non-removable batteries, soldered RAM, CPU, SSDs, removing backward compatible ports, Use of adhesives, glass in place of screws - making repairs expensive and error-prone. List goes on and on..')
