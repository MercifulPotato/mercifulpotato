This game perpetuates that idea and that colonialism was like, &quot;oh, you know, just finding unexplored land! No one has ever been here!&quot; When the reality of the situation was far different. Perpetuating historical inaccuracies might lead to people having faulty ideas because they&#x27;re based on incorrect information.<p>Just because you grew an interest in history when the games had incorrect information doesn&#x27;t mean everyone will.')
