Item(by='rvz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602955187, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24810881, text='&gt; I agree with this, at least from Apple&#x27;s part most effort is clearly done on &quot;application level&quot; and usefulness of Swift outside there seems more exploratory at the moment. Personally I&#x27;d like them to start adding higher, rather than lower level functionality, and steer towards scripting.<p>This here makes sense. I can see Swift becoming more focused on the application-level side at the moment and in the future becoming a way of writing cross-platform GUI apps in Swift, more likely if it is with Qt5 with direct C++ interop with a SwiftUI-like DSL.<p>As a Rust user, the server-side use-case for Rust is far more developed unlike Swift and would much rather see Rust pushing for low-level development as well.<p>However, I&#x27;ve seen many attempts for a cross-platform GUI library for Rust for a long time and it has been proven to be difficult in terms of adoption, implementation and maintenance. It would take an enormous amount of effort to cover all three of these difficulties from scratch and using bindgen bindings to wrap and maintain it and I&#x27;m afraid for them it would be more trouble than it is worth. But who knows?<p>I just don&#x27;t see a mature cross-platform GUI library coming from the Rust ecosystem anytime soon.')
