Was it a new innovation? No, not at all. Other companies had produced similar products years before, just non did put enough mony into it to refine it to the degree Apple did.<p>Same goes for their ARM chips. They didn&#x27;t invent them nor did they invent the idea of fast ARM chips. But they took and refined them over many product generations to now yield excellent results.<p>Same for ARM laptops.<p>Same for a lot of their software innovations.<p>Same for there camera.<p>Through it should be noted that for them to be able to refine thinks to that degree often some  technological innovations are mixed in in-between.<p>But that&#x27;s fine, constant refinement is often more use-full then complete new innovations without refinement.<p>Sadly sometimes the focus on what gets refined in which ways is pretty questionable.<p>In turn refinements you can&#x27;t sell as innovation get neglected.<p>Also the developer is forced to work with Apple using apple tools so that is often neglected, too. Their is little insensitive for Apple to spend more money on things like that when this will not bring more Users or Developers to Apple.<p>Which is short sighted IMHO given how much money Apple has.')
