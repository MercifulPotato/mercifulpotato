Item(by='gbrown', descendants=None, kids=[24788701], score=None, time=1602764801, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24787735, text='Well yeah, that just about sums it up for me. There’s a subtle myth in absolutist free speech circles (to which I used to belong, and which I still think envision a society worth working towards) - that people are rational. In a world of rational actors, the solution to bad speech is good speech.<p>Humans, on the other hand, have proven themselves largely unprepared for the modern media environment. We have consumer protection laws about what can be put in our food, and I think it’s worth exploring what that would look like for media.<p>Personally, I come down on a power*responsibility compromise. Individual people should have the broadest possible freedoms, but:<p>1. Wealthy and powerful people have an unchecked ability to amplify their voices, and we should think carefully about how to manage that. Returning to a sane world of campaign finance law would be one example.<p>2. Media corporations have a lot of power, and many have abdicated the corresponding responsibility. I think we should work towards editorial standards, mandatory complaint resolution and correction at least for those masquerading as news.<p>3. Platforms like FB and YT have shown themselves capable of algorithmically maximizing engagement, and it seems that for a subset of their users the effect is radicalization and conspiratorial nonsense (Qanon, anti-vax, climate deniers, holocaust deniers etc.) I don’t have the solution, but a bit more gatekeeping against misinformation would probably help.')
