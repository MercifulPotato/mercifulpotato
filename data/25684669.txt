As of January 1, 2018, no issuance or redeeming services will be available to these users.\nExceptions to these provisions may be made by Tether, in its sole discretion, for entities that are:\nEstablished or organized outside of the United States or its territorial or insular possessions; and,\nEligible Contract Participants pursuant to U.S. law.<p>&gt; An Eligible Contract Participant includes a corporation that has total assets exceeding $10,000,000 and is incorporated in a jurisdiction outside of the United States or its territories or insular possessions. This will be the principal basis upon which we will continue to do business with selected U.S. persons.<p>Basically, it looks like they only provide on and off ramps for large clients outside the US. Given their history, I am betting they might not want to reveal where they store their assets, and don&#x27;t want to deal with US regulators (but not sure this is working).')
