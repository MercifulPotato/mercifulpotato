After a management change at the company, I couldn&#x27;t get budget for books or lunches any more.<p>So I bought the books and bought the lunches.<p>The most effective way to learn something thoroughly is to teach it, and I was the facilitator for the book club, leading all the discussions and planning things out.   The thousand dollars or so I spent per book, which won me sufficiently motivated study partners <i>depending on me to lead</i>, offered much more value than money spent on typical coursework or conventions.<p>Never mind the value I was providing for the company (lost on the new management, but I felt good about it nonetheless), spending that money was justifiable solely in terms of creating a maximally stimulating learning environment for myself.')
