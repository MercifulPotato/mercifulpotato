I recently bought a Windows machine since a very long time as I want access to all 3 big operating systems (Mac, Windows, Linux). I forgot how terrible Windows can be with downloading stuff from the internet.<p>I wanted to download a program so that I could control my fans a bit better. Before I knew it, it took over my browser and would redirect me to other sites, couldn&#x27;t remove the program either. Norton didn&#x27;t do its job, and I didn&#x27;t do mine because I probably unchecked one box too few during the installation process. The only way to fix this was to wipe the disk completely.<p>I&#x27;ve never had this experience on Mac or Linux.')
