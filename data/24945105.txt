I see at least four different voting proposals in the above comments, so it isn&#x27;t clear to me whether RCV <i>always</i> works as you describe - admittedly, this discussion hasn&#x27;t come to my locale in a meaningful way yet, so I&#x27;m legitimately interested in understanding the various models.<p>I have to wonder if perhaps even in the model you are describing still overlooks the human element. Our voting system is remarkably complicated - everything from fill-in-the-bubble to poke-out-the-hole to align-the-paper-ballot, voting by mail, voting in person, etc. The first part of my inquiry was a deliberate interest in the human interaction in this kind of voting.<p>The second part of my inquiry seems to have been touched upon by several other commenters, regarding the math behind outcomes when this kind of voting is introduced.<p>&gt;This comment is uninformed.<p>Perhaps leave this part out next time - the rest was helpful. You make more friends with kindness.')
