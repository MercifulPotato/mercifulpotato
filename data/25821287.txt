This is different than an em dash that acts like parentheses. Ex: mother-of-the-bride is a single concept, like post-apocalyptic. I couldn’t parse your comment, getting stuck wondering what a “skim-yes” is supposed to be, and wondering if it was similar to a “skim-through.” A space around the dashes or using an em dash would make it much clearer. Cheers.')
