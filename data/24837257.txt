I, too, hate discord and everything it stands for. Your points are very valid indeed, but I think the main reason I hate it is because it really showed me that I am in the grave minority when it comes to caring about the issues you listed. Nearly* all people I know don&#x27;t give a fuck: They don&#x27;t give a fuck that it&#x27;s a web browser with web widgets and humongous spacing everywhere. They don&#x27;t care that it cannot be customized. They don&#x27;t care about who runs the whole operation. They don&#x27;t care where the money comes from. They don&#x27;t care that I (I know, I know) have to fill out about 15 captchas every time I want to interact with the thing. They don&#x27;t care that other clients are forbidden and a bannable offense.<p>Every time someone invites me to discord, it shows me that the world indeed couldn&#x27;t care less about the values that are central to me when evaluating software. But I wouldn&#x27;t expect that from the gaming community anyways, those guys never cared. The true pain comes when I find some free software project where all developement talk is on discord. Because it shows me that even the people I&#x27;d expect to care at least a tiny little bit about all those points, are okay with this.<p>I also want to add that I want to punch an executive every time someone calls his discord space a &quot;server&quot;. It&#x27;s not a server. It seems that fight is lost as well. Discord servers are what people think of now when the word server is used, and this change of meaning will not be reversed.<p>*Except my two best friends, who continue using a self hosted teamspeak&#x2F;mumble with me and of whom one shares my grief about the whole discord situation.')
