The world economy would collapse if countries stopped allowing Chinese goods into their economies.  We can&#x27;t just retool overnight.<p>The reason they get away with their concentration camps is precisely for this reason.  There is very little leverage the rest of us have to stop them.<p>The best the world can do is slowly twist the screws until they are less powerful.  This is already happening.  You can see some manufacturing is already moving out of China into other parts of Asia because the US is making small but steady changes on how goods from China can be consumed.  This is the only option right now unfortunately.')
