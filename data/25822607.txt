These were various brands and odd shapes when LED bulbs were still immature.<p>Current &quot;Feit Electric&quot; bulbs - outfitted the house with them top to bottom when they were about 30 cents&#x2F;bulb due to a government rebate + deep discount at Lowes, actually seem to live up to expectations.  I&#x27;m not sure when I&#x27;ve last replaced one, and a big box of them bought later for spares (at about $1&#x2F;bulb) is so far mostly unused.<p>The other thing is that even crappy LEDs with low efficiency and reliability save so much electricity that you come out ahead, compared to a 1000h incandescent, even if they do fail after 1000h as well.  Maybe not better for the environment, but microeconomically OK.')
