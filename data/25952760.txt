And when I tune to a different station, it&#x27;s a touchscreen with UP and DN buttons that I have to tap on to tune Â±0.2 MHz, and it takes takes maybe 750ms to lock on to the station. Think about how absurd this is! Compared to my first car made in the early 80s where the radio started as soon as you turned the key, and you had an analog dial that panned through the spectrum instantly with the sound continuously playing.')
