It should say <i>fixed width integer addition</i> instead of simply <i>addition</i> since the latter can either refer to a simple ADD cpu instruction or to the much more complex &#x27;+&#x27; operator in python.<p>However, once you agree on this, the concept of step is clear enough: it is an ADD instruction (or LOAD+ADD+STORE if you wish, still constant time for fixed width types). Obviously, it does not mean that every occurrence of &#x27;+&#x27; in python can be computed in constant time.')
