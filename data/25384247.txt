You can download this PWA in the background too once app has installed if you are afraid you might not be able to do this on demand. I don&#x27;t see why not use PWA? The performance implications in this case are minimal imo. And you have all the other fully fledged native features since your app is combination of both. Main arguments against PWA is that iOS doesn&#x27;t support that well, but hell in this case you skip ALL problems with PWA since you have full capabilities already thanks to being generally native and you are downloading it from AppStore anyway.<p>In this case it could easily be reused within both Android and iOS without having to create duplicate business logic which I think already is a nightmare.<p>Airports logic I think should still be something that is defined using JSON&#x2F;XML or w&#x2F;e and algorithms should handle  parsing that.<p>Or come on, there must be a way to get airports logic in an easier way. Does user have to update the app every-time when there&#x27;s some minor airport update?')
