This lets you package releases in a simple way by just tagging the repo. That tag&#x2F;release gives you the exact version of all the components that you need.<p>But CI becomes substantially more complicated. You have to figure out with every commit what actually changed and based on that change what needs to be tested and built. You donâ€™t want to run a build of all components if you only changed a small piece of one component.')
