Item(by='mkl', descendants=None, kids=[25621470], score=None, time=1609675894, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25621291, text='I literally always have a Jupyter QtConsole open with one tab having Sympy loaded, and every single letter variable defined as a symbolic variable, and another tab with numpy; this is my constant daily-use calculator.  In that context, it really is just &quot;plot(sin(x))&quot;.  It&#x27;s not really anything more than having a terminal open with Gnuplot running, and no less elegant.<p>Edit: plus, if I&#x27;m plotting with Sympy it&#x27;s almost certainly something I&#x27;ve calculated symbolically with Sympy, so everything is defined and ready, and it&#x27;s much more elegant than switching to a separate program.  For a one-off &quot;what does function look like?&quot; question, both these tools are far too clunky, and I&#x27;d use Desmos or GeoGebra.')
