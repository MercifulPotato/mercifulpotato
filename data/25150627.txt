But not for a website I currently use. I switched off those old emails and I am currently only using aliases (I know it&#x27;s not very helpful without a list of websites I use).<p>The other thing I do is that I monitor failed smtp connection attempts to my mail server, particularly when they use one of these unique email aliases. That gives me advanced notice that the website has been breached, and I have quite a few that are not on HIBP&#x27;s radar.')
