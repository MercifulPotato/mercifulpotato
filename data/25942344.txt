Cars should be designed with an eye towards how they perform in an emergency. There is a reasonable case that Tesla didn&#x27;t do that. As an owner of a Model 3 now, it is concerning to me how I would get out of the car if the electrics fail as exiting requires a button press controlled by a computer.<p>Most people don&#x27;t have a hammer &#x2F; seat belt cutter. It is not a required piece of equipment. People aren&#x27;t trained in its use. There is no expectation that a standard driver (at least in the US) should be able to use this tool. This is Tesla&#x27;s issue, not the drivers.')
