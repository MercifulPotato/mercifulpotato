I believe the prestige and social standing of  physics (and, in part, the academia as a whole) is founded in the truly transformational technological advances -- say, the transistor -- made in the past decades.<p>Problematically, to secure funding today, one is essentially expected to frame every condensed-matter experiment as the next transistor. Not only in grant applications, but increasingly also in the abstract and opening paragraphs of research articles. There&#x27;s a marked contrast with older research articles in physics, which usually go straight to disseminating the results. (Needless to say that I prefer the old style.)<p>As a result, a great deal of funding and attention is allocated towards projects that <i>simultaneously</i> 1) Will not improve the quality of life of anyone, even in the long term. 2) Are &quot;de-risked&quot; to such extent that no new scientific insights can come out of them.')
