For the part to execute the run-script I&#x27;m currently going with a github-action itself:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;marketplace&#x2F;actions&#x2F;run-travis-yml" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;marketplace&#x2F;actions&#x2F;run-travis-yml</a><p>it&#x27;s based on the original travis-build so that utils like &quot;travis_retry&quot; are still available.<p>each command in the asserted stages (e.g. before_install, install) directly breaks the build while the script runs through and gives the fail exit at the end (while showing the commands run and their result as on travis, asserted stages are with folding).<p>might be a good addition to the online converter.<p>the other parts of the workflow (vm setup, caches, services, matrix etc.) I find hard to port automatically. this needs much more insight and often is specific to the languages. and then it&#x27;s &quot;relatively easy&quot;.<p>but an automatic mapping from the many languages travis supported looks overwhelming.<p>perhaps better is to actually have the whole travis-build project as a github action (but I&#x27;m not fluent with ruby).')
