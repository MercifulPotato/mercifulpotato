If facebook existed 100 years ago, you could say the same thing as now, just the &#x27;good&#x27; and the &#x27;bad&#x27; groups would be a lot different.<p>And you don&#x27;t have to wait a 100 years, in my country, if we overly applied the same rules, at the start of the first covid wave, facebook would censor all the science-deniers, and crazy preppers for using masks (because &quot;masks don&#x27;t help&quot; - our doctors, depending on where you live, probably yours too). Then one random saturday, our government decided you need a mask and gloves to enter any indoor public place (stores,...), and facebook would censor the anti-mask people.<p>We also live in a culture, where we have a few &quot;protected groups&quot;, where we censor anything (even jokes) about that (eg. rape jokes), but even those rules, we apply very arbitrarily.... in movies, rape bad, rape jokes bad, unless the person raped is a man, then it&#x27;s not a crime&#x2F;thriller, but a &quot;satirical erotic romantic comedy&quot; ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;40_Days_and_40_Nights" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;40_Days_and_40_Nights</a> ). Again, rape jokes are censorship worthy, unless you change one tiny variable, and that makes it all ok. Today atleast.')
