By contrast, in the US, US National Science Foundation (NSF) is the grant-giving agency for most basic science&#x2F;math research in the US, except biology which is under a different agency (NIH) (also I think DOE funds some energy-related research)) total budget is $8.3 billion per year. So if these assumptions are correct, then this initiative alone is over 3.5x the total US NSF budget.<p>This is not completely an apples-to-apples comparison because this is obviously applied rather than basic research.')
