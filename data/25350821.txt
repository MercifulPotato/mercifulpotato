Or is it just legacy cruft in X.509 that we pay for through security vulnerabilities like this? It is in obscure, rarely or never used features that vulnerabilities tend to lurk, since bugs in the more commonly used features get discovered and fixed much faster.<p>If hardly anyone is using EDIPARTYNAME, maybe support for it should just be dropped? Reject as invalid every certificate containing it? Release a new streamlined version of X.509 with the legacy cruft removed or deprecated?')
