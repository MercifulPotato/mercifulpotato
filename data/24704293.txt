It is also awful from a customer perspective and I care about that a lot. I used to do most of my shopping on Amazon. Now the ux of it all sucks out loud. I’ll search for a product and the first two results are ads for Chinese knockoffs. They’re constantly trying to sell me shit instead of the thing they have, that I want. It’s like walking around a store with a shopping list, but I have to constantly turn down offers to get what I need.<p>It’s really bad.')
