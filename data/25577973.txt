So yes, we can piss off all the new users by reclaiming the right of ways (technically).  But there&#x27;s still a huge cost in recreating what was torn up to make it useful for a different purpose.  My own opinion is that between the &quot;piss off new users&quot; and &quot;cost of rebuilding&quot;, these right of ways will stay &quot;rails to trails&quot; forever.  Which, again, isn&#x27;t a bad thing.')
