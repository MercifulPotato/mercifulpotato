Bit strange to claim &quot;there is no database&quot; and then add &quot;GitHub issues is the database&quot;, maybe add &quot;there is no traditional RDMS&#x2F;document database needed&quot; or something similar.<p>You might want to detect infinite loops as well :) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nlsn.cf&#x2F;6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nlsn.cf&#x2F;6</a><p>Last note, the status code seems to be incorrectly set to 404 instead of any of the redirection status code. If you&#x27;re hosting it on GitHub pages, I&#x27;m not sure you can actually control it. If the status code was correctly set + the Location header, I think all browsers would be able to detect the infinite loop automatically and prevent it.')
