Both the left and the &gt;right in the US have paramilitaries (antifa, proud boys). Both the left and the right in the US have &gt;enemies lists, and have effective propaganda wings that eviscerate opponents and call basic and &gt;decent democratic norms into question (free speech, elections). Both sides use identity and &gt;demographics to sow division and resentment between groups.<p>bOtH sIdEs ArE tHe SaMe!!!!!111<p>No, they&#x27;re not. And I know I&#x27;ll get downvoted for this.<p>Trying to equate the Proud Boys, which is definite example of an organized right wing paramilitary group with antifa which is a loosely defined movement is a false equivalency.<p>The &quot;left&quot; is not trying question voting.  Rather, we&#x27;ve tried to make voting more accessible to all and ensure all votes are counted. Eviscerating free speech? Is that the made up &quot;cancel culture&quot;?  You mean driving hateful and intolerant messages off social media? Alex Jones et. al made have been deplatformed, but as far as I know, he still has a media presence on Fox News, OAN, etc.  Identity politics? You mean BLM? Or maybe the desire to make it so our politicians are more diverse as opposed to overwhelming represent a single demographic?<p>Both side are the same, calls for centrism, etc. are nothing more than an attempt to absolve oneself of your responsibility to stay informed and be active in civic life.  It&#x27;s an attempt to excuse yourself from voting, etc.  No, both sides are demonstrably not the same.')
