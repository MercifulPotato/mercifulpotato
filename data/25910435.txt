There was no measurable difference in health outcomes (in fact, those provided housing died at higher rates). I am not convinced the housing first is as great as its proponents claim it is, though it does have an intuitive appeal (by definition, itâ€™s the solution to homelessness! But what if homelessness is a symptom, not the disease?).')
