Item(by='i_am_new_here', descendants=None, kids=[25385663], score=None, time=1607677121, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25381636, text='I am an AirBnB host myself since about 5 years and with 3 units today and there is a rating of your guest at the end, which basically prevents all of this. You can also just allow guest with (good) ratings to book your apartment (at all). So <i>you</i> have quite a good control over this. People are not dumb and will try to get value out of their investment (also guests - their investment is the booking of the accommodation), but I think your anecdote is not representational. Your home might be cheap and in a &quot;bad&quot; neighborhood, where you are forced to rent out to &quot;problematic&quot; people, since only those are interested to stay there. Though initially you probably bought the house cheaply and now -maybe- conveniently ignore this and complain about the problems in the neighborhood.<p>I am not saying that there are no problems. But it&#x27;s kind of possible to get them under control and also have a good value proposition as a host. If you don&#x27;t have this, then switch back to classical long-term renting. If you keep renting (rather short term) via AirBnB, then the value proposition for you (the host) must also be good enough considering all factors. It kind of does not make sense to be an AirBnB host and be unsatisfied - only temporarily.')
