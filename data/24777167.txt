Your CI should handle reliability (and if not, you have a bigger problem) and you&#x27;re more likely to patch a vulnerability than to introduce a new one and it&#x27;s unlikely that by the time a PR hits production that the version is compromised.<p>I understand that updating cuts both ways when it comes to security, but I agree with Matt Tait&#x27;s ultimate conclusion when he spoke on this issue a few years ago: For most medium size and smaller companies constantly updating is safer than delaying. He had real world data and graphs of compromise windows, etc. Short answer was that attackers are more time motivated than defenders.')
