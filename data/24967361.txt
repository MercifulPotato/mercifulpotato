Each time I was going with OVH, and each time the CEO was trying to push for moving to AWS instead, despite having no clue what the difference may be.<p>Their problem was that &quot;startups are supposed to use AWS&quot;. They were having impostor syndrome. One would come to tell me every month or so how &quot;all his friends use AWS, and they say it&#x27;s very good&quot;. An other one was afraid what possible investors may say when he tells them we&#x27;re not on AWS.<p>If people will pay overpriced services to be with the cool kids, why bother competing on price?')
