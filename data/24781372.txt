Nicely done.<p>There&#x27;s a droll quote from a political to the effect &quot;I have to find out where my voters are going, so that I can lead them.&quot;<p>As you know, waterdowned legislation is sometimes passed to blunt or diffuse a competitor&#x27;s initiative. And the rest of Seattle absolutely does not want Sawant&#x27;s name in headlines.<p>Other Councilmembers may not like Sawant, but they absolutely respect her as a politician, especially noting that she does a great job representing her constituents. (Source: served on local Dems e-board, have had many sidebar convos.)<p>For my part, I&#x27;m really uncomfortable with the notion of backseat drivers. I expect the person I vote for to do the work. But given her successes, I need to reassess Sawant&#x27;s decision making process. Thanks for nudging me.')
