This person is <i>not</i> complaining about  differences in programming syntax across languages at all. He is making a very specific complaint about how PL Notation (i.e metasyntax not syntax) in academic literature isn&#x27;t standardized. This has nothing to do with the vagaries of Perl vs Lisp and everything to do with how PL white papers are written.')
