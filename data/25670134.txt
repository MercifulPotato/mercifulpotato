Item(by='kd5bjo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610021510, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25669644, text='From what I can tell, the problem is that those first three paragraphs are a perfectly good introduction to a different article.  Larson is obviously going to be a main character in this story, but there are strong signals that the article won&#x27;t be primarily <i>about</i> Larson.  Instead, it seems to be building up to a story about how the show went wrong and what the wider effects were.  In particular, it&#x27;s promising themes of themes of shock and incredulity.<p>The next four paragraphs deliver none of this, opting instead to make a study of Larson&#x27;s character.  The show itself, another major character, doesn&#x27;t makes an appearance again until paragraph 8.  The first hint at the foreshadowed themes doesn&#x27;t show up until the end of paragraph 10, where &quot;Bob Edwards was uneasy about Larson.&quot; and then not again until paragraph 14, where &quot;Host Peter Tomarken became increasingly flabbergasted...&quot;<p>From that point on, the article seems to match the tone of the introduction.  The correct fix is probably to rework the introduction to include some of the themes present in the first half of the article.  Maybe focus on themes of escalation, as the whole article is built as a slow, constant build-up of intensity.')
