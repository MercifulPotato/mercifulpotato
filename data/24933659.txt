It&#x27;s going against the herd and criticizing someone like Joe Biden that will get you thrown out of the club.<p>So, if it&#x27;s a high-profile investigative piece on a senior trump admin official, everyone will applaud you. But as soon as you start investigating the Biden family or, on the other hand, write something positive about Trump &amp; Co, then you&#x27;ll quickly find yourself out of the club.')
