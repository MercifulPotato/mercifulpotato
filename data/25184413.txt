I just want to be the first to say that given the huge potential impact, &quot;potential&quot; is bad enough.<p>When dealing with probabilities there are two measures that need to be considered independently: probability and effect. Traditional statistics multiplies them into &quot;expected utility&quot; and works just with the aggregated value. But that&#x27;s tricky, because effect is not a continuous function. Imagine a pebble falling on your head plotted based on its weight - there&#x27;ll be sharp discontinuities at &quot;hurts&quot;, &quot;commotion&quot; and &quot;death&quot;.<p>At society&#x27;s level there are also similar discontinuities. Something that may cause tens of million of cases of cancer over time should be in a separate category from a medicine that may suddenly kill a few hundred people, even though the latter has a bigger emotional impact.')
