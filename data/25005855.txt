But why explicitly do you think they&#x27;re anti-internet and anti-privacy? To me it seems like being pro-internet and pro-privacy aligns both with their general incentives and their monetary incentives.<p>I genuinely think they&#x27;re a net positive for and supporter of Tor users. Before, site owners and security providers who faced issues with abusive&#x2F;malicious traffic behind Tor connections (spam, illicit content, security scanning, password struffing) nearly always resorted to outright blocking all Tor exit node IPs, because they had no other feasible option. I&#x27;ve been in that position. Cloudflare at least provides any site owner an ability to easily allow the traffic; just with a fairly quick occasional bot check.<p>Additionally, as of 2018 they now have an &quot;Onion Routing&quot; option which site owners can enable, which results in Tor users being able to access your site 100% through the Tor network. As a result, Tor users no longer experience any captchas, load your site faster, and never have to touch the clearnet.<p>&gt;But their web app security system is overly strict and bad for the internet IMO.<p>Their WAF seems to have a pretty low false positive rate, compared to others I&#x27;ve seen. (Though the flipside of that is it also has a pretty high false negative rate and isn&#x27;t very helpful against a dedicated non-automated attacker, like many other WAFs.)<p>&gt;But it doesnâ€™t always get much traction on here because both the founder and employees of cloudflare are quite popular users on HN.<p>They do post a lot here, but I doubt that&#x27;s really responsible for defensive responses from other HN users. The most common criticism I see here (presenting a captcha for people using Tor, which site owners can now disable) makes me think the majority of people making the criticism have never run large websites or worked infosec for any organization with a large website.<p>Tor is of course not a threat itself, but anecdotally I&#x27;d estimate 90 - 95% of traffic that the average website owner receives from Tor is highly abusive&#x2F;malicious, and Cloudflare empirically estimated 94% as of 2016 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cloudflare.com&#x2F;the-trouble-with-tor&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cloudflare.com&#x2F;the-trouble-with-tor&#x2F;</a>). And anecdotally, not only is a high percentage of Tor traffic malicious, in many cases a significant percentage of all malicious traffic is Tor traffic. Naturally, due to Tor by design making it impossible to distinguish the ~94% connections from the ~6%, it&#x27;s extremely difficult to mitigate this without just blocking 100% of Tor traffic. This is obviously not Tor or anyone&#x27;s fault; it&#x27;s just a practical reality for website owners. This sort of situation will always be the case for any kind of robust privacy-protecting application.<p>Cloudflare is possibly the first free service that actually enables anyone to easily allow normal traffic from Tor without much increase in security&#x2F;abuse risk. They seem explicitly pro-Tor, especially with the explicit Onion Routing feature that lets Tor users access your site 100% through the Tor network without ever experiencing captchas, and statements like in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cloudflare.com&#x2F;the-trouble-with-tor&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cloudflare.com&#x2F;the-trouble-with-tor&#x2F;</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cloudflare.com&#x2F;cloudflare-onion-service&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cloudflare.com&#x2F;cloudflare-onion-service&#x2F;</a><p>One may certainly have lots of other justified, legitimate concerns regarding the company and their disproportionate control of a huge chunk of the internet and web, but I&#x27;m not sure how someone could read those, see how the traffic is handled in practice, and conclude they&#x27;re anti-Tor or a dangerous threat to Tor.')
