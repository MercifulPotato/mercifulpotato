But that&#x27;s the best we ever had.<p>High-end Android phones have 120+ ms latecy. That&#x27;s easily noticeable and actually annoying (at least to me).<p>My personal pet peeve is the latency of input when i&#x27;m starting new applications in KDE. E.g. I&#x27;ll start a new terminal with Super+Enter, followed by a Super+Right Arrow in order to tile it to the right. But the latency is big enough, that often it&#x27;s not the terminal that ends up tiled, but the application that had focus earlier, e.g. a web browser. It&#x27;s really annoying.<p>I also don&#x27;t understand how still in 2020 when I move a window with the mouse, the window can&#x27;t keep up with the mouse.<p>30ms input lag is what we should work towards. But that&#x27;s not what we have today. Today is actually crap.')
