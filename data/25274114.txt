Is the approval process so different and so much more efficient than the one in the EU or USA? Was it extremely rushed to make sure to get doses before they have to compete with other countries for limited supply? I&#x27;m pretty curious now. Let&#x27;s hope for the best, i.e. a good vaccine, a good process and no trust problems, the latter because at least it feels rushed.')
