Before they removed the charging brick - I would end up with 3 charging bricks laying around my house. Now I can purchase 1 charging brick and use it to charge all of my phones. Also nothing prevents me from using my older charging cable with my older brick as well, so I am not sure why people can&#x27;t understand that it is in fact reducing e-waste compared to if they shipped charging bricks with every iphone.')
