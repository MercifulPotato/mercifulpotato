It is couple orders of magnitude cheaper than in some other places. Or compare to just road, not tunnel, building:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rbth.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2010&#x2F;10&#x2F;20&#x2F;what_drives_russias_astronomical_road_costs05041.html#:~:text=However%2C%20the%20Russian%20costs%20of,at%20the%20Russian%20Transport%20Ministry" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rbth.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2010&#x2F;10&#x2F;20&#x2F;what_drives_russias...</a>.<p>&quot;However, the Russian costs of road building are among the highest in Europe, with each mile of road costing $10.5 million.&quot;<p>and the 20km Crimean Bridge cost almost $4B.
