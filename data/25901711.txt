Afaik the implementation of malloc_in_gc comes down to<p><pre><code>    result_address = first_free_address;\n    first_free_address += requested_bytes;\n    return result_address;\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s the actual garbage collection that might be expensive, but since that process deals with the fragmentation, there is no need to keep a data structure with available blocks of memory around.<p>That&#x27;s also the reason why, depending on the patterns of memory usage, a GC can be faster than malloc+free.')
