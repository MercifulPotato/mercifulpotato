No type enforcement, no requirement for class&#x2F;object declarations, circular imports&#x2F;dependencies allowed, threading&#x2F;gevent&#x2F;async messes, variable&#x2F;class scope weakly enforced<p>Python is great for a lot of things, but the language is not a beacon of well-managed code. Good Python programmers write nice, easy-to-follow code, just as good Excel builders create very nice, easy-to-follow spreadsheets.')
