You can use a math trick to make them to go through specified points, and to early statisticians &amp; data analysts, this seemed like a good way to model a nonlinear trend based on a set of sample points. But that trick doesn&#x27;t make polynomials <i>tame</i>. And it gets worse the more points you need to interpolate - you have to add a degree to the polynomial every time you want to go through another point. Each new degree makes the polynomial wilder and wilder outside of the points you&#x27;re interpolating.<p>We later discovered that the tame functions that usually work well for extrapolating from a sample are things called splines.')
