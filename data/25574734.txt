Many proof-of-concept delivery drones I&#x27;ve seen are of this kind.<p>re: size, you can definitely make smaller drones. There&#x27;s plenty of cute and surprisingly flyable drones out there that are less than 6 cm in diameter, some even with cameras. However, there&#x27;s a few drawbacks at smaller sizes:<p>- Less power. They can fly fine indoors, but they&#x27;ll be swept away by any strong winds.\n- Less space for electronics&#x2F;camera and batteries, so image quality and flight time will suffer.')
