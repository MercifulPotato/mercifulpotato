Everyone is focussing on the curtailing of free uploads for high resolution images. But I don&#x27;t think anyone yet has mentioned what is far more concerning for me; the fact that Google&#x27;a announcement also says that if your account is inactive for two years, they MAY [my emphasis] delete your data:<p><pre><code>  &gt;What happens when you&#x27;re inactive\n  When you have been inactive in a product for 2 years, we may delete all content for that product. But before we do that, we will:\n\n  Give you notice using email and notifications within the Google products. We will contact you at least three months before content is eligible for deletion. \n  Give you the opportunity to avoid deletion (by becoming active in the product)\n  Give you the opportunity to download your content from our services.\n  \n  Important: As an example, if you&#x27;re inactive for 2 years in Photos, but still active in Drive and Gmail, we will only delete Google Photos content. Content in Gmail and Google Drive (including Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drawings, Forms and Jamboard files) will not be deleted if you are active in those products.  \n</code></pre>\nThat is pretty concerning for anyone who believed that, in the event of their death, their Google Photos archive would still be around for their surviving friends and family to enjoy.')
