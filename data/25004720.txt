We use a hash of entirely arbitrary data you want a cache item to invalidate on when that data changes.<p>For example, a cached snippet of HTML for a related products section should invalidate if the product IDs change, so you hash the Item ID with the product IDs and bam, you got a cache key that will let you know when you need to reprocess that snippet.<p>Put that bad boy as a child of another snippet and you can cache the whole lot. It&#x27;s cache keys all the way down!<p>Caveat: not worth the engineering effort for simple systems, just use an FPC and call it a day.')
