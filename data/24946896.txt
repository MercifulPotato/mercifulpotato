Item(by='xab31', descendants=None, kids=[24946976], score=None, time=1604091991, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24946499, text='My gut reaction if I were Jeremy would be to say that &quot;This is absolutely absurd; there is no way that claiming &#x27;X&#x27;s opinion is wrong&#x27; is in itself a CoC violation, and if it somehow is, then the CoC is ridiculous. The fact that such an accusation was even able to be <i>made</i> under the CoC and not immediately dismissed makes CoCs look ridiculous. Why are you wasting everyone&#x27;s time?&quot;<p>He goes a very, very different route. I think that different route gave him a better outcome. I think it is worth thinking about why that is. We are not talking about an accusation of sexual harassment or assault here, we are talking about an almost textbook case of how CoC accusations can be overextended to absurdity. Yet he chooses to <i>defend</i> CoCs.<p>One possible explanation of this is that he is trying to draw a distinction between things that should be &quot;legitimate&quot; CoC violations, and his case. Another possible explanation is that he is trying to say that &quot;Look, I strongly believe that &lt;murder should be illegal&gt;, really strongly. That makes me one of the good guys. Would a good guy commit murder?&quot; The latter take is more cynical, but I think it would be more effective than my gut reaction.')
