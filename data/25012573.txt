[...] “They have very rigid ideals in terms of win-lose,” he continues. “Their expectations of success are through the roof, and when their reality doesn’t match up with their expectations, it leads to burnout—they leave no room for error or failure at all in their formula.” [...] Yet ask Cass why his clients are burning out, and his answer isn’t any different for a banker than it would be for a public-school teacher; there’s a gulf between what they expected from their jobs and what they got. “I can’t tell you,” he says, “how many people come into my office and ask, ‘How come I have this money and I can’t find happiness?’ ” So what does he tell them? “That happiness equals reality divided by expectations.”<p>-- Jennifer Senior, &quot;Can’t Get No Satisfaction&quot;, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nymag.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;features&#x2F;24757&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nymag.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;features&#x2F;24757&#x2F;</a>')
