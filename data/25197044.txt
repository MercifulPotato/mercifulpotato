Don&#x27;t have children. Switch to a vegetarian or vegan diet. Use public transport or bikes &#x2F; walking rather than petrol cars. Use solar panels to offset your electricity consumption. Improve the thermal efficiency of your home to reduce energy usage. Switch to &quot;green&quot; energy suppliers. Lobby the companies you use to become more environmentally friendly. Ask your pension provider whether they have a low&#x2F;no carbon plan - if so, switch your investments to it. Plant a small garden that you can take care of. Encourage others to do the same.<p>Those are all things I&#x27;ve done. Some may be easier or not depending where in the world you are, and your financial means.')
