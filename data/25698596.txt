Reading some of Trump&#x27;s comments, it seems like what he&#x27;s been pushing for isn&#x27;t so much <i>revoking</i> 230 entirely, but rather mandating that you only get to keep section 230 protections if content moderation is applied &quot;neutrally&quot; (which in his mind means right-leaning content isn&#x27;t moderated as heavily anymore).<p>The problem with this, IMHO, in today&#x27;s polarized world is who judges whether moderation is balanced? Whichever party currently runs the executive branch? A commission whose members are squabbled over like the SCOTUS? Etc. Similar to trying to bring back the FCC &quot;fairness doctrine,&quot; it feels unrealistic at best... or a backslide into government censorship at worst.')
