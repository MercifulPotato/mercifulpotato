While there is no such <i>express</i> condition in the Constitution, and pardons have been issued in such circumstances (including the famous Nixon pardon), none of them have been challenged (such as by a later attempt to prosecute despite the pardon) in a way which caused a court to rule on their effect, and there are cases where the question of the Constitutionality of pre-conviction pardons has been raised, though those cases were resolved on other grounds. So it should probably be acknowledged that the claim that a pardon requires trial and conviction <i>is</i> an active legal theory, though one without positive support in case law, and one which the actual practical use of pardons in the US has not been consistent with to this point.')
