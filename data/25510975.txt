I am not aware of who originated this idea, but I heard it from Christoph Adami (a researcher in evolutionary information theory). I also recall someone at a conference proposing the term &quot;Turium,&quot; for &quot;Turing-complete phase of matter.&quot;<p>Earth just happens to have an environment that contains a large abundance of this phase of matter, much like how stars are full of plasma etc.')
