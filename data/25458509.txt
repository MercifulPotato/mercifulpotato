There is no technique or dexterity required with the soldering iron itself.\nI would also recommend that you think of solder wire as a 2in1.\nThe flux core in the solder wire is helpful, but not the endgame. \nUse extra flux from a flux pen or flux bottle that is compatible with the flux core in the solder wire.\nFor example: You can put a glob of solder on the tip of your soldering iron and just bring it in to the surface or joint.\nIf you have pre-applied flux on a clean surface or joint, the liquid solder will wick off the soldering iron and onto the surface by itself. Perfect every time. (Surface tension, capillary action.)<p>For manual hand soldering, the flux management is the only complicated part.\nWhat flux to use? Do you have to clean it? How to clean it? Saponifiers, or IPA good enough? Compatible with the flux in the solder wire?\nYou must be sure to reach the activation temperature of all the flux on the board or it can corrode metals over time.\n&quot;No Clean&quot; fluxes are really hard to clean without special saponifiers, I would avoid these fluxes.\nIs the flux residue on the board still inert after it gets wet by accident or at high humidity?\nThere are also problems with high frequency circuits and No Cleans.\nWater soluble fluxes require excellent process control. Even tiny defects in the PCB can cause failures if you use water soluble flux.\nRead the datasheets and recommendations from the flux manufacturer.<p>Some fluxes are more easy going:\nFor you Americans I would recommend Kester 186 Flux-Pen and Kester 285 Sn63Pb37 RMA Flux-Cored Wire.\nDo not use more flux than necessary, do not make a mess.\nUse eye protection for this flux from Kester!<p>Soldering gets even more interesting with gold embrittlement (gold plating thickness and migration to the center of the IMC), tin whiskers, silver whiskers, etc.\nThere is much more to all of this if you want really high reliability.\nI went deep down this rabbit hole once. Not a professional soldering guy. Just obsessive compulsive about high reliability design.\nThis is enough text for a post on HN :)')
