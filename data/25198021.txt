Things go wrong and then they go right and then they go wrong in an endless cycle. It&#x27;s like an engine that breaks down every now and then. You can fix it and you should.<p>&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take a galaxy brain super genius to figure out that an economic system that relies on infinite growth doesn&#x27;t exactly pan out in the long run<p>Capitalism doesn&#x27;t rely on infinite growth. It drives growth by rewarding increased productivity and innovation. However, since it does so through monetary rewards it is entirely possible that government policies make it easier to acquire money through non innovative or unproductive means. QE and low interest rates are a pretty good example of this. That money can be used to acquire competitors or simply stay alive for much longer.')
