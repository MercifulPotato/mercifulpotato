FastAPI is really productive in all the areas you&#x27;d normally reach for Flask. I used SQLAlachemy as an ORM with Postgres and PostGIS. I had to write a bit of custom serialization stuff with Shapely to fit PostGIS in but otherwise everything was pretty much taken care of with Pydantic. It&#x27;s a good level of magic&#x2F;abstraction in that you can rip pieces out easily and replace them if you need to, but if you just follow the beaten path everything works. OpenAPI spec and docs is also really nice to have built-in.')
