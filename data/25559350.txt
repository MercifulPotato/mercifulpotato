I&#x27;ve only listened to about 12 episodes of philosophy and science. It is hosted by Melvyn Bragg. The guests are a selection of academics with deep subject matter expertise.  Bragg is a seasoned radio broadcaster and is brilliant at moderating the programme.  I agree with this description Bragg&#x27;s hosting by an English journalist:<p><i>&quot;Bragg gives short shrift to pretension of any kind, while remaining stalwart in his search for knowledge. His methodology in In Our Time is... not unlike that of a man throwing a stick for a dog: he chucks his questions ahead, and if the chosen academic fails to bring it right back, he chides them. He retains enough of his bluff Cumbrian origins not to be taken in by gambolling and tweedy high spirits.&quot;</i><p>As a sampling, listen to this episode[2], <i>Photosynthesis</i>.  (I was pleasantly surprised to hear Nick Lane, a molecular biologist and an <i>excellent</i> science writer.)<p>Another episode (from 2016) I recently heard, and enjoyed, was the <i>Epic of Gilgamesh</i>[3].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;programmes&#x2F;b006qykl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;programmes&#x2F;b006qykl</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;programmes&#x2F;b0435jyv" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;programmes&#x2F;b0435jyv</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;programmes&#x2F;b080wbrq" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;programmes&#x2F;b080wbrq</a>')
