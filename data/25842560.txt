You are not able to come here on a visitor&#x27;s visa anymore.  However, as another poster mentioned -- it&#x27;s relatively easy to apply to get a Gold Card (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taiwangoldcard.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taiwangoldcard.com&#x2F;</a>).  As long as you can document income above about $67k USD&#x2F;year (the actual requirement is to be above $160k TWD &#x2F; month), you should be able to get it.  The process is normally supposed to take about 30 days... but since there has been so much interest in the program over the past year, I believe the process is now taking 45 ~ 60 days.<p>* If you have a spouse &#x2F; children that you want to bring with you, the process will take even longer -- you can only apply for your spouse&#x2F;kids resident visas <i>after</i> you get the Gold Card.  This process usually takes an additional 2 or so weeks.<p>* Everyone who comes in is required to undergo a 21-day quarantine restriction.  It&#x27;s a 14-day strict quarantine (where they monitor you and call you at least once a day), and then a 7-day &quot;self&quot; quarantine after that.  (Although there are rumors that they may increase the restrictions on the 7-day period)<p>* For the specific question about race -- if you are African &#x2F; African-American, IMO you likely wouldn&#x27;t see much in terms of direct, hostile racism.  OTOH, I would imagine that you <i>would</i> likely encounter racialism -- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.huffpost.com&#x2F;entry&#x2F;racism-and-racialism-are-_b_6368010" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.huffpost.com&#x2F;entry&#x2F;racism-and-racialism-are-_b_6...</a> is a good article distinguishing it.<p>There&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> more I could post about the experience about coming out here and what life is like once you&#x27;re here (especially as a software dev &#x2F; digital nomad) -- but in the interest of brevity, I&#x27;ll stop for now.  But if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me.')
