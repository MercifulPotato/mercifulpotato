The paper doesn&#x27;t critique Google. It critiques the current focus of AI research of building bigger and bigger models. Google is one of the leaders in building those big models. So what? They also invest in research to make smaller models that perform equally well. They have a huge incentive - those big models are very expensive.  I don&#x27;t think anyone at Google really care if the paper is published. I&#x27;m pretty sure it will get published sooner or later. The authors could&#x27;ve addressed the reviewers&#x27; comments pretty quickly and then re-submit to another conference. The whole thing blew out of proportion. She picked the wrong battle. Should&#x27;ve bitten the bullet.')
