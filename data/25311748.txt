Sure, the math was beyond me but determinism wasn’t actually ruled out!<p>Sharing this on various forums was met with outright hostility.  The usual schlock like Bell’s Inequality “proving” that hidden variable theories are impossible, etc.<p>Bohm was definitely not well known outside of experts back then.<p>Things hav improved in the last decade, but I wonder how far we’ve setback physics by being so dismissive?<p>i.e., the failure of the scientific method is us.')
