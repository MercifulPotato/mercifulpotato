This is an article on Vox, not the BBC.<p>&gt; In the UK “Asian” definitely includes people from the Indian sub-continent.<p>It is my understanding that the UK term isn&#x27;t more inclusive, it just refers to subcontinentals <i>instead</i> of orientals, since for historical reasons that&#x27;s who&#x27;s present in England.<p>&gt; Also your claims about genetic similarities and differences between races will need some supporting evidence as they sounds very much like personal opinion.<p>Don&#x27;t be ridiculous. Yes, Indians are much more closely related to whites than Asians are. You don&#x27;t need to support basic well-known facts.<p>Recall that Indians were usually &quot;white&quot; under US law (there are some exceptions) until pressure from Indian activists in the Nixon administration got them reclassified.')
