There is more than one &quot;code&quot; schema, with different lifecycles too.<p>There are plenty of interesting problems with it. I would prefer to completely separate code from data if it wouldn&#x27;t impact elsewhere. As it is, separating them would severely harm us, so it&#x27;s kept this way. It brings a lot of productivity, but we have a very small team working on it, and completely separated procedures for them.')
