This means that get a better view (things on the ground aren&#x27;t too small), and the cloud ceiling can be lower.<p>* Manoeuverable and &#x27;fun&#x27; to fly<p>Some disadvantages (limiting myself to the main commercially available pre-built ones, i.e. AutoGyro and Magni):<p>* Slower than a plane (max speed of any is I believe 125 MPH)<p>* Can only take two people, and often limited luggage space<p>* Haven&#x27;t been around as long (in their modern form), so while they&#x27;re cheaper to buy than a plane, you are limited to new or fairly new.<p>* None are instrument rated, and only one model is night rated (in the UK)<p>* You don&#x27;t really want to fly them in the rain - erodes rotor and propellor')
