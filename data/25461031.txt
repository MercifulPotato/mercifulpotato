Item(by='ogre_codes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608242165, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25460434, text='&gt; We&#x27;d have Linux on the desktop in 2020 if any of those projects had some Torvalds-like figure ranting on a mailing list about why the user is always right, shame on you on redesigning the menubar yet again breaking any UI convention for no real purpose, and no, Canonical&#x2F;Red Hat&#x2F;whoever, we will not accept this patch that undermines the goals of this project.<p>I don&#x27;t think a Torvalds like BDFL would save Linux desktop. With the Linux kernel, there is a massive incentive for everyone to circle their wagons around one kernel. By having a single Linux kernel, it makes it much easier for vendors to create drivers and services against. With the desktop, the incentive to stick with &quot;one&quot; desktop solution drops off quickly.<p>If I want a tabbed window manager and one doesn&#x27;t exist, I create it. This is great for me and the people who want a tabbed window manager, but for the other 95%+ of the population, it&#x27;s essentially worthless. Multiply that effect by thousands of decision points and you have the Linux desktop: An abundance of fairly mediocre to good options with few really great ones.')
