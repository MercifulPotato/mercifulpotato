Item(by='JoelJacobson', descendants=None, kids=[25862774], score=None, time=1611248706, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25860967, text='&gt; Iâ€™m further confused by the purpose of `to_text()` and `from_text()`. Their example shows a string composed of mostly Latin characters being encoded into a string of emoji and back.<p>This is meant to be used if you want to pass some text containing escape characters or perhaps JSON. Note also that the first emoji is a checksum, which might be useful if you want to make sure a user correctly copy&#x2F;pasted a string, as opposed to sending a raw text string (without checksum).')
