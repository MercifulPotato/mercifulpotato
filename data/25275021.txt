This mechanism does not work with higher order functions.<p>You can emulate Rust&#x27;s approach with Java, by creating what is essentially a sum type like Result. You&#x27;d have to enforce that any access to its content must also handle the error case, and I don&#x27;t really know how to do that generally. There are various hacks, like having a bespoke sum type for that particular operation that twrows a particular exception on access to its content. But that gets really old, really fast.')
