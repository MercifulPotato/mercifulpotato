(Well, that doesn&#x27;t work if the registrar doesn&#x27;t offer any DNS service other than submitting NS records to a zone file.) The NS records updated to generic, known values shows that someone who owns that domain intends to use your nameserver, but that someone doesn&#x27;t have to be the one claiming the domain. If two accounts try to claim a domain at the same time, and the NS records have been set, which account do you award the domain to?<p>Also, strict proof may not be necessary, there&#x27;s the Cloudflare&#x2F;Route53 way with a pool of nameservers used for verification.
