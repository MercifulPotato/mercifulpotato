Would definitely like to find a value-adding (rather than reducing) way to cover the costs though. I&#x27;ve been thinking about adding an account system where you can save a couple routes for free and unlimited with a subscription, along with other &quot;premium&quot; features, but haven&#x27;t finalized anything yet. Definitely open to suggestions :-)')
