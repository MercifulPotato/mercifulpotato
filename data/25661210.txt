Item(by='kuroguro', descendants=None, kids=[25661413], score=None, time=1609961262, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25661029, text='That just seems short sighted as the seller&#x27;s account would be tracked down sooner or later. Entering your real details on a receiving account is way too risky.<p>It would be possible to launder with a similar setup - just not with stolen cards but with prepaid cash&#x2F;crypto ones so amazon doesn&#x27;t flag the account for charge-backs. But then there&#x27;s no real need to steal the book author&#x27;s identity. You could just put your own name or a pseudonym on it. For a 1099 to arrive they&#x27;ve clearly entered the stolen SSN somewhere. You&#x27;d want your own SSN there to prove to the IRS that you&#x27;ve made the money... (and then you&#x27;d want to pay the taxes).')
