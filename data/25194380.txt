Item(by='BoorishBears', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606182758, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25192934, text='I&#x27;m dying of laughter because this is exactly the reply I would expect from someone of the school of thought I was representing.<p>But I&#x27;m sorry, that&#x27;s a thing! People ask for a baby in a month, get a baby in a month, sure the baby is not great, but it gets them pretty far. Not everyone has the luxury to say no and walk away. Honestly I find that kind of weird gatekeeping in our profession kind of sad.<p>-<p>The people who &quot;only know how to slap together components&quot; are starting somewhere. I was privileged enough to have access to technology from a young age and tinker to my hearts content so I ended up with a deeper understanding of things. But there are people who started from nothing, didn&#x27;t have the opportunity to even tinker had they had the access, they were working on moving forward in life.<p>Now our field has been democratized to the point people <i>don&#x27;t</i> need to have had those opportunities to do amazing things, we act like that they do is somehow lesser, even though once we swallow our pride, at the end of the day people don&#x27;t care <i>that much</i>.<p>People notice their apps crash, people complain things are slow. But when the chips are on the table, they deal with it very well. The web has gotten slower and slower, and it&#x27;s usage has gone up and up. The apps have gotten buggier and buggier and the amount of utility they provide has never been higher.<p>-<p>Also I thought about pointing out the context is for-profit apps here when talking about people rushing to ship hastily slapped together legos but figured anyone having this conversation would realize that.<p>In that context money <i>is</i> everything. No point in shipping a formally verified native app if a competitor takes the entire market with their 1 month baby and no one uses it. (and yes sure you can point out the academic satisfaction of it... but academic satisfaction isn&#x27;t going to pay a mortgage or feed your kids)')
