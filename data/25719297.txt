You&#x27;ve rhetorically zoomed out so far that only the most abstract description of the category of the action is up for discussion. But this is begging the question - there&#x27;s no reason that this must be the case.<p>This rhetorical trick of categorizing all of these as &quot;private companies denying service,&quot; is the same one used by those who opposed anti-discrimination laws. Should an ice-cream store be able to kick out a person pissing on the floor? Should they be able to kick out a black person for being black? In each case, it&#x27;s simply &quot;a private company doing whatever they want.&quot; But, obviously, these two cases are not the same.<p>Personally, I think it&#x27;s quite a different thing to kick people who incite violence off your social media platform than it is to ban sex-workers from using you as a payment processor. And, because they are different actions, with different intent and effects, it is, of course, possible to think &quot;Hey, it&#x27;s good that [x] is happening, but bad that [y] is happening.&quot;')
