Item(by='8fingerlouie', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611312718, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25870402, text='No more than i worry about my operating system or office suite being closed source.<p>But then again, i don&#x27;t put my sensitive information like passwords, ssh&#x2F;pgp keys, tax returns and stuff like that in Resilio. I very rarely need those documents &quot;on the go&quot;. Instead i have working documents, books, notes and more that i need access to, and while i&#x27;d rather not share them with the rest of the world, it would probably not make much difference if it was.<p>Furthermore, i can completely &quot;wall off&quot; Resilio Sync. It runs in a container on my public server, and files i need access to are mounted as NFSv4 shares &quot;outside&quot; the container. Access to the shares is managed through Kerberos.<p>So even if you make it inside the container, you can (probably) wreak havoc with the files on the NFS shares, but those are backed up, and unless you can find a way out of the container, or a bug in NFS, that&#x27;s pretty much it.<p>The container has only the absolute minimum of binaries to allow Resilio to work, so you toolkit is kinda limited, at least when compared to Nextcloud which requies a lot of binaries&#x2F;libraries to work, along with a PHP interpreter.')
