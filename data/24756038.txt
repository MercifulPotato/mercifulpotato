Sure, it&#x27;s good to have a non-zero amount. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that the opposite extreme - having 20x the capacity that you actually use - is the right way to go.<p>If the best place is anywhere in the middle of those two extremes (e.g. to have 5x the capacity), it won&#x27;t be possible to achieve while everything is based on individual private ownership. We&#x27;d have to share, and build the slack capacity into the shared pool of vehicles.')
