Your local board of elections probably has sample ballots that you can take a look at online if you like, and that might clarify some of the confusion.<p>While you can register as a member of one particular party in order to vote in that party&#x27;s primary election, you certainly don&#x27;t have to, and it has nothing to do with how you vote in the general election.  In some states, even if you are &quot;unaffiliated&quot; you can participate in one party&#x27;s primary in that state as well.')
