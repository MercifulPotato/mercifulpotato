Between studies funded by companies and&#x2F;or authors with conflict of interest, unreliable methods (in vitro antioxidants) or cohorts selection issues (grad students that need the money so they lie on selection interviews for experiments or trials)... In those cohort studies, what people eat is highly dependent on their wealth, education, localisation, jobs... And they rarely control for everything (mostly because it is impossible and if they asked people to remember instead of giving them devices they don&#x27;t may not have the money to spend on a carefully designed experiment).')
