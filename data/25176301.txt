Every time I remind myself that GIMP is a worthless heap of garbage.  For a FOSS program to have such design problems for as long as it has shows that the people in charge of the project are overly opinionated about how THEY think a Photoshop clone should be.<p>GIMP can only be a Photoshop clone.  To the extent it is like Photoshop it wins.  It is however nothing like Photoshop.  They go far out of their way to make it not like Photoshop.  Even when every other ANYTHING editing program UX uses the same behaviors, GIMP manages to invent some new totally stupid UX.  And I do not use the S word there lightly.  It&#x27;s almost as if they had a meeting to determine what the worst UX was and picked that one.<p>GIMP is an example of how FOSS can fail and be worse than useless to the rest of the open source community.  We would likely have some sort of FOSS Photoshop clone if GIMP wasn&#x27;t there.  If there was a worldwide vote to end a single FOSS project, I suspect GIMP would be in the top 5 list.')
