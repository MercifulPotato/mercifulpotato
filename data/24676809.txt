It&#x27;s a strange perspective to me. The people I know who are bilingual still prefer one language and use the other primarily to speak to people who don&#x27;t know their primary language.<p>As an example I am Swedish but fluent in English and Dutch. In my family we use a mix of Swedish and Dutch. But I use Swedish exclusively with anyone else who is Swedish unless someone is in the conversation who only knows English. I have both friends and colleagues who don&#x27;t speak Swedish (nor Dutch) and I always speak Dutch with my wife&#x27;s family.<p>In this context it makes little sense that I&#x27;d simply stop using multiple languages, since then I&#x27;d be unable to speak to parts of my family, friends, and coworkers.')
