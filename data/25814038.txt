Science tells us our universe had a definite beginning, the Big Bang, and that this event will not repeat: there will be no Big Crunch, no reboot. SciFi authors prefer to ignore science so they can imagine immortal humans who survive the cycle of infinitely rebooting universes. If we colonize the stars and galaxies we can postpone our death a few trillion trillion years, but eventually the last star will snuff out, the last black hole will evaporate, and there will be no energy left to power the phenomena of intelligence and consciousness, and life shall be no more. The last humans will have to bravely face certain and inevitable death just as our prehistoric ancestors did, and just as you and I must.')
