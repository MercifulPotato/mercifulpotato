Please try again.”<p>It doesn’t matter if the password is valid or invalid.<p>Netflix Twitter account confirms they are working on a fix: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Bridom51NY&#x2F;status&#x2F;1349495994396913665?s=20<p>I guess good to know even a company like Netflix can totally screw up basic login. Will be very interesting if they ever explain what went wrong.')
