Anand measures the AC power consumption of the Mini, which is a good measure, but that is not comparable against CPU TDP because TDP has a tenuous relation to actual power draw at best [0]. A better comparison would be ARM Mini vs Intel Mini AC power draw, and a similarly spec&#x27;d AMD system for good measure. Unfortunately, unless I missed something, the article only measured AC power draw from the ARM Mini.<p>The M1 is certainly more power efficient than Intel or AMD for the average user, but as far as performance per watt, we cannot make any judgements with the data we have.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gamersnexus.net&#x2F;guides&#x2F;3525-amd-ryzen-tdp-explained-deep-dive-cooler-manufacturer-opinions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gamersnexus.net&#x2F;guides&#x2F;3525-amd-ryzen-tdp-explai...</a>')
