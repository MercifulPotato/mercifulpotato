They can&#x27;t resolve that problem adequately, all they can do is refund an item and that&#x27;s not the right solution. Someone needs a meal, and if that item is forgotten or wrong to the point where the person can&#x27;t eat the meal then I still have a problem after they&#x27;ve given me my money back. I don&#x27;t need that money, I need a meal to feed someone.<p>Ya sure, I can dig around in the fridge and find something for that person to eat but by not replacing that meal, Doordash makes that person feel completely unimportant. Yes, of course it would be expensive for them to dispatch another driver to bring one meal. But, that&#x27;s the right thing to do. Even if I pay another delivery fee and another tip to reorder the refunded food, then I&#x27;m taking the hit for someone else&#x27;s mistake.<p>When it goes right, it&#x27;s great. When it goes wrong, it&#x27;s one of the worst customer experiences you could design because nobody wins, not even DoorDash. Well, maybe they win a little bit in the short term, but not long term.')
