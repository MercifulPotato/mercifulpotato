Somewhere deep in their R&amp;D facility I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they are quietly working on a full speced ILC camera system - they could just license the Nikon Z mount (which is the most advanced and future proof mount of any other vendors - Nikon&#x27;s real ace in the hole) or - as people have said here just outright buy Nikon - and apply all of their silicon &#x2F; imaging knowlege to it.I wouldn&#x27;t put it past Apple.')
