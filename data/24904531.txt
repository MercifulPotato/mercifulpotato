Those using online services for marketing purposes -which include copyrighted material- must be required to reach an agreement with those services to flag the status of those materials in a way that&#x27;s transparent to software.<p>If I stream a file for an hour, I tie up a bunch of network resources for an hour. If I can legitimately DL that in 2 minutes, I&#x27;m using less net resources for a shorter time. Why in the hell should that be denied because <i>some</i> material is <i>not</i> in the public domain? Completely illogical result.<p>I watch a lot of long-playing material (I <i>think</i> is non-copyright but WTF do I know?) that I DL to timeshift and watch offline in chunks as time allows. Is that music concert from Poland that&#x27;s up on Youtube copyrighted? That amateur history&#x2F;science&#x2F;education channel that asks for Patreon help? Screw RIAA (again)')
