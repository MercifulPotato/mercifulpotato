According to some Google searches, there are 80 trillion dollars in the world. Total Bitcoin supply is 21 million. It means that 1 BTC would be valued around $3.8 million or 277 times more of its current valuation. Currently bitcoin eats around 7.46 GW, so it&#x27;ll become 2 TW. Current world energy consumption is 157 TW.<p>So that&#x27;s a rough estimate upper bound if Bitcoin would become our civilization currency of choice: 1.2% of total energy spent.<p>Not the end of the world, if you ask me.')
