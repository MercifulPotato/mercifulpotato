It that taught the dark ages honestly:  “We let the Catholic Church run Europe for a few hundred years... It turns out that’s a terrible idea”.  They also had a few months of “how to avoid cults” in religion class, and a separate, well-done world religions semester.<p>They had a Spanish language “if you want justice fight for peace” poster up (the officially sanctioned Catholic US translation is “work for peace”) and covered multiple instances of the Catholic church working to overthrow corrupt dictatorships, and also covered the abuses of global captialism in a semester on social justice.<p>That was all mandatory.<p>I also remember a talk a holocaust survivor gave proudly proclaiming that the Catholics in Germany overwhelmingly voted against the Nazis.<p>Don’t get me wrong; even that school was offensively conservative in many ways, just as the rest of the church is.<p>I think the obvious cognitive dissonance mostly just helped most students develop their BS detectors.<p>It’s been shocking to hear which right wingers from that crowd are voting for Biden this year.')
