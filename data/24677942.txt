Item(by='derekp7', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601808802, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24670746, text='I came back home from a 2-week summer camp, at 13 years old, to an IBM PCjr.  Was told &quot;We spent a lot of money on this setup, it better not be collecting dust in a few months&quot;.<p>From there I learned DOS, Basic, general &quot;administration&quot;.  Got a job in late high school at the small company where my Mom worked, helping out with various office tasks (filing, running the postage meter, counting inventory).  They had a few PCs, and a &quot;main&quot; computer system (some sort of Data General &quot;mini&quot; I believe).  They had a PC consultant that would come in for various tasks, for $350 an hour.  They quickly found out they could get the same work from me for $3.50 an hour.<p>Eventually, the company that supplied their central computer (with a bunch of ASCII terminals hooked up) migrated over to a Unix system (AIX on an IBM RT), I saw that the interface was somewhat similar to DOS but different, and went to town.  Learned the vendor&#x27;s app export functions, started producing custom reports using grep&#x2F;sed&#x2F;join&#x2F;awk in shell scripts, became a &quot;local hero&quot;, realized I have a hero complex, so I kept pursuing tasks that would help feed my ego -- further learned C programming, and the rest is history.<p>Today I&#x27;m a Linux systems&#x2F;network engineer that does a lot of programming on the job (now they call it devops), and also filling in as a pinch hitter for some of the development teams whenever they need someone that knows system level programming and C.  Also put out a few full-stack apps using node.js on the back end with plain html5&#x2F;javascript on the front end (not really into modern frameworks, that is a hole I need to fill in).')
