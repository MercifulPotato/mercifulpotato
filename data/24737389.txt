Anything NSFW is not allowed by default and without explicit warnings. Porn is not allowed. Drug stores are not allowed. Gab is not allowed. Imageboards aren&#x27;t. Why would this be different?<p>Apple owns the app store and the iOS platform. They have a duty to protect their customers from clicking on unsightly and wrongful content.
