So I just created a simple repository framework (inspired by <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=rtXpYpZdOzM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=rtXpYpZdOzM</a> ) overlay in which the functions end up calling dapper.<p>The beauty of this is it&#x27;s pretty simple to setup the overlay, and allows complete control of what is going on.  I have a need for &quot;dynamic&quot; table names.  I don&#x27;t think there is even a way to do this in EF (at least not a simple way), but when I have my own repo overlay it&#x27;s really a piece of cake.  I just tack on whatever specific function input I need to help define what the resulting table name is that its great.<p>This is probably not the most common use, but a simple repo overlay to a micro orm is not much work and gives full control.')
