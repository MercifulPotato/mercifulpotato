But they also don&#x27;t need unreliable electronics to tell them what they know from walking around the store.<p>&gt; It seems like the product layouts in my local grocery stores have hardly changed in the last decade, so I think I must be missing the point here.<p>1) Grocery stores are optimized to hell and back already since the margins are so terribly thin.  Industrial engineers have been over every shelf and aisle several times already.<p>2) Grocery stores have seem to have reoptimized roughly about 2-3 years ago.
