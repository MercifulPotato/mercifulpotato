That this belief is so widespread is actually a testament to the effectiveness of anti-union messaging...<p>However, not all unions operate on that model. One major example: the Screen Actors Guild<p><i>&gt; According to SAG&#x27;s Mission Statement, the Guild sought to: negotiate and enforce collective bargaining agreements that establish equitable levels of compensation, benefits, and working conditions for its performers; collect compensation for exploitation of recorded performances by its members, and provide protection against unauthorized use of those performances; and preserve and expand work opportunities for its members.</i> (Wikipedia [0])<p>Actors have a lot of freedom to do what they want... For example: they can work on a big budget movie and make millions, or they can take the minimal fee and do a small low-budget artsy film. They can also write&#x2F;direct&#x2F;produce the movies that they act in. The guild&#x27;s contracts just require that they be treated and compensated certain ways (both up front + residuals) for their acting roles.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Screen_Actors_Guild" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Screen_Actors_Guild</a>')
