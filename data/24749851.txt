One issue I found, however, was getting a list of my subscriptions without having to go to the website and fetch the channel IDs or video IDs for youtube-dl to then use.<p>I also noted that youtube-dl can download from your subscriptions list directly, which is cool. I was going to put that on a cronjob and just let it milk my subscriptions on a daily basis as new videos come out.<p>I&#x27;ve also been using &quot;Clean Up YouTube&quot;, a Firefox plugin, which basically eliminates whatever you want from the UI. For me that&#x27;s the home screen&#x2F;trending crap, comments and just about everything. Now I only focus on my subscription feed and move on from YouTube after that. This has helped to drastically reduce the amount of crap I watch.')
