This isn&#x27;t surprising, or evidence of some anti-conservative agenda, since tech workers often exist at the confluence of both geographic distributions and educational backgrounds (usually bachelor&#x27;s degree or more) that are more liberal than average.<p>But still, I&#x27;m really curious as to how you justify the claims you&#x27;re making in this comment.')
