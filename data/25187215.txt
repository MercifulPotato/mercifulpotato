We have been sending our transactional mails directy via our own backend, and so far we haven&#x27;t had any issues with that. If you don&#x27;t send tens of thousands of identical mails per day you should be fine.<p>You can use a worker and scheduling framework like Celery and Celerybeat to e.g. periodically go through your users and generate mails. The advantage is that it&#x27;s much easier to integrate this with your backend and tie the mails to actual user actions. Just make sure to record which mails you have sent already to a given user to avoid sending the same stuff more than once.<p>But maybe don&#x27;t take my advice on this, we&#x27;re a really privacy-focused startup so we try to keep most of our customers&#x27; data in-house for security and privacy reasons, I know that there are a lot of people that will recommend to rely on external services for this (and they might be right in many circumstances).')
