I can develop a fix for a issue for version 1.2.30 of some software, generate a the diff using the diff tool and then apply this diff using the patch tool to version 1.1.15 of the software. This might fail (or result in something undesired), but there no principal problem in moving the diff around and applying it somewhere else.<p>A git commit however <i>is</i> a particular version, so git is not really good at applying a commit somewhere else.')
