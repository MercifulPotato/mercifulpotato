Indeed if the government actually had such goals then funding cycling paths, mass transit routes would certainly be better, but the government doesn&#x27;t have such goals really. So companies develop technology that fits within the government funded systems that exist (namely the government heavily funds building highways and roads) so the systems must be built for that application. Feel free to encourage politicians to change their ways, but until that happens automated vehicle research will continue.')
