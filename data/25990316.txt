I appreciate why central banks would want to suppress the price of precious metals, but that isn&#x27;t the same as believing it is happening.<p>That said, silver has run up to around $50 before. Consumers could do worse than picking up a few silver bars or rounds. I don&#x27;t see this as risky as buying GME at $400 or BTC at $30k-$40k. Governments have stimulated trillions in 2020. 2021 is looking to be similar.<p>The conspiracy stuff can be interesting if you are into that kind of thing. Although you don&#x27;t need to accept those narratives to appreciate precious metals.')
