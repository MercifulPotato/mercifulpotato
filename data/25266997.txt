Majority of my family from Punjab is into farming and we&#x27;ve always struggled with lack of water and power. There is subsidized power supply on paper but in reality it&#x27;s supplied way less than what&#x27;s needed. Same is the case with water. People have to use gensets and thus spend more money than the standard power rate. We would rather pay the market rate for these and get better supply than the subsidized but poor service.')
