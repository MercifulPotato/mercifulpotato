To not even attempt to call out a car model or even a brand or generation, and just hand-wave &quot;baseline luxury German cars&quot;, and not attempt to specify what type of cornering you&#x27;re discussing here.<p>The biggest problem a Tesla would have vs a competitive ICE sport sedan would be mass, which can hurt all vehicle dynamics; likely on the order of 300-400lbs or so (Model 3 LR: ~4k lbs, 330i ~3600lbs, Model S P75 ~4500lbs, 530i ~4000lbs). Of course it&#x27;s worth noting that none of these vehicles are featherweights, and the extremely low center of gravity of skateboard battery pack vehicles helps them roll vastly less than one would expect, which helps a lot in transitions and steady state cornering.<p>Regardless, both the Model S and the Model 3 are extremely well-balanced and the 3 is surprisingly nimble and adjustable. The 3 has a ton of grip, turns in sharply and gets out of corners FAST. I haven&#x27;t driven a Model X so I can&#x27;t say.<p>Source: I instruct, I drive on the track, I own 2 BMWs and 1 Tesla, I&#x27;ve driven numerous BMWs and Teslas including the original roadster on the street and on closed courses. And I&#x27;ve been on car forums for decades and seen endless comments like this.')
