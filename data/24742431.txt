The actual pump is submersed inside the underground gas tank.<p>- mid grade gas is just premium and regular gas that is gets mixed at the dispenser before the fuel is dispensed.<p>- Holding the hose up high and pulling the trigger does not allow more fuel to drain from the hose after reaching your prepaid amount<p>- people drive off with the nozzle still in their car surprisingly often. There is a magnetic breakaway so the hose will disconnect and not pull the dispenser over.<p>I can probably think of some more of people are interested')
