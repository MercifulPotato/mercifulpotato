They could keep going. Even if the limit exists in principle, if it&#x27;s 7 orders of magnitude away, we should seriously consider whether or not the system will be smarter than a human before it reaches that point.<p>It could be a factor of 2 away from GPT-3! It could be something they already reached, if it is close! But we don&#x27;t know. And without these answers, this is going to end up being one of the most interesting technical projects in the world.')
