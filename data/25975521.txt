Like 10,000 very different shader programs (mutations of each other) running simultaneously, but sharing the same texture&#x2F;environment&#x2F;data. Analogous to each creature being its own process on its own CPU, ideally.<p>But I never saw how such a setup could be run on a video card. Admittedly, I got really disheartened about this stuff a decade ago when OpenCL and CUDA came out and seemed to be made for running one program on a bunch of different data. And complicated. Do you or does anyone know if things have changed?<p>The closest I&#x27;ve come to this lately is Unity shaders, but I vaguely remember there is a way to run Julia on GPU? Like if each different shader program is run as a layer in a rendering pass. Except rather than 8 or 16 layers, can modern GPUs run more on the order of 100+ layers? What&#x27;s the limit?')
