The real bar is, &quot;better than N months of covid, where N is the time until a better vaccine with fewer adverse effects is discovered.&quot;<p>So, these are both abstract speculations. It would be nice if you could put some knowledge to them. Do you think it would be possible for an adverse effect to go unreported, while being common enough to equal those N months of covid?')
