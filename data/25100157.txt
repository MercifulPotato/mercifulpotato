It will help you get your first data role and will be your main tool to solve 97% of the problems you will ever face.</i><p>That&#x27;s a bit of an exaggeration but I will say: most of data science is not the fun stuff. Everyone goes into the field thinking it&#x27;s all about doing machine learning to uncover astounding insights that will fundamentally transform the business.<p>In reality about 5% of most data scientists time is spent doing that. Maybe less. The bulk of the work is getting the data and cleaning it up, doing a tiny bit of the sexy stuff, then writing it up into a report or a presentation to give to people who will either not believe it or scoff because they already knew it.')
