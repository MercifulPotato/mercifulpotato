Let&#x27;s stop for a minute and assume that I&#x27;m an unfeeling, non-empathetic person who doesn&#x27;t care about anyone but himself.  Even then, I would advocate to allocate more money to homeless services, regardless of how that money is used, because doing so would benefit me: I don&#x27;t want to see human feces on the sidewalk, or used syringes, or disease-carrying rats running around near tent encampments, or mentally-ill people screaming at me as I walk by.<p>People who adopt the attitude that we shouldn&#x27;t give people a generous safety net because they haven&#x27;t done anything to &quot;deserve&quot; a handout are quite simply cutting off their noses to spite their faces.  They&#x27;re making their lives actively worse just to &quot;teach a lesson&quot; to those &quot;undeserving&quot; homeless people.')
