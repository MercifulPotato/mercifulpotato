Almost entirety of the books from Ivy schools are Cyber Security &#x2F; Information Security related whereas public schools seem much more balanced with books on Databases, OS, Networks, AI and Algorithms. Has there been a bias of some sort in the study or the Ivy schools really all just focus on Cyber Security heavily?')
