Math background. Didn&#x27;t go anywhere with that immediately.<p>Here&#x27;s what I wish I&#x27;d done.<p>Take the minimum amount of steps it requires to go to grad school or line up a quantitative finance job. Even if you don&#x27;t care about those possible paths, you have the privilege of applying whereas many do not. At least talk to some of those people and see what they have to say to you. It sounds like you&#x27;re coming up with a catastrophic idea of your future without consulting the very people who are supposed to navigate these waters with you.<p>If you want a &#x27;realistic&#x27; answer, it sounds like you just need a job. Any job. Give up the idea that the work will always be interesting. I guarantee you, once you abandon the pretense that you need to be working on interesting problems, you will see that others will bring interesting work to you anyways.<p>As math major to another, there are interesting problems everywhere and literally all people are interesting and full of problems.')
