While our electrician did all the wiring, I did the programming myself. It has a steep learning curve, but if you&#x27;re in IT, you&#x27;ll probably get the hang of it pretty quickly.\nThe system is very robust and offers a lot of flexibility.\nAlmost all our componenents are from MDT (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mdt.de&#x2F;EN_Start.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mdt.de&#x2F;EN_Start.html</a>). They build really great products and are quite affordable. Compared with components from other manufacturers we use (Theben, Weinzierl, Steinel) I think their applications and manuals are also far superior.<p>I have since connected the system to my home assistant installation, and enjoy the added flexiblity.')
