Paper bags need to be a lot heavier to offer the same strength.<p>They calculated that such a paper bags needs to see 15+ reuses to become more environmentally friendly, which is unrealistic seeing how fast they break. Recycling also favors plastic bags. The only upside is that paper bags are better biodegradable in the environment and don&#x27;t spread microplastics around.<p>The solution for this particular problem is, of course, that free paper bags should also be banned.')
