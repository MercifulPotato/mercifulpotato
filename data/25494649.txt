Now that the pandemic has made remote work a necessity, I&#x27;m wondering if regions of California outside Silicon Valley will benefit from remote tech workers having more options in terms of residences.  For example, Sacramento is a very popular destination for ex-Bay Area residents, and it appears to be a good location for people working remotely for Silicon Valley companies who (post-pandemic) may need to make occasional trips to the office.  Sacramento is still affordable, though it&#x27;s becoming more expensive each year.<p>Other areas that are intriguing to me include San Luis Obispo County and some of Southern California&#x27;s exurbs like the Antelope Valley area and Lake Elsinore, where it&#x27;s possible to buy a nice single-family house in a safe neighborhood for less than $500,000.<p>California gets a bad rap in some circles due to its high cost of living and its taxes, but not everywhere in California has the Bay Area&#x27;s high housing costs.  There are many other areas of the state where people can still reasonably make a day trip to the Bay Area to enjoy its amenities while living in a place that is affordable on an average engineer&#x27;s salary.')
