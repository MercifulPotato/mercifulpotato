Why did they limit 1 per customer?  Out of some flawed communist ideals that the authorities should determine who should get how much TP and at what price.  Needless to say TP was gone for months.  If it were $100, people that really needed it would have been able to get it.  Now replace TP with insulin or other life saving drugs.  Some would say it would be cruel to bump the price 1000%.  However, if the price is held down, it will be hoarded just like TP.  If the price is held down and quantity limited, those that really need it, like hospitals, and actual sick could not get the quantity they need at any price.<p>No doubt leftists will try this like Venezuelan price controls on food that did nothing but create a food shortages.')
