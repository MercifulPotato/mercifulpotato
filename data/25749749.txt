But the numbers are marketing numbers &amp; should be treated as such. The same goes for the CPU in your XPS. It was sold with an advertised TDP, was probably configured by the manufacturer to a &#x2F;different&#x2F; TDP target subject to the thermal constraints of the laptop &amp; as an end-user you can shift the set-points of thermals vs power consumption yourself if you want to. None of this is new &amp; Apple is no exception. If Intel hadn’t completely failed to deliver their last 2 fab shrinks, you’d be sat here raving about how amazing your passively cooled Intel Mac was I imagine.')
