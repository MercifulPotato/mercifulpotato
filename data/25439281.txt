I enjoy regexes, but definitely get how other people would find them bizarre.<p>Personally, I&#x27;ve never liked SQL, though. As with regexes, a little does no harm. But building anything substantial with it always turns into what feel like absurd bank shots to me. I don&#x27;t just have to cast everything into the relational paradigm, I have to try to guess how a couple million lines of DB server code is going to map that back into operations I actually understand.<p>That said, as with most technologies that I don&#x27;t personally like, people seem to build sufficiently effective systems and profitable businesses on top of them. So I think it&#x27;s down to personal cognitive differences and matters of taste. Let a thousand flowers bloom, I say.')
