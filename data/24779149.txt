I get value out of FB (that&#x27;s why I still have an account) and Oculus is the primary driver of progress in VR today.<p>However, I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s a user-friendly product decision to tightly couple FB&#x27;s VR hardware to its social media platform. It&#x27;s yet another push towards a walled garden, much like Google&#x27;s AMP and Apple&#x27;s app store.')
