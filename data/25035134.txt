I could add the option if there&#x27;s enough interest, but aren&#x27;t there already dedicated tools to do this?<p>As an example: I sometimes run &#x27;curl ifconfig.me&#x27; to get my public IP from the command-line, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect curl to add an &#x27;--ip&#x27; option to make this specific query easier to run. curl is a general tool, and the fact that you can use HTTP to get your public IP doesn&#x27;t mean it needs a top-level option in an HTTP client. (I get that reverse lookup is an internet standard, and ifconfig.me is a third-party service, but still.)')
