While AGPL is sold as a means for protecting against abuse of a party&#x27;s good-faith open source work, it defacto signals a transition to a bait-and-switch business model. Most large companies do open source to commoditize the cost of non-differentiating software. How you create value over and above what large companies are already willing to do in such an ecosystem is tough, and few have been able to build as non-services-based value prop. Open source software contributions, be it directly through lead maintainership or indirectly through contributions to 3rd party projects, are best viewed as marketing. You have to have something else to sell.')
