Gitea is as &quot;involved&quot; as you make it - mariadb certainly is not a requirement for Gitea. I&#x27;ve been using Gitea with sqlite for a couple years and upgrades have never ever been more complex than replacing the image with a new one. If minimality is a concern then you really can&#x27;t get any simpler than `.&#x2F;gitea`.')
