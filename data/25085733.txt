That&#x27;s easy to say when putting country over politics happens to agree with your own political views. I don&#x27;t know if many democrats would have voted for a person like Ted Cruz in 2016 if Trump (or someone like him) had been the democratic candidate. I can almost certainly say that I personally would have played the same games of semantics that the right was playing then (and still are).<p>There&#x27;s a lot of &quot;right-shaming&quot; going on when I suspect that it&#x27;s just an accident that the right was the side that fell for it this time. The left should be extra vigilant to make sure that we don&#x27;t fall for it ourselves.')
