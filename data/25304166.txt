For example, if suddenly 10 fold more people want to open accounts then spot price will rise to 60 dollars from a base price of 6 dollars.<p>* This can be done through BTC payments instead of dollars to protect identity of account owners a bit.<p>* Users should be able to hand-select moderators and if wanted, review their actions transparently. This will eliminate all unfair moderation and provide huge value to users. An user still can get banned by a moderator but only people who subscribe to that moderator will assume user is banned.<p>* As accounts are bought to post content, there wonâ€™t be any advertisement. There might be some subscription fee though.<p>* All this can be done in a decentralised framework to increase resilience.')
