Item(by='ryan29', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609953255, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25644559, text='I looked through the product listings a bit (I mentioned it elsewhere) and they look reasonable for things I&#x27;ve researched lately.  I hope it works out for you because there&#x27;s a huge lack of trustworthy product data and massive amounts of trash to sort through these days.<p>I&#x27;d probably be your target market.  I&#x27;m usually looking for products that are good value.  Ignoring the fact that I&#x27;m from Canada and all your links are US, I&#x27;m also the kind of person that would make an effort to buy via one of your affiliate links if I used your site as a source for products I want to research more in depth.  However, I don&#x27;t think most people would make that effort and maybe that&#x27;ll be a problem.<p>Put another way, it looks like a great site to use as a starting point for products I don&#x27;t know much about, but I&#x27;m going to jump to other in-depth review sites before buying anything and might convert through their affiliate links instead.  Add in sweet (get it?) industrial scale affiliate link hijackers plus price watching services like CamelCamelCamel and all of a sudden there are <i>a lot</i> of ways I can use your site and never give anything back (unintentionally).<p>I&#x27;m also not sure I&#x27;ll remember your site to go back to it (sorry).  I wonder how a browser addon would work out.  The no ad, no tracking design of the site lends a lot of credibility in terms of being trustworthy, so I&#x27;d consider installing an addon for the type of data you have.  If you can build a reputation as the brand that filters Amazon down to the X% of products that aren&#x27;t garbage, that might get some traction.<p>For example, if I&#x27;m browsing Amazon and could click on a GCAF addon that showed me a curated list of similar products that aren&#x27;t complete trash, that would be helpful to me because there&#x27;s too much garbage to sort through manually on Amazon.  Once I&#x27;m on the product page (via your affiliate link in the addon), I might open a new tab to read other reviews, but I&#x27;m not going to click back through to the product page when I already have it open in another tab.  Or if you sort by products that are currently on sale I might just open tabs for the ones on sale and just buy something right there.<p>I also manually jump from Amazon to BestBuy before buying stuff.  If the pricing is close enough I buy it at BestBuy instead.  If I could click an addon that linked me directly to the same product page at other stores I think you could capture that too, at least from me.<p>Anyway, good luck!  I hope it works out for you.')
