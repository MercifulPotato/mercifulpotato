You just separate yourself from the game.<p>If you lose it&#x27;s not a big deal, if you win it&#x27;s also not a big deal. If someone annoys you, just go find another server&#x2F;game.<p>Basically you do everything to avoid getting emotion.<p>Another option is to find a less intense genre you may like, such as simulation or something less action packed.<p>You can&#x27;t really be highly invested in a action packed heart pounding game, and look like a bored zombie. Even top tier CS streamers&#x2F;professional gamers while they may not appear super invested it&#x27;s mostly because they are not highly invested, they are just playing to practice something&#x2F;or for entertainment for their viewers. If you watch them at a intense match or tournament you&#x27;ll see them at their peak intensity.')
