Still the same strange security process getting into the building as in a legitimate dispensary, still the same process of getting delivery (sometimes with nice web design to boot) so it certainly passes the smell test. Happen into one of these, and the prices alone will keep you going there rather than a legal dispensary down the road. Not to mention the packaging requirements of legal dispensariesâ€”ask for an oz and you get handed 8 bags in some very annoying &#x27;child proof&#x27; ziplocks (I opt to just cut them open with scissors) since they seemingly can&#x27;t sell larger units than 1&#x2F;8 oz or 100mg of edibles per package.')
