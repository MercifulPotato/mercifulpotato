Whatever those things make me feel.<p>Sometimes the strongest arguments have large flaws (mostly moral with you examples) but sometimes we just don&#x27;t understand the opposing arguments and then just create strawmen to rage against.<p>I&#x27;m opposed to this type of irrational emotional behaviour. It causes things like mob violence which I&#x27;m very familiar with.<p>So when someone can&#x27;t articulate the opposing views then they need to be warned or directed to do so. If they refuse and run back to a strawmen then yes they are not honest and obviously not prepared.<p>uMkhonto we Sizwe was a terrorist organization. But they had a very strong argument for why terrorism was an appropriate action.<p>I don&#x27;t say that I agree with their use of violence, but they had an argument that makes blanket statements like &quot;terrorism is evil&quot; harder to make.')
