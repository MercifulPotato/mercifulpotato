But that still means someone needs to take care of all other dependencies, security fixes, scaling, etc. Someone needs to understand and maintain all pieces for it to work properly, and need to know how to optimize bottlenecks.<p>Automating fixes is only possible if you understand fully where the problem is. Then, it still needs testing does it break something else. For testing, automatic tests most likely do not test for everything. And someone would need to create those tests.<p>There is also a lot of existing code for existing software. Would it be possible to analyze or convert that amount of code to be somehow updateable?<p>Software is usually made with some programming language and related dependencies. Those dependencies don&#x27;t necessarily exist for other programming languages and web frameworks.')
