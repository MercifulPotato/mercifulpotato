I&#x27;ll paste in something I shared on Twitter, about one of the features I think some will find surprising (at least, in the sense I might have been skeptical about it if it had been pitched to me a year ago). The twitter thread is here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;honnibal&#x2F;status&#x2F;1316792607205470209" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;honnibal&#x2F;status&#x2F;1316792607205470209</a><p>This release was SO much work! Glad to finally have it out. \n:beer:<p>The big impact for users will definitely be the transformer models and config system, but I want to talk about a feature I wasn&#x27;t expecting to build until a few months ago: the new workflow system, spaCy Projects. :thread:<p>spaCy Projects was inspired by @DVCorg\n , and has an easy integration for DVC users. But it&#x27;s also standalone: you can write a single YML file and spaCy will get your data, trigger your processing steps, and use remote cache. It even generates readmes: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.co&#x2F;uRcfJWZlsQ?amp=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.co&#x2F;uRcfJWZlsQ?amp=1</a><p>The requirements that spaCy Projects handles are more general than spaCy. So why put it in the library? The case against it -- simple minimalism -- is pretty clear. The case for it is a bit more subtle.<p>We built spaCy Projects for the design-space it opens up for the rest of the library. If we can assume a workflow system (by giving it to you!), it&#x27;s much easier to let things happen in separate steps. We can embrace approaches that would otherwise be awkward.<p>A good example is the way we&#x27;ve stream-lined the training utilities. spaCy used to have this awkward class, GoldParse. That&#x27;s gone now: the training annotations are represented with the Doc class, and the training data is read in from DocBin format -- which is about 100x smaller.<p>Why didn&#x27;t we ditch GoldParse sooner? Well, there&#x27;s definitely a downside to reading data from a binary format. It adds an extra conversion step. But with the projects system, that&#x27;s no longer such a big deal. We now have a conventional way to describe such multi-step workflows.<p>I think the impact will be especially big for the ecosystem. It&#x27;s extremely standard in NLP to have a bunch of steps to run to build counts, lists, models etc. Previously every spaCy Universe project had to build and describe their own conventions. Now we have a standard.')
