It does B&amp;W prints, and that&#x27;s actually all we need at home. I can print directly from my phone, scan directly to my phone, and amazingly, I can print from Linux, which I would never have dreamed of in all my 20 years of Linux desktop usage.<p>Being the family tech support, I&#x27;m slowly but surely migrating all family members away from inkjets to laser printers. This is easy because the inkjets invariably die within a couple of years. I make the beloved relatives think really hard about needing color or not. Let&#x27;s be fair, we don&#x27;t need it for printing ticket QR codes.')
