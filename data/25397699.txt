If not, it&#x27;s an a.<p>I have to say a word (or abbreviation, or acronym) out loud very occasionally to determine if &#x27;an&#x27; is appropriate -- and reading the writing of North American english <i>speakers</i> throws me when an &#x27;an&#x27; is used in front of a word that, in my head, starts with a consonant sound.<p>The obvious example being &#x27;an herb&#x27; - because in Australia (and indeed England) the h is pronounced, consequently it would normally be &#x27;a herb&#x27;.<p>There are minor mental flurries with abbreviations that some people pronounce differently, I&#x27;m sure.')
