In 1996 I was a drop-out philosophy student who got web-programming jobs through a friend who saw my potential and I moved out to Toronto to try to make a go of it, got caught up in rave culture, etc instead of focusing well on my career.  My programming interest was in the MUDs&#x2F;MOOs and the potential for that kind of synchronoius multiuser environment; not the web (which I was only into because that&#x27;s where the $$ was and it kind of sucked then.) Then as now I didn&#x27;t&#x2F;don&#x27;t have the personality type to be an entrepreneur or manager of that kind of stuff.<p>It&#x27;s just interesting to look back at those early days and think of how green field it all was, and how there was at least the semblance of opportunity.<p>But as you point out, it wasn&#x27;t really a level playing field either.')
