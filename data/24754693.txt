I&#x27;m not saying you are lying, but you are probably in a minority.<p>Here&#x27;s my &quot;secret,&quot; if it helps. I buy laptops with Linux pre-installed from a supported vendor, I run Ubuntu LTS in the default configuration, and I only customize a tiny number of things. This has worked pretty well for me for over a decade. (Before that, I had more issues.)<p>I don&#x27;t feel like installing Linux onto random Windows laptops is a good use of my time. Similarly, if I were to choose some unusual distro or desktop environment, that would usually mean more hassle. So I don&#x27;t.<p>&gt; Also, having two screens with different scaling was completely unsupported, unlike on Windows.<p>Yup, that&#x27;s the biggest limitation I&#x27;ve seen. That&#x27;s one reason I ended up giving away my ancient external monitor and getting a new 4k. That way I can use the same scaling on the internal and external monitor.<p>And if I&#x27;m going to make a major hardware purchase, I usually Google to see if it works with Linux. This matters mostly for things like drawing tablets.')
