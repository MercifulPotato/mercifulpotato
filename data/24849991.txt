Does that mean we should not care that Google is evil?<p>You&#x27;re conflating two things.<p>1. The government is more evil than Google.<p>2. Google may still be evil.<p>therefore... use the more evil thing to fight the less evil thing?<p>I disagree with this assessment.<p>I&#x27;d say we should focus on mitigating the _most_ evil thing, using _less evil_ tools.<p>&gt; The government is the only tool we have to fight Google.<p>The missing piece here is - we have plenty of tools to &quot;fight google&quot;. Everyone could up and leave, stop using their service, and boom. no more revenue. Google is gone, irrelevant, de-monopolized.<p>The government is indeed the only _coercive_ tool available to fight Google, because the government can make credible threats of violence against the Google leadership.<p>There are plenty of other non-coercive tools we can use to &quot;fight&quot; google, and it&#x27;s called &quot;competition&quot;.<p>For example, notice that we&#x27;re talking about Google right now, and not Microsoft. This is because Google &quot;fought&quot; Microsoft&#x27;s monopoly by _making better tools_.<p>I cannot wait to see what company comes along and beats Google at their own game.')
