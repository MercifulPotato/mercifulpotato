I have played around with formulas for my Excel-like data table product [DataGridXL](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datagridxl.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datagridxl.com</a>) for quite a while but I decided not to include the feature since it was a little more difficult to implement than I had imagined, exactly because of these update chain rules. Perhaps one day, in a v2.<p>Most other Javascript spreadsheet products are slow even without formulas, with a very slow DOM structure.')
