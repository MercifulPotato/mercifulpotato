And from VOX of all places. And basically amounting to &quot;It&#x27;s not Orwellian thought-crime persecution if we do it to those who indeed have criminal thoughts&quot;.<p>Orwell himself had something opposite to say in 1944 no less:<p>&quot;It will be seen that, as used, the word ‘Fascism’ is almost entirely meaningless. In conversation, of course, it is used even more wildly than in print. I have heard it applied to farmers, shopkeepers, Social Credit, corporal punishment, fox-hunting, bull-fighting, the 1922 Committee, the 1941 Committee, Kipling, Gandhi, Chiang Kai-Shek, homosexuality, Priestley&#x27;s broadcasts, Youth Hostels, astrology, women, dogs and I do not know what else&quot;.')
