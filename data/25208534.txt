France has strongly supported these subsidies, which replaced domestic French subsidies, because of the effect on rural life and the rural economy. Subsidies are the reason that millions of small farmers can make a living, the reason that many French villages still exist, one of the reasons for that high quality local produce made in small batches is available cheaply all over France, and one of the reasons that retirees from the UK and Netherlands like to live in rural France (the much more intensive farming in those countries makes rural life quite different).')
