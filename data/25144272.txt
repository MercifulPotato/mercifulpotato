Item(by='rualca', descendants=None, kids=[25145374], score=None, time=1605743204, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25143990, text='&gt; When the margins of victory in several states are so small, this seems to be merely conjecture.<p>Your conspiracy theory is based on the assumption that tens of thousands of votes can be cast fraudulently and matching records without anyone noticing, let alone leaving any trail, and that this can be pulled off on such a massive global scale and so uniformly and stealthily that it just resembles real votes cast by real people.<p>Isn&#x27;t that a little bit incredible?<p>I mean, the only objective statement behind that conspiracy theory is that you feel the wrong candidate won the elections. That&#x27;s the whole basis of this whole election dispute. The rest of your argument derives from there. As the wrong candidate won then there must have been a conspiracy to get votes for that candidate.<p>What really boggles the mind is that these absurd and totally idiotic conspiracy theories sprang up after we saw an incumbent openly sabotaging elections by barring people from voting, by putting up barriers to mail voting, by purposely degrading postal delivery services to force votes from being shipped, let alone counted, forcing votes out because of technicalities such as delays in delivery and counting, and more eggregiously arguing in public that votes on his competitor, and only those, should be simply thrown out.<p>But somehow that doesn&#x27;t raise questions. What raises questions is if voting normally could be trusted.')
