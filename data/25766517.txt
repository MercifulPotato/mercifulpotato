Item(by='Nextgrid', descendants=None, kids=[25767717], score=None, time=1610564556, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25761633, text='&gt; There are various reasons for the data collection. One is obviously marketing, but another may also be identifying bad actors.<p>And my point is that since companies can&#x27;t be trusted to not use this data for marketing purposes (and the legal&#x2F;regulatory environment is ineffective at deterring that) then they should not have that data.<p>&gt; almost all stores have rewards programs [...]. People will, by and large, willingly give their identifying information in exchange for this, so I think it&#x27;s inevitable<p>I don&#x27;t have a problem with it being optional and voluntary (though I still think more regulation and transparency around what is done with that data is badly needed), but the problem begins when you need a loyalty card or providing identifying data to return an item for example, since as per the previous point they can&#x27;t be trusted with not misusing this data. I don&#x27;t want to live in a world where you have to &quot;Login with Facebook&quot; to purchase or return something.<p>&gt; I just know I would rather have something new<p>I agree, but I mean whether it&#x27;s worth proposing and normalizing a large-scale data collection scheme and all the problems this entails (especially around bias - what if your algorithm start declining returns from black people because blacks were under-represented in the data and a single individual making a bad return was enough to sway the balance) to weed out maybe 1% of bad returns?<p>&gt; How are you determining that money is being pissed away?<p>Because paying companies to waste people&#x27;s time and annoy them with ads does not improve the quality of the products that I am buying, and yet part of the price I pay for most goods goes to this useless and counter-productive endeavour.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s very easy to start a retail business.<p>I am talking about starting a business that can compete with the big-box stores, since your original argument was that screening returns would translate to savings and that would give the businesses who do pass on those savings to the customer a competitive advantage, but the average 2-4% saving (or less) isn&#x27;t enough for a brand new competitor to emerge, thus the established retailers don&#x27;t actually have pressure to pass on those savings onto the customer instead of making them disappear into a black hole.')
