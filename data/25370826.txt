Now, I take that with a grain of salt, state agencies are known to sometimes say what they need to to further their agenda. But it is worth noting.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a few interviews and articles by evolutionary microbiologists who have examined some of the genetic and behavioral traits and found several that indicate that it evolved under selective pressures of being in a controlled environment like a lab. I don&#x27;t have links to them, but I&#x27;m sure they can be found with an internet search, once you wade through the mountains of bullshit that you&#x27;re sure to pull up when you do. Two behavioral traits I noted were the significantly lower number of cases that are thought to have been spread outdoors and the propensity of the virus to move across different tissues, a trait that is deliberately selected for in lab testing of viruses because it enables ease of testing in different scenarios.<p>So there is <i>evidence</i> is came from a lab, but so far no <i>proof</i> that the public is privy too.')
