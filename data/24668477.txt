I had very mild symptoms, easily confused with springtime allergies. My wife ended up with pneumonia and was almost hospitalized. One child got bronchitis. Another had mild symptoms.<p>I didn&#x27;t notice it much at the time, but my sense of smell had changed. It&#x27;s now October as I write this and I haven&#x27;t recovered. In fact I would say it has gotten worse.<p>I&#x27;m trying to think of how to describe it, because it&#x27;s not as simple as saying I can&#x27;t smell things. There are things that I used to be able to smell with a lot of nuance in flavor, like ripe fruits, wines, cheese varieties, and so on. Now, the nuance is gone. The hint of the smell is there, and for things that I used to eat often, I still have the memory of the smell and taste. Because I&#x27;m unable to smell other things, it makes me wonder if I am actually smelling things, or if my mind is telling me that the thing I am eating has a familiar taste, like a phantom smell sensation.<p>Because of this, I now have a strong preference for very spicy foods and other strong flavors, because it&#x27;s the only time I ever really taste something.<p>I am also in the camp of people who have lost the ability to smell certain things, even toxic things. I can&#x27;t smell cleaning products that contain chlorine-based bleach, for example. I don&#x27;t notice certain other funky smells that I would normally find repulsive. When the city was blanketed in smoke here in Seattle for a week, I barely noticed the smell. It was there, but only faintly.<p>The strange part to me is that some smells have fundamentally changed. When I am outside and working in our garden, the smell of soil is now profound. Wet, woody material has a very strong scent. It got me wondering if there was some evolutionary advantage the virus was selecting for, like it was giving me the smelling abilities of some woodland creature. I know that&#x27;s stupid. That&#x27;s just where my Covid brain has gone.<p>The observer in me wants to run experiments to try to document the experience. The pragmatist would prefer to drink a stout beer and eat a BBQ burger with Gorgonzola cheese and pickled jalape√±os.')
