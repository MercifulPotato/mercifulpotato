When I first made the jump to using Linux as a daily driver circa 2016, I had to keep a Windows partition to be able to play any game in the Steam library that wasn&#x27;t native on Linux. With steady improvements to Wine and Valve&#x27;s release of Proton however, I can play most games out of the box or with a minimal amount of tweaking.<p>However, the games industry is still largely hostile to gaming on Linux. I&#x27;ve always had the best experiences with indie games or FOSS projects, and the only trouble I&#x27;ve had is with newly released AAA titles. I wouldn&#x27;t even bother with newer multiplayer-only games or MMOs, as anti-cheat on Linux is a pretty reliable way to be falsely detected and instantly banned (not to mention requiring kernel-level access, which is utterly ridiculous).')
