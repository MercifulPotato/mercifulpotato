Apart from any legal changes that may come, we vote with our clicks and platform usage, and there&#x27;s a growing number of people who are tired of these political censorship games, so they&#x27;re leaving for other platforms with less political bias. As censorship increases, that will likely accelerate.<p>Please remember that Section 230 doesn&#x27;t <i>just</i> apply to the big players.  It applies to <i>any</i> internet resource that allows third-party content.  Including any site that <i>you</i> may host&#x2F;own.<p>I suggest you actually <i>read</i> the sharp end of Section 230 (section (C)(1), which pretty much all litigation around it has been resolved).  I present it here for your review[4]:<p>&quot;No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s it.  Full stop.<p>I don&#x27;t care about platforms like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc.  I don&#x27;t use them (well, okay, sometimes I listen to songs on YT and once in a while I&#x27;ll dig up an amusing or enjoyable clip from a movie or tv show) because I find their business models personally offensive.<p>But you attack Section 230 at your own (and everyone else&#x27;s) peril.  And there are a bunch of reasons for this.<p>The impetus for Section 230 came out of the court decision in Stratton, Oakmont v. Prodigy[0], where the court ruled that if Prodigy did <i>any</i> moderation at all, they were then liable to be sued for third-party content they hosted.<p>But that didn&#x27;t just apply to Prodigy.  It applied to <i>any</i> connected device that hosted <i>any</i> content, whether that content <i>originated</i> from the owner or a third-party.<p>Try to imagine what the world would look like under such a legal regime:<p>A site like HackerNews, if they (as they do now) allowed the upvote&#x2F;downvote&#x2F;flag moderation system, would be liable to be sued for just about any post that someone didn&#x27;t like, or for a submission that wasn&#x27;t <i>sufficiently</i> up or down voted.<p>In such an environment, HackerNews (and every single other website, mailing list, Usenet group, Mastodon instance, Github repo, etc., etc., etc.) would be liable to be sued for just about <i>anything</i> that <i>anyone</i> posted if they did <i>any</i> form of moderation (like blocking spam, porn or any content unrelated to the purpose of the site).<p>If there was no Section 230, <i>you</i> could be sued if you hosted a <i>mirror</i> of the lkml[1] list and someone didn&#x27;t like a snarky response from Linus about a rejected patch merge request.<p><i>You</i> could also be sued just for <i>forwarding an email</i> that contained statements that someone didn&#x27;t like.  In fact, Section 230 protections stopped just such a lawsuit[2] in 2006.<p>Companies with deep pockets like FB, Twitter, YT, Reddit, etc., have the resources to fight most such lawsuits, but what about sites like HackerNews?<p>Do you really think we&#x27;d be having this pleasant conversation right now if YC could be sued for <i>any</i> post or submission on this site?<p>YC would run for the hills, because they don&#x27;t want that sort of liability.  If they moderated <i>anything</i> (and that includes user up&#x2F;downvotes&#x2F;flags), they could be sued for any content hosted here.  The only alternatives they would have would be to shut down or <i>not make or use any moderation tools at all</i>.<p>Which would quickly turn this site into a cesspit of spam, porn, irrelevant postings and other garbage (essentially, 4chan&#x2F;8chan&#x2F;8kun).<p>Do you have a github repo?  If there were no Section 230, and you blocked <i>even one</i> PR that contained spam, porn, discussions about placentas and&#x2F;or other irrelevant content, <i>you</i> are now liable to be sued for <i>any</i> statements made by others in that repo.<p>As such, the result of removing Section 230 protections would create two kinds of Internet resources:<p>1.  Sites which do not allow <i>any</i> third-party content;<p>2.  Sites which allow <i>all</i> third-party content without any limit (think gay, midget furry porn plastered all over a knitting website)<p>And so, no.  I wouldn&#x27;t mind <i>at all</i> if a particular site moderated in favor of a political (or any other) view with which I disagree.  If I don&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;ll go elsewhere.<p>Because of all this, I say that Section 230 is <i>essential</i> to free speech, not a hindrance to it.<p>Feel free to disagree, but you&#x27;ll be wrong[3]<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Stratton_Oakmont,_Inc._v._Prodigy_Services_Co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Stratton_Oakmont,_Inc._v._Prod...</a>.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lkml.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lkml.org&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Barrett_v._Rosenthal" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Barrett_v._Rosenthal</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techdirt.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20200531&#x2F;23325444617&#x2F;hello-youve-been-referred-here-because-youre-wrong-about-section-230-communications-decency-act.shtml" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techdirt.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20200531&#x2F;23325444617&#x2F;hello...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;47&#x2F;230" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;47&#x2F;230</a><p>Edit: Fixed spacing issues.')
