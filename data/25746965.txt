Item(by='buran77', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610460087, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25744919, text='&gt; Which is neither here, not there<p>It is the answer to your question* though, along with a practical example of what happens when instead of stopping obvious radicals and extremists you just ask &quot;but how do we reaaally know?&quot;.<p>&gt;&gt; * how would you discern conspiracists from realists that tell it like it is?<p>If you are <i>willing</i> to take radical action with no evidence, or <i>encourage</i> others to do so you may be called a &quot;conspiracist&quot; and you are definitely a danger to society and democracy. DJT and &quot;Stop The Steal&quot; (whose ban you were objecting to) are today definitely way into the realm of &quot;baseless accusations and incitement to radical actions&quot;. And it turns out reality unfolded exactly as predicted. So what was your objection to them being banned? That they were only &quot;telling it like it is&quot;? That it was FB and Twitter deciding? That it&#x27;s just opinions and won&#x27;t lead to anything more?<p>Your comment was in effect a mix of many mostly questions-related fallacies and vague implications but no direct, actual argument. That&#x27;s no way to carry a useful, productive conversation.<p>But I will say it again, just not agreeing with someone is not a reason to ban them. Banning should be a protective measure when facing an imminent threat.')
