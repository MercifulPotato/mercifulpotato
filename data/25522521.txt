I&#x27;m not prescribing 3 hour sessions, or JavaScript. Target a 45 minute session. Target whatever tools, languages, etc are expected for the role. Maybe that means being language agnostic. Whatever is appropriate.<p>Watching folks make something -- for any significant duration -- is perhaps a better estimator of a candidate&#x27;s genuine job ability than testing how well they approximate an algorithm textbook. Well...that&#x27;s the assumption, anyway.')
