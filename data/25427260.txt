They&#x27;ve even shown that the study might be responsible for as much as half of the life expectancy gap between white and black American men today, because it directly led to mistrust of the medical establishment and caused black men to avoid going to the doctor.<p>That said, I recently read that most black people (falsely) believe that the Tuskegee subjects were deliberately infected with syphilis, but I can&#x27;t find the source right now, and it&#x27;s kind of splitting hairs anyway.')
