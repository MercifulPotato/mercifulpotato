That may last longer than that capacitor and, I guess, is less easily defeated (does that charge fry the stored bits or only the logic for reading and writing it? How do you defend against Evie carefully drilling into the epoxy until contact with the charge is made?)<p>A step up is two chemicals that don’t need oxygen (prevents Evie from opening the device in a nitrogen atmosphere). Bonus points if they only explode when depressurized, as then, you can mix them inside the device.<p>I think techniques like those have been used in safes, but can’t find a link. I did find <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;people.kth.se&#x2F;~msmith&#x2F;is2500_pdf&#x2F;Anti-Tamper%20Techniques_elena.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;people.kth.se&#x2F;~msmith&#x2F;is2500_pdf&#x2F;Anti-Tamper%20Techn...</a>, which discusses this use case.<p>It mentions detecting attempts to X-ray the device, and even mentions using explosives (with a remark “this option is not practical for consumer electronics”). I guess that is not a problem in military hardware (if a F-35 falls into enemy hands, destroying its software probably is more important than destroying the plane)')
