Granted, it was a WYSIWYG editor and today no one writes entire websites that way anymore. But it still allowed basically <i>anyone</i> to start their own website â€“ an idea which I still find very appealing as it&#x27;s so close to Tim Berners-Lee&#x27;s vision of a web where everyone is both a consumer and a producer. (Whether or not this vision was ever realistic is a different matter.)<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mozilla_Composer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mozilla_Composer</a>')
