Item(by='dgavey', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610233645, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25700135, text='I&#x27;ve been working on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dedolist.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dedolist.com&#x2F;</a> on and off since summer. I wanted a one stop place to find and be able to use open data from around the web.  I even have an open API (no authentication required currently) for each data source. I have basically done no marketing at all for it. Mostly just wanted an excuse to play with some new technologies (Netlify and Eleventy in this case).<p>Not sure how much I want to continue adding data sources or supporting it, but it doesn&#x27;t really cost me much keeping it online currently.')
