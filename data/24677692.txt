From the Lightroom FAQ: <i>Drawing to the screen can be slow when Lightroom is using the entire screen of a high-resolution display</i>. Also: don&#x27;t use Lightroom in 2020 if you want to experience a responsive UI.<p><i>To make professional use of a MacBook Pro, you need a CalDigit TS3+</i><p>Wrong.
