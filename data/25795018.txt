Item(by='8f2ab37a-ed6c', descendants=None, kids=[25795098], score=None, time=1610738388, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25794903, text='&gt; By making girls making the first move, you empower girls, you prevent them to get a insulting message from all your matches, you make them feel they decide. Girls are happy of this environment and stay on the app.<p>Respectfully, that doesn&#x27;t make sense. All you did is introduce another step before the male sends them an insulting message. Previously they would get the message right away, now they get it after saying &quot;hi&quot; and pressing the Send button. I still see the &quot;women go first&quot; as pure marketing, with no real empirical backing of being empowering.<p>Maybe the genius of this is that it forces the woman to re-examine the profile of the match one more time after the swipe to see if this is someone they would actually want to talk to. It forces a second sanity check of the match. I could see that argument, but I&#x27;m not fully buying it.')
