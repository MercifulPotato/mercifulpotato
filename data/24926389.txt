Cmake can be a real treat to use, provided you follow the so-called modern cmake approach, and qmake is just an unmaintainable mess of a system.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve never used Conan so I can&#x27;t comment on it.<p>Conan is pretty much orthogonal to any build system. Conan&#x27;s responsibility is pretty much limited to managing the project&#x27;s third-party libraries: it handles downloading their interfaces and libraries, pass their settings, and just integrate them into your project with as little code as possible.<p>There is indeed some modules for CMake that offer some limited functionality that allows third-party packages to be integrated, such as the ExternalProject module. However, those were an afterthought that only add complexity to a project.')
