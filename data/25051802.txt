One suggestion that might or might not be relevant - don&#x27;t do weightlifting at your proper max, and don&#x27;t push your limits that way. Its a way to grow fast but also sure way to injury. There is no way to be at your limit and keep the proper perfect form, every time. You can always add more repetitions to workout.<p>For me weightlifting is about staying in shape for things like mountain adventures, feeling great, looking good. But Arnold-look is a silly goal for long term wellness, and so are the methods to get there. Once I stopped pushing the numbers and focused on more repetitions, I <i>never</i> had any injury. That&#x27;s worth much more than some momentary number of kilos&#x2F;pounds you did today - nobody will care about that tomorrow, but injuries remain, sometimes forever.')
