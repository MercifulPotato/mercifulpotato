But the equation changes if another player has 2+ potential prey species. Then he has to react by spending 1 card <i>for each species he has</i>. Just change your expectations - your goal doesn&#x27;t have to be wrecking other players. Just exploit abundance of vulnerable species.<p>Also, I have Evolution but no Climate (there&#x27;s no localized version). I imagine it may be possible to play smart and use predators to push players into bigger sizes, then change climate to hot. For unfamiliar people - in the game, big animals overheat easier, while small animals struggle with cold.')
