Everyone&#x27;s position is completely determined by what they think of Bannon (or Trump really), so no information is exchanged. Here&#x27;s a thought anyway though. The image he used (heads on pikes) is gruesome and is also a common metaphor for doing something dramatic to deter unwanted behavior, also known as <i>pour encourager les autres</i>. In my mind that usage tilts the remark away from &quot;let&#x27;s literally put their heads on pikes&quot; to the more metaphoric. Now try this thought experiment: come up with some new grisly image of a way to murder someone, without any history of being used as a metaphor, and imagine Bannon had used that image instead. That would tilt the remark more towards being an actual threat.<p>Other people in this thread have made a similar better point. If he had said &quot;heads should roll&quot;, that&#x27;s not a call for decapitation. Another obvious point is that he&#x27;s being an edgelord, going too far but not exactly all the way, in order to get attention. Edgy references to civil war are the same. That&#x27;s not starting a war, but it&#x27;s not totally <i>not</i> starting a war either. There aren&#x27;t precise lines to draw here, probably on purpose.')
