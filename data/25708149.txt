I&#x27;m skeptical whether a serious attempt to clean up violent speech would ever satisfy these platforms, especially when what constitutes violent speech is determined by people who are extremely ideologically hostile and uncharitable towards you (eg. see how Twitter construed Trump&#x27;s last tweets.) But we&#x27;ll never know because I don&#x27;t expect such a reform effort to be made.')
