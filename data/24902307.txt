Item(by='int_19h', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603751618, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24884761, text='My issue with TBP is not so much the hand-waving, it&#x27;s the attempts to explain things that quickly become ridiculous, because the author is clearly out of their domain of expertise. Sophons are one example - they would be more believable unexplained, but when they&#x27;re explained as a circuit <i>on the surface of an unrolled elementary particle</i>, well...<p>Or sometimes it&#x27;s the way something is set up in a particular way, only to be abandoned when it becomes inconvenient. For example, when they come up with a plan to set up a trap using monomolecular filament, it is specifically stated that it can <i>only</i> be made in that shape. But literally one page later, when the question of how to tie it to something without cutting through that something comes up, it&#x27;s immediately dismissed by the same character saying that they can also make sheets of that material, so it can be used as a backstop. Either take is believable per se, but they&#x27;re clearly mutually exclusive.<p>On the whole, the science in Three-Body Problem kinda felt like gratuitous insertion of random (and ften misunderstood) pieces of popular science into the story as a deus ex machina.')
