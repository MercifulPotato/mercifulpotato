Hit the glass very hard in the corner where it is held most firmly so that you get a large force distributed over a small area, that is the largest stress.  The same thing goes for smashing a car window.  I have a small spring loaded device on my keyring for exactly this purpose [1].<p>A slightly smarter thief might carry a hammer specifically designed to break double glazing [2].  Mind you carrying that in the UK could count as &#x27;going equipped&#x27; if you don&#x27;t have a plausible excuse.<p>Otherwise just use a heavy pointed rock in the corner of the window.<p>But of course most burglars don&#x27;t break windows, they take advantage of open windows, doors than can be forced, sliding doors that can simply be lifted out of the track, and other flaws in building security.<p>[1] Like this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smartasaker.no&#x2F;no&#x2F;artiklar&#x2F;resqme-belteskjarer-amp-vindusknuser.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smartasaker.no&#x2F;no&#x2F;artiklar&#x2F;resqme-belteskjarer-a...</a>\n[2] For instance: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.co.uk&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B00EFZC62Q" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.co.uk&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B00EFZC62Q</a>')
