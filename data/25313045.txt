An 80-bit hash has collision resistance of only 2⁴⁰, a mere trillion. This is ample for many applications, but nowhere near enough for many other applications if you consider collisions a bad thing.<p>2¹²⁸ is indeed overkill for most situations, but it’s about trying to make sure choosing IDs randomly is safe. (I was probably playing it a little too safe in saying “<i>most</i> fields”.)')
