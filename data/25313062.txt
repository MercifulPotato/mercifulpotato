Where does this instance come from and what is its scope?<p>&gt; By default, Enumerated Cases have no primitive equivalent. They are simply singleton objects.<p>So, singletons. That way you end up with more global state, with all its consequences.<p>&gt; the following features of objects are not allowed on enumerations:<p>&gt; Enum&#x2F;Case properties<p>Ok, so these are objects without properties. That could solve the global state problem but at this point you may just as well skip the entire object part as I don&#x27;t see why exactly it&#x27;s needed for an identity check.<p>Also, enumerations may have static methods but the provided example says &quot;public function&quot; without the static modifier.')
