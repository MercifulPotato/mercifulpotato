Every 6 decibels is roughly a halving of sound pressure so if you have 30 decibels of loss you’re hearing 1&#x2F;32 of the sound that a person without any hearing loss would hear.  That’s not mild!<p>This is a very cool project, I wonder if modern hearing aids work in a similar way- by tuning their response to the person wearing them?')
