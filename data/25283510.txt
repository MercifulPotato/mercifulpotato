They do not. If you sign for 400k of RSUs over 4 years with a 1 year cliff and the stock rockets up 2x just before your first vest and then plateaus, you’re still getting only 400k.<p>There’s literally no difference to a regular salary except you get paid out twice and it makes taxes more annoying because you have to pay estimated taxes quarterly instead of doing it once like normal people.<p>Netflix has also proven this obsession with RSUs is unnecessary. You can have strong growth without it and in large public companies, the theory that this somehow incentivizes employees in any meaningful way has a severe lack of any evidence.')
