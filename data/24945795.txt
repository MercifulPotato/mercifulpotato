I was looking for a static site gen that was a bit more comfortable than my previous shell scripts around pandoc approach.<p>I settled on Hugo because it ticked all the boxes and even had org mode support.<p>The next three nights were horrible. I&#x27;m a professional web dev, full stack, I&#x27;ve used dozens of langs, frameworks, probably hundreds of tools. It took me three nights to set up a basic home page for an academic CV and some publication lists. Nothing more. And even then the whole thing was wonky and super unreliable for inscrutable reasons. Big red flag.<p>I was angry and frustrated, and I started doubting myself.\nSo I pulled the plug. Tried Zola, I was done in 1.5hrs. Start to finish, just done. Zola is great.')
