I would say zwift is pretty fun but after awhile its the group events that keep me engaged and give me the extra boost.<p>If you&#x27;re still building out the roadmap put a little bit of resources (or thought spent) around the ability to add in live instructor classes further on down the line.  That way you can bring that market along with you instead of the situation that Peleton and Zwift have that is an either or situation (different hardware considerations there, but annoying you are locked into one option).  Different model and capital allocations - but worth considering.<p>Best of luck!')
