By your peculiar definition, it just means that you don&#x27;t own the home that comes with HOA encumbrance.<p>I don&#x27;t think your peculiar definition is the same as the law normally uses.  By itself, it&#x27;s as fine a definition as long as everyone is careful in their use of words, and doesn&#x27;t try to draw build moral arguments from issues of definition.<p>I&#x27;m not a lawyer.  But I suspect that your first paragraph mentioning issues of discrimination might be able to have some legal firepower.  I doubt you&#x27;d get much mileage out of anti-trust concerns, unless a particular HOA was dominating a housing market?<p>As for your second paragraph: those sounds like excellent reasons for an individual such as you or me NOT to buy a home that&#x27;s part of a HOA.  But they furnish no reason to outlaw HOAs, ie to forbid other people from forming them or joining them.')
