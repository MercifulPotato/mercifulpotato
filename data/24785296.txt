My girls thrived in school while my boy did not. They are all equally brilliant and talented in their own way.<p>My son was on elite traveling basketball teams, all star baseball teams, and earned a podium medal for track at state. He hated school and failed to get his diploma -- one credit short. (He made it up later at a community college.) He excelled as an US Army Ranger in a high-skill combat role with the Rangers (fire support specialist).<p>He was diagnosed with ADHD at a young age, but I didn&#x27;t believe in such a thing back then. (I believe it now given my late diagnosis and ongoing treatment and struggles.)<p>I hated school too what a boring nightmare. I still feel guilty about taking my son to school when he was 6 years-old and begging me to let him hang out with me instead.<p>That memory will always be a record of one of my greatest regrets and failures.')
