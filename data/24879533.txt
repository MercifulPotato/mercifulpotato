Seeing them and thinking &quot;what if there&#x27;s something we are missing&quot; is exactly what many particle physicists also think. This is why the existence of particles and interactions addressing those gaps have been hypothesized to death and then some. Trying to compare some of these hypothesis with the experiment is a major part of fundamental physics today, second only to measuring the things we know exist more precisely. In many cases the comparison has been performed, and when it has been the conclusion was &quot;if there is something there, then the parameters must be such that our instruments did not measure the effects yet&quot;. This is why particle physicists are pushing for better instruments.')
