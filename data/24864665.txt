And&#x2F;or business people who bought in the right place at the right time lol.<p>The property tax laws in California that benefit long time homeowners also benefit long time commercial property owners. In California, if proposition 15 passes AND a ton of companies stop leasing space, a lot of those firms will probably have their arm twisted enough to sell the properties. That will lead to a lot more property tax revenue.<p>That, or the commercial properties get torn down and replaced with residential properties.<p>Or none of the above and California becomes like Detroit, as some people in another thread predicted, lmao.')
