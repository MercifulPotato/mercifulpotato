All I&#x27;m saying is that, practically speaking, it&#x27;s a huge limitation. Imagine if Clojure couldn&#x27;t leverage Java&#x27;s ecosystem. Or, rather, it could but first you have to fork each package so you can change all the import statements and standard lib calls.<p>I do wonder if they couldn&#x27;t have provided a shim for the Node system-APIs, and maybe even a compatibility-mode for Node&#x27;s import style? Something where you could drop a Node project into Deno, complete with NPM dependencies, and immediately run it, and then gradually convert it to &quot;idiomatic&quot; Deno code with the proper (typed!) system APIs and URL-style imports. If they hope to eventually replace Node, &quot;scrap the entire library ecosystem&quot; doesn&#x27;t feel like a very realistic roadmap.')
