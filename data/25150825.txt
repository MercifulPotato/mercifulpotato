With the constant advancement in treatment, many previously terminal diagnoses may be survivable today and you want to make sure the doctor isn&#x27;t missing any of the new treatment options.<p>I think stage 4 used to be considered terminal, but there are patients who survive it now. One that comes to mind was the mother of Gary Lincoff (or was it Paul Stamets). She had stage 4 breast cancer and is in remission after her trametes versicolor augmented chemo regimen. So there&#x27;s stuff out there which is still in trials that could extend his time even further. Stuff like the trametes versicolor can even be available to you without a prescription.')
