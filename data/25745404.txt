When the button glows &#x27;red&#x27; the power is removed from the microphones.<p>Does the microphone take any time to boot up? How far could a malicious SoC get by toggling &quot;reset&quot; on and off very fast? If you toggle the microphone on and off at 96kHz with e.g. a 1% duty cycle, then you&#x27;d be able to sample the level from the microphone at 96kHz, and the LED would still be glowing at 99% of its usual current (which would be visually indistinguishable from 100%). This would allow the SoC to record audio at full quality, and still leave the LED glowing.')
