People use Whatsapp because outside US and Asia is the worldwide de facto standard for messaging. The new TOS does not state that Whatsapp is going to read your messages, actually even the non-techo-savvy population in Europe <i>knows</i> that Whatsapp uses end-to-end encryption (they just know that &quot;it cannot be intercepted&quot;), so they use it for good reasons, and will continue to do so, because 99% of people don&#x27;t give a shit about Facebook sealing your profile image and list of contacts or stuff like that. So it&#x27;s not going to happen that there is a mass move outside of Whatsapp anytime soon. I also find very curious that people are concerned with that, but not with the fact that Facebook and Twitter can decide who can talk and who not, to te extend that one person can be the president of US but not writing his thoughts on social networks. You will hardly find somebody more against Trump than me, but that&#x27;s not the point, the point is that is a lot more concerning that social network owners can decide what &quot;free speech&quot; is.')
