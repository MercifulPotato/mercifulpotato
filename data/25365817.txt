The reason he was revealed is because he got sued by a woman who claimed that she knew where the treasure was but her phone was hacked. She accuses the (previously anonymous) finder of hacking her phone.<p>It&#x27;s actually pretty clever of her.  He&#x27;ll most likely want to settle out of court by just giving her some money.')
