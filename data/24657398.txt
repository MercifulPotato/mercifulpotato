Imagine the process of colorizing -- imagine there was a dye color that we couldn&#x27;t manufacture prior to year X.  And we train colorization on a dataset that whether known to the curator or not includes this dye.  Are we creating images that are a misrepresentation of the past?<p>On the other hand, &quot;science&quot; often does some pretty (I think) extreme extrapolation of things like dinosaur fossils, so maybe it shouldn&#x27;t be such a big deal and it&#x27;s just something we have to live with.')
