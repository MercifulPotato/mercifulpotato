We, as a people, haven&#x27;t figured out to how to get along with each other even though we&#x27;re all sentient. Why should machines behave differently as they become sentient?<p>Whatever the case, I&#x27;m less worried about machines than I am about people <i>with</i> machines. At least for the foreseeable future.<p>Heck, if we&#x27;re talking sci-fi, the _truly_ destructive beings in Blade Runner weren&#x27;t the synthetic humans (even though they became sentient), it was the &quot;real&quot; humans with their organizations, their power, and their machines all at their disposal.')
