And we&#x27;ve discovered they are complex and expensive, and we&#x27;ve discovered they take forever to design, and that very often the construction process fails and the investment is lost.<p>Energy storage technologies have the property that they can rapidly iterate new designs, on a smaller scale than nuclear.   They are inside nuclear&#x27;s decision loop.   The mammals are outbreeding the dinosaurs (yes, I know that metaphor is unfair to the actual animals).<p>There&#x27;s a reason business people don&#x27;t swallow the kind of BS you sling on nuclear, and it isn&#x27;t because they&#x27;re Greenpeace members.')
