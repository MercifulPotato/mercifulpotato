The overhaul between major versions, at least between 2 and 3, was large enough to warrant a new name.<p>Microsoft has introduced just as many new toolkits during the same time, but nobody expects WinForms to be backwards compatible with MFC.<p>That would have given application developers a better chance to keep maintaining the toolkit long after GTK developers lost interest.')
