For now, Intel offers (relatively) poor CPU performance and poor peripheral performance.<p>So, if your software can&#x27;t run on Altra, the other choice for high performing servers is AMD, not Intel, unless you&#x27;re just locked into Intel for historical reasons.<p>Intel does have some nice budget offerings for cheap servers, though, such as Xeon D.')
