For example, renters in Germany have very strong legal protection. It is very difficult for your landlord to kick you out, or raise the rent dramatically. I could certainly afford to buy the flat I live in, but I prefer to have the money invested in the stock market instead, and have someone to call (who also pays for) any problems. I also lived in rented apartments in France and UK, and it felt significantly different: Limited-term contracts, poor maintenance, (poorly) furnished - I would not want to live that way forever (of course, I choose these contracts because I only intended to stay for a limited time).')
