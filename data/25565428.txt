If there were an open source project that made running server applications (personal blog, email, game server, file backups, mastodon, etc) easy for non-technical people, it would open up whole new use cases (in the same sense there are kinds of software now that wouldn&#x27;t have made sense before everyone carried around a phone).<p>It would also be a whalefall for the hosted vm industry if it caught on, which is why I&#x27;m surprised it isn&#x27;t being worked on by Amazon or similar.  The only company I know of working on this is Urbit, which seems at this point unlikely to take off for a variety of reasons.')
