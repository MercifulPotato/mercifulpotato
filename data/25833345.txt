The conditions on the surface of the earth and at the bottom of the ocean are vastly different.<p>DNA stabilizing:<p>Much lower T (below 0C)\nPractically no radiation (an ocean above you blocking it all)<p>DNA de-stabilizing:\nCorrosive chemicals spewing from a nearby volcano (but only if one is near you!)\nRadiation from said volcano and rocks (but they&#x27;d have to be closer still, due to shielding from the water)<p>So unless the 500 year half life is the &quot;self-damaging&quot; rate, I&#x27;d expect DNA at the bottom to last much longer.')
