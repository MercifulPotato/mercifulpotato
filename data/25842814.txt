Also nonsensically false that &quot;mars bars instead of sandwiches&quot; would get any intervention.<p>You are very misinformed on this topic. Almost everything you have said is directly, easily contradicted simply by looking at the widely available data on foster care.  Children <i>arrive</i> in foster care with attachment disorders - the majority of children don&#x27;t even enter foster care until they are too old to develop an attachment disorder, according to the diagnostic criteria. Almost 50% of children who are taken into foster care in the US have only one placement (1). (Unsurprisingly, being diagnosed with RAD correlates very highly with having more placements. There&#x27;s likely causality in both directions there.)<p>I don&#x27;t know why you have such a strong opinion here, but it&#x27;s not based on reality.<p>(1) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.childtrends.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-share-of-children-in-foster-care-living-with-relatives-is-growing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.childtrends.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-share-of-children-in-fo...</a>')
