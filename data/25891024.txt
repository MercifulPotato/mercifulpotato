What percentage comes from suburban versus urban areas?<p>What is that money actually going to? In California, over half goes to school funding and suburban schools get less since the state gives more to poorer (mostly urban) school districts.<p>The typical complaint is that suburban areas use more water, energy, and their roads cost more. However, they often have to pay for all that. Local roads are paid by local government (read the suburbs). Water districts are often also local.<p>The only areas where suburbs may use more (but not pay more) is in building and maintaining infrastructure: highways, electrical, gas. The power infrastructure is long paid for and is actually a regulated utility so you are limited to highways. I wonder what taxes are going to be created as people switch to electric cars. There are already cries that the punitive gas tax against driving will become ineffective.')
