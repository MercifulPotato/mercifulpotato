Item(by='themanmaran', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611437071, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25881192, text='&gt;  Leaving money tied up on the service indefinitely is not really an option when you start talking about the kind of money that would actually motivate someone to do a lot of work.<p>This is something that I&#x27;ve been going back and forth on for a while. I&#x27;ve considered having the money be a &#x27;pledge&#x27; like Kickstarter. Where people pledge the funds and pay out when the issue gets resolved.<p>But that can add some technical concerns (keeping track of peoples bank details to charge them) as well as less assurance that the developer will get paid.<p>And I especially don&#x27;t want to have a platform where a developer puts in the work and doesn&#x27;t earn the bounty.<p>Parallel effort is another tricky one to solve. And I see it all the time even without funding involved. Someone comments that they&#x27;re working on an issue, and then everyone else drops it for 6 months only to realize that person dropped it too.<p>I think that splitting bounties could be a good solution. Have multiple people contribute towards a branch, and the funding gets distributed evenly.')
