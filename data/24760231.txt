Some people take it to mean &quot;the ability to care about others on a moral level&quot;, and others take it to mean &quot;the emotional intelligence to detect and understand the nuances of another&#x27;s thoughts and feelings&quot;. I believe the author was talking about the second, not the first. It&#x27;s entirely possible to be an idealistic and good-hearted person without having a shred of emotional intelligence.')
