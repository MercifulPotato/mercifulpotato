Things like nested if-else with multiple conditionals are just a little more persnickity if you&#x27;ve been using C braces for decades. But the language, in the Borland dialects that most are using now, is somewhere in between C and C++ in terms of power overall: it&#x27;s a little safer by default, still manual memory, but without needing to fling around quite so many pointers. And those compile times! A pretty well-suited language for game coding, actually.<p>And in terms of writing production code, libraries may or may not be a barrier. Basically, Pascal&#x27;s current ecosystem exists in the shadow of one of the best RAD environments of the 90&#x27;s - Delphi. That&#x27;s where a lot of the code got written, and there&#x27;s a definite focus on native desktop apps that remains. There are certainly good libraries available, but many are old, Delphi-centric, and lack polish - haphazard accumulations from developers that are very &quot;get-er-done&quot; and unconcerned about reuse. You can always bind C code, of course, but today it&#x27;s easy to end up saying, &quot;well, but I could just get a working library in (Go&#x2F;Python&#x2F;Node&#x2F;etc) and be done&quot; and thus end your Pascal journey before it starts.')
