Open a public &quot;bet&quot; or similar<p>2. Make it so that you can always wiggle yourself out of the bet (on nitpicking and legalese)<p>3. If someone challenges you wiggle yourself out hope that person sues you and then use nitpicking and legalese to win the court case <i>about that proof of you being wrong not being applicable for the bet</i><p>4. Then claim that the court agreed with you that you have right with your bet  (which isn&#x27;t what the court case was about but people don&#x27;t know and sometime don&#x27;t (want to) understand).<p>There had been some case of this pattern in Germany wrt. to (I think) vaccines and autism. If I remember correctly (I might not) their trick was to require a single scientific paper formulated in a way so that if you paper has other papers it refers to it&#x27;s no longer eligible for that bet and in turn to win the bet you would have to do multiple large case studies from scratch in cram them into one massive paper covering multiple topics and the joint conclusion. I.e. it&#x27;s not very feasible.')
