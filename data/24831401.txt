Item(by='SahAssar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603144022, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24831211, text='&gt; Websites are simply apps installed in the browser without asking for permission<p>That actually work on the platforms I choose. There are many apps that only work on iOS&#x2F;Android that I want to run on my desktop or a more pure linux phone. I just want to be able to consume a service from a platform that clearly have the technical capabilities to do so, but no, it has to be a &quot;app&quot;.<p>&gt; Notorious for tracking abilities<p>And a lot easier to chose&#x2F;disable them. This summer many apps (including stuff like spotify) would not even start on iOS because the facebook SDK crashed. On the spotify web player I can choose to block calls to recaptcha, facebook and similar with umatrix. Do you think that apps on average have less tracking or just that you tend to pay for apps but not for webapps and therefore get higher quality apps?<p>&gt; data storage tied to the browser<p>Great! Data storage on the client should either be treated as unreliable or the only storage (for stuff where there is no &quot;cloud&quot; or privacy is critical). Tying storage to a single vendor (like icloud or google drive) is a very, very bad idea. Web browsers also have a well defined interface for you to inspect the data saved locally if you want.<p>&gt; performance lower<p>For the majority of apps this does not matter. The reason webapps are usually slow is not that the platform is slow, it&#x27;s that companies copy websites that are stuffed with tracking (if you block that they tend to be much quicker). They suck because the people who made them made them suck.<p>Most chat, mail, news, or any other form of text&#x2F;image&#x2F;video app could easily be performant enough as a webapp. Hell, amazon even made their real time game streaming service a webapp. The platform is not the problem.<p>&gt; data consumption unpredictable<p>Not sure what is different here from native apps? Both can auto-update, both can download assets at-will, right?<p>&gt; identification tied to web technologies<p>Yes please! That means it&#x27;s portable and not tied into google&#x2F;apple!')
