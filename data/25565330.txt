Landlord wouldn&#x27;t have any (financial) incentive to approve since they get money either way, and taking on a temporary subtenant is usually higher-risk than a regular renter.<p>Then again, if the current tenant has a lead on someone to potentially take over the lease and become a long-term tenant, then everybody wins.')
