My 2010 Mazda 3, used almost entirely on country driving with an average speed of 81km&#x2F;h since I got it, sits at an average of 5.2L&#x2F;100km. I recall figures from a couple of family members with similar or slightly larger cars on mostly Melbourne suburban driving, and they’re something like 8–9L&#x2F;100km. My parents’ Nissan Elgrand (2007 I think?) hit something like 13–15L&#x2F;100km before it got switched to LPG, if I recall correctly, and it was acknowledged to be a <i>huge</i> fuel guzzler (so they got rid of it once enough of their children had left home that they didn’t need it), far more than the smaller-and-lighter-but-same-seat-count ’86 Tarago had been.')
