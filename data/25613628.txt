If they read that you&#x27;ve made performance improvements, then great they can continue to play Candy Crush but not have it crash so often.  They won&#x27;t CARE that you &quot;optimised the use of the strcopy function&quot; or some crap like that.<p>Remember the app stores are targeted towards consumer users of phones, not tech people that live on Hacker News websites.')
