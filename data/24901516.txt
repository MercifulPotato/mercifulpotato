As she says, weather doesn&#x27;t really work like that; it&#x27;s just an analogy. But an analogy to an unfamiliar thing isn&#x27;t really going to help a whole lot of people.<p>The problem with climate change isn&#x27;t about radiative forcing causing a large, discrete jump in temperature. It&#x27;s a fairly classical, non-chaotic effect. Add a little CO2 and get a little temperature increase; add a lot of CO2 and get a large temperature increase -- when averaged over time (a period of several years).<p>There are plenty of chaotic elements to understand about both weather and climate, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll help most people understand the difference between the two.')
