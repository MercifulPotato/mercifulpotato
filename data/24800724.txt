And when something, like this gif, catches public attention, related resources will be linked.  A little bit.  In an unprepared, ad hoc, shallow, and unfunded kind of way.<p>A &quot;teachable moment&quot; is an transient opportunity to offer insight.  And unplanned opportunity, but one a teacher trains and prepares for.<p>With viral content reaching so many, are we missing an opportunity by not being organized to exploit them as teachable moments?  To rapidly and reactively link related content?  History, transport, economics, construction. Might not a spike of viral be broadened, by better facilitating people following up on whatever aspect of the spike tickled their interest?<p>The compressed timescale makes things harder.  But also easier - coping with the severe content-creation bottleneck of copyright is easier in a transient context.<p>How might we explore this space?  Perhaps strengthen the existing &quot;here&#x27;s something related and interesting&quot; pattern by aggregating and propagating such?  A tweet &quot;here are some links from HN&quot;, and an HN comment &quot;here are some links from the twitter discussion&quot;?  Those are variously suboptimal, so what else?')
