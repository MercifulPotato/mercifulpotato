I definitely want to get an electric at some point, but at the moment it&#x27;s not practical for us (mostly the lack of off-street parking where we live).<p>If we could charge up at home I think we&#x27;d only ever need to charge on route about three or four times a year, when going on holiday. If the car rental industry was a bit more consumer friendly (they seem mostly designed around business use), renting for the holidays would be very appealing.<p>It will be interesting to see if campsites will let you charge up from their electric hookups. I can see that being a thing in the future.')
