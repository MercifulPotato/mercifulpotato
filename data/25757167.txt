The primary limitation on what businesses can and can&#x27;t do with who uses their platforms are that they need to avoid affecting protected classes.<p>If you think we need to protect MAGA supporters as a class, I just flat out disagree that there&#x27;s any cause for it. That group of folks are largely already brimming with privilege that protects them (see walking away from storming the Capitol after killing multiple people).<p>If you think that the government should force private entities to not enforce consequences to speech they disagree with, I believe the government would struggle to prove that that doesn&#x27;t itself impact the free speech rights of the private entities and it face immediate law suits to overturn such a law. The 1st amendment protects us from the government, not us from each other.')
