It&#x27;s a real shame because the device itself has a lot of potential if they can remediate some hardware decisions like speaker out put placement.<p>For it&#x27;s size and cost the display is great and it&#x27;s something you can just pick up and play easily. I was really looking forward to more opening of this type of device but it looks like Nintendo is putting the kibosh on that.<p>The Analogue Pocket is cool but it&#x27;s much pricier and who knows if they&#x27;ll be able to produce more or if they want to.')
