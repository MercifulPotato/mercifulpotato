I find it ironic that being caught lying once is considered something that proves you&#x27;re not officer material. That is, of course, it&#x27;s the &quot;caught&quot; part, because it seems rare that anyone higher up is ever actually caught for anything; that&#x27;s what the scapegoats are for.<p>To be very clear, I appreciate the military and all those men and women that serve in it. I just think it&#x27;s ridiculous to think that they are of a higher moral caliber than the rest of the population. They&#x27;re people, just like you and me. And learning from your mistakes is part of being human. You can&#x27;t learn from a mistake if there&#x27;s never second chances.')
