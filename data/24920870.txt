There&#x27;s a large community of people who enjoy using it and helping others solve their problems on Discord, Reddit, and Discourse.  Experienced embedded developers are saying really positive things about Rust for their work, with the exception that the open source ecosystem remains in its infancy.  I&#x27;m noticing embedded Rust job listings sprouting up in a lot of industries, so I think we have much to be optimistic about at this point.  Also, teams such as those at Ferrous systems are focusing on long-term viability of Rust for embedded by investing in the ecosystem and creating onboarding pathways: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ferrous-systems.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ferrous-systems.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;</a><p>Even if you don&#x27;t wind up doing embedded work, you can cffi your python to Rust libraries for performance optimizations.  You probably won&#x27;t be writing optimized Rust for a while, so don&#x27;t plan for quick wins with Rust extensions until you&#x27;re several months into working with Rust full time.')
