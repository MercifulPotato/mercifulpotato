It&#x27;s because on facebook and twitter they can push their post to a big audience, even if no one is searching for the kind of content they&#x27;re publishing.<p>A self hosted blog&#x2F;website does not have this feature.<p>Just as an example, the government does have an official self-hosted blog: whitehouse.gov and the President could have simply published all their thoughts and messages there instead of Twitter. They could also easily have a personal self-hosted blog. But why didn&#x27;t and don&#x27;t they? Instead choosing to post to Twitter?')
