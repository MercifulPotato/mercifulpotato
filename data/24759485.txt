I’ll pay for their hotel, so I can live in a smaller, cheaper, better located condo for the rest of the year.<p>Then friends won&#x27;t visit, it&#x27;s more of a hassle to schedule - however infrequent these visits are they&#x27;ll be even less frequent.<p>&gt; I have to schlep a bunch of kids far away? I’ll get a Modo minivan, a local car share, for a few hours. Let someone else maintain that gorgeous van.<p>You&#x27;ll go fewer places and do fewer things if everytime you want to go somewhere you have to deal with getting a rideshare van.<p>&gt; Need some outdoors time? Walk a couple blocks to a park. I’m not interested in mowing something I only use a couple hours a week.<p>No backyard cookouts, no sitting on the deck, you&#x27;ll go to the park less frequently.<p>It&#x27;s the same for the rest of it, there are good reasons to reduce some of these things but the reasons he gives dismiss the true value.<p>Even owning a car vs. rideshare, sure rideshare can work out to be cheaper (sometimes) but having every travel decision be a purchase decision is a lot of overhead and is a constant pressure not to go somewhere.')
