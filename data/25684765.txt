Item(by='hairofadog', descendants=None, kids=[25684776], score=None, time=1610114398, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25684526, text='A family member recently relayed the story of his kid begging for $20 for a “bunny suit” Fortnight skin and how he, the adult, slowly came to understand that the skin didn’t even do anything; it just ever-so-slightly changed how the game looked (which I already knew, but his exasperation was amusing). We were like, huh. Kids today.<p>Anyway, for reasons I don’t totally understand, in my experience this dad’s bunny-suit exasperation is how most people feel about paying for software of any kind. It’s not just frugality but indignation at the very idea that they be asked to pay for software.')
