An injection of capital provides runway at a minimum and leverage in many cases regardless of a company&#x27;s situation at nearly every stage. Your suggestion of &quot;growth&quot; as the metric to be maximized is the main issue. If an enterprise wants to generate maximum short-term profits for the owner, establish a large market share initially, or generate maximum cash flows long-term, each presents a very different view of when and how capital can solve problems.')
