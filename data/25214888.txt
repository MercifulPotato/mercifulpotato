Slack is adding $200m per year in sales growth and burning massive amounts of red ink to do it, which will harm rather than improve Salesforce&#x27;s financial situation. Salesforce is approaching $20b in sales, to generate a mere 10% growth in the coming year they obviously need $2b per year in additional sales - that $200m from Slack is almost meaningless, other than being a shovel to the head of CRM shareholders in price paid to get it.<p>Slack is such a horrible financial Titanic that post acquisition it&#x27;ll destroy most of Salesforce&#x27;s already mediocre profitability. Salesforce generated $463m in operating income in its most recent fiscal year; Slack lost $330m in operating income over the prior four quarters.<p>Slack&#x27;s growth prospects are bad to make matters worse. This deal will result in a giant writedown in the not very distant future. It&#x27;ll eventually be considered a bad joke that someone paid ~$25 billion for Slack.<p>For Slack&#x27;s part, it&#x27;s a brilliant exit. Get out while they can still fetch an extreme bubble multiple. Their stock had performed so poorly post IPO (while everything else cloud &amp; remote zoomed) because the market knows their prospects are not great.<p>In 2016 Salesforce was getting a valuation of about 10-12 times sales, before this latest mania really lifted off, with a market cap similar to or lower than what eg Snowflake is getting today (with Snowflake now doing around 1&#x2F;9th the sales that Salesforce was back then, ha). Slack is getting 30-35 times sales on its exit with no evidence they have a great business that will endure (versus a mere product that Microsoft will forever be squeezing the financial life out of by making the segment inhospitable territory). It&#x27;s not just a product? Sure it is, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s about to end up in the belly of Salesforce as a really dumb acquisition mistake typical of later stage bubbles.')
