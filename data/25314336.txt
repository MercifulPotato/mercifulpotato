A quick check shows that it was released in 2006, making it a fair bit older than the servers I most recently used it on. For what it&#x27;s worth, FreeDOS 1.2 was released four years ago and the <i>third</i> release candidate of 1.3 was just released <i>this past summer</i>. It seems that FreeDOS, at 26, is still alive and, in fact, doing quite well!<p>To be clear, I&#x27;ve not actually attempted to boot any of the other DOS systems in, well, quite a long time -- at least 10 years for MS-DOS and likely 20 years or more for DR-DOS and PC-DOS -- as I haven&#x27;t had any reason to. FreeDOS has been a superior replacement since before the turn of the century.<p>In my case, FreeDOS is booted via (i)PXE and the &quot;hard disk&quot; (image), which contains the various firmware images, utilities, etc., is downloaded via HTTP and loaded as a ramdisk. In those rare instances when it&#x27;s actually been needed, it is just so absolutely useful.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;d be a bit surprised if MS-DOS (a.k.a. PC-DOS) did not (for the most part) also &quot;just work&quot;(TM) ...<p>... and, now that I&#x27;ve said that, I&#x27;m fairly confident that MS-DOS 5.0 (1991, IIRC?) is also available on the netboot server. I can&#x27;t confirm that at the moment but (assuming it is) now I&#x27;m quite curious so I&#x27;ll try to remember to try booting my workstation into it the next time I happen to restart it.')
