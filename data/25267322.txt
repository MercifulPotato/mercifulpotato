I don&#x27;t know why but whenever I use a Linux desktop, the mouse either moves too fast or too slow and there&#x27;s no sweet spot.<p>The GUI keyboards shortcuts are all messed up: I love the &quot;⌘&quot; (super) key because then ⌘C is copy everywhere, and ^C is an interrupt in the terminal. I have ⌘← , ⌥← , ⌘⌫ , ⌥⌫ , ⇧⌘← , ⇧⌥← ingrained in my memory (for moving, deleting, and selecting by line or by word). I have fussed with remapping keys but there&#x27;s always that one app that won&#x27;t cooperate.<p>So why not both: shift down from a single the top of the line 16&quot; MacBook Pro to a MacBook Air, and then pair it with a desktop running Linux that I SSH into over LAN.<p>- LAN internet speeds are fast enough that I don&#x27;t notice any latency.<p>- I&#x27;ll have convenient access to both Linux and macOS, for testing.<p>- I can spec up the Linux desktop as much as I want. It could even have a Threadripper.<p>- The MacBook Air will have better battery life than any Linux or BSD laptop.<p>- I can use Tailscale[1] to set up a no-fuss VPN, so that I can still SSH to it even when I&#x27;m not on LAN.<p>- All the GUIs will still be macOS, so things like mouse speed and keyboard shortcuts will all be familiar.<p>It might even net out to be around the same price. My 16&quot; MacBook Pro was like $3,000. An M1 MacBook Air would be $1,500 (with some storage and memory), and the remaining $1,500 is more than enough to build a beefy desktop.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tailscale.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tailscale.com&#x2F;</a>')
