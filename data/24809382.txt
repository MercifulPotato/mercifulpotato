On top of that SwiftUI has been a disaster compared to Apple&#x27;s existing UI toolkits because it&#x27;s less featured than UIKit, less reliable and unlike UIKit, there&#x27;s no new hardware forcing its adoption.<p>None of this is new per se; weird Apple specific edges like @UIApplicationMain and @NSManaged have always polluted the language. But, it&#x27;s hard to buy in on &quot;Swift world domination&quot; when server-side Swift is stillborn, Rust is more appealing as a better bare metal language, Catalyst and SwiftUI are weaker than AppKit and UIKit, the last time Swift got a useful language feature was guard let in Swift 2.')
