It cannot be because RealPlayer Downloader is a browser extension that provides a &quot;download&quot; button within the WWW page itself and youtube-dl works from URLs given on a command line, because other YouTube downloaders like iTube are also able to download a video given only a YouTube page URL.<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itube.aimersoft.com&#x2F;free-mac-youtube-downloader.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itube.aimersoft.com&#x2F;free-mac-youtube-downloader.html</a> (&quot;free download YouTube videos to Mac in a Click.&quot;)<p>Or maybe it isn&#x27;t a difference nowadays.  This was some years ago.  But there does not seem to be much talk about having to update these downloaders frequently like youtube-dl.')
