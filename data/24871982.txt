I know these people better than the schmuck reporters. Just because the official numbers shrank doesn&#x27;t mean the actual constituency did.<p>Do you also only think that crimes happen only if it gets reported? Meaning if 50 burglaries happen to 100 people but only 2 people reported it, does that mean the burglary rate is 2% or 50%? This is why I don&#x27;t bother with these worthless metrics as I&#x27;ll explain in the next paragraph regarding trump.<p>Did you ever wonder why a lot of people don&#x27;t publicly come out as trump supporters? They have very liberal friends that they don&#x27;t want to lose because they said they&#x27;d vote for trump. That sentiment still lingers here. Most leftist people who argue against trump vehemently do so in a way that these regular folk that end up voting for trump keep it under wraps because they&#x27;re too scared to publicly say anything.<p>Just because the &quot;numbers&quot; shrank, doesn&#x27;t me the actual voters did. There is a lot of societal pressure involving politics and only on the left is it worthy of breaking a friendship over. This is why many white liberals who voted trump keep their mouths shut.')
