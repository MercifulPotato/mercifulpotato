Naively I even shared it here. After learning that someone in England was arrested only for having links to pirated movies I took everything down.<p>It&#x27;s a shame how hard they are coming after torrents and copyright content like that. As I kid growing up in Brazil I wouldn&#x27;t have access to a lot of movies, games and tv shows if weren&#x27;t for torrents and pirate content. Now a days I can buy these games and pay for a subscription to movies and tv shows, but I learned of them by downloading first.<p>I wonder how much it hurts a tv show like GOT to have some kid watching it without buying.')
