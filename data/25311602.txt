Those same people pressed records for other artists who did not make it big, or even fell flat. Their labor input was exactly the same.<p>The difference was in the songs the Beatles created. The Beatles created those songs, not the laborers who pressed the records.<p>Or take Stevie Nicks, who google reports is worth $100m. Are the stage hands who set things up for a concert creating that wealth for her? Nope. Those stage hands could do exactly the same for my unrecognized musical talent, I could pay them the same, and would lose gigantic amounts of money.<p>Is Stevie exploiting those stage hands? If she is, then wouldn&#x27;t those stage hands doing the exact same work for me be exploiting <i>me</i> for my foolish money?<p>Bottom line is people are entitled to what they can negotiate for. They don&#x27;t give it back if their employer loses money, so why would they be entitled to what their employer made?')
