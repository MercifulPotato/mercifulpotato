On the other hand, most American presidents are nice &amp; courteous at face value while raining drone bombs on unsuspecting non-Americans, spreading Freedom (with a capital F).<p>As a non-American, I would rather Americans endure a bit longer and the remaining (7B-0.3B) world citizens have 4 more years of (relative) US non-involvement. Selfish, I know, but the world needs a breather.')
