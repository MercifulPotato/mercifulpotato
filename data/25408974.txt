Martin, and the silmarillion by J.R.R. Tolkien. A pretty standard selection of well-known books in the Fantasy genre.<p>Out of the 90 books I get, 53 either have the word &quot;Dragon&quot; in the title, or a dragon on the cover of the book. Clearly, a majority of the results also fall in the Fantasy genre, so have my doubts this counts as escaping the echo chamber.<p>On the other hand, there are a lot of books in that list that I have never heard about, and that look interesting (insofar as you can judge a book by its cover).\nWhen I&#x27;m done with my current series of books, I&#x27;ll have a good look at this :-)')
