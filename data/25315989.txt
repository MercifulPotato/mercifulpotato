As long as you don&#x27;t let applications touch the pixel data of decoded images, it&#x27;s all within libraries, and you can change the bit depth of buffers and change how they map to physical pixels easily.<p>Most frameworks don&#x27;t let applications touch pixel data without jumping through some hoops, because by restricting it you can implement things like lazy loading, GPU jpeg decoding GPU resizing, etc.')
