They typically fail because a tiny amount of crud in the feedwater, whether it came from the city supply or somewhere in the domestic water supply, plugs up the flow restrictor.  I&#x27;ve fixed two like that.  I replaced the flow restrictor on mine with an adjustable needle valve.  3 gallons per hour is a lot. I have mine adjusted to emit just a slight dribble.  I think too much and the water on the biscuit is too cold to evaporate well, too little and the biscuit is not wet enough.  I&#x27;ve considered making an Arduino circuit to flood the thing thoroughly at startup and then pulse it, but it works well enough as it is with the slight dribble.  I think the newest fanciest humidifiers may actually have the pulse feature.<p>The &quot;biscuit&quot; in there was kind of old, so I went to some trouble to acquire a new one.  Difference in humidification:  None whatsoever.  But while it doesn&#x27;t impressively cycle the humidistat (I monitor that) like the old rotating foam drum humidifier did, the air quality is fine.<p>The previous &quot;standing water&quot; type humidifier was a nightmare.  Some sort of microorganism in there caused copious amounts of yellow crud on everything and no amount of cleaning could get rid of it for good.  Air quality wasn&#x27;t affected, but... yuck.  I didn&#x27;t try bleach in there because I hate the smell of it.<p>Humidifiers are just inherently an iffy technology.')
