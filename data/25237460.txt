I said docker on Linux does not have that as a feature out of the box.<p>Go install docker desktop for Mac.  Click a preference and you have kubernetes.<p>That is not the case in Linux.  Can you install kind?  Sure.  Can you install minikube? Sure.<p>And define support?  To give you a simple example, in minikube on Linux how do you make local images built by docker available in minikube?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hasura.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;sharing-a-local-registry-for-minikube-37c7240d0615&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hasura.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;sharing-a-local-registry-for-minikube...</a><p>It involves using dockerhub (rate limited) or running another local registry that you retag and push.<p>How about docker for Mac? No changes required at all, if the image is in the docker registry, it works in kubernetes<p>This is the exact type of retagging non sense that I hate in a dev workflow and is completely hacky.<p>So I solved it myself using k3s but I don’t think I have seen anyone else tackle it on Linux.
