It&#x27;s still a 105w soc. And since you need more of them, that&#x27;s more motherboards, more RAM, more drives, more networking, and more power supplies. Which all has both up-front costs and ongoing power costs.<p>It&#x27;s only being positioned as a lower cost mid tier offering because it&#x27;s uncompetitive otherwise. It&#x27;s almost certainly not even cheaper to make. The monolithic design will be more expensive than AMD&#x27;s chiplets. Cheaper for Amazon maybe, as obviously AMD is taking a profitable slice, but that&#x27;s a slice that can easily be adjusted should Graviton start looking stronger at some point.')
