First time I tried it, I got a BLT sandwich. Exactly what it says on the tin: bacon, lettuce, tomato, no weird spices or creative takes or deconstruction. Just a stock BLT sandwichâ€”except better in every way. I&#x27;m not even sure how. I would not have thought there was <i>that</i> much room to improve on a BLT through better ingredients and execution, but apparently there is.<p>Anyway, if you&#x27;re in Berkeley, I would highly recommend giving it a try.')
