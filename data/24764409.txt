The more restrictive licenses like GPL 2 or AGPL, I think Google either flat out denied or you had to do a lot more work to get permission.<p>Now that I work for myself, I much prefer not having to ask anyone for permission to contribute to open source, but I generally default to MIT&#x2F;Apache2 unless I have a reason to do otherwise, out of consideration for employees at Google or other corps who may want to participate in my project.')
