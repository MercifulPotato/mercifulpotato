Seems more likely that we&#x27;ll just see people get Parler on Android through channels other than the Play Store.<p>&gt;What then?<p>There&#x27;s a lot of additional attack vectors. We&#x27;ve already seen Amazon move to boot Parler off its web infrastructure. If that fails to kill the platform, we&#x27;ll likely see attacks on anything related to its financing, or things like CloudFlare protection. If that fails I could see progressives abandoning net neutrality to lean on ISPs to block traffic.<p>In reality I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll get all the way there, but we&#x27;ll get close enough that a stable &quot;red social media&quot; ecosystem will emerge that&#x27;s out of reach of cancellation. In the long run this may work out worse for everyone.')
