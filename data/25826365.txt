And the US government is a loud voice advocating for deposing governments, so its preference guides the commmon use of language.<p>A clear example is Israel: it has a &quot;regime&quot; in Arab and leftists human rights communitjes, but not in US mainstream media.<p>China has a &quot;regime&quot; depending on how hard line anti-Communist you are. Even though the government has no democratic legitimacy (like the Soviet regime in the cold war), it&#x27;s not a &quot;regime&quot; in diplomatic circles because the US is economically dependent on China. Likewise Russia is not a regime now that the cold war is over (for now).')
