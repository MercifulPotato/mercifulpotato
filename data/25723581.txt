But first make sure that you&#x27;ve familiarized yourself with the previous explanations and understand the constraints we&#x27;re subject to. If it&#x27;s something simple like &quot;just ban politics&quot; or &quot;just allow everything&quot;, I&#x27;ve already answered many times why that won&#x27;t work.<p>Given that stories with political overlap are inevitably going to appear here, that the site has rules for discussion (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>), and that the rules don&#x27;t stop applying just because a topic is politicized, if users break the rules repeatedly and ignore our requests to stop, we ban them. What else would we do?')
