Because at least for someone who likes to try out lots of different games, not just the big tentpole AAA games that get released near Christmas, this game is exceedingly mediocre at gameplay.<p>Its one undeniable quality is that the story missions are compelling and interesting, because I keep coming back to them and I want to see where it goes. But if you take any of the systems in the game, they leave a lot to be desired: crafting, gunplay, sneaking, hacking, quickhacks (or this game&#x27;s magic system), driving, side missions, voice acting. Hell I find even many of the animations pretty generic most of the time when they are outside of the main story stuff.<p>The bugs are immersion-breaking for sure, and I hate when I need to restart a mission because of one, but the game is otherwise pretty mediocre. I compare it to Skyrim, where the bugs were present, and the individual systems were sometimes pretty lame, but I otherwise was still immersed in the game world completely and was always having a ton of fun.
