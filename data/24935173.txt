Item(by='LeifCarrotson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604002349, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24934784, text='I&#x27;m surprised that Stack Overflow&#x2F;Stack Exchange wasn&#x27;t in the list of platforms; their policies against eg. duplicate questions are frustrating to users expecting a forum but are explicitly designed to generate content that&#x27;s useful in the long term. I have no idea how many man-hours (man-centuries?) of effort have been spent by programmers generating post-hoc documentation within the SO platform.<p>It&#x27;s unquestionably useful today, it&#x27;s somewhat distributed by mirrors and the database export, it has an API, but there&#x27;s no question that if SO folded tomorrow that a lot of utility and a lot of effort would be lost. However, I am confident that if SO did not exist and those contributors did not become addicted to the dopamine boost from &quot;+10 Karma!&quot; notifications that they would not have instead created permanent, Google-able, individual blogs with an equivalent amount of utility as what SO provides.')
