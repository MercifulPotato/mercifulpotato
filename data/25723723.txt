And basically he pans the thing [the conference]. He says “Fortunately a large number of the society&#x27;s members were unable to attend.” And he goes on and says “Well, the hotel was pretty good and there was good breakfast…” But he says here “Another paper which was titled A History of Writing Compilers”—which was mine—“was actually the history of one individual&#x27;s rather limited experience with *a* compiler”.</i><p>&gt; <i>Well, that wasn&#x27;t exactly true, but it was true enough: in other words, in 1962 I didn&#x27;t know about almost anything of what I&#x27;m going to tell you tonight. So I took it as “maybe, you know, if I&#x27;m going to talk about the history of something, maybe I ought to actually research it, look into it.” And so over the next few years I started learning more about this and the more I learned the more fascinating it got…</i><p>More broadly though, I echo your comment about Knuth&#x27;s passion for history, which goes surprisingly deep: in fact in his paper “Ancient Babylonian Algorithms” (click on any of the PDF links at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.google.com&#x2F;scholar?cluster=108873709784335393280" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.google.com&#x2F;scholar?cluster=10887370978433539...</a>) he mentions having used dictionaries of Akkadian and Sumerian to make sure his translation was accurate, and in a 2016 lecture (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4UFkH5ZlVqQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4UFkH5ZlVqQ</a> or <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DjZB9HvddQk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DjZB9HvddQk</a> = <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ZK4jnuCWl0Y" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ZK4jnuCWl0Y</a>) he mentions learning enough Sanskrit (or at least the Devanagari script) to fix an error in the transliteration in a Wikipedia article.')
