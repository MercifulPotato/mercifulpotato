I <i>really</i> did. But I had a ton of sync problems between my phone and my desktop client, tried to report them, and the developers didn’t care. Then one day I got a new phone and discovered I’d lost my old Signal identity and there was no way to export my messages from my old phone. And the developers didn’t care about that, either.<p>They always had some excuse for why it was the “right” behavior and the user’s fault. For example: clients just can’t sync more than 1000 messages, and if you go this long without using your desktop client, well, you’re out of luck, and you should have realized this.<p>I just can’t recommend a platform on which the developers don’t care about usability.')
