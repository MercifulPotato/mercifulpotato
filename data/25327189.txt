My incomplete understanding is she submitted a paper, google said it was not submitted in time and they made her retract it, and in response she demanded the names of those who reviewed the paper or else she would resign. That is completely unacceptable behavior and they were right to accept her resignation. The fact that she has a history of bullying makes it even worse for her. Of course they aren&#x27;t going to give her the names of those people so she can bully them too.')
