It&#x27;d be straightforward to build an orchestrator around this graph to perform automated pen-tests - like if an EC2 instance is compromised, the attacker can dump instance metadata (creds) and assume the IAM role that the instance runs as, and then from there potentially pivot to others and repeat. It&#x27;d be great as a pen-tester to be able to click on a graph node and say &quot;give me a shell here&quot; and then be dropped right in.')
