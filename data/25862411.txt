Their temporal experience, if they went into a time machine, is:<p>1. Time machine backwards<p>2. Shoot themselves<p>3. Time machine forwards<p>And that’s how they would have experienced it.  The whole premise seems to be that this is allowed:<p>1. Time machine backwards<p>2. (do something)<p>3. Time machine forwards<p>Of course step 2 always happened since it’s the past.  And yet they shot themselves.  But they couldn’t shoot themself and exist now as well.  And that’s the paradox.<p>Two choices at this point:<p>1. You can’t really do anything in step 2.  In which case time travel is impotent, and hence why even dignify calling it time travel at all?<p>2. You have some potency in step 2, but you can’t do things that lead to paradoxes.  But then how would you handle those special cases?<p>Just stating that “the past is fixed” doesn’t solve the paradox, it restates one of the premises.')
