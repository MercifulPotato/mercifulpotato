Supper my groups are full of success stories.<p>That&#x27;s great, and it&#x27;s supported by... wait for it... studies [1] &quot;Magnesium&#x27;s role in migraine pathogenesis is well-described, with deficiencies known to promote cortical spreading depression, alter nociceptive processing and neurotransmitter release, and encourage the hyperaggregation of platelets, all major elements of migraine development.&quot;<p>If you have a defined deficiency, then a multivitamin may be helpful. If there&#x27;s nothing wrong with you, then it&#x27;s at best neutral, and at worst harmful.<p>We need to take a science-forward approach to this stuff.<p>[edit] To be clear: you didn&#x27;t mention specifically what you were using magnesium for, and the parent post was implying that there were vitamins or minerals that it wasn&#x27;t worth checking whether you had the deficiency before taking. As such I looked into the role of magnesium in general wellness which is not supported by data. Had you mentioned that it was for a specific condition, I would have researched it before making my implication, so <i>my bad</i> there.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;books&#x2F;NBK507271&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;books&#x2F;NBK507271&#x2F;</a>')
