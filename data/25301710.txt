GoT is not crazy anything goes fantasy. Weather in GoT follows clear patterns that also happen to be super important for plot.<p>It is also big on maps and accurate timing of how long it takes to get from place to place. There was even massive complaining when last seasons written by different people failed in that aspect.<p>There are inaccurate things beyond Dothraki, as described on both this blog and half the internet. But arguing about GoT as if it was Alice in Wonderland crazy fantasy is absurd.')
