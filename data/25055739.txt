You start an external command and talk to it via stdin&#x2F;stdout.<p>NIFs are potentially much faster and are traditionally in C. But they carry the risk of crashing the VM. Rustler+Rust removes most, likely not all, but most of the risks for screwing up and killing the VM.<p>So NIFs are usually not recommended simply because the resilience and reliability of the BEAM VM relies on a bunch of cool strategies inside the VM and NIFs side-step all of that. The Rust ones should be far less dangerous.')
