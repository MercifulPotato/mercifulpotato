Item(by='phendrenad2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606438365, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25223751, text='Basically, in some team-vs-team video games, teamwork matters much more than individual skill level. So no matter how skilled a player is, they can still lose consistently and be ranked lower than they &quot;should&quot; be. The skill rating system used is often the ELO system, and the &quot;hell&quot; here is a situation where a player is consistently matched with players far below their own skill level, due to poor teamwork.<p>There&#x27;s also a lot more randomness in teamwork - sometimes a teammate has a bad day, or is just trolling. Successfully convincing the other people on the team to work as a team to accomplish objectives is often a counter-intuitive skill for people who focused on game mechanics and game knowledge.')
