Not unprecidented for a state to have its own environmental regs that are stricter than national regs. And since there are no salmon migrating up rivers in Kentucky, it should be less of a concern there and you don&#x27;t need to spend effort&#x2F;political favors getting the support from the Kentucky delegation in congress.<p>Sure it would not be perfect, because you would still have out-of-state vehicles using the roads, but it would be an improvement that could probably get done a lot faster and it might be enough.')
