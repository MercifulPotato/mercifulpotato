Computer Science - the computer part was cool. Science was cool too, so a Computer Science course would be amazing!<p>Except... it&#x27;s not really about computers. And it&#x27;s not about science either. It&#x27;s a complete misnomer. Only after the sunken cost fallacy had taken full hold I realized that it was actually a <i>math</i> course.<p>If you took most of the Computer Science curriculum back in time, to a monastery hundreds of years ago, with no physical computers, it could still be taught in the exact same way! That&#x27;s great, but not really what I thought I had signed up for.<p>Was it useful? Yes. Was it worth 4 years? No. And, for a while, I had a very dim view of myself, as I didn&#x27;t excel like my peers did. This had negative and long lasting impacts. Took a long while to realize that it had nothing to do with my ability, just my lack of interest.')
