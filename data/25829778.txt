Alternatively, one would write &quot;not unreasonable&quot; as a way of contrast relative to something that was previously claimed to be &quot;unreasonable&quot;.<p>I can think lots of other reasons, but feeling clever isn&#x27;t one of them. I mean, if someone would like to feel clever, there&#x27;s probably a more eloquent synonym for that.')
