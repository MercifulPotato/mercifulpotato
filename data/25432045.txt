This coupled with a lack of time, significant competing concerns (keeping a job during a global pandemic job market; work-load; personal life), and &quot;eh, I&#x27;ll get to it&quot;-laziness, means I have to put this on the back burner.<p>If you handed me a simple solution using rclone, zfs send, btrfs-send, or a pre-canned &quot;this is what it would cost&quot; Bacula approach, I would move to it.')
