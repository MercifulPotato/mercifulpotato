And then he posted the video online, attracting even more attention to what would normally just be a &quot;crazy people are crazy&quot; experience that you get in NY when you confront strangers for bad behavior.<p>I&#x27;ve been accused by a crazy person on the subway of being a rapist, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that I&#x27;m oppressed for being a male of a certain color. It was just a crazy person doing crazy things.')
