I&#x27;m not terribly surprised - Paul Graham ended up on the wrong side of this argument earlier today before NYT dropped their bombshell report by claiming that traditional reporting was declining in the context of the Coinbase front-run, so the fact that HN is deeply suffering from the same strain of (at the very least unconscious) bigotry isn&#x27;t really news, but I&#x27;m keeping tabs on it anyway because people need to understand the problems HN has with diversity and inclusion. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;paulg&#x2F;status&#x2F;1332272708428713984" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;paulg&#x2F;status&#x2F;1332272708428713984</a>')
