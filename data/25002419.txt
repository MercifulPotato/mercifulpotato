Item(by='sischoel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604613080, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24988790, text='There is another Julia package called Revise.jl : <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;timholy&#x2F;Revise.jl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;timholy&#x2F;Revise.jl</a><p>When loading Revise.jl in a Julia REPL session, it keeps track of all packages loaded afterwards and if the code is changed in one of the packages it automatically updates the functions provided by that package. As far as I know this does not work (yet) for structures that have been changed though.<p>The cool thing is now, that it seems as if one can also use Revise.jl in a Pluto notebook - when the code of a package loaded in a Pluto notebook is changed, then also the cells in that notebook are run again with the updated code.')
