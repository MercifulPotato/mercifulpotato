But 8k out of 220k total is nitpicking.<p>26k heart attacks is a bigger slice of the pie, but it&#x27;s also far more difficult to tease out if COVID contribute to heart attack deaths (I&#x27;d argue that it likely does). I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some study somewhere that COVID significantly taxes the cardiovascular system and can result in meaningfully increased risk of heart attack deaths.')
