Get it into memory, use a programming language that supports recursive functions.<p>This is the basic argument here. If the situation is delicate enough we need the database to be doing graph operations, why would we pick SQLite? If it isn&#x27;t, why would we pick SQL over Python?<p>I don&#x27;t think it is bad that SQLite supports this, just ... what are the circumstances where this is a good idea? Is there a reason to do graph-style algorithms in SQL?')
