He says that cleaning baby bottles and things every night was tiring him out. Now he loads it every night and turns on the Baby Steam mode that sterilizes the stuff after cleaning. Apparently, the dishwasher needs no connection to the faucet. Pour in water from the top and allow the dirty water to run into a bucket.')
