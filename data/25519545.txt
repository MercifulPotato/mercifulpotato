The general public has always been fleeced in the markets. Always. And always will be. Read any historical book on the markets, the public is getting fleeced. If you want to complain about execution or products or relationships you should get serious and become a trader, in which case you’ll immediately stop using Robinhood. If it makes you feel any better, almost every time you’re being fleeced there is a professional trader on the other side of the trade laughing at this dumb schmuck just giving their money away.')
