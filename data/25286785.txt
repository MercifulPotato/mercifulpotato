Item(by='yourapostasy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606983734, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25286398, text='<i>&gt; Why isn&#x27;t anyone studying the Arabic states as UBI models?</i><p>Perceived cultural differences, possibly leading to more interesting, uncomfortable parallels than many would like. On the ground in the kingdom, in the field, there is an enormous cultural bias towards status, and low-status jobs are shunned. This is made more complex because of a subtle, more recent cultural bias that emerged from having foreigners perform almost all the work for so long, and foreigners in Wahhabi faith as it is practically practiced (in theory it is different) are considered inferior in an unenlightened sense. A halo effect emerged around private jobs, and now any job at all that used to be performed by foreigners is considered low(er) status.<p>This is changing rapidly and gaining steam in numbers at the margins with many younger generations. I&#x27;ve met some incredibly brilliant, young KSA native engineers. Many are working hard to reverse the rot the Resource Curse visited upon the kingdom.<p>However, I wouldn&#x27;t be so quick to dismiss that kingdom&#x27;s experience as unique to it, saying that does not apply to America or many other developed nations. Considering the penchant for superficial solutions, get-rich-quick adulation, and <i>de facto</i> class stratifications in all developed nations, I&#x27;m not sanguine a UBI would elicit much better results than a Resource Curse. Norway is an exception that proves the rule, from what I&#x27;ve seen so far.<p>And I wouldn&#x27;t point fingers at just nations, either. Even here on HN, where startups with fast 10-1,000X liquidity events receive gallons of ink compared to the inkjet droplets miserly begrudged to to self-funding, slow organic growth companies, we engage in similar dynamics.<p>Making someone or a nation fabulously wealthy and&#x2F;or powerful doesn&#x27;t change them, it only discloses their true character and moral fiber. The uncomfortable truth is a substantial portion of us, whether at the individual or nation-state level, when granted free reign with no one saying &quot;No&quot;, are jerks. IMHO UBI is like pure communism or pure capitalism: they only sustainably and consistently work if the vast majority (I&#x27;d personally guess around 95%) are truly not jerks, and thus have the means to keep the levers of power away from those who are.<p>BTW, I&#x27;m one of those jerks. Maybe not the biggest douche-canoe you&#x27;ve ever met, but I&#x27;m definitely a jerk, though I chip away at that.')
