In the absence of 230 platforms would be required to have <i>no</i> moderation of content - getting anything pulled, incl the grotesque, would require a court order. Not because they don’t want to remove the content, but because the moment they did of their own volition they become liable.<p>230 allowed moderation without becoming responsible for all content.<p>The framing of them somehow exploiting 230 is absurd and frustrating.')
