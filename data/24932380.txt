Item(by='munificent', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603989616, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24929699, text='One way to look at this is that money launderers are happy to pay a higher price because the house provides more value to them that it does to other buyers: it is both a real estate asset and a tool to launder their money. It&#x27;s sort of like putting an offer down on a house with a pool when you can&#x27;t swim. You rationally won&#x27;t pay as much as the Olympic swimmer also bidding on the house because they get more value from it than you do.<p>The first-order obvious rational solution is to &quot;learn to swim&quot;. If you&#x27;re going to buy a house, figure out a way to also launder some money with the purchase. That way you&#x27;re competing on a level playing field with other money launderers.<p>The second-order observation is that there is a business opportunity here. Shortly, I expect to see a Y-combinator funded startup developing an AI-driven mobile app that connects BC home buyers with criminals looking to launder their illicit gains. The market becomes more efficient and everyone wins.')
