It&#x27;s time for Congress to do more than just write strongly-worded letters to large tech conglomerates hoping that these kinds of anti-consumer practices stop. It&#x27;s funny (or sad) that the <i>meme du jour</i> is &quot;build your own app store, bro.&quot; We need: (1) transparency and (2) accountability.<p>First of all, we can&#x27;t have stuff getting arbitrarily censored or kicked off stores, because even though it may start with alt-right QAnon nonsense, it will lead to things like Hey, Epic, Fortnite, Robinhood ratings being scrubbed, WSB being banned, or now Element. The slippery slope is not hypothetical. It&#x27;s <i>here</i>.<p>Secondly, we can&#x27;t just have AAPL, GOOG, FB, etc. merely say &quot;oops, our bad&quot; when the shit hits the fan. People get mad, they say &quot;oops&quot; -- even though the app may have lost thousands of customers and reputation -- and everyone forgets the snafu ever happened. This is not okay, and as consumers we should not be okay with it. I promise you Google will release a statement saying &quot;certain groups&quot; on Element &quot;used some poopoo language&quot; and the apologists will, yet again, be totally cool with it.<p>(I don&#x27;t feel my comment is particularly controversial, yet I&#x27;m being mass downvoted with no counter-arguments.. weird.)')
