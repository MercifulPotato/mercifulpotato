It was demeaning and demoralizing.<p>In the 80s&#x2F;90s, I would have just tossed a tar-ball over the wall and say &quot;good luck - feel free to use it, if it suites your needs), but in the age of github, all sorts of folk show up demanding that I do this that or the other, with no offer of payment. My response was: &quot;Look! You have the source code. Do what you want to it to make it fit your needs better. You can even do a pull request.&quot;. They didn&#x27;t want to do that - they just wanted me to work for them for free. I opted out of the entire situation by unpublishing all of my previously published works.<p>* None of the packages were significant. One was a Flask-based SaaS-in-a-Box thing with home screens, user accounts, log-in (auth), payments and various utilities. The other was an early Pixar-era ray-tracer (renderer) that was slow, but very extensible and capable of making pretty pictures of landscapes and other things like caustics.')
