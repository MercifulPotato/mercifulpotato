What versions are on your system?  What versions on the systems of the people running the script?  Do they support the same features?  If you&#x27;re running on a Mac are you using the Mac-shipped programs or the GNU coreutils from homebrew?<p>Also, that Bash script that the author is defending has a subtle bug in it, because Bash is subtle.  The bug is here:<p><pre><code>       $APP $filename &gt;&quot;${output_dir}&#x2F;summary_${name}.txt&quot;\n       if [ $? != 0 ]; then\n           echo &quot;Error $? in app&quot;\n       fi\n</code></pre>\nThe return value of [ ... ] overwrites the $?, so the inner $? is the result of the test, not $APP.<p>Which is exactly the kind of crap that everyone&#x27;s talking about when saying that we should avoid Bash scripts.  It&#x27;s full of landmines like this.<p>Bash is great for interactive work on the terminal.  It is not great for writing correct, maintainable programs.')
