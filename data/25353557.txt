It&#x27;s also not fully covering the threat model here: for example, if you are concerned about privacy there are whole classes of device which you simply cannot allow because blocking one feature simply means that the vendor will run everything through the same endpoints required for the device to work.<p>&gt; Also often perfect security isn’t required. Doors with locks are good, but useless if the burglar just breaks the full length glass window next to it. They still serve a purpose, but don’t need to be an absolute comprehensive solution.<p>Perfect is the enemy of the good but you have to also think about the asymmetry here. Trying to hijack DNS is only useful when you control the network but neither the client or server. Trying to stop malware by politely asking them to play nicely is a losing game and the IoT devices many people worry about have entire teams devoted to bypassing you as well (e.g. if any significant number of people tried to block a TV from reporting your viewing activity, the endgame is that viewing history and software updates would both go through samsung.com, not that they&#x27;ll give up millions of dollars in revenue). That leaves you with cases where you do control the client and thus have less invasive alternatives such as installing an ad blocker or using a different browser.')
