Some people do not care about shout-outs, and those people do not include attribution clauses in their code licenses.<p>I also did not mean &quot;fault&quot; in the legal sense, but rather in the sense of courtesy. It is not a faux pas to comply neatly with the terms of a public contract. What you&#x27;re suggesting is that Amazon erred in not mentioning the author, but the fact that is visible to everyone in the license is that the author does not care about attribution.<p>I don&#x27;t like the insinuation that a license can be non-exhaustive in its conditions for the &quot;correct&quot; use of open-source software. You shouldn&#x27;t run the risk of offending an author by violating some tacit, contradictory rule.')
