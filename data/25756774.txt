But this is just the latest of a long series of hijack attempts for this namespace (the Internet&#x27;s DNS hierarchy) and it&#x27;s about time people learned that can&#x27;t work.<p>Successful namespace hijacks rely on overwhelming numbers. You need to have <i>so many</i> people using your hijacked namespace that you&#x27;ve got way <i>more</i> people who <i>do not even know</i> that it&#x27;s a hijack but are using it anyway than the existing administrators had total engagement so that it&#x27;s pointless to argue with you.<p>Handshake can&#x27;t get there from here, most of the world now uses the DNS hierarchy.
