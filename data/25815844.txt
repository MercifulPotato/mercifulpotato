In particular, cherry-picking something you said:<p>&gt; The economics of a few people developing high performance languages that everyone can use just makes too much sense<p>I agree: high performance is the job of a _few_ people. It doesn&#x27;t hurt to know basics for it for everybody else, but even then... that&#x27;s just one area out of many a dev could dive into. Maybe security or virtualisation or OS programming or whatever would be just as useful or more. My point is that we can&#x27;t pick a random subfield of software engineering and say &quot;everybody should be skilled at that&quot;')
