This should be one step (that was a bottleneck) in helping a company with a fixed budget do an order or magnitude more &#x27;experiments&#x27; with the same amount of resources.  Lab resources are expensive and fixed, so if you can pre-compute what you need, you can get right to the more powerful results.<p>We design proteins for immunotherapies - this kind of thing would help us more rapidly design our proteins (and more efficiently use our wet-lab resources to speed existing projects).  For others, some drugs are hard build without knowing how they will interact - this could both provide new &#x27;targets&#x27; to go after, but also might help prevent projects that would otherwise accidentally target an important protein.')
