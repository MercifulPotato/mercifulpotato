I would think the number of abandoned open source projects to be closer to 70% or higher.<p>Even projects that have reached popularity.<p>So many times I have found references to libraries I wanted to use (C#&#x2F;F# .Elixir).<p>In the end I find a link to sourceforge or similar to find it has been abandoned-ware for a long time.<p>Then we have the vast majority of open source code that never reached much of an audience and have been abandoned long ago.<p>I am sure if one ran a query over all public GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket, SourceForge, Codeproject the vast majority are abandoned.')
