SBCL treated type declarations (using DECLARE) as assertions (as opposed to mere hints for optimization), making it what some might call a gradual-typed system.  So with properly declared type, SBCL could have found it then too.<p>Now, some discourage the use of type declarations in Common Lisp (for a variety of reasons, one being the limited portability as less clever compilers don&#x27;t warn against mismatch, but might produce broken code) and suggest the (run-time type testing) CHECK-TYPE (standard) macro instead.  SBCL&#x27;s type inference (at least in recent versions) is sufficiently clever to detect mismatches at compile time, when the type is (implicitly) announced using CHECK-TYPE.')
