I also code Ruby so +1 :-) I would be cautious about rolling your own implementation like this though.<p>1. This is not your core business. Eventually you want to start segmenting things by verticals, geography etc. You will want to visualise them. It takes time, which you want to spend building your product.<p>2. There are many important details in how you calculate certain metrics. Either you dive into the topic and again waste time, or you start having metrics which are custom, not really comparable with benchmarks or just plain wrong.<p>Maybe you just spent 1hr on this and that’s ok. Just make sure you spend your time on your product domain, because that’s what’s probably gonna make you happier (unless you pivot into saas metrics world!)')
