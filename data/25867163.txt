But you think it&#x27;s unfair to call this a &quot;gap&quot; that ES is now trying to close?<p>The gap in that case was that the GPL was not sufficient to ensure that software remain free software when companies started using SaaS for software that previously would have been run locally. SaaS was in effect a workaround for the GPL&#x27;s distribution requirement (enabling companies to avoid giving the software&#x27;s users the freedoms associated with free software), so the AGPL was created for software that was meant to run on a server.<p>This is different: the point of contention here is not that Elastic&#x27;s software was being made proprietary (they could have easily used the AGPL if that was their concern, the AGPLv3 predates the first Elasticsearch release by three years) but that Amazon is using their software to compete with them. That&#x27;s something that&#x27;s pretty fundamental to both free software:<p>&gt;The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).<p>...and open source:<p>&gt;The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.<p>Freedom 0 is a feature, not a bug! It may be a &quot;gap&quot; in Elastic&#x27;s business model, but it&#x27;s certainly not a gap in FOSS licenses - the freedom to use the software as you wish is a pretty core value of free software.<p>Now that said, I do think that taking FOSS and making it proprietary certainly does violate the spirit of free software. Amazon doesn&#x27;t seem to have done that here, though - their fork is under the Apache 2 license.')
