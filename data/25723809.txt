While it is a bit awkward to get used to the time limit it&#x27;s part exploration, part archeological adventure, part flight simulator and part platforming. The latter parts take a bit to get used to but really make the game fantastic. It&#x27;s up there for me with journey and it sounds like I should really play KRZ. I just wish I could forget the Outer Wilds and play it again.')
