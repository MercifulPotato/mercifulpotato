In other words: despite the large quantity of personal information collected by advertisers, they still cannot exploit it efficiently enough, so far all they can do mostly is showing you the same things over and over - advertisers are still unable to develop a perfectly manipulative algorithm that makes you buy things (edit: or they have it, but it&#x27;s still not found in wider deployment).<p>Effectiveness of targeted ads directly translates to effectiveness of mass surveillance. Perhaps we should enjoy the useless shopping recommendations from Amazon for now. When every single shopping recommendations made by the algorithm is the thing you always wanted (coming soon!), you&#x27;ll know the cyberpunk dystopia is officially here.<p>This point of view also reconciles the two different opinions on machine learning in the tech community. The first person tells you that it&#x27;s nothing but overhyped marketing, while it has some specialized uses, but everything is exaggerated as &quot;AI&quot; to get money from VCs, and in many areas, it&#x27;s effectiveness is just too limited. The second person warns you that collecting personal information at an industrial scale is extremely dangerous, with the recent progress on &quot;AI&quot;, they can use your data against you in ways never possible before. These two are not a contradiction: The first view is where we were previously, and the next view is where we are going to.')
