Otherwise you&#x27;d have great schools for the rich and terrible schools for the not-so-rich and horrible schools for the poor (assuming they&#x27;d have an education at all). As it is there is still lots of skewing but by having the rich kids go to the same schools as the poor ones at least the divide is a smaller one (of course, neighborhood and town&#x2F;city still leave plenty of room for differences, as does the existence of home tutoring for wealthy people&#x27;s kids).')
