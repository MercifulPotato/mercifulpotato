The most important one IMO is merging and that does not work on arbitrary formats serialized to text. E.g. let two 3D artists fork a blender 3D file in GIT, both do changes and commit them. Until here everything seems fine, now they want to merge their changes ... and suddenly everything falls apart.<p>Edit: To clarify, if you don&#x27;t need merging than you also don&#x27;t need distributed VCS and centralized VCS will be sufficient. That is why I explicitly talked about distributed VCS.')
