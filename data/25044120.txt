I like it a lot. The harmony changes are easy to see as concentric slices slighty rotated. On heavy drum music the rythm also leaves a trail of spaced circles easy to recognize. You might be onto something here. Colored waveforms, like those used in djing software, might be better for locating a point in a song, but I&#x27;ve never been able to locate a chord change on those based on the waveform representation alone. I would totally love to try to &quot;mix&quot; some of those mandalas, or try an editor software using this visualization where I can move around a virtual needle, copy paste slices, etc. Not saying It will be better than using a waveform, but I would experiment with it given the chance.<p>Very nice job, congratulations!')
