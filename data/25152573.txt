An in-depth review of the two can be found over here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.androidpolice.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;24&#x2F;google-play-music-to-youtube-music-making-the-switch&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.androidpolice.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;24&#x2F;google-play-music-t...</a><p>Personally I wish all these music streaming services could agree on metadata sharing such that I could enable apps like last.fm to review listening history across every service, and offer my listening history and playlists to every service to receive better recommendations. It feels odd that I can listen to the same song from 4-5 different services that I subscribe to legally, yet none of the services has a complete picture of what I like to listen to unless I pick one and use it as often as I can. I had thought that playlist sync would be a way to improve my recommendations, but it seems most services look at listening history rather than playlists. It&#x27;s also irritating that every company has its own way of doing playback sync between devices, whether it&#x27;s AirPlay, ChromeCast, Spotify Connect, Alexa, YouTube app, etc. There is no way things should be this fractured and hard to use for music playback and recommendation in the next decade, we need more standards. :)')
