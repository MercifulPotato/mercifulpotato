The idea is to use maps with specially constructed keys, that give you type safe access to their accompanied values. That is better than completely untyped, you have a place to document stuff at the declaration of those keys and you can easily create runtime checks, that check for the presence of a set of well defined keys in the map. The fact that they are described in a Java book  does not mean that they aren&#x27;t a nice pattern in Scala and several other statically typed language with generics.')
