Classmate of mine in university had absolute pitch, and while it was useful for some things, it was a liability in several places. For one thing, she played flute: everyone tunes to the oboe, so if the oboist is a few cents sharp everyone&#x27;s a few cents sharp and she spends the evening wincing while playing. Further, when we got to the &#x27;ear dictation&#x27; section of music theory class (professor plays a melodic sequence and you have to write it down based on the relative pitches), she made the mistake of letting on she had absolute pitch. From then on, the professor would say, &quot;OK, this melody starts on F&quot; and then start it on Ab instead, forcing her to do the relative calculations in her head. Didn&#x27;t bother the rest of us, but drove her absolutely up the wall.')
