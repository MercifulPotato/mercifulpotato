Which has just been demonstrated:<p>1. The DC Mayor was powerless to stop the riot. The DC National Guard report to the President (EDIT: and the President took 3-hours 10 minutes before the DC National Guard responded to the break-in. From 2:30 to 5:40, the DC National Guard waited. So needless to say, DC Residents aren&#x27;t exactly feeling safe about the President&#x27;s ability to protect them)<p>2. The DC Residents, where the riot took place, have no Representative nor a Senator to represent them.<p>3. DC Residents pay taxes, just like everyone else in this country. But without a substantial Representative nor a Senator to carry their voice (on such important issues like: maybe the Mayor should have been in charge of the police forces on 1&#x2F;6th, instead of Trump).<p>--------<p>I presume that those who lost the election still have a Representative, a Governor who controls their own military (a local National Guard and&#x2F;or militia of some kind), two Senators and more.<p>DC Residents on the other hand: show the true &quot;taxation without representation&quot;. What it actually feels like to not have power over your own city.')
