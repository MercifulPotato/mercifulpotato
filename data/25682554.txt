I would love to contribute to electric cars but all the ones I have test driven have unsafe dash UIs for something as simple as adjusting the cabin temperature. I have driven Audi SUVs for quite while because I have dogs and like to ski and play outside (and even those have had absurd UIs since the mid-2000s), but I may just end up with a late 90s Tacoma - easy to fix, decent all-wheel drive, super-safe and intuitive dash interfaces... the electronic UI future&#x2F;present is hideous to me and inferior to physical knobs and buttons. Mazdas also look like a decent option.')
