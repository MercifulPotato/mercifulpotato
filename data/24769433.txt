You just need to run the old and the new system in parallel during the migration, ensure you write to both and read from both. Ensure that all tests still pass if you switch source of truth to the new database. At first you treat the old one as the source of truth in production, keep track of how often they disagree, migrate data slowly so you don&#x27;t overload your database and crash them, after migration disagreements should be 0, then switch source of truth to the new database and remove the migration code, then turn down the old database. Congratulations, you now have migrated data without downtime!<p>There is no special tooling for this since there can&#x27;t be, you just have to roll up your sleeves and do the dirty work needed. It isn&#x27;t hard, just a bit tedious if you want to do it properly. A junior developer can do it.')
