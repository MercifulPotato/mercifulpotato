I have been getting domino&#x27;s delivered for years, but all the stores that normally would do have been &quot;not available for delivery&quot; in 2020.<p>I&#x27;m not really sure I understand this-- surely there&#x27;s not more risk to the driver in delivering to you than in you coming to get it yourself, which they definitely still support. Maybe it&#x27;s because their delivery drivers can&#x27;t share cars anymore or something.')
