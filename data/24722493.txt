On the other hand, I think there&#x27;s more to it than just wanting to &quot;carry around an expensive item.&quot; I enjoy the craftsmanship and engineering that goes into making a nice knife. I find that a three-inch knife blade is useful in a way that a one-inch box-cutter blade is not, for example when I want to peel an orange or sharpen a pencil. I also carry a knife since I believe a knife may be helpful in an emergency situation - imagine, for example, you are in a car accident and your seatbelt jams. With a good knife you could easily cut yourself out - much harder to do with a boxcutter.')
