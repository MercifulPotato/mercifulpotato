The Rust defaults will probably start off more performant, and the ceiling will be higher as well.<p>A lot of the performance comes from the different paradigms though, so it&#x27;s not always an apple to apple comparison. But I also think that&#x27;s an assumption being made when talking about a Clojure Vs Rust implementation. In the latter, you&#x27;re most likely implying using mutable collections, fixed size structs, primitive types, and a tighter memory allocation surface. And not surprisingly, those are the same changes you&#x27;d make to your Clojure code base to speed it up (most likely).')
