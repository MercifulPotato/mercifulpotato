I want to know how do you build your audience?<p>Please don&#x27;t share tips. What I want to know is the actual process like how you grew from 0 to 10. Then, from 10 to 50. 50 to 100. and so on.<p>Like, What was the situation you were in? \n1. What did you do? \n2. Where do you post your blog or what did you do to help people?\n3. What makes them hook to you?\n4. How long did it take you to grow from 0-50?\n5. Did you go through some pure luck by posting online or did you recognize some pattern?<p>Although I didn&#x27;t really want to hear from luck, but I open for your opinion.<p>Thank you HN.')
