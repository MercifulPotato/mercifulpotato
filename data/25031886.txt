It must be vanishingly small.<p>The response to &quot;there can be more than one view of reality that is valid and true&quot; isn&#x27;t to respond with &quot;lies are lies and using lies in place of truth is lunacy&quot;, (to paraphrase the parent comments, perhaps more fairly than the latter deserves) so to remain focused on &quot;Alternative facts&quot; is to be led astray by what amounts to a straw man. That whole debacle was a petty response by a narcissist to a petty narrative line by a media that isn&#x27;t focused on what matters anyway and anyone repeating the White House line was more than likely acting tribally - as was anyone criticising the numbers. The proverbial storm in a teacup.<p>Regardless, who is arguing for &quot;Alternative facts&quot; here?')
