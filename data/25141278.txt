Your compiler should have errored on a mismatch between discrete and continuous quantities (much thinkings should either be many thoughts or much thinking) and then on a compound noun without hyphenation.<p>Creative punctuation is normal; really, we&#x27;ve only standardized on punctuation since the mid-1700s or so.<p>Capitalization is, again, stylistic: e.e. cummings, notably, was against it. So was Archie.<p>And you broke on == and !fits, but the context of reading Hacker News ought to equip your parser with adequate sidechains.')
