Is there a relatively efficient algorithm to tell that a particular folding solution is correct (or within a certain distance of correct)? If there was, at least then this AlphaFold would either tell you &quot;here, this is more or less what this protein folds into&quot; or &quot;I can&#x27;t figure out the folding&quot;. Even if it told you it can&#x27;t figure out the folding a large portion of the time, at least it isn&#x27;t giving you garbage data.')
