In my observation, there is a <i>huge</i> amount of material available on the web, but it isn&#x27;t very centralized -- especially at the upper levels.<p>My advice would be to get a book on any topic which interests you, read through it, <i>and do a significant number of the exercises</i>. You might try Epp&#x27;s <i>Discrete Mathematics</i>, Hefferon&#x27;s <i>Linear Algebra</i>, Colley&#x27;s <i>Vector Calculus</i>, Dudley&#x27;s <i>Elementary Number Theory</i>, Spivak or Apostol&#x27;s <i>Calculus</i> (these go far beyond ordinary freshman calculus), Pinter&#x27;s <i>A Book of Abstract Algebra</i>, among many others. Some of these books are expensive to buy new, but just buy older editions.<p>Resources like Khan Academy and 3blue1brown are also fantastic, and I have shared some of these with my students. I&#x27;d recommend using these as a supplement; if you rely on them solely then you&#x27;ll develop vague intuition but not much else.<p>Also, with the pandemic, there are a huge number of traditional university courses that have moved online, and you could probably enroll in one for not too much money. Check the RateMyProfessor reviews -- you want a mix of positive reviews claiming the prof inspired them, and negative reviews complaining that work was expected. I have a RateMyProfessor review which complains bitterly that &quot;homework is graded for accuracy and not completion&quot;. :)')
