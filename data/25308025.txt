And that does sound like exploitation.  But consider the alternative.<p>Let&#x27;s say that every worker was paid for the full value that they produced.  That would mean that the profit of every company was $0, because the workers got all the value produced.  How many companies would we have?  Probably not very many.  Risk my capital to start a business, for a return of $0?  Yeah, no.  I&#x27;ll pass. So will most people.<p>And that would mean that we wouldn&#x27;t have the things that large businesses produce, from computers to airplanes to vaccines.<p>Even for the workers, is that a net win?  I don&#x27;t think so.')
