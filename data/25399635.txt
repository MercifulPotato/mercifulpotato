To me, these people had to know something more than pretty words. There had to be something deeper in their songs than just &quot;sex, drugs and rock and roll.&quot;</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;genevievefiles.blogspot.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;anger-management.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;genevievefiles.blogspot.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;anger-management...</a><p>Words never stand completely on their own. What they mean to people is shaped by context, history and reputation.<p>Hacker News wasn&#x27;t always a space with 5 million unique visitors per month who mostly barely know each other. When I originally joined in 2009, it had a sense of community.<p>I never got to be one of the &quot;insiders&quot; in that community. I was a visitor looking in from the outside.<p>But it did exist and many of those people still come here, though their presence isn&#x27;t obvious. I don&#x27;t think you can tell who pg&#x27;s friends are by who says what on Hacker News.<p>I&#x27;ve always respected the man, though he and I were never friends. I respected him because of how he comported himself here when he was in my mind just a moderator for a forum that I participated on, before he was big time famous and big time wealthy, when his wealth was measured in words starting with M, not B.<p>I don&#x27;t read every single thing he writes and I never have. But I certainly take his words seriously when I do sometimes read them.<p>He has a PhD and he suggested to his girlfriend that the two of them should start a company together. That company is, of course, YC.<p>I feel like it gets little press as a &quot;pro diversity&quot; company, but it&#x27;s a big company with a woman founder and that&#x27;s true because of Paul Graham. It was not Jessica Livingston who came up with the idea.<p>It&#x27;s sort of a stealth diversity thing and I generally don&#x27;t say too much about that because I think that&#x27;s the best way to do diversity and I don&#x27;t want to ruin it by calling a lot of attention to it.<p>But we&#x27;ve had a pandemic all year and the entire world is cranky as all hell -- me included -- and it&#x27;s just rubbing me the wrong way that people are so desperate to find a dog to kick these days. So I feel a need to give a bit of pushback here lately.')
