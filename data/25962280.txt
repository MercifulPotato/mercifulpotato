I would go further and say that this should apply to guilty pleas and plea bargains as well. The police should have to prove that the plea is justified by the evidence, and disclose all evidence at their disposal to the court. If you&#x27;re pleading to a reduced charge, the police should have to prove both charges. <i>After</i> the evidence has been presented and shown to be sufficient, <i>then</i> the court decides if the plea is justified, what kind of trial to hold, and what sentence to mete out.<p>It&#x27;s supposed to be hard to convict people.')
