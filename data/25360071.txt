You are correct I didn&#x27;t intend to imply otherwise. My point was more specific to the case at hand. If Google distributes the code to say an end-consumer, they need to be prepared to distribute the source as well. That consumer can then provide that source to any of Google&#x27;s competitors and they can make use of it in their own products. In most of these cases a company like Google would probably stop wasting time and simply make the source for any consumer products easily accessible by all.<p>However, Google need not provide the source to people that they do not distribute the code to (well obviously there are differences between e.g. GPLv2 and GPLv3, but whatever this isn&#x27;t a legal analysis). For example, if Google uses it internally they may not need to release the source to anyone at all. They&#x27;re all important points that more people need to understand, but they aren&#x27;t really the ones that I was making in this thread and none of them are really specific to Google vs. other companies.')
