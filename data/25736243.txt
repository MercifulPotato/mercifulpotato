I&#x27;d agree that many people in the west don&#x27;t have much of an idea how China or the CCP work. Calling them communist is pretty hilarious even if the word is in their name. The country has grown into it&#x27;s own new empire much more like those of old, I think shaped by the expectations and education of its people.<p>I&#x27;d also agree that because many of China&#x27;s educated upper class (political and economic) have been schooled or at least traveled or met foreigners from the US or other democracies, they understand many of the mechanics. However, I would completely disagree that even a bare majority of Chinese have much conception at all how western politics work. Even those who are educated in the US&#x2F;Europe rarely understand politics except at a single point in time.<p>I would count myself as one who has a fair knowledge of politics and business in China having spent almost 2 decades traveling and working with businesses there. I have some understanding of their history, socialization and education, as well as, business practices. What I can say is that they are very different depending on where you are (Shenzhen&#x2F;HK vs Shanghai vs Beijing vs Chongqing). They speak differently, they live differently, and they do business differently. Also, China&#x27;s politico-economic environment has changed very significantly in the past 20 years often with political leaders. and Xi has been one of the more rapid&#x2F;dramatic changes.<p>I&#x27;ve learned that I do not understand the inner workings of China&#x2F;CCP... even the workings of the US political system over the last 4 years border on incomprehensible. I would say that some of the business people I have seen most taken advantage of are Chinese expatriates who invested back into their homes and had relatively large businesses taken from them, because they thought they understood - align your interests carefully with someone who is on the ground or even family can take everything (this wasn&#x27;t a single instance).')
