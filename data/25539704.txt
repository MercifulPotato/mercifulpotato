I didn&#x27;t even have any interest in learning Classical Chinese, but was drawn in by Barnes&#x27;s book more or less immediately... ).<p>As much as language-learning is a lot about hard work, some people seem to be exceptionally good at teaching, and slaving away struggling to learn a language under a dreary teacher is the worst.<p>Language teaching seems to have its own particular flavour of impact on the students and their relationship to their teachers?  I guess it&#x27;s far more common that their teaching will have a gigantic impact on someone&#x27;s life, if they are going to be using the language every day, than many other things that people learn.  Less likely of Latin, but it still seems that people can be nonetheless grateful to have a gifted teacher even there!')
