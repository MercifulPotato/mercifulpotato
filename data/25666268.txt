If that were the widely adopted solution, you&#x27;d end up with large free providers that work perfectly fine for most regular users (like gmail), paid services that fully respect your privacy, and the more technical folks would be free to host their own servers.<p>I guess Matrix is doing this, but unfortunately, the way history has played out, centralized IM had first mover advantage by a huge margin and that&#x27;s what people are used to now - that a messenger is an application on your phone that you can only use to contact other users of that same application.')
