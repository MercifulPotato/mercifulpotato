The tested AMD chip has an RRP of $500 (though that comparison is arguably less fair as the core count is an issue). The tested Apple computers both cost about $1000. That&#x27;s for the whole computer, not just the chip. You can have one of these for as little as $699 (though you shouldn&#x27;t; 8GB of RAM really isn&#x27;t enough).')
