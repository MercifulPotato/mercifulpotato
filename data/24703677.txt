(To be really pedantic one could ask <i>which</i> computable reals, but let&#x27;s assume the usual definition, i.e. the set of reals defined by a computable Dedekind cut.)<p>Although computable reals have many properties shared by the actual real numbers (e.g. they are a field, which is not <i>that</i> trivial of a property), they are also different in very significant ways, for example, they aren&#x27;t computably comparable, they aren&#x27;t computably enumerable, their order is not computable.<p>Also, real analysis works very differently on that set, for example, it is not guaranteed that the least upper bound of a bounded increasing sequence of elements of the computable reals is itself a computable real.<p>Even ignoring feasibility in practice, working with non-standard mathematical structures is <i>very</i> unintuitive, much more than floating point numbers can be. (Let alone reasoning about the time-complexity of operations in that setting!)')
