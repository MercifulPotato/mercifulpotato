This in turn will lead to a substantial increase in CO2. Last year we measured the CO2 development in a classroom and detected extremely high CO2 levels [1].<p>I am living in an area of high air pollution, and more and more people are starting to move away from standard air purifiers and install positive pressure fresh air systems [2] that take outside air, filter it and release it inside the house. Thereby keeping CO2 low and presenting dirty air from entering.<p>One of the reasons why many people install these systems is because they are getting more aware of the cognitive impacts of bad air.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airgradient.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;07&#x2F;we-measured-the-co2-level-in-a-classrooms-this-is-what-we-found-out&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airgradient.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;07&#x2F;we-measured-the-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airgradient.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;08&#x2F;positive-pressure-systems-for-clean-air&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airgradient.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;08&#x2F;positive-pressur...</a>')
