The language is strange to everyone, which is part of what makes it &quot;magical&quot; sometimes !  It really is made to be performed, and often makes awkward reading I think. Lots of the drama is based on the personalities of the actors and actresses.. Some people make a show of learning the lines and shouting and such, which to me, is part of learning.. Plain language text in a book would lose almost all of that.. perhaps find a video to try?')
