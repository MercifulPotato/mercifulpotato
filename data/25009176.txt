The cgroups facility does not control &quot;the number of CPU shares per process.&quot; Although you can put such a thing into effect with control groups, it&#x27;s more accurate to say that a control group limits the resources of a set of tasks. Those tasks may be from one or several processes, and it&#x27;s also the case that a single process can divide its own tasks into several cgroups.')
