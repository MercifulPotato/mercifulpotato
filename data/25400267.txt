How frequently do vaccines present side effects on the 1-3 year timeframe?<p>Basically never: negative effects are overwhelmingly weighted to close to administration.  This could, of course, always be the first vaccine to really do this.  Indeed, most childhood vaccine trials have been about a year long.<p>Much more interesting &#x2F; troublesome is what immunogenicity is at 1 years &#x2F; 3 years &#x2F; 5 years.  That&#x27;s why vaccines have failed at the end of their trials: efficacy isn&#x27;t durable enough, not that too many people get side effects 2.5 years in.<p>There&#x27;s a fair chance we&#x27;ll find that these vaccines don&#x27;t offer great long term protection.  So far protection seems to be holding up OK... But that&#x27;s next year&#x27;s problem.<p>&gt; Had that judgement call not been made in one of the least competent governments in US history, I think it might carry more weight, no?<p>We have plenty of other competent regulators making the same choice, and the review process followed seems reasonable.  The pressure from the top to speed it up further is yucky, I admit.<p>&gt; I would challenge this statement in that I don&#x27;t believe it possible to fully understand the risks yet.<p>Well, sure.  We can&#x27;t know exactly the probability that it will turn us all into vampires a year from now.  We can&#x27;t exactly know the risks from letting COVID-19 doing its thing unimpeded, either.  But the former risk looks pretty small and the latter risk looks pretty big, and it&#x27;s not like we&#x27;ve not studied both pretty extensively.')
