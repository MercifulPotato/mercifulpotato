But I haven&#x27;t seen any yet.<p>Written by Nathan Kolluru. He and Benson Leung were the two guys who did early through technical reviews of USB C cables, later he joined Google as well as a Hardware Engineer, Technical Program Manager. They gave this presentation recently <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usb.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;D1T2-3b%20-%20USB%20Type-C%20Linux%20Connector%20Class.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usb.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;D1T2-3b%20-%20USB%20...</a> In other words, he actually knows what he is talking about USB C wise, unlike little me :D Interesting writings on USB C hw at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@kolluru.nathan" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@kolluru.nathan</a><p>Edit: please, ffs, stop recommending non specs compliant garbage magnetic connectors. One, you might have very serious ESD issues because now your USB C pins are much more exposed than the normal connector. Two, you might have very serious data integrity issues because those pogo pins do not and can not adhere to the very rigorous specs. I find it absolutely astonishing that people would trust a thousand dollar electronic device on a piece of uncertified cable transmitting 100W and tens of gigabits...')
