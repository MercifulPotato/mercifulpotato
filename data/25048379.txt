There&#x27;s definitely a learning curve to switching to a new style of debugging, even if you&#x27;re accustomed to rr, and so encouraging use is more likely to get people to actually get to the point where they&#x27;re benefiting from the tool.<p>But that&#x27;s a tough sales cycle, they&#x27;ve tried it, they&#x27;ve said they would be happy if someone came asking for that. You could make the argument that they should hire an enterprise sales person or something, which may be true but also has obvious costs. (Let&#x27;s just say that it would be a large percentage increase over their current staffing.)<p>I&#x27;d think that their reality wins out over your &quot;shoulds&quot;. You may be right that they&#x27;re incompetent about selling into the enterprise, but I&#x27;m certain that they&#x27;ve had more experience trying to sell Pernosco to larger corporations than you have and so I&#x27;m not going to ding them for this <i>additional</i> purchasing opportunity.<p>Source: I work for a mid-sized company that does have a contract that gives me unlimited access to Pernosco. It&#x27;s quite useful. I don&#x27;t know the exact terms. I know I have solved some bugs that I would have been unlikely to ever fix and would be ongoing stability and maintenance concerns.<p>I&#x27;m working on a bug right now where the submitter is able to reproduce easily but I am not. They have managed to capture it in an rr recording, so I&#x27;m uploading it to Pernosco to take a look even though my desktop&#x27;s CPU is mismatched enough that I can&#x27;t just run the recording myself. From past experience, if I have it in Pernosco, I <i>will</i> be able to fix it, even though the root cause is far far removed from the resulting crash. (It&#x27;s subtle GC corruption.)')
