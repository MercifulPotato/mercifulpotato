Well, as a freelance contractor I often need a safe way to transmit sensitive information to clients (passwords, tokens, etc.) and have the guarantee the information will never be stored permanently anywhere nor replayed afterwards.<p>Anything you share on Ephemere is end-to-end encrypted using XSalsa20-Poly1305 and only stored within the browser. You close the tab, and everything is gone. You re-join a room, past messages are not replayed. As simple as that.<p>I intend to keep it free and open-source for the foreseeable future. I&#x27;m looking for some user feedback and ideally find some motivated contributors to make this a nice a usable app!\nThe complete source-code and opened issues are on GitHub: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ephemere-app&#x2F;ephemere" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ephemere-app&#x2F;ephemere</a>')
