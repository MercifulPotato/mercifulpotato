I don’t know why anyone pretends that these stats suggest that companies are being racist about hiring. Having been involved with hiring for several of the major tech companies, and being aware of the DEI targets at others, I can tell you that they are <i>fighting</i> over non-white male and non-indian male talent. It’s simply not true. Given that you’ve seemingly been out of the workforce for some time, I don’t know why you insist on being so adamant about how hiring works.<p>As for laws on the books, you found a historical artifact that has no legal effect, which the article you linked explains. It’s a reminder of a racist past, yes. These reminders will always exist in our society, and while it makes sense to continue to scrub them from legal documents over time, it’s not a good faith argument to cite such a thing as though it has any legal effect today.<p>To be intellectually honest, you should also be upset that virginia makes it illegal for unwed couples to live together. It’s also illegal to kill a sasquatch in Washington. In Kansas, it’s illegal to put ice cream on cherry pie.<p>To falsely say that blacks are hired last and fired first in America is not only preposterous, but extremely counterproductive to the outcome you’re presumably looking for. This is just inventing bogus reasons for Americans to feel hostile towards each other, and discouraging more people from even trying.')
