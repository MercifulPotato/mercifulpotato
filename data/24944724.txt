If you start charging you have to account for how much of the user base will leave just for there being any cost at all. If you&#x27;re using Paypal or similar for transactions you lose 39 cents out of each $1 yearly transaction (and if you run your own merchant account now you have to secure credit card information). Additional customer service overhead having to deal with people&#x27;s $1 yearly transactions, on top of people expecting better responsive customer service because they&#x27;re paying customers now, maintaining private customer data ... the variable costs per customer would probably end up more than $1. It&#x27;d be cheaper, literally, to make it free.<p>Maybe $5 a year could work as a price point, and given the gulf between Pay Nothing vs Pay Something, I doubt $5 a year would&#x27;ve lowered the conversion enough to make $1 a year transactions worth it. Don&#x27;t do credit card transactions for a dollar or less unless you&#x27;re counting on it converting into a higher amount a month later.')
