I&#x27;d argue there isn&#x27;t since almost all resources poured into AI are spent getting better at optimizing immutable functions. I don&#x27;t see progress in getting better at optimizing immutable functions as progress towards general intelligence, hence I don&#x27;t see almost anything people do in AI today as progress towards general intelligence.<p>Do you understand now? I don&#x27;t say nobody works on the things I think is important, just that it is mostly neglected compared to the enormous amount of resources spent on dumb models.')
