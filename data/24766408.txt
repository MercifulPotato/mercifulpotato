However, 12+ mos ago we canceled Netflix with the intention of signing up for a HBO product for awhile. That was the plan anyway. We haven&#x27;t yet signed up for a second service.<p>It helps that whenever the kids are home we binge on whatever during the holidays because they have &quot;shared&quot; accounts with almost all services.<p>edit-to-add: we have basic cable because bundling it with internet saves us a dollar.')
