That Arabic is written left to right seems to come from chisel based writing.<p>&gt; <i>Although it is hard to pinpoint why Arabic is sinistroverse, it has been theorized that before the papermaking process emerged in China, the Arabs used chisels to engrave the ideas and concepts they wished to manifest on stones. Due to its longevity, stone was preferred over leaves, skin, bones and shells. Considering most of the “writers” [and individuals in general] were right-handed, they would use their right hand to hold [and carve with] the chisel and the left hand to hold a hammer. Such direction is more natural because it involves an outward motion and is, therefore, easier to perform from a motor point of view. A left-to-right motion would have been counterintuitive, especially with the risk of personal injury involved.</i>[1]<p>However, as another comment mentioned there are techniques that solve the smearing and awkward hand-position by rotating the paper. I would not be surprised if those are taught more widely for Arabic as 90% instead of 10% of writers face that problem.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pangeanic.com&#x2F;knowledge_center&#x2F;arabic-right-to-left&#x2F;#" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pangeanic.com&#x2F;knowledge_center&#x2F;arabic-right-to-l...</a>')
