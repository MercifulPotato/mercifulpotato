Item(by='filoleg', descendants=None, kids=[25382476], score=None, time=1607644882, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25370512, text='&gt;Gameification of investing can only be a bad thing<p>I keep seeing people referring to RH somehow &quot;gamifying&quot; the experience, but I just don&#x27;t see it, it feels like just throwing a buzzword at RH until that buzzword sticks.<p>The only thing they did in terms of UI is made it very simple and convenient to use. If that&#x27;s what counts as &quot;gamification&quot; in 2020, then I am all for it. I just thought that this term usually referred for stuff like &quot;achievements&quot;, some goals&#x2F;scores, objectives completed, etc. RH has none of that. All it has is a very good UI that is pleasant to use.<p>If someone could clarify what RH does that constitutes &quot;gamification&quot;, I am curious to hear.')
