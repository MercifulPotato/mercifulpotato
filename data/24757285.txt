This version was first published between 1829 and 1834 in either New York or Baltimore. All of the above performers claimed to have written the song, and the dispute is not resolved.<p>It&#x27;s possible for both things to be true and for multiple versions to have become popular at the same time, with one outshining the other in popularity. As a recent example, Aretha Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Respect&quot; is a cover.<p>In any case, the NPR&#x27;s assertion is that specifically in the context of ice cream, 19th century ice cream parlors played minstrel songs (including but not limited to the song in question), and when they moved to trucks they played the music they used to play in parlors to attract customers who remembered what ice cream parlors sounded like.')
