While your conclusion would likely be incorrect, you almost never run into that scenario.<p>For example, if you conducted a study every week for 20 years, you&#x27;d both be extremely prolific and expect to have drawn about one wrong conclusion.<p>The example is a case of an absurd premise (i.e., a fair coin comes up heads 10 times in a row) leading to an absurd conclusion (that the coin is biased). Of course, this is exactly the guarantee the hypothesis test provides: under robust assumptions, you&#x27;ll draw the wrong conclusion only rarely.')
