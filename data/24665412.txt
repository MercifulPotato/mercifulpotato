Knowing this, Thibado&#x27;s group built their circuit with two diodes for converting AC into a direct current (DC). With the diodes in opposition allowing the current to flow both ways, they provide separate paths through the circuit, producing a pulsing DC current that performs work on a load resistor.</i><p>&gt; <i>Additionally, they discovered that their design increased the amount of power delivered. &quot;We also found that the on-off, switch-like behavior of the diodes actually amplifies the power delivered, rather than reducing it, as previously thought,&quot; said Thibado. &quot;The rate of change in resistance provided by the diodes adds an extra factor to the power.&quot;</i><p>&gt; <i>The team used a relatively new field of physics to prove the diodes increased the circuit&#x27;s power. &quot;In proving this power enhancement, we drew from the emergent field of stochastic thermodynamics and extended the nearly century-old, celebrated theory of Nyquist,&quot; said coauthor Pradeep Kumar, associate professor of physics and coauthor.</i><p>&gt; <i>According to Kumar, the graphene and circuit share a symbiotic relationship. Though the thermal environment is performing work on the load resistor, the graphene and circuit are at the same temperature and heat does not flow between the two.</i><p>&gt; <i>That&#x27;s an important distinction, said Thibado, because a temperature difference between the graphene and circuit, in a circuit producing power, would contradict the second law of thermodynamics. &quot;This means that the second law of thermodynamics is not violated, nor is there any need to argue that &#x27;Maxwell&#x27;s Demon&#x27; is separating hot and cold electrons,&quot; Thibado said.</i>')
