These are basic assumptions that anyone can make if they spec 5 seconds using common sense.<p>Why do you think that the SEC, Fed, and all aspects of the US Government would sit back and knowingly let a new financial crisis happen? It doesn&#x27;t really matter who it&#x27;s not fair to, it wouldn&#x27;t happen. You can argue who will get the short end of the stick in the end, and why it&#x27;s not fair, but that&#x27;s secondary to my point.<p>Another good example of this is claims (which yes, have fizzled out over the last couple of days) that Melvin Capital has lost $100B dollars already, and only has $13B in assets (which, if you account for a firesale, is likely much less than that). That amount of money is pretty much the practical maximum that you could get out of Melvin Capital, even if they have done the shady and illegal things that have been alledged. At a point you can&#x27;t get blood from a stone, no matter how much you feel that you are in the right.')
