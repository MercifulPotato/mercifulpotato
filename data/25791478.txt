One of the <i>other</i> effects of society is to reduce -- and it has been fairly constant -- access to pain medication.  At first you could nip over to the apothecary for laudanum or whatever.  Then you needed a prescription from a physician.  Next, one of the effects on society is <i>insurance</i>, so you must also navigate that to get your prescription.  And finally the government comes in and decides on a ham-fisted &quot;crackdown&quot; on pill mills, nevermind people who actually need the stuff, so society has put another obstacle between you and relief, so there are quotas, hooray.<p>The other area where this falls down is <i>standardization</i>, and I think this is exactly a group of people to understand it.  Twenty years ago programming was very much the Wild Wild West, but now, seemingly, everyone talks this Agile talk and now we &quot;must&quot; all program like one another, which includes odious morning standups and the being &quot;on call&quot; mentality of DevOps, plus even bog standard shops pretending that they have some kind of Silicon Valley burn rate and velocity to maintain.  And if you cannot hack that, tough, find another industry.  That&#x27;s society and that&#x27;s a transition that has been fairly rough if you are put in a position to count your spoons.')
