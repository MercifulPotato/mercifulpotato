That’s the point of valuing businesses. You’re not buying the stock. You’re buying a portion of the business.<p>Say you have a drywall company in town. You and the owner are good friends and the owner wants to retire but doesn’t have a family member who is interested in the enterprise. He seeks out buyers. You mention to him you’re interested but you have to ask yourself how much you’re willing to pay for the business, its fleet, tools, leads and customer database, current lease agreements, employees, etc.<p>Someone has to value that, because it intrinsically has value. It’s not worthless. You can’t rebuild a multimillion dollar business over night.<p>So it turns out if you have this entity that produces cash flow, it’s worth something. So how much are you willing to pay for each dollar of earnings? At the end of the day, that’s what a business produces for its owners.')
