I&#x27;ve been using it to build a project to make US ranked choice election results more accessible. It&#x27;s very intuitive and easy to use. The main difficulty for me is how to get around the limitation that the sqlite files have to be colocated on the same server. These datasets can get pretty large, and I can&#x27;t host them on Github, and since I can&#x27;t put the datasette db on an S3 bucket, I&#x27;ve been exploring mounting AWS Elastic File System to the Docker container. Is there a better way?')
