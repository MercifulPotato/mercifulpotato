I don&#x27;t sell modchips anymore because it wasn&#x27;t very economical or profitable.<p>I did come up with ways to assemble the chips faster but I couldn&#x27;t optimize it enough so that I could remove myself from the equation. I ended up selling enough to get rid of all of the inventory I purchased and making enough profit to cover any tool&#x2F;equipment purchases.<p>If anyone knows how I could streamline the whole modchip creation process I would be very interested!')
