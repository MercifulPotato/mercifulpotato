That is, instead of numerical salary offers, the company thinks it&#x27;s better to offer a specific lifestyle level in a geographically neutral way, which translates into different salaries for different locations.<p>Unfortunately the policy such reasoning leads to is exactly the same one that the conspiracy of coastal elites would implement (if it actually existed):  Based solely on their location, pay people who live in Middle America less than you pay BigTechCity residents for the same work.<p>I&#x27;m trying to explain that you have to look at lifestyle-based reasoning from one particular perspective for it to make sense.  There are other reasonable perspectives which reveal it to be a stupid, absurd policy.')
