The code they present explicitly references `config.DevelopmentConfig`:<p><pre><code>    database = config.DevelopmentConfig.DB_DATABASE\n    user = config.DevelopmentConfig.DB_USERNAME\n    password = config.DevelopmentConfig.DB_PASSWORD\n</code></pre>\nOne way this could happen is if the objects under `config` were loaded from separate files, and the dev file was changed to a symlink to the prod file. So `config.DevelopmentConfig` always loads &#x2F;opt&#x2F;myapp&#x2F;config&#x2F;dev.cfg but a developer had dev.cfg -&gt; prod.cfg and the prod credentials and connection details were loaded into `config.DevelopmentConfig`.<p>Just an idea.')
