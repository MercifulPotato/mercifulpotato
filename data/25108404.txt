You claim they&#x27;re all thieves and they don&#x27;t want to be integrated, so you deny them any job prospects. And then you turn around and wonder why they steal!! How else will they feed their families or afford the basic necessities, man?<p>I&#x27;m not saying they&#x27;re all honest people; but if the honest ones are not given a chance, they will have to resort to dishonest means.<p>It takes 2 to tango. You need both sides to make compromises.<p>This whole episode reminds me of how blacks were treated in America. Were it not for WW2, I wonder what the situation of blacks would be like in the USA.')
