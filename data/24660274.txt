Especially if it doesn&#x27;t involve breaking any laws (not ethics). Even in many cases Gaming the system by breaking the law is considered OK as long as one doesn&#x27;t get caught doing it. (In fact this might be the only way to come up in politics in India, but that&#x27;s another debate.) Once they are caught the general attitude is &quot;they had it coming&quot;.<p>Consider this highflying Indian start up, Unacademy[1][2]. Here is their anthem [3], &quot;Let&#x27;s crack it&quot;. This &quot;crack it&quot; is basically about &quot;Gaming it&quot; and succeed at it any how.<p>* Majority of Indians have a lot of attraction towards free. I have seen even people from millionaire families, spend 10-15 minutes of their time to get something free that is of $1 or $2 in value. The attitude is like, am I doing anything else productive here? If not I might as well do this and earn Rs. 100. In fact this attitude is cultivated from childhood in certain business class families. Don&#x27;t let go of any opportunity of earning a profit, however small it might be.<p>Here we are talking about student population which is generally low on cash anyway.<p>So if you are any company offering something free to Indians, expect them to come in droves, and milk you as much as possible. Here I think Digital Ocean doesn&#x27;t mind being well known in Indian students. Many of these Indian Students are going to make purchasing decisions on servers in a few years to come. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s the OSS community suffering because of it now.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Unacademy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Unacademy</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unacademy.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unacademy.com&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=XvIfiblHz1I" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=XvIfiblHz1I</a>')
