But there isn&#x27;t, and not due to lack of trying. Cosmology aside (difficult to measure) all the measurements of femtoscale interactions and condensed matter &quot;constants&quot; and their corresponding QM&#x2F;QFT calculations that match to like 13-15 decimal places.. there are just incredibly massive chunks of evidence in favor of QM. It&#x27;s just not a &quot;first approximation&quot; of reality that can be thrown out easily.<p>Theorists and experimentalists in the field come up with new tests every year (they are my favorite papers to read!), so it&#x27;s absolutely not like there is some inherent scare of not daring to contest it. It&#x27;s just that you need experiments to contest well-established and working theories, you can&#x27;t just go out and say &quot;well, but <i>I</i> don&#x27;t like it&quot;..<p>By the way as I&#x27;m sure you know if you studied this kind of physics, the &quot;it doesn&#x27;t give us any insights into how to peek beyond it&quot; isn&#x27;t really true, there are falsifiable assumptions that are tested and peeked at all the time - I&#x27;m thinking on the hidden variable theorems and validations. The theorems don&#x27;t assume any specific theory (QM or a new one would do). That road is a nice one to casually drive down.')
