I generally cook on my grill to get to really high heat, and that is definitely at the high end of what I&#x27;d even do with the heat.<p>At that&#x27;s the low-point for the effect. I&#x27;m not sure that commercial products necessarily all experience that reaction at that temperature.<p>That&#x27;s above the smoke point of any oil I could imagine cooking with. While I&#x27;m sure you can&#x27;t discount it entirely, I would not consider it something you would need to worry about unless you were throwing caution to the wind with your cooking process, or perhaps left your stove unattended.')
