But in classic history this seems to be the same. Good and great is having conquered much. \nAnd also in the general perception. The hollywood movies of Caesar or Alexander? Pure admiration. No serious criticism(or any at all), I remember of. Nothing against presenting history as it was. But there is still lots of glorification going on.<p>My school history classes were also speaking mainly great of the &quot;great&quot; people. Even though we would call them brutal dictators and barbaric enslavers if they would exist today.')
