Some OSes (OpenBSD) will do randomization based on object files and sections, which you can do things with like place each function in a different section and relink. This would require an exploit to leak addresses, which is a better situation I guess; the downside is that this adds complexity and is fundamentally incompatible with certain operating systems (Darwin). As for JITsâ€¦I mean, they kind of need to exist, but I am unsure what to do there other than &quot;your app doesn&#x27;t seem like it needs a JIT&quot; will mean, especially as more programs ship with language runtimes and browser engines.')
