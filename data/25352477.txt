Somebody has to work to provide a stable distro and supported on many hardwares, hypervisors&#x2F;clouds and softwares running on top of OS. But the funny things is that usually there is a huge contradiction on people who uses CentOS on production, they are the same people who pays for proprietary software like Windows, Office, Oracle DB, VMware, etc... sometimes spend millions of dollars on these softwares, but save some bucks using a free Linux distro!! But I do respect the ones who are entirely open source, just don&#x27;t think any big company besides Google for example, would have a huge IT teams to support everything')
