In every way.<p>Deming process people call this &quot;one way flow&quot; of information.<p>Paraphrasing, mostly to continue my rant:<p>Versions are just labels (tags, aliases) you share with clients, users. Semver is no worse than any other scheme. And fretting about semver gives scrum masters something to do.<p>Build numbers are used for internal processes. Like the &quot;found&quot;, &quot;fixed&quot;, &quot;closed&quot; fields that QA tools should have (but rarely do).<p>As you said, version is annointed AFTER an artifact is accepted, moments before release. Like an imprint. (For all workflows prior to &quot;Test Into Prod&quot;, so ymmv.)<p>Then everyone can also precognitively divine a future version, so stuff like press releases can be front loaded. Genius!<p>Few things drive me more nucking futts than teams which predetermine version before attempting a build. Oops, build failed. Manually increment semver. Try again. Rinse, lather, repeat. Then ferret all wiki references to semver and update those JIRAs.<p>Trying to explain this to noobs is harder than advocating using knives for cutting to someone who&#x27;s only ever seen spoons. People get it when they see it, but can&#x27;t imagine it, so the push back is exhausting.')
