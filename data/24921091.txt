If it can be viewed without logging in, then they get it indexed with Google and it dilutes the search results.<p>Nobody views snippets and user profiles as a common part of daily development, so it takes time away from development to investigate those things to prune them. And if you don&#x27;t prune it fast enough, it gets into the search results at which point it&#x27;s even more of a pain in the ass to remove (even using Google&#x27;s webmaster tools).')
