It&#x27;s not immediately obvious that YouTube which uses full video ads is best served by getting ads from a company that focuses on text ads (Google) or banner ads (Google&#x27;s DoubleClick).<p>Gmail could charge for account features like Yahoo mail and Fastmail do.<p>Android could be legitimately open source, like Linux is. Or they could sell carrier specific distributions, which is something carriers are doing themselves right now but badly.<p>Chrome would need to operate under the aegis of some company, but that needn&#x27;t be the same company that runs Google search and Google ads. If that were the case, their abusive ad experiences code may actually be <i>good</i> and not merely reflect a desire to destroy ad companies that aren&#x27;t Google&#x27;s DoubleClick. Chrome could also then allow browser login integration into other companies. I&#x27;d prefer of Chrome integrated with my Apple accounts, not my Google accounts for example.<p>Ads itself could be split into two companies---Google search ads (which may or may no be owned by Google search), and DoubleClick which was its own company to begin with before Google bought them.')
