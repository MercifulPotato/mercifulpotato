By far the worst parts are excessively verbose &quot;Beans&quot;, nullpointer by default, the JEE ecosystem (there are good alternatives) and the high RAM consumption (a JVM flaw). Honestly 80% of the value I derive from using a different JVM language come from avoiding NPEs, getters and setters. The remaining 20% can be very useful but they are certainly not essential nor can they be considered mandatory.')
