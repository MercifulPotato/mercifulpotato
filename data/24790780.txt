The idea that Apple &quot;just works&quot; is part of this brand, and they fight against any claim that it doesn&#x27;t, even if it&#x27;s true. It&#x27;s very important to them to push the idea that their operating systems are the best ones available into the brains of their users. In some industries, like the music production industry, if you don&#x27;t have an Apple device, you&#x27;ll be laughed out of the room. The brand is probably the single most valuable asset that Apple possesses.')
