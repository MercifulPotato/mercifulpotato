This is a problem for consensus systems (like Zcash in the article) because the signature is recorded and needs to be verified by many parties, and if a malicious signature it tickles an interop bug it can maybe (<i>handwave</i>) force third parties to treat the blockchain as invalid, or something like that. But in the context of DKIM if a sender generates a signature that a recipient can&#x27;t validate, by using buggy key generation code that produces small cofactors or noncanonical encodings, only the sender suffers pain.')
