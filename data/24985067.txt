Both for the printer, AND for the inks.<p>You cannot reproduce photo-quality prints with just 4 colors (cmyk). Your high-end photo-level printers use 10 or 12 inks, with far higher resolution than a typical $200 Brother printer.<p>But if you&#x27;re only doing office work &#x2F; text &#x2F; etc. etc., laser is great. Even mild graphics (diagrams mainly) work out fine with laser prints.<p>--------<p>The typical $200 ink printer however, is complete garbage.')
