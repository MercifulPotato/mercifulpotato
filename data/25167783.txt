You&#x27;d be hard pressed to find a single one of them in a modern OS software stack, to be honest. Even the kernel is likely to be ASLRed, and hardware is dynamic and can&#x27;t be hardcoded.<p>They are common in embedded software though. Different RISC arches handle this differently. ARM usually uses a constant pool after functions, relative PC-addressed. PowerPC usually builds 32-bit literals in two instructions each containing 16 bits. Both of those have the ~same overhead at 32 bits, but at 64 bits the constant pool version wins. But then again, any 64-bit system is unlikely to be small enough to be running embedded style code with absolute addresses anywhere that matters, so...')
