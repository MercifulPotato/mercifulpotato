Apple doesn&#x27;t support Linux on 86 either. Third parties did the Mac Linux ports for 86, and will do them for the ARM Macs.<p>The only thing Apple needs to do is to not lock the ARM Macs from booting another OS, which is very easy to do -- Apple doesn&#x27;t need to invest lots of work to run Linux on ARM Macs, just needs not to prevent it.')
