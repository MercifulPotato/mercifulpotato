The contract that Parler agreed to has an Acceptable Use Policy which is very broad. If Parler believes AWS breached their contract, they can sue just like in anyone else in a contract disagreement.<p>Maybe in the long-term we&#x27;ll look at hosting more like real-estate and it will have more laws and regulations about what the providers can and cannot do, but I doubt it and I&#x27;m willing to bet the trade offs that come with that are truly terrible. Imagine how many things wouldn&#x27;t get off the ground if hosting contracting was even 1&#x2F;3 of the real estate process.<p>More importantly, hosting isn&#x27;t a monopoly. There&#x27;s no government provided moat that justifies that level of regulation. The way I see it there are only two things that are in utilities in the internet space, ISPs (both consumer facing and interconnects) and DNS, and DNS is arguable.')
