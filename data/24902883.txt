Item(by='gamblor956', descendants=None, kids=[24903622, 24903157], score=None, time=1603755777, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24902118, text='<i>Based on the &quot;Betamax&quot; supreme court ruling on case &quot;Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.&quot; in the United States, it is. This is the same ruling that protects many DVR&#x27;s such as Tivo, and many more which are used all over the U.S. and in many parts of the world.</i><p>I guess nobody told them that DVRs like Tivo aren&#x27;t sold in the US anymore or that Betamax hasn&#x27;t been governing law for over 2 decades. Betamax was fair use because it was the only option for viewing a lot of broadcast content due to the limited broadcast windows and rarity of TV shows sold on cassette tape at the time.<p>But every form of media content today is available on-demand, so the time-shifting logic doesn&#x27;t apply. And a lot of the content is also made available (for a price) for connectivity-shifted access, so the &quot;download for the plane ride&quot; argument doesn&#x27;t work either.<p>I would wish them luck, but quite honestly they&#x27;re just going to waste courtroom space that could go to a case that actually needs it.')
