I can remember my friends dad had a Mac in the 90s. When I asked my dad he hated Apple and Macs with a passion about.  He was an EE and hated the closed operating system. He was not even close to being alone either.<p>It really was similar to what I hear today from a couple people who I know that refuse to use an iPhone or any apple product. The Apple hating passion from people who have never used them is very real and has been for decades.')
