It is more a neurological fact than a metaphysical matter woven into the fabric of reality, in the manner that philosophers tend to discuss it.<p>In this case, anger is a loss response. Sadness is also a loss response but it looks back in time and works to reduce one&#x27;s activity level, while anger is forward looking and tends to drive one towards more action. (Unrelated, but fear is also a loss response, but a response to a potential loss).<p>Anger also generally (but not always) requires that the one experiencing anger recognizes the perceived cause of anger as an agent with free will. We don&#x27;t feel angry, for example, when we get caught in the rain (unless it is at ourselves for not bringing an umbrella). However, we <i>have</i> seen animals (such as chimpanzees and dogs) on occasion expressing what look like anger at inanimate objects that have hurt them.<p>Perhaps there are other intelligent species out there with a different evolutionary path that has a larger number of primary emotions. And perhaps there are others who only possess one emotion in place of both anger and sadness. It is a subject worth examining from an evolutionary and neurological angle, rather than philosophical.')
