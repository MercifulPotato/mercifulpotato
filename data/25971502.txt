A large number of people acting in concert can fight back against them without going to a class action lawsuit (which are banned anyway). A few years back, the MO for companies was to require arbitration, not participate, and then let it linger forever. California changed the law recently (2019?) where if the company doesn&#x27;t respond, they &quot;lose&quot; according to JAMS rules.<p>* I participated in the IndieGoGo arbitration process. Our fee was $250 while theirs was uncapped with most (public) estimates being in the $10-12k range. With a few hundred people, it starts turning into real money for them.')
