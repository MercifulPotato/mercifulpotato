And we wanna gather as much user group as possible globally, keeping unit economics positive.<p>So, is there any marketing solution to automatically turn on&#x2F;off (or change budget of) Facebook, Google ads, Snapchat, Tiktok, Twitter advertisement campaigns with estimated CLV of user group acquired by the campaigns?<p>For example, suppose that we&#x27;ve spent $300 on Facebook ad campaign A since 48 hours ago, and revenue from the user group acquired by the campaign A is $150 (but the estimated CLV is $350). Then we wanna increase budget on the campaign A by 50% automatically.<p>And if we&#x27;ve spent $300 on Facebook ad campaign B since 48 hours ago, and revenue from the user group acquired by the campaign B is $80 (but the estimated CLV is $200). Then we wanna stop the campaign B right away.<p>Now we have payment performance data for each marketing campaign collected from Adjust and Appsflyer. So we can provide this data as a raw data or set up the integration on Appsflyer.<p>Is there any Saas you can recommend for this situation?')
