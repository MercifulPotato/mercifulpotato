Intuition is a shortcut. But you still need to go back and work out the formal proof, to show you&#x27;re right - to yourself and also to communicate it to others.<p>And, once you know the answer, and have an idea of why it&#x27;s true, this guidance makes it much easier to find your way.<p>To come back to your question: you can learn another way to get the answer by watching videos, where they explain what they are doing as they go. So, this won&#x27;t explain how <i>you</i> do it, but you can learn another way of doing it that you <i>can</i> explain.<p>BTW IMHO the most insidious difficulty in learning mathematics is gaps - an incomplete or subtly incorrect understanding. It&#x27;s insidious because the gap is not apparent at later material, because it assumed, so you <i>won&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing</i>, and therefore can&#x27;t diagnose or fix it. You need either an excellent teacher&#x2F;tutor&#x2F;mentor&#x2F;coach to pick it up (but they often don&#x27;t), or to methodically go through <i>all</i> the previous work. The sooner you do it, the easier the easier it is.')
