They all failed to beat the performance of comparable conventional processors. [1] lists the following disadvantages of data-flow:<p>- Debugging difficult (no precise state)<p>- Interrupt&#x2F;exception handling is difficult (what is precise state semantics?)<p>- Implementing dynamic data structures difficult in pure data flow models<p>- Too much parallelism? (Parallelism control needed)<p>- High bookkeeping overhead (tag matching, data storage)<p>- Instruction cycle is inefficient<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;course.ece.cmu.edu&#x2F;~ece740&#x2F;f13&#x2F;lib&#x2F;exe&#x2F;fetch.php?media=onur-740-fall13-module5.2.1-dataflow-part1.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;course.ece.cmu.edu&#x2F;~ece740&#x2F;f13&#x2F;lib&#x2F;exe&#x2F;fetch.php?med...</a>')
