I&#x27;ve linked one in another comment here, Carbon Engineering:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Carbon_Engineering" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Carbon_Engineering</a><p>They think that at scale, a ton of CO2 will cost $100 and take 5-6GJ if energy.<p>Totally agreed that it is far cheaper to just never emit in the first place. But as far as building new nuclear, France has not been able to succeed at this economically, and similarly the UK&#x27;s plans at building new nuclear are coming apart completely.<p>And even if we are able to decarbonize, with whatever technology, be it nuclear or not,  we will still need to get to negative CO2 emissions in the coming decade. While some of that will take the form of CO2 sequestration in the biosphere, such sequestration is only temporary, and we will eventually want geologic sequestration.<p>So we must solve the capture problem by some means. Perhaps it will be with something like Carbon Engineering&#x27;s process, or maybe something else.')
