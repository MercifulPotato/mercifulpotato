Item(by='pmontra', descendants=None, kids=[25249271, 25250841], score=None, time=1606691523, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25248472, text='I own an Ubuntu laptop with an NVIDIA card since 2014 (HP ZBook 15 with Quadro K1100M). Not perfect but not garbage. Hours of debugging &#x2F; workarounds cumulated in 6 years yes, days not.<p>The remaining problems on Ubuntu 20.04:<p>1. The brightness control keys don&#x27;t work. They generate the event they are supposed to generate then I see an error in syslog. Workaround: two hotkeys bound to windows+fn+brightness up&#x2F;down to run a bash script that increases &#x2F; reduces the backlight level.<p>2. The screen works at 40 Hz since Ubuntu 18.04. I expected to be unusable but actually I can&#x27;t notice the difference with 60 Hz. Noveau works at 60 Hz but it&#x27;s unusable for other reasons (I don&#x27;t remember the details, I checked months ago)<p>Problems I had because of the NVIDIA driver: the laptop didn&#x27;t shutdown, only restart. Workaround: I press the power button right after the restart, when the BIOS shows up. Not a big deal because I shutdown a couple of times per year.')
