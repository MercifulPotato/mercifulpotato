I&#x27;m not anti-crypto, and I own a small amount myself.<p>That said, all these posts are absolute horseshit. We&#x27;ve had John McAfee anticipating million dollar Bitcoins for the last few years, we&#x27;ve had Novogratz spewing more unsubstantiated price predictions, and now someone writing a blog post is doing the same. Maybe it will happen. Maybe. But there&#x27;s no point speculating on it like this. I could do the same with nearly any other asset or idea, like virtual reality or artificial intelligence or some other buzzword.<p>This just fuels FOMO and hype and does little to advance the cause of decentralization and cryptocurrencies.<p>This is not to mention Bitcoin&#x27;s biggest problem, which is its distribution. People like Roger Ver and Brock Pierce will not (and <i>probably</i> should not) be the richest people on Earth.')
