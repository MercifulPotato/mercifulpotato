His assumption was that the `IO80211AWDLPeer`s were in a linked-list type of data structure (which is a pretty sensible guess). In fact, it ended up being more akin to a priority queue:<p>&gt; The data structure holding the peers is in fact much more complex than a linked list, it&#x27;s more like a priority queue with some interesting behaviours when the queue is modified and a distinct lack of safe unlinking and the like.<p>I amended my post for clarification, I&#x27;m sure Apple uses linked lists all the time :)')
