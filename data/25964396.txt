Reflectivity of visible and UV light prevents more energy from being absorbed, but doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean the material cools down well once hot. A high emissivity means the material can cool down quickly through radiation.<p>I guess YInMn blue has a high emissivity.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reflective_surfaces_(climate_engineering)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reflective_surfaces_(climate_e...</a>')
