Could you elaborate?<p>I too agree that social media as a common medium probably does not, in itself, confer &quot;common carrier&quot; status on it. Even if many have been bought up by Facebook, there is still room for competitors to arise that provide alternative. This is not like ATT&amp;T before its breakup where it was literally the only option. Heck, nothing stops someone from rolling their own stack on a local PC or local &quot;cloud&quot; and running their own social media service there, with mobile friendly sites that don&#x27;t need an Android or Apple apps no need to rely on 3rd party cloud infrastructure. <i>Then</i> they would only be relying on the common-carrier ISP infrastructure that couldn&#x27;t ban them for content. They aren&#x27;t entitled to use the private infrastructure services or content distribution networks of other private organizations.')
