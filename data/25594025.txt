Item(by='fao_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609431718, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25592165, text='&gt; Systemd&#x27;s &quot;start everything at once, let the dependencies sort out automatically&quot; is a major regression for server systems. With sysv-init you could just pick the right ordering and be done, everything was stable for every boot after that.<p>This is a big point. All of the systemd systems I&#x27;ve been exposed to in the wild have non-deterministic inits, i.e. if it takes longer than average to boot up once (A problem I had a few times), starting it again doesn&#x27;t replicate said problem. If the network craps itself when booting sometimes, that problem is variable so it&#x27;s impossible to tell if you&#x27;ve fixed the problem, and it was what you suspected, or if it&#x27;s something else and you only think that you&#x27;ve fixed it.<p>On the other hand, my alpine system consistently boots up. If it errors once, it will error consistently enough to allow tracing of the cause, but regardless, it has never had a problem on boot.')
