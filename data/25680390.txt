Republicans were routinely denied the right to watch vote counts.  In some cases, they were forced to stand more than six feet away &quot;because of COVID&quot;, and in other cases, they were sent away entirely.<p>&gt; Once again if fraud had taken place there has been enough scrutiny to turn up more than a single dodgy mail man and a counting station in georgia where no one who knows how the counting process works has challenged the explanation given.<p>I gave you examples.
