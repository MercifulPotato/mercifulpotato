It was especially original and interesting, as it relied heavily on languages and accents for the plot.<p>However, what killed my suspension of disbelief (as a native French speaker) was the fact that the French actress spoke with an unmistakable early 21st century accent, definitely out of place in a second world war movie.<p>This was a big letdown, considering how much attention had been given to accents in the rest of the movie.')
