For nearly all sports, the male version of the sport is identical to the female version. Maybe women don&#x27;t lift as much, don&#x27;t run quite as fast, or do shorter distances (like in speed skating), but the basics of the sport are the same. Not so in gymnastics: men and women do entirely different things. Men are all about upperbody strength, women are all about flexibility and elegance. They&#x27;re basically completely different sports, which I guess goes a long way to explain why athletes peak at totally different ages.<p>What if a female gymnast wants to do the horizontal bar or other &quot;male&quot; events? And even when they do have the same event in name, like the floor, they&#x27;re still different for unnecessary reasons. For example, women have music, men don&#x27;t. Why?<p>Obviously there are biological reasons why women aren&#x27;t as strong, maybe it&#x27;s unreasonable to expect women to do a heavy event like the rings, but most events could be equally accessible to everybody. But the sport itself forces athletes into very gender-specific roles. I can&#x27;t help but wonder if unifying the sport may help to reduce this kind of abuse as well.')
