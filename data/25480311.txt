It really isn&#x27;t an inevitability that anything like SV exist, and in fact, there are tons of reasons why it&#x27;s unlikely a new one would evolve, chief among them the hostility to individual entrepreneurs* like regulatory capture, enforceable non-competes, and so on, as well a lot of the margin and efficiencies have been driven out of the business in favor of defensible moats and network effects.<p>The most likely thing isn&#x27;t five more valleys, it&#x27;s that the valley gets { Texas, Boston, Utah, Minnesota, DC Metro, ..}-ized and there is nothing like it again.<p>* (I _hate_ &quot;entrepreneur&quot;; I&#x27;ve founded and exited a company but as a term it is not in-line at all with the freewheeling, let&#x27;s-do-this, let&#x27;s-do-it-better-than-anyone way people who drove the valley in the 70s and 80s thought of themselves. The rise of &quot;entrepreneur&quot; as the way of thinking about founders correlates well, imho, with the decline of the valley as the center of technology.)')
