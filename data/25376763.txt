I&#x27;ve learned Clojure in the past and keep wanting to go back to it but Clojure has been the hardest language for me to become fairly comfortable with. I think it may have to do with its dynamic-ness. There&#x27;s basically no problem Clojure experts can&#x27;t find a solution for. Its basic constructs are very powerful but all those solutions are not codified in the language itself. So Clojure has this extra layer of &quot;culture&quot; around it and as a beginner that&#x27;s very hard to learn without a lot of doing and running into a wall quite a few times. Just when I think I have a grasp on the language, I see a new construct or new way of doing something that&#x27;s completely alien to me and wasn&#x27;t in the Clojure book I just read. I&#x27;ve not saying one can&#x27;t become good at it but it takes a bit and might help to have an expert or two guiding you.')
