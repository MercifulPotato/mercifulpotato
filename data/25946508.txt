Even before the government got involved I was a bit concerned at the rapid growth of personal consumer credit through platforms like Ant financial and it was something my friend and I would occasionally discuss. These fintech comapnies made it extremely easy to obtain a loan and actively pushed these financial products through advertisements. There were also growing numbers of anecdotes online and in real life of people who didn&#x27;t necessarily know or understand the financial consequences of a personal loan and ended up sadelling themselves with debt they couldn&#x27;t pay back. You have to remember that China is growing rapidly, for some people their previous generations were still farming somewhere in the countryside. Some of them may in fact still be in the countryside but have access to internet and a smartphone. They might not have the adequate financial literacy.<p>Rapidly increasing consumer debt in an economy is not necessarily a good thing as more than demonstrated by subprime debt in the 08 financial crises. If completely unchecked, it is in the interest of a company like Any to keep pushing out loans, and it wouldn&#x27;t be that they are knowingly doing anything wrong. However it might not be good for the rest of society. I think western media enjoys portraying this whole incident in some sort of nefarious light but I actually think it&#x27;s a prescient and responsible move.')
