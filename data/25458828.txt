It would have been unlikely for nvidia to try doubling GPU prices for fear of the backlash and the risk of losing out if that wasn&#x27;t countered by enough people willing to buy at the higher price.<p>But then the bitcoin gpu shortage happened and people were paying double for mid tier GTX 10xx cards.
