A local brewer needs new tooling for their canning line; I’m currently 3d scanning various components and designing replacements that I will machine from stainless and Delrin. I do a lot of this kind of work for local small and mid-sized businesses. I would say that successful local outfits are energetic about making their customers happy and tend to be efficient. I’m sure Siemens could send a team to re-tool this canning line, but it would cost 5x more than having my little company take care of it, and I’m interested in stuff. I don’t mind taking the time to get it right and make it last.')
