LeelaZero was one of the early ones, KataGo is probably your best bet right now. Sai is also in the mix.<p>All are _very_ strong. KataGo is ungodly strong, it beats pros.<p>Learning Go is about more than just playing against strong players, but it could help. The biggest difficulty is that the strong AIs aren&#x27;t actually that good at playing handicap games, and they&#x27;re also almost completely unable to explain to you why you should play one move over another.')
