The way I see it is that models are like theorems: they are useful and worthy of being studied, but if you forget to validate that your hypotheses are correct, you get wrong results: garbage in, garbage out.<p>An alarming amount of stuff these days is the equivalent of people trying to apply the pythagorean theorem to a non-rectangle triangle and then complaining the results don&#x27;t match.')
