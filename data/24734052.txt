Enough credits got you a month of hosting. So of course I wrote up a little HTML page with some javascript that had a dozen iframes to load each click into a different frame, then refresh the ads list. Host told me to knock it off a couple days later :(<p>He did end up hiring me for a tiny bit of website work after that, paid like $200. My first ever paid tech gig.')
