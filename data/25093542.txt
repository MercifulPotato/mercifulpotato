Item(by='xrisk', descendants=None, kids=[25093761], score=None, time=1605373101, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25093427, text='&gt; White space or negative space is important for usability<p>Sure, I don’t deny it. <i>However</i>, just adding a ton of space doesn’t make a design good. Especially when you actively harm functionality while doing that.<p>From my limited experience doing design, I’ve realized that good contrast and active visual demarcations go a long way towards that goal (both things which the new UI is sorely missing).<p>See the old Mail UI: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;content&#x2F;dam&#x2F;edam&#x2F;applecare&#x2F;images&#x2F;en_US&#x2F;mac_apps&#x2F;Mail&#x2F;macos-catalina-mail-inbox-multi-account.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;content&#x2F;dam&#x2F;edam&#x2F;applecare...</a><p>Notice the breadcrumbs that you could use to conveniently use as favorite inboxes. Those are gone now, which means that you <i>have</i> to keep the left sidebar always exposed (thus taking up significantly more horizontal space). This was what I think is <i>really</i> good design, thoughtful and non-intrusive.<p>Not everyone is working on large screens. Adding a ton of padding to all UI elements doesn’t improve usability in the slightest, regardless of what you might say.')
