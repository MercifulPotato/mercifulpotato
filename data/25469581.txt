If you&#x27;re not seeking&#x2F;expecting rapid growth, isn&#x27;t it just a &quot;small business&quot;.  There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that, not everything has to be a &quot;startup&quot;.<p>(Wiktionary tells me &quot;A new company or organization or business venture designed for rapid growth&quot;, but Merriam-Webster Collegiate 11th ed tells me &quot;a fledgling business enterprise&quot;.  Of course, the Merriam-Webster only recognizes &quot;start-up&quot; not &quot;startup&quot;, so how much could they know?)')
