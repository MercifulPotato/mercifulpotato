But due to lost knowledge for example in communicantions theory say like broadband&#x2F;wideband spectrum singnal broadcasting and general optimization with bounded linear optimization.  Can know enough about say, reversible computing and many paradoxes for example about lost knowledge about codecs and such, still don&#x27;t let the &quot;decades of experience&quot; exchange .    Remember, according in modern understand of a general physical flip-flops synthetic clocks in &quot;more special&quot; general relativity and we can infuse modern ways of collaboration to reduce regularity, we can get better at sensing same patterns in cognitive processes to change the clock rate of terms of service over with power saving mega-log discrete hz. If anyone wants to collobrate further let me know at sashmit@gmail.com. We likely have some shared understanding, but not completely, but have some &quot;free&quot; knowledge about y-combinatoric that can excite digital logarithms but still have to not error-code all singularities away. I can understand it clearly because of the &quot;ancient wisdom&quot; of the polymorphic dual gods of say dharma (allow everything) or the transjuctions of the buddha (allow 1 thing). Most of whatever paradox can be solved via l-r modules to be placed to be postmarked for the future, but to allow that I just will meditate and focus on my own well being. :)')
