A payment provider I worked with didn&#x27;t have a proper way of &quot;storing&quot; cards. But you could create a subscription and bill it whenever you wanted. We didn&#x27;t want to risk that the subscription stopped working, so we hard coded the subscription to be valid until 9999-12-32 (why not?). This worked fine in the sandbox, but when it was pushed out to production, it didn&#x27;t work at all, because here in Europe, with the SCA that is enforced by the banks, they refused to create subscriptions that exceeded an unknown amount of time.')
