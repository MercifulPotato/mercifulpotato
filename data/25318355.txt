Item(by='pmoriarty', descendants=None, kids=[25319519], score=None, time=1607202367, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25318115, text='<i>&quot;If Sartre can&#x27;t get it right, can a random newcomer understand it the way Heidegger intended?&quot;</i><p>They&#x27;re not going to understand Hegel either, and probably not Kant, or a bunch of other philosophers on that list.<p>But Heidegger and Nietzsche were undeniably hugely influential on philosophy, so they belong on that list as much or more than many of the other people listed, who were of minor significance, at best.<p>Ecce Homo was written shortly before Nietzsche went insane, with chapter titles like &quot;Why I am So Wise&quot;, &quot;Why I am So Clever&quot;, and &quot;Why I Write Such Excellent Books&quot;.  I wouldn&#x27;t take what he wrote there at face value.. and much of what he writes in other places should be taken with a grain of salt also, as he often wrote with tongue firmly in cheek, and it&#x27;s often difficult to nail down exactly what Nietzsche thought or intended.<p>This is one of the reasons he&#x27;s been so influential on modern Continental philosophy, some of which took on wholeheartedly his spirit of play and irony, which most of philosophy before Nietzsche was missing.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that Nietzsche can&#x27;t be serious.. much of his work is serious, but it&#x27;s written in an aphoristic rather than a systematic way, which makes understanding what he&#x27;s saying a lot more difficult than, say, many Analytic thinkers, who prize being clear and straightforward.<p>So, yeah, Nietzsche&#x27;s not great for beginners either, and he&#x27;s famous for being misinterpreted anyway, even by professional philosophers.  But he&#x27;s still highly significant, and for my money far more profound than all the Analytics put together.')
