That post was funny.<p>If you haven&#x27;t heard the song, he describes the way they used to do math as follows:<p>Consider the following subtraction problem, which I will put up here: 342 minus 173. Now, remember how we used to do that:<p><i>Three from two is nine, carry the one, and if you&#x27;re under 35 or went to a private school, you say seven from three is six, but if you&#x27;re over 35 and went to a public school, you say eight from four is six ...and carry the one, so we have 169.</i>')
