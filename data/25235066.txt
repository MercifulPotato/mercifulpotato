People like to assume that a simple math equation tells the whole story, while ignoring the fact that bikers do more than just exist as rigid attachments to a bike that travels in straight lines.<p>I can do the math, but I can also swap wheels in a matter of minutes and feel the very obvious difference.<p>I&#x27;m talking about 29&quot; mountain bike wheels, where the mass and moment of inertia is significantly more than what you see on 26&quot; road bikes. It&#x27;s palpable.<p>Maneuvering the bike in the air is another place where the mass difference is noticeable. Dropping 500g doesn&#x27;t sound like much when you think about holding 500g in your hand, but it&#x27;s a different story when that mass is on the ends of a 48&quot; long wheelbase and you&#x27;re trying to maneuver it in the 0.5s that you&#x27;re in the air.<p>If you&#x27;re just riding something like your tri bike in a straight line down a smooth asphalt road at a constant velocity then it obviously doesn&#x27;t matter, though.')
