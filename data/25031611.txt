It&#x27;s an alpha exercise and you feel amazing doing it. But the only physical reward you get from deadlifting is the ability to deadlift more and alongside it have a severely higher risk of injury.<p>If you want a correlation between sitting at a desk and building strength to offset that, look at squats in all it&#x27;s forms, and hamstring and quad dominant exercises. Your lower body is in much more trouble than your lower back from sitting at a computer.<p>Hipflexer stretches with resistance bands will also do you wonders.<p>Trust me folks. Doing deadlifts because you see the gym-bros on youtube doing them is a big mistake. Take a book out of Eddie Hall&#x27;s playbook who says the exact same thing... And he&#x27;s literally the strongest man in the world.')
