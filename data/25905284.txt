What&#x27;s not so obvious is how to generate a model that can manage the &quot;usual problems&quot; (unclear road signs, debris on road, pedestrians&#x2F;cyclists, harm minimization in accidents) without &quot;freaking out&quot; (phantom braking).<p>For example if the car in front did not even slow down while going through some obstacle (the proverbial plastic bag), then it&#x27;s very likely that we don&#x27;t have to either. But if something looks like a drunk guy trying to cross the highway, then it&#x27;s caution time.<p>That said, without the actual data&#x2F;studies&#x2F;access on what Tesla does and how, it&#x27;s hard to say how good they are at this. (Sure, in theory everything needed to drive a car well can be inferred from regular human vision visuals. But that means their model has to be able to do counterfactual reasoning - I see this thing as a wall, but other cars go through it, so it&#x27;s not a wall, so maybe it&#x27;s a marking. Otherwise it&#x27;ll very hard to just figure out things frame-by-frame and simply by raw object detection.)')
