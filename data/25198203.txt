I&#x27;ve not used either in a while and when I did there was a long separation between using one then the other so it&#x27;s a bit lost to memory (same for Vim).<p>Despite my earlier criticism of ED, I&#x27;ve always liked CP&#x2F;M&#x27;s command line structure and switch parameters. For example, here&#x27;s one I think I remember: PIP B:=A: [V O] (I hope that&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s been a long time.)<p>I wonder if that elogence is Kildall&#x27;s work, as I&#x27;ve never been sure whether GK just took the PDP&#x2F;DEC command stuff verbatim or whether he altered some items.')
