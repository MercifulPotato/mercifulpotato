I imagine that used Tesla battery packs may be used for this purpose pretty frequently. Unfortunately while this activity provides a great value for the players involved, the batteries are often passed off as new high-discharge cells to consumers who use them for vaporizers or flashlights. Using old spent cells for both of these use cases can be dangerous, but it&#x27;s particularly worrying in vaporizers because the battery may fail catastrophically inches from the consumer&#x27;s face.')
