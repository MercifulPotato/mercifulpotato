I didn&#x27;t say GraphQL lost the feature, I said it lost the advantage.<p>I see also the paper says, in bold, &quot;it is unfair to attribute the gains observed with GraphQL only to the IDE&quot;, but elsewhere they trumpet the ability of the IDE to interpret and enforce the schema as significant. And again, we can accept that the feature is <i>useful</i> without conceding that GraphQL has the <i>advantage</i>. We could just as well have an IDE that understands OpenAPI specs an accomplish the same thing.')
