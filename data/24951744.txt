And this is absolutely great until you need to interface with meatbags, ie local time. It&#x27;s not just display of time either: think about anything Cron does in localtime, eg backups or open building door locks, or send an ACH payment file; then ponder all the corner cases of DST switches. Eg do you do something twice, or never? What if you reboot somewhere in the DST switch period? etc. All these shenanigans are dictated by the TZDB.<p>Oh, and UTC also contains leap seconds.')
