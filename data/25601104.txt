Azure) predominantly deploy to Linux VMs, whose trend will continue to dominate.<p>You can view the supported Linux distributions on their installation page which includes Linux binaries  for x64, Arm32 + Arm64 including package managers for its supported Linux distributions (Alpine,CentOS,Debian,Fedora,openSUSE,RHEL,SLES,Ubuntu) [1]. As well as maintaining multiple Docker configurations for popular Distros [2].<p>With Linux now being a supported platform means if you have run into an issue you can report it where their full-time resources will resolve it. The old days of using .NET to push Windows is gone, the future is the cloud and Azure doesn&#x27;t care if you run Linux or Windows VMs, it&#x27;s all the same to them, they&#x27;re still collecting rent for usage of their servers by the hour.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dotnet.microsoft.com&#x2F;download&#x2F;dotnet&#x2F;5.0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dotnet.microsoft.com&#x2F;download&#x2F;dotnet&#x2F;5.0</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hub.docker.com&#x2F;_&#x2F;microsoft-dotnet-aspnet" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hub.docker.com&#x2F;_&#x2F;microsoft-dotnet-aspnet</a>')
