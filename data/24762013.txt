Item(by='longerthoughts', descendants=None, kids=[24762151], score=None, time=1602560169, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24761723, text='&gt; I posit that nobody in any of these orgs deeply cares about music.<p>I know people who work for “these orgs” and most (albeit not all) deeply care about music. Some were previously full-time musicians. Many make music as a passion&#x2F;hobby but never pursued it professionally. Some are ashamed of or uncertain about the impact they’re having on music and the industry. Some seem to genuinely believe they’re helping push music forward. None of them are perfect stewards for music or the music industry, but none are the cold, greedy caricatures you’re imagining. I can only speak for the people I’ve met and they may not be representative, but the bar you set was “nobody” and it’s just not that simple.')
