At present its a small group of left-leaning corporate executives.<p>At the moment it just seems like people doing their own interpretation of what someone&#x27;s inner motives are, because I really can&#x27;t see a clear cut example of incitement of violence from any of this. This to me is a perfect example of the term &quot;thought police&quot; - we are guessing what your thinking.<p>E.g. Steve Bannon putting &quot;heads on pikes&quot; is clearly a common figure of speech and simply an emotive expression of anger. I&#x27;m sure you can find many politicians expressing similar things...&quot;let&#x27;s punch nazis&quot; etc. Sounds like it can&#x27;t cause harm...but what if you are called a Nazi and you are not? Every single atrocity in history comes from a group of people being portrayed as something they are not and then dehumanized because of it.<p>&quot;Trump supporters&quot; are incredibly dehumanized at present. They are nazis, racists, etc. It&#x27;s okay to mistreat them because they are really bad people.<p>70mm people voted for Trump, and would probably disagree with the interpretations of the free speech violations. Do we actually believe a democratic process would result in a decision to permanently censor? No way.<p>All you have to do is imagine the reverse situation by swapping the two sides and imagining how you would feel.<p>Would you ever be okay having your speech taken away from you from a side that you disagree with? You might say &quot;but I would never incite hatred&quot;, but what if they say you do?')
