It&#x27;s undecidable to have a general compression algorithm, but people compress data (e.g. their core values) to their theoretical limits all the time.<p>If there&#x27;s a landmark theorem that states &quot;all mathematics greater than or equal to number theory is uncomputable, &quot; and mathematicians make a living computing these systems, then I must conclude either a) mathematics is a Sokal affair on a cosmic scale b) something is wrong with the hidden presuppositions behind my theorem.')
