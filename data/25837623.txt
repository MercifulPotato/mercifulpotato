DMCA is super one sided.<p>All you need for DMCA takedown notice is &quot;a good faith belief&quot; that reported content is infringing copyright you own (or is owned by someone you represent).<p>The opposing party has to prove that the claim was knowingly false and malicious for the claimant to be charged with perjury.<p>The opposing party has to prove actual damages in court to get any compensation. You may get legal fees back too (up to the court), but that&#x27;s only likely to happen if it&#x27;s obvious at the first glance that the claim was bogus.<p>This is all you can do to someone filing the notice. Notice doesn&#x27;t even establish a jurisdiction (and cease-and-desist letter does) - so you can&#x27;t counter-sue in your jurisdiction to get declaratory judgment that copyright is invalid.')
