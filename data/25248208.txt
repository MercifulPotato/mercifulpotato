He uses an example of a engineer he knew that in the era of early electronic calculators (still clunky and and slow, but getting faster all the time) honed his slide rule skills to wipe the floor with any desktop calculator operator. But he was spitting into the wind, it was clear calculators were getting faster and there was no more road with slide rules.<p>Ultimately he wasted effort on a legacy technology rather than leveraging what was up and coming.<p>In many ways this mirrored the PC, in its early days, it was slow, dumb and unwieldy, but it was improving at a rate of knots and eventually came to dominate.<p>Both Michael&#x27;s Black Book and Zen of Assembly are on Github and maintained as PDF, Epub and other formats. They aren&#x27;t terribly applicable technologically to computing today but they are very readable and contain a lot of general purpose problem solving and optimisation tips that are as applicable today as they were then.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jagregory&#x2F;abrash-black-book" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jagregory&#x2F;abrash-black-book</a><p>There have been few technical writers emerge that match Michael Abrash and it makes me so happy he&#x27;s still hacking away at interesting problems today. Shame he doesn&#x27;t write as much as he did, but I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s busy trying to usher in the metaverse (snowcrash had a big influence on him)!')
