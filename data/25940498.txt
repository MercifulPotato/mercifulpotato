Never enough to research it tho...<p>What I realize now is that, contrary from what I would assume just looking at butterflies in the field flying around, is that their wings are pretty flexible during flight, and this is used to direct the air flow to produce force in desired direction (upward swing -&gt; force air behind -&gt; move forward; downward swing -&gt; force air below -&gt; lift up).')
