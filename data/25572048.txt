And were they paid fairly?<p>I can understand the situation. The Chinese government is trying to improve the economy in Xinjiang and encouraged companies to setup factories there. Ruled by a communist government, these companies had to comply and provide jobs to those areas, which is far from port and industry, whose workers are less trained and educated. China is hoping that by improving the economy, people can forget about independence maybe?<p>Evil? Kind of. Very practical plan though.<p>Edit:\nDistance from Xinjiang to Shenzhen: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;dir&#x2F;%C3%9Cr%C3%BCmqi,+Xinjiang,+China&#x2F;Shenzhen,+Guangdong+Province,+China&#x2F;@32.8595005,91.8301004,5z&#x2F;data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x3806008cfd7b4dab:0xaa5952ebac7a708a!2m2!1d87.616848!2d43.825592!1m5!1m1!1s0x3403f408d0e15291:0xfdee550db79280c9!2m2!1d114.057865!2d22.543096!3e4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;dir&#x2F;%C3%9Cr%C3%BCmqi,+Xinjiang,+...</a><p>4k+ kms, 6+hr flight<p>One of the reason south China is more developed to northern China is that the south has most factories, it is close to port.')
