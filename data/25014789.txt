Instead of having a &quot;smart&quot; GraphQL client I let users write their Queries&#x2F;Mutations&#x2F;Subscriptions in GraphiQL. I&#x27;ll then take the operations and generate a fully typesafe &quot;dumb&quot; client which has no clue about GraphQL at all. The Operation gets persisted as an RPC which the dumb client can then call. Feels like GraphQL, behaves like GraphQL but is very lightweight, performant and secure at the same time. All it takes is one code generation step but I think that&#x27;s acceptable. GRPC does it the same way.')
