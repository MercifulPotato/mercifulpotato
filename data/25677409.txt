About 3 hours of that is meetings, and the rest is straight up coding. I don&#x27;t make a lot of money, but I&#x27;ve never been happier with a job. I honestly don&#x27;t feel less productive than when I worked full time. I spend the rest of my energy working on a project I intend to turn into a saas business.<p>I think this kind of thing, where your job doesn&#x27;t dominate your life should be the future. It&#x27;s just so much more humane.')
