I try to use it for any server project, and ran it as a desktop for a little bit.<p>That being said, the reason I don&#x27;t go 100% all in on it and use Ubuntu is the upgrade process.  The article says they were successful upgrading minor versions, but major version upgrades are a real pain.  Last time I did it it was showing me diffs of system scripts and asking me to make calls on what changes to accept; I chose &quot;use latest&quot; for everything, and ended up breaking &quot;sudo&quot; and effectively lost control of my cloud instance.<p>If there&#x27;s a better way to perform system upgrades, I&#x27;d love to hear it, because I think the OS is beautifully minimalistic and closer to Unix philosophy than Ubuntu&#x2F;OSX.')
