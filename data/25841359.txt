Most countries are looking to move away from Australia, but the absence of a countervailing power is what&#x27;s stopping them.<p>Alternatively, the CCP got more aggressive with their suppressive tactics because of the US&#x27;s diplomatic retreat, but I dont think this is the case. I think the CCP&#x27;s behavior is a natural consequence of Xi Jinping basically giving himself a life term. With no opportunity to ever lead the party through a peaceful transfer of power, all the leadership hopefuls will probably be looking for alternative solutions. And even if they aren&#x27;t, Xi is almost certainly gonna be paranoid that they are, and that would mean increasingly severe crackdowns on the people of the country.')
