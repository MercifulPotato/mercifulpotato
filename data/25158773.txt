The reason it _isnt_ hard to push your trunk lid down is because gravity is helping you do so. If you take that gas spring off the trunk, suddenly you need a lot more force to compress it.<p>I don’t understand your explanation: you can’t load a spring without energy, gravity + mass loads a spring, but gravity + mass isn’t energy. It is literally potential energy isn’t it?')
