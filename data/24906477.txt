ATI kept them afloat through a CPU performance drought, and divesting globalfoundries secured necessary liquidity. These two alone essentially saved AMD, so I&#x27;ve got faith in leadership being able to make the appropriate strategic maneuvers.<p>But maybe I&#x27;m being overly optimistic. (Probably because—disclosure—I&#x27;m long AMD. Been long for years.)')
