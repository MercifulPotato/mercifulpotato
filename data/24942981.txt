Windows had just released Windows 8 and was introducing the Windows Store and the idea of having &#x27;apps&#x27; on a desktop PC. Neither of these took off, probably for other reasons than Valve decrying them, but if they had then we&#x27;d be in the same situation with PC that Epic vs {Apple, Google} are in now.<p>Steam machines didn&#x27;t take off because there were no games for it [1], the price point for the pre-builds was too high [2], nobody wanted to buy another (inferior) PC just for gaming [3] and the Steam Controller that was billed as part of the package was an experimental concept rather than being something people could pick up and play [4].<p>All of these kind of made sense at the time, but kind of felt like they had the signature Valve over-engineering. They have learned from this and have done the following:<p>For [1]: Proton<p>In 2018 in on fell swoop, Valve brought thousands of Windows games to Linux. Basically everything other than Multiplayer games with EAC or Battleeye work now (and EAC has a Linux version for native games).<p>From this point on I&#x27;d say that even though Linux still isn&#x27;t &#x27;the future of gaming&#x27;, it&#x27;s definitely a contemporary option. There are limitations, but it&#x27;s viable.<p>For [2]: Scrap steam machines<p>It was a good effort, but I don&#x27;t think Steam Machines will happen unless they can go toe to toe with the consoles. They don&#x27;t need to, though, because people who want to run Linux are happy installing it on kit they already have.<p>For [3]: Steam Link<p>They released Steam link at the time, but now there isn&#x27;t the competition of Steam Machine vs. Steam link - you can just run your Linux desktop and stream to your TV or to a raspberry pi.<p>For 4: Controller support with Steam Play<p>Steam play now has exceptional APIs which make it easy to play with any controller. I do think they need to release a Steam branded &#x27;boring&#x27; xbox style controller, but I think they&#x27;d wait until another Steam OS version before then.<p>They&#x27;ve also invested massively in surrounding tech such as KWin, DXVK and a bunch of others. Linux may not be the &#x27;future&#x27; of gaming, but it&#x27;s definitely going to be a valuable safety net if Windows or the Consoles go rogue.')
