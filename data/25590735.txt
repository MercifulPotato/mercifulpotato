Is it perhaps that by creating a minimum wage law, there are fewer jobs available? Or maybe they just like the convenience of working for Uber, even if they aren&#x27;t guaranteed to make minimum wage after expenses. Or would you go so far as to suggest that these people are too stupid to know they are being voluntarily oppressed, but because you know what&#x27;s best for them, you would help legislate them out of a job? (Make no mistake: higher prices will result in fewer Uber rides.)<p>The real minimum wage is zero. Just add a UBI and get rid of all the other market distorting AOC-economics. The resounding success of the gig-economy (in terms of labor supply specifically) is a side effect of a minimum wage that is too high, crowding people out of full time jobs. In the meantime, adding these minimum wage laws to Uber will just result in more people making nothing and fewer people having convenient transport.')
