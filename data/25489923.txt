Sorry Iâ€™m a relative GPU noob, but I find it fascinating to observe some higher level interactions with eg pytorch; it seems like the GPU is a very leaky distraction, and you quickly find yourself battling GPU memory management, truncating input sizes and whatnot in order to deal with the insane memory requirements.')
