If you factor in gunicorn process count, the wins are even higher because if you had 4 gunicorn processes each using 230mb but now they use 55mb, you&#x27;re really going from 920mb down to 220mb of RAM.<p>Edit: This isn&#x27;t true in the end, a brain malfunction mis-read the table thinking PyPy was actually the regular Python interpreter. It would be interesting to see how it compares to the default Python implementation for memory usage tho.')
