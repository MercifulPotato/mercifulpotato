And unless you can convince almost all of them to do it at about the same time, the old will necessarily linger (see also the compatible&#x2F;incompatible problem I mentioned) and provide further disincentive. And then there are regulations that make any changes like this take an absolute minimum of five or ten years, because of multiple iterations of required regulation changes and certifications (e.g. the regulator must be convinced to allow thing Q, then manufacturer A must make and get certified product X, then manufacturer B that builds on that can make and get certified product Y, then C for Z, and finally the product you need is on the market and now you have to convince your boss you actually need to buy it).<p>You <i>must</i> have a strong lever if you wish to effect meaningful change. HTTPS adoption is a good example: browsers were in a position to honestly bully people into preferring it; and even then, it has been taking quite some years to get any substantial majority. I see no possible route whereby HTTP&#x2F;3 could have succeed had QUIC been built upon IP rather than UDP.<p>Progress fails to happen due to inertia <i>all the time</i>. This is not something specific to software or hardware. The first example that springs to mind is climate change mitigation. Simply as a general observation about life, most people don&#x27;t want to change what they&#x27;re doing.')
