They both have to do with allowing the compiler to optimize around assuming that writes to one pointer won&#x27;t be visible while reading from another. As a concrete example, can the following branches be merged?<p><pre><code>  void foo(&#x2F;*restrict*&#x2F; bool* x, int* y) {\n    if (*x) {\n      printf(&quot;foo\\n&quot;);\n      *y = 0;\n    }\n    if (*x) {\n      printf(&quot;bar\\n&quot;);\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nEnabling strict aliasing is effectively an assertion that pointers of incompatible types will never point to the same data, so a write to y will never touch *x. restrict is an assertion to the compiler on that specific pointer that no other pointer aliases to it.')
