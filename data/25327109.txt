As the explanation of the second method suggests, a List is the same thing as a pointer to its first element, so why not do this?:<p>typedef struct IntListItem* IntList;<p>Also, could it be that both methods fail terribly (infinite loops?) when they are given wrong input such as elements not in the list at all?')
