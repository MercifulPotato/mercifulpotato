We are so much at the mercy of the outside world. Maybe the neighbors AC sucks &amp; reverbs something wicked. How would a winter home buyer find that out? Or maybe it&#x27;s the heater that&#x27;s a problem.<p>And it just doesn&#x27;t feel like we&#x27;re in a world where people tend to be open to working together to improve things.')
