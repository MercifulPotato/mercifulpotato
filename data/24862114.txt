Google is a damn good search engine ... ” ... I agree:<p>Well, I disagree.<p>1. It is quite difficult to determine whether a search engine is good or not - without massive resources for surveying. Also, remember that even if one likes the results - they typically don&#x27;t know which potential results they are _not_ seeing, to compare against.<p>2. Google is known to suppress search results on political grounds. Specifically, Socialist and anti-Imperialist news and commentary is partially suppressed. This was covered here on HN a few times already, e.g.: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14975338" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14975338</a> ; Google officials mostly keep quiet about this of course, so the breadth and scope are not entirely clear.  There&#x27;s also an NYT story about this and other issues, but it&#x27;s paywalled: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;09&#x2F;26&#x2F;technology&#x2F;google-search-bias-claims.html?_r=0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;09&#x2F;26&#x2F;technology&#x2F;google-search-...</a> . I would not at all be surprised if other non-mainstream political views are being suppressed as well.<p>3. Inherent, over-arcing Biases in Google&#x27;s ranking: This is a different issue than direct suppression or blocking. Here&#x27;s I myself am being very anecdotal and speculative, but I have the distinct sense that larger websites get ranked higher by Google, so that for most of a typical person&#x27;s searches they are likely to stay within a the sphere of, oh, I don&#x27;t know, a few thousands or tens of thousands of larger sites. Again, anecdotally, when I search duckduckgo I seem to get into the &quot;tail&quot; in terms of site size faster. I may be totally wrong about this but as I said in (1.) we can&#x27;t really know.')
