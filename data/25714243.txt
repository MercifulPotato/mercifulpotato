I&#x27;m an Indian student. All exams have different rules. They sometimes ask you to keep phones outside, sometimes near the invigilator, and maybe even in your pockets. Some also refuse to let you use the bathroom throughout the exam (usually 3 hours)<p>But students always find a way to cheat. Nothing will stop cheating.')
