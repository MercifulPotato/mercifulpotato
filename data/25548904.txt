What went wrong here is what is called “validation” and is a big part of pharmaceutical analytical analysis.<p>You not only describe how you measured your drug concentration, but you also test the limits.  And those limits should go beyond anything you might encounter in actual manufacturing.<p>If your aim is to confirm a concentration of 5mg&#x2F;mL, then you test all the way down to 0mg&#x2F;mL and then 50mg and 500mg&#x2F;mL.  Then if you have a saline mixture, you test different concentrations of NaCl.<p>You’re basically trying to break the analysis to show where it doesn’t work.<p>The fact they did a UV vis and didn’t account for a different emulsifier is a big miss.')
