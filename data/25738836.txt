Look at the last 4 years, glaring issue after issue that has been roundly ignored, gaslighted and no compromise has been reached. Election security, Russia, China, any kind of foreign policy decision, any kind of domestic issue. Ideas that should be fundamentals of democracy are being attacked.<p>These are the discussions that make sense. From there it easily devolves into Soros conspiracies, Pizzagate and 5G brainwashing myths. The QAnon insanity is just the latest of a long line of completely disconnected thinking.<p>The consequence of not pushing back has done irreparable harm to this country and part of the reason we&#x27;re in this situation in the first place. Trying to be soft on this insanity is why people are now dead.<p>Will they be radicalized? Possibly. Will they be thrown in jail if they act out or start a low boil insurgency? Absolutely.<p>But if they&#x27;re so far gone that they believe that storming government buildings is &quot;taking back their country&quot; then they need a hard reality check.<p>edit: I mean look at this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;yashar&#x2F;status&#x2F;1348745936499982339" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;yashar&#x2F;status&#x2F;1348745936499982339</a><p>We&#x27;re so far gone from acceptable societal behavior at this point.')
