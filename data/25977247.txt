If they are non-competitive, they are out.<p>They would be non-competitive <i>because</i> of the no taxation clause that the bill has -- allowing big corp to undercut the mandis. Not to mention that corps are known to take losses just to establish market monopoly (see Jio).<p>&gt; But in Punjab where they are there, no one is allowed.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why you cite the mandi as a monopoly, when <i>in the existing system</i> a farmer can choose to sell anywhere they want?<p>Let the big corps procure from the farmers, at a &quot;competitive price&quot; as you say. Why should they deserve tax breaks?<p>The fact of the matter is that the mandi <i>is</i> desirable and has contributed to the material success of Punjab&#x27;s farmers. There is no doubt that there are inefficiencies and leakages, but to do away with them in deference to the gods of the &quot;free market&quot; is a bit questionable.
