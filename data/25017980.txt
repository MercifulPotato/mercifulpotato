That alone wins it.  It seems there would have needed to be 200k fraudulent votes for this election to have been changed.  How is that not &quot;widespread&quot;?<p>Also it isn&#x27;t just the media that investigates voter fraud.  Academics and political institutions have looked into it also and not found a problem.  Trump&#x27;s Administration even looked into it and couldn&#x27;t find any significant problem.  Is there anyone who you would trust that could certify this isn&#x27;t a problem?')
