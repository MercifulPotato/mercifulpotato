Item(by='usr1106', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604737312, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25012856, text='Youtube does not protect the rights of video. The video might well be an upload that was copyrighted in the first place.<p>Youtube wants to make it difficult to watch the video without seeing ads. So you could say the downloader steals from Google by using their resources without contributing to their business model. I don&#x27;t see how DMCA would be applicable there. Youtube has no copyright on illegally uploaded material.')
