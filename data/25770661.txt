This essentially is the same as my take. This is the inevitable result of pushing your brand as &quot;no content moderation&quot; but not actually having any skills or plans on what to do when it eventually caught up with them.<p>Anyone familiar with 4chan knows that some of the earliest content that was banned on the platform include childporn and organizing raids&#x2F;doxxing.
