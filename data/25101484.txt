Item(by='yladiz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605450891, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25100230, text='The paper is available on Sci-hub, but the paper itself is pretty light, referring primarily to the supplemental material[1] for details about the tests. I can&#x27;t judge about the tests, but their control was &quot;Negative human serum(IgA&#x2F;IgM&#x2F;IgG)&quot; according to the supplemental materials, and if I understand correctly this is simply a basic serum that would always test negative and so I think this adds some credence to the idea that it might not be specific enough. Maybe it wasn&#x27;t possible to get a control with an older coronavirus?<p>In any case, I agree that it&#x27;s surprising, because knowing what we do about the virus now, if it was in the population back in September and assuming that the numbers in the general population were a lot higher than 23 in September, I think something would have been noticed earlier, although I guess it&#x27;s somewhat plausible that it could have been masked by the normal autumn&#x2F;winter flu hospitalizations. I also think it would have been caught in the research that the Italian NIH did earlier this year when they looked at wastewater[2] and found that it was there in mid-December 2019 but tested from October. Given these, plus this paper being both light on details and being published in what I can tell as a small journal makes me skeptical.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.sagepub.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;suppl&#x2F;10.1177&#x2F;0300891620974755" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.sagepub.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;suppl&#x2F;10.1177&#x2F;0300891620974...</a>\n2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-health-coronavirus-italy-sewage&#x2F;italy-sewage-study-suggests-covid-19-was-there-in-december-2019-idUSKBN23Q1J9" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-health-coronavirus-italy-...</a>')
