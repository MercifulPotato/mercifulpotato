Each one takes up a big chunk of RAM, and either a few or a lot of CPU cycles, depending on your browser and what’s running on the page. Each one takes up some screen real estate and makes it harder to navigate among the tabs that you’re actively using. If your browser crashes you may lose some tabs and the information that they represent. You can’t use this information easily if you switch to another browser.<p>If, however, you turn these tabs into notes on your file system, all these issues disappear. Plus, you can use any software, or write your own, to manage this information. But how do you turn these tabs, conveniently, into notes? Well, just check HN now and then. Every few days there is a new front page story about another system to do just that. I wrote my own, and so have many people, because this is the kind of thing that one wants to work exactly a certain way.')
