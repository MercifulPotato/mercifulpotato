We use both and my subjective sense is that it isn&#x27;t, but I regularly visit just a couple of specific sections in the AWS console whereas we use the Google console for a lot of things daily. I&#x27;m sure front end engineers could find a lot to complain about in the GCP console&#x27;s design and implementation, but the tl;dr for me is that it works and it&#x27;s fast enough for the things I need to do. In areas where the console is limiting I am probably working off the CLI anyway (daily operations within our k8s clusters for example).<p>Probably worth noting as well that for both consoles the underlying APIs are broad, complex, and evolving at a dizzying pace. I can only imagine the technical and organizational challenges around keeping these consoles up to date and improving them where possible.')
