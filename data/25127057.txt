These laptops aren’t quite as slick as the MBP but weigh in at 1.5kg, have huge 91Wh batteries…</i><p>1. You&#x27;re not going to get 20 hours of battery life.<p>2. Don&#x27;t forget it&#x27;s not just the M1—it&#x27;s the unified memory, the 8 GPU cores and the 16-core Neural Engine. Most CPU and GPU-intensive apps are going to run faster on the M1 than on your machine. Even x86-64 apps using Rosetta 2 on an M1 Mac may run faster, since those apps are translated to native code on the M1.<p>3. Mac&#x27;s SSD is probably faster; it&#x27;s essentially a 256GB cache for the processor.<p>4. The Mac can run iOS&#x2F;iPadOS apps too.<p>5. If done right, Linux compiled for the M1 will likely run faster on an M1 Mac than it does on a machine like yours, especially if Apple provides a way to access certain hardware features.<p>We’ll have to see what happens but expect these machines to be pretty popular with users, even those who need to run Linux when that the distros are updated.<p>We shouldn&#x27;t forget that the underpinnings to all of this is Darwin, the BSD-derived Unix layer which is already running natively on M1, including the compiler and the rest of the toolchain.')
