We quantify the out-of-plane movement by collecting the displacement current using a nearby small-area metal electrode and present an Ito-Langevin model for the motion coupled to a circuit containing diodes. Numerical simulations show that the system reaches thermal equilibrium and the average rates of heat and work provided by stochastic thermodynamics tend quickly to zero. However, there is power dissipated by the load resistor, and its time average is exactly equal to the power supplied by the thermal bath. The exact power formula is similar to Nyquist&#x27;s noise power formula, except that the rate of change of diode resistance significantly boosts the output power, and the movement of the graphene shifts the power spectrum to lower frequencies. We have calculated the equilibrium average of the power by asymptotic and numerical methods. Excellent agreement is found between experiment and theory.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.aps.org&#x2F;pre&#x2F;abstract&#x2F;10.1103&#x2F;PhysRevE.102.042101" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.aps.org&#x2F;pre&#x2F;abstract&#x2F;10.1103&#x2F;PhysRevE.102.0...</a>')
