Many model organisms are now opened to transgenesis due to crispr compared to traditional methods. There was a new paper that came out on cas3 recently that showed a cool application in studying minimal genomes (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41592-020-00980-w" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41592-020-00980-w</a>). And there are also potential in non-in-vivo usage of crispr for general sequence manipulation.<p>Just because it might not be immediately useful for one over-hyped application, doesn&#x27;t mean it is dead for all other applications.')
