His point was that on a long enough timeline it would&#x2F;will eventually happen, and with adequate preparation a country could ensure both objective victory and survival for the majority of its populace and civilization.<p>Someone has to think about the unthinkable. Wishing nukes away won&#x27;t make them disappear, and as shown in Daniel Ellsberg&#x27;s the Doomsday Machine, nuclear weapons have been used as weapons of war in U.S. foreign policy for decades as indirect threats and bluffs. They will eventually be used again as explosive ordinance. Civil defense was lambasted and deprioritized in the west because people thought with their hearts instead of their minds with regard to the destructive power of nuclear weapons.<p>Decades of poor science on nuclear winter based off of the terrible TTAPS climate model have engendered the notion that nuclear war is a death sentence to humanity. It&#x27;s not true, academia knows it is not, but nobody will push the subsequent corrective nuclear winter stories because the fear of nuclear winter keeps nuclear hawks at bay in political office. The top answer in this quotation question has a ton of links on this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;Is-the-nuclear-winter-a-hoax" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;Is-the-nuclear-winter-a-hoax</a><p>They are weapons of war. They are effective weapons of war. They will eventually be used as explosive ordinance and not just threats and bluffs. Calling them unthinkable and anyone who plans for survival following their use a horrible person is bad emotional rhetoric. We should have an implementable plan for civil defense like China and Russia do. We should not allow fear to prevent the survival of our way of life.')
