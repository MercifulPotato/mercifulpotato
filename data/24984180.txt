I doubt. Because if there is a majority of people that is homogeneous and shares common history&#x2F;views&#x2F;culture etc, and this group might look inwards, not outwards and respect their own traditions and other things more than those of foreigners, do they have a privilege over me? Of course they do. Is it not fair? It is fair. And im okay with that. Maybe that&#x27;s a privilege of majority?<p>How about Asian privilege? Why so many Asian in STEM in western universities? Is it unfair? I think it is absolutely fair as long as the administration doesn&#x27;t judge them by their skin color or other irrelevant to study qualities.<p>But abstract administration may want to look at the skin and help those who they consider are lower on the victimhood hierarchy, but there are many many problems that arise when an administration starts doing this.')
