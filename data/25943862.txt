Is that what you mean by &quot;damage their political opponents?&quot; Phrases like that make it sound like the &quot;opponents&quot; are some innocent little scared children who did nothing wrong. If demanding that calls to violence are stopped is political for you, then ok, sure.<p>As I&#x27;ve said and will keep saying: those most vocal about protecting the &#x27;freedom&#x27; of domestic terrorists to terrorize are the ones most certain they&#x27;ll never suffer from that terror.')
