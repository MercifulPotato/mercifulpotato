On the other hand, I&#x27;m surprised they didn&#x27;t replace all the electrolytic capacitors in the A&#x2F;V area -- or even the whole unit. If some of those leaked already, IMO, the rest will leak soon too. Seems a bigger risk than a lack of conformal coating. <i>shrug</i><p>Either way, excellent video and very well put together. I love seeing stuff like this.')
