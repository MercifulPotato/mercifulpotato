Or in other words, 100% of services with streaming anime available in my country. To be fair, seasonal anime gets a good coverage with those. Netflix&#x27;s player is pretty good, but the rest vary from meh to awful (I have never successfully changed the timestamp in Funimation&#x27;s player without playback crashing within the next minute).<p>But back catalogues availability is not so good.  Crunchyroll and Netflix have the most popular stuff like Naruto, Code Geass or Evangelion but literally nobody has, say, The Devil is a Part Timer in my country.<p>Movies? The SAO movie got a physical showing in my country, the Made in Abyss movie actually did show up on a pay per view non-region locked streaming service and... that&#x27;s literally it.<p>Soundtracks? It might be on Spotify. This week. But maybe not next week. I&#x27;ve no fucking idea, but the constant appearence and disappearence of soundtrack songs from my playlists has even caused me to stop moving spotify.<p>So for movies and back catalogues, my only &quot;legal&quot; option is to ship DVDs&#x2F;Blurays and a region locked player from the US, or maybe sometimes I can get stuff from the UK in my own region. For soundtracks, even that is not usually an option. Does that legally entitle me to pirate it? No. Do I care? Not really, I feel I&#x27;ve tried my best')
