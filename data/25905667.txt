Could I sit down and write a web-facing server from scratch and have a reasonable expectation of safety? Probably not.\nCan I write a piece of firmware for an embedded device with no internet access and a very limited serial protocol, and have a reasonable expectation of that being &#x27;safe&#x27;? That seems more likely, particularly if I follow good practice and use available analysis tools where possible.<p>I think the biggest problem with these languages is that when something goes wrong (as it so often does), the keys to the kingdom are up for grabs as the whole of everything can suddenly be manipulated, to read out arbitrary memory (e.g. heartbleed)')
