Plus idle time at the caltrain stations waiting for the next leg. Plus walking time.<p>Sometimes you&#x27;re lucky and the bus and train schedules align, but in my experience, the bus schedule will come out, aligning to caltrain, then three weeks later, caltrain adjusts their schedule, and you&#x27;ve got 20 minutes between drop off and pickup again. It&#x27;s better if you get a corporate shuttle to pick you up from caltrain, but still. Also, if you need to stay later than normal, bus and train service drops in frequency a lot, so you might be waiting even longer.<p>I was just avoiding traffic, so I drove to caltrain, which avoided the waiting on one end.')
