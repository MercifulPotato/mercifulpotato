What does this have to do with &#x27;minorities&#x27; (If you are referring to the FDA requirement, it&#x27;s not about public trust so much as literally a medical requirement to include people of different ethnic groups to measure potential differing response, which is normal in such trials)<p>??? And what are you talking about &#x27;rushed&#x27;. I&#x27;m not talking about changing the nature or timeline of the trial. I&#x27;m talking about ramping up production before the vaccine is proven to be safe and working, because the opportunity cost of &#x27;COVID shutdowns&#x27; are 1000x greater than the lost opportunity cost of wasted spending on manufacturing vaccines that work.<p>Again: we should have been mass producing the potential &#x27;good candidate&#x27; vaccines months ago. It doesn&#x27;t matter if some of the failed to pass muster, it would have been well worth any potential wasted money on making vaccines that we can&#x27;t use.')
