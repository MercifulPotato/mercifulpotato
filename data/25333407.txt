There&#x27;s a Twitter thread of a researcher who was accepted into the Azure bounty program, found a lot of important zeroday vulnerabilities, and was paid nothing. In fact he expected to be paid for his findings, and then had trouble with his basic living expenses. Anyone who has worked with bug bounties should know to stay far away from them since you can&#x27;t get assurance you&#x27;ll be paid (and companies are not incentivized to pay security researchers).')
