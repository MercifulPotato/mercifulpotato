Which encourages more isolation instead of collaboration between projects.<p>This is where I would respectfully disagree. As a dev, packaged libraries from the system are often fine â€“ until I hit a snag, and need to work with the devs from another project to work out a fix. With cargo&#x2F;node&#x2F;yarn&#x2F;poetry&#x2F;gopkg&#x2F;... I can send a PR to another project, get that merged, and vendor in the fix while all of that is happening.<p>If I can&#x27;t do that, I&#x27;m left with hacky workarounds, as upstreaming a fix and then waiting up to 12 months (if I&#x27;m on a six-month release tempo OS) for the fix to be available to me is just not practical.<p>Being able to work on a quick turnaround with dependencies to fix stuff is one of the huge wins with modern build tools.')
