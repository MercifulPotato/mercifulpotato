Even if the advice is not strictly correct, it is not wrong.<p>We do this constantly, especially with children. We feed them with not strictly correct information because the alternatives are to not give them any, to give too much or to give information that is not useful.<p>You would not tell your kids their uncle committed suicide by blowing his head off because he was unsatisfied with his miserable life because he made a bunch of lousy choices and because of this aunt left him for a younger guy which caused severe depression. That is way too much information for a child to handle.<p>People who know better will know why the advice is structured this way and will know to ignore it.<p>There is also incentive for producers to give information like that, because it is easier to require you to put your speakers far from any wall than to delve into particulars of your speaker placement. &quot;We guarantee our product offers excellent quality if you put it far from walls, but should you decide to ignore that advice you are on your own&quot;')
