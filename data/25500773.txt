How convenient.<p>The only thing convenient is you not addressing my point :) The government intervention is a desparate attempt at not letting people die of disease and pestilence literally outside a point of care. You&#x27;re asking for a dystopian hellscape. And that&#x27;s what much of the last 300 years <i>was</i> with respect to medical care.<p>&gt; In the 1980s the US did not have a 40 percent socialized system. The fraction of people on medicare was far less. Yet it was not the most expensive system in the world then. The US system is definitely failing, but it isn&#x27;t the 300-year old market system that is causing it.<p>Yes it is.<p>Canada had a similar system until the 1970s, and it was bad. Then it switched over and things got better. America remained on the private system and it just got worse and worse.<p>Venezuela is totally and utterly irrelevant to this conversation. There are so many functioning systems with socialized medicine (all of Europe, especially the Scandinavians, Canada, Taiwan, etc, etc), Venezuela is an outlier and not even worth discussing. It&#x27;s a failed state.<p>Whether you call it coercion or a power differential (you will die, the insurer or provider won&#x27;t) this <i>precludes</i> a voluntary meeting of the minds necessary in a free market. Period.')
