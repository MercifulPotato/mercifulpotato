There is a lot of mafia activity in Grenoble and bars (as well as pizzerias and night clubs...) are notorious for being fronts and for whatever other dodgy activities.<p>I would not be too surprised if the bars in question have links to the criminal world and the police simply used whatever hard evidence of wrongdoing they could find to bring them down or perhaps as a way to gain further access to documents, etc. I&#x27;m pretty sure that a bar owner &quot;<i>unknown to police services</i>&quot; (as they say) would simply receive a warning that logs must be kept, at least at first.')
