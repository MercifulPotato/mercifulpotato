After filing a fraud claim with Chase, she was then informed the charges were genuine, and to contact Apple.</i><p><i>Once she contacted Apple and was talked through a &quot;buried running list of all the charges&quot; and seeing the Sonic icon, she realized it was her son&#x27;s fault...</i><p><i>Apple refused to refund her money, as she didn&#x27;t call within 60 days of the charges, which Johnson said was because Chase told her it was likely to be fraud in the first place. Apple Support was also apparently cold to Johnson admitting she wouldn&#x27;t have been able to make a mortgage payment, telling her &quot;There&#x27;s a setting, you should have known,&quot; the mother claimed.</i><p>From TFA.')
