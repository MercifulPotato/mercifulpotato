A fridge designed for repair might have a thumb-screw panel for access to the logic board with clearly labeled test pads for fuse continuity. This (or other, similar repair-friendly designs) would allow you to more easily determine the value of &quot;x&quot; and more accurately assess whether &quot;x&quot; is small enough to make repair the more viable option.')
