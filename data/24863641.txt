There are plenty of times where I want to use Halide and I want to shoot RAW but I also want to easily share a photo (without going through the laborious processing thing). So I&#x27;m really looking forward to that.<p>I&#x27;m curious in what way you believe your processing pipeline for &quot;getting to jpg&quot; (RAW -&gt; Instant Raw Processing -&gt; JPEG) is superior to Apple&#x27;s (capture -&gt; Apple&#x27;s Processing -&gt; JPEG). Does it just come down to different aesthetic preferences and one-frame-per-image? Or is there something else to it?<p>Also, love the XDR Analysis. So cool.')
