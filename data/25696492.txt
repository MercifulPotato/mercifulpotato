That&#x27;s so silly. If you are the one making an outrageous claim, cite the claims yourself. It&#x27;s like you claiming that the earth is flat and then demanding I read some book to &quot;inform&quot; myself.<p>&gt; Some youngs situationaly fight other youngs but you can&#x27;t establish a ranking of individual in a wild pack.<p>Actually, the fighting is establishing a rank.<p>&gt; That wouldn&#x27;t make much sense.<p>Of course it makes sense. Just because you say it doesn&#x27;t make sense don&#x27;t make it true.<p>&gt; Human families don&#x27;t have hierarchy.<p>Yes we do. Parents at top and then kids ( pretty much by age ). Ever heard of patriarchy&#x2F;matriarchy?<p>&gt; Young children are subordinate to their parents until they come of age<p>Oh so there is a hierarchy?<p>&gt; I am starting to understand your confusion.<p>I don&#x27;t have any confusion. You are confused. You say there is no hierarchy and then use words describing a hierarchy.')
