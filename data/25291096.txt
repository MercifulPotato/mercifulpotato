Google has a problem with activist employees pushing radical political agendas, often in ways explicitly prohibited by company policy -- for example, leaking internal documents to sympathetic press and harassing individuals on public forums like memegen because of their privately held political views.<p>These activists present their activities as &quot;union organizing&quot;,&quot;transparency and ethics&quot;, &quot;whistleblowing, and other sweet-sounding and broadly-liked labels, but in reality, what they&#x27;re doing is not any of these things. What these activists are actually doing is trying to turn the company into a vehicle for advancing their fringe vision for a Utopian society. And if you know your history, you should run away screaming from anyone trying to engineer a Utopia.<p>Neither Google nor any other company should tolerate employees  using the power of the company to advance their personal ideological beliefs. Companies should be mission focused. Coinbase got it right where Google got it wrong, and now Google&#x27;s activist chickens are coming come to roost.')
