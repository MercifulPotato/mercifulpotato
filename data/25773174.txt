There isn’t a clear and present external danger which requires all of us to stick together in unity. Certainly the British aren’t going to return for their former colonial land. This so-called unity is doing us more harm than good.<p>You&#x27;ve been living the good life for so long that you&#x27;re become blind to the bad life (normal life for many others). The Brits won&#x27;t invade you, but every big country will try to bully you, some even openly. Look at what happened to Taiwan, Armenia, Iraq, Lybia, Korea, etc.<p>You won&#x27;t be invaded, just pushed around to the benefit of third parties.')
