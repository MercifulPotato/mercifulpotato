Of course we cannot predict what mutation will happen. Are you trying to say we don&#x27;t know which mutation take off? Even then the issue that we don&#x27;t know what future mutation might take off is a problem.<p>&gt; each seasonal flu vaccine is really a combination of three different strains<p>This year it was 4 different strains.<p>&gt;  it&#x27;s impractical, even dangerous, to give them all of the strains at once<p>I&#x27;ve never heard this before. Can you provide a citation so I can verify it?<p>&gt;The common cold is an even more extreme version of that process<p>There are a lot of different viruses for the common cold.  There have been vaccines for them, but the odds of catching any one strain are so low that a vaccine against one isn&#x27;t really significant.')
