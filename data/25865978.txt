There is only &quot;better and worse at reproducing in a particular environment.&quot;  At the moment, our genes are in an environment where health care is available, so there are genes that are able to reproduce in that environment which might not be so good in a different environment.<p>Also, we are not <i>entirely</i> at odds with our genes.  Obviously the relationship is symbiotic to a large extent, because we can&#x27;t exist without our genes and vice versa.  But our brains can want things that are bad for our genes, and vice versa.')
