This is slightly better than just getting an email. Product Market fit (or even Problem Market fit) is more than someone just imagining their future best self as being interested.<p>True validation has the prospect part with something of value, real value, not just an email.<p>Like, give me $100 and I&#x27;ll tell you how I&#x27;ve boot strapped a company now worth $4MM. Or I&#x27;ll tell you how my previous company took $50k investment and grew to be worth $60MM.<p>Only folks <i>really</i> interested in the problem space would part with something of value today for a solution tomorrow.')
