There is nothing wrong with worshiping science but scientist worship is a part of it. We are all humans with our egos, trouble admitting being wrong, or simply personal gain from acting a certain way. Many of us just go with things to fit in, or have a career or just to make ends meet.<p>Numbers can be fudged. Everyone should have the stance of &quot;show me&quot; before believing. And you can&#x27;t just take what media shows you at the face value. Reenactments, B-roll footage, the whole thing is a lot less &quot;real&quot; than we are lead to believe.<p>It is not a pandemic if you need to be told it is a pandemic.<p>You are losing your rights and freedoms because people are scared.<p>If you were alive during 9&#x2F;11, doesn&#x27;t this feel eerily familiar?<p>Doesn&#x27;t it feel exactly like it feels when the second plane hit on 9&#x2F;11?<p>Scare me and take my rights and freedom.<p>Can&#x27;t you see people have the same emotional reaction when you try to get people to question the official COVID narrative that you see when you try to get them to think outside the official 9&#x2F;11 narrative?<p>We are a lot less free now than we were before 9&#x2F;11. And we are not any safer.<p>The same is about to happen if not happening right now.<p>We are all being played. Open your eyes and question even the sources you trusted for years. Just because your views aligned with a source for years doesn&#x27;t mean they are on your side. They can be fooled too. This isn&#x27;t about intention. We are all human. We are all fallible and this is about to get worse unless we all open our eyes and stop repeating the narrative the media is feeding everyone.')
