My kids day care has a government mandated 8 to 1 ratio.  That teacher doesn&#x27;t get paid 8x the average wage to watch kids.  I don&#x27;t pay $25&#x2F;hr for my 2 kids to be at daycare.<p>A local babysitter can watch more than 1 kid for that $12.75 an hour as well...it&#x27;s not per kid.<p>Nice try.  Also, continued education is a requirement as it should be for such a career, but don&#x27;t forget that her pay will go up as she completes credits (on top of her yearly increase).<p>Just so you know, teachers in my area start at $55K&#x2F;yr right now, not including benefits.')
