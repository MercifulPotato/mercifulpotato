Selectable runtimes make a huge amount of sense for interpreted languages or languages with a runtime. Rust is compiled to a binary. There are libraries that make it easy to set up a Lambda runtime, and guides for deploying that runtime; beyond that, a Lambda runtime is &quot;run this program, leave it running, answer requests&quot;, and I don&#x27;t know how standardized that could easily become with a compiled language that doesn&#x27;t need a runtime or interpreter.')
