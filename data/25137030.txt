So far I&#x27;d say the course (which was free as I won it as a prize in a business plan competition) is directly responsible for at least 50-100.000 â‚¬ of additional revenue that I made in the last years, simply because I negotiated more effectively.<p>I&#x27;d highly recommend honing this skill as it will also help you as an employee, as even small gains in salary can add up to quite a lot of money over the years. For freelancers and entrepreneurs negotiation is also important of course and will greatly help you.')
