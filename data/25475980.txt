The microservices hype train is real, but it&#x27;s far from ubiquitous in real life and the fashion will probably be dead long before Java (I&#x27;m not saying microservices are bad <i>per se</i>, but it&#x27;s way overused, by companies who have zero scalability issues and adds a lot of engineering complexity).<p>Then there&#x27;s cost: deploying 3 times more machines because you use Python on a high traffic service is a good way to give some margin to the cost-killers in the next LBO.')
