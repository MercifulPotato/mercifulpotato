It sounds great in practice, but simple things like showering, defecating and preserving food become very difficult.<p>I have to both agree and disagree. I&#x27;ve been living in my converted bus for about 3.5 years. It&#x27;s harder and more complex than living in a fixed location but it depends a lot on the setup of your vehicle and how you use it.<p>If you have a low end conversion with no shower or toilet it&#x27;s a lot more complex, especially in COVID times with limited access to public facilities.<p>If you have an RV or something like my bus with a full conversion it&#x27;s not bad.
