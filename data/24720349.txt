Every time I move, it&#x27;s different recycling rules to learn. Do we put paper in the blue bin or the green bin? Can we recycle cardboard in this city? What kinds of plastics are OK here and what kind aren&#x27;t? It changes from city to city.<p>At one place I lived, I watched the truck come along and they just dump both bins in the same section of the truck. So you&#x27;ve got me agonizing over which bin to sort things into and then the waste management people just re-combine them. I guess I&#x27;m the sucker here!<p>As usual, the USA&#x27;s un-coordinated &quot;let the states and local governments figure it out&quot; strategy fails again.')
