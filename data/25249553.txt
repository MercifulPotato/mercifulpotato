It allows the placement of links to the stories on those sites. (I use the term &quot;allow&quot; loosely, since in many jurisdictions they do not have the right to restrict in-linking.)<p>The news industry is free to try to prevent in-linking. The technical capability already exists in the form of robots.txt and the referer header. Although I can tell you right now what will happen. People will read less news, and read more of other stuff that is still distributed on Facebook or Google. They won&#x27;t stop using Facebook or Google.<p>Honestly, it would probably be better for the world. People are reading too much news and it is contributing to polarization. Won&#x27;t help the news industry&#x27;s bottom line, though. Won&#x27;t hurt Google or Facebook&#x27;s.')
