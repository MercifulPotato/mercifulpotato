He knew so little about coding he didn&#x27;t even know what tech debt <i>was</i> when I spoke to him, a year in. But he got the v1 to market, which got them investment, and allowed them to hire in experience round him, and start paying off a mountain of tech debt. It was painful, but it worked. And, crucially, they could not have even got started if they&#x27;d not done it that way.')
