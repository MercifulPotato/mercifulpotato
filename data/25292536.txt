Item(by='abeppu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607020123, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25291449, text='&gt; Taking an oral medication + injection every 8 weeks looks a little bit too hard to follow to me for preventing HIV acquisition.<p>In the US, PrEP is normally a daily pill, plus testing (typically an in-office blood draw) for both HIV but also kidney function every 90 days. 8 weeks vs 90 days isn&#x27;t _that_ different, and visiting a health care provider to get an injection vs a blood draw seems quite similar.\nSo in terms of patient experience, this treatment + placebo combination during their trial doesn&#x27;t seem that far off from what a lot of people are already doing. The prospect of moving to _only_ the long-term injection (and perhaps supporting tests done at the same time?) would be appealing for many.')
