The introduction from &quot;open up a terminal, and type these commands in, which does these things&quot; to &quot;now just put those commands in a file called script.sh and type .&#x2F;script.sh, and it will do the thing automatically&quot; was eye-opening, at 22 years old. Looking back, it&#x27;s the exact same problem that resulted in a company I used to work for doing 100s of GB of data processing in Excel, because writing Excel macros was more accessible than writing a bash script to append two .csv files.<p>I mean, Linux specifically isn&#x27;t really necessary for this. Back in the early-mid 00s, OS X got me into terminal usage and &quot;real&quot; programming via its free (as in beer), full-octane bundled dev tools and included Ruby installation.<p>In fact, at the point that I got into these things with OS X, I had already tinkered with a Linux variant (Yellow Dog) and had given up before getting too far because I didn&#x27;t have the knowhow to make the OS as a whole work properly, and worse, the internet resources needed to fill this knowledge gap didn&#x27;t make themselves obvious.')
