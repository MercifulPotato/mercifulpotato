Having one repository of all notes would be really helpful, I think, as long as it was properly indexed. But I agree that there are areas where paper will never be beat.<p>Plus, I&#x27;ve used a wacom tablet and, while I was impressed that they managed to somewhat mimic the feeling of writing with a pen, it isn&#x27;t the feeling of writing with a great pen. And nowhere near the feeling of a nice mechanical pencil. There&#x27;s room for improvement.')
