On the other hand, there are still some lessons to be learned.  To be honest, I&#x27;d rather _never_ have those experiences.  But they do teach me things.<p>There&#x27;s a mind experiment I like to play sometimes (and an interview question I like to ask candidates): What if you never needed to worry about money; your bank account always had what you needed.  What would you do?<p>This question can unfortunately illustrate how your mind is wired&#x2F;trained.  In my case, I devolve into logistics puzzles of how to ensure the right sized private jet is within close reach and able to take me to the travel destination of my current whim.  (And further, how to optimize the resource&#x2F;jet allocation to keep the planes full of friends, family, or other passengers when they are being relocated.)  Point is, I suspect we always like to do some kind of work.  In my case, I like to find solutions which balance concerns and provide situation-optimal results.<p>Ultimately it is likely that individual human life is pointless.  Certainly from a macro time or macro universe perspective it is.  So we gaze at our own navels in our own entertaining ways.')
