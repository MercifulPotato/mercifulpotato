The cells have to be first attacked and infected before the immune reaction can kick in. Even now, it is known that the highest infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 is often before the symptoms are observable, i.e. before the immune reaction starts. That would also explain the existence of asymptotic carriers: their immune system already protects them, but they are still able to infect others.')
