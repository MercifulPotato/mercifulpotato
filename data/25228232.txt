So far the supposed deal prices are higher on many items than they were in the spring at regular price.<p>It seems prices are up 10 to 20 % right across the spectrum of product categories. This seems outside normal inflation.<p>I would like to know if this is just happening in my region(Pacific Northwest) or everywhere.')
