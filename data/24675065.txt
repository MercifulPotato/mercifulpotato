You can just compile any constant as a stand-alone serialized message that you mmap into your code in a safe way. It can’t do complex math and things (at least yet) but you can express lists, dictionaries, and reference other constants, so as a config file replacement I love it. I’ve also found the format to be far more regular and consistent than you get with things like text protobuf (you’re still using the schema language instead of another format)')
