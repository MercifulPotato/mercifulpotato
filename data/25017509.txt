Literally, worthless. Anyone can be nominated by anyone.<p>Yes, the fact that we didn&#x27;t get into any hot war is pretty much the only thing that Trump has going for him, though it was partially due to others backing him off bad ideas.<p>He wanted to remove us from a South Korean defense agreement, which would have been huge for each country&#x27;s economy and defenses.<p>He bombed an Iranian general in Iraq - it was a huge gambit of arguable utility, and the only reason the Iranians didn&#x27;t get more international support for retaliation was because they shot down a civilian airliner on accident.<p>He talked so much crap to NK that there was serious concern of an escalation in fighting.<p>But, yes. We didn&#x27;t have any major foreign-based terror attacks, and we didn&#x27;t get entangled in fighting a new conflict.<p>As far as the peace deals, I think they could be good, but they haven&#x27;t &quot;fixed&quot; anything yet. The Palestinians still have no sovereignty, the Israelis still deny Arabs rights of citizenship, Iran and SA still are at each other&#x27;s throats while Yemen, AFAIK, is still a humanitarian crisis.<p>China is perpetrating a holocaust on ethnic minorities, and Trump congratulated Xi on his success there.<p>The man is no human rights hero.<p>---<p>edit: Not to mention his domestic policy failings, his characterizations as sitting president of all who disagree with him as &quot;enemies&quot;, his rhetoric around protesting, his encouragement toward violent right-wing actors, and his use of the National Guard to clear out a public square to get a picture taken with a holy book he has never read.')
