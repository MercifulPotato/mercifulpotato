After Tada&#x27;s legal victory, the National assembly under pressure from the taxi industry changed the law to essentially kill the &quot;domestic&quot; company -- under the new law, Tada was only allowed to serve tourists and the pick-up&#x27;s and drop-off&#x27;s limited to airports &#x2F; seaports.<p>Sure, Uber was the first to arrive in the SK market and it immediately faced fierce pushback from the taxi union and regulators.  South Korea&#x27;s transport law does not allow private vehicles for commercial purposes, but it makes an exception for &quot;car pool.&quot;  Uber was declared illegal because it used private vehicles for commercial purppose and the company subsequently pulled out in 2015. Kakao launched the following year, but avoided Uber&#x27;s misfortune by using registered taxis only. It appeased the taxi union, but it also meant that the company couldn&#x27;t make any money and it is probably not the best example of the &quot;shared economy&quot; business model promoted by Uber.<p>South Korea&#x27;s &quot;domestic&quot; companies like Tada and Kakao tried to enter carpool business afterward, but, after no fewer than 3 taxi driver suicides in protest, two in horrific self-immolation, and the gov&#x27;t intervention, Tada was forced to close their shop this year; Kaokao&#x27;s capool service is limited to only 4hr&#x2F;day and during rush hours on weekdays. That is not what Uber would have pursued in SK.<p>I don&#x27;t think Uber&#x27;s failure in SK is good evidence to prove your case as many domestic companies, big or small, suffered similar legal troubles and fierce resistance from the taxi industry. I&#x27;d generally agree that SK doesn&#x27;t have the best business climate, but I just don&#x27;t see where it is necessarily hostile to foreign companies,  or where &quot;domestic&quot; companies are favored over foreign competitors; or where all they do is to copy foreign companies similiar to China.')
