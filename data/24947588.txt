And there&#x27;s nothing wrong with either of those sets values, but they&#x27;re not the same!<p>With that lens, I&#x27;d characterize the parent comment as contrasting the PostgreSQL team&#x27;s core value of &quot;robustness&quot; with the Javascript crowd&#x27;s core value of &quot;velocity&quot;.  That&#x27;s a distinction in <i>values</i>, not in <i>technology</i>.')
