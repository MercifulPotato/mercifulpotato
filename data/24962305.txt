Now probably 90% of traffic exists in increasingly siloed walled gardens, which all take measures to ensure their content (and more importantly, <i>you</i>) stay there. (Hell, a good portion of that traffic isn&#x27;t even from some general-purpose browser, it&#x27;s from an app.) And circumventing that is pretty much the letter of the (poorly worded) law when it comes to the DMCA. It&#x27;s not really the people that have changed, it&#x27;s the internet that has.<p>(Sure, many parts of the internet are still open, but youtube isn&#x27;t one of them.)')
