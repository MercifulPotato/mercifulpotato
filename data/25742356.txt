It was also released roughly concurrently with at least one vaccine that was legitimately withdrawn for safety reasons.<p>Compared to, say, the covid-19 vaccines, or the MMR vaccines, I find the public hesitation more understandable. It&#x27;s not like a disease with an especially high mortality rate or one that&#x27;s spread person to person.<p>Not saying the push to shame it out of existence was right, since it sounds like the benefits outweighed the risks at least for some people, but there&#x27;s a lot to unpack. Definitely worth a read.')
