For all intents and purposes I want the nodes to route traffic through a VPS in some other DC (in this case bridged via wireguard). Incoming&#x27;s easy enough with reverse proxies&#x2F;load balancers, but with all the UDP traffic on random ports, outgoing TCP connections, etc, I haven&#x27;t figured out a way to make it not leak my IP in some way.<p>Feels this should be dead easy but I&#x27;m stumped. Oh, and assume no support of SOCKS proxies in the software itself.<p>I&#x27;m aware of hidden onion services but talking clearnet here.')
