Assuming optimistic 50% LED efficiency and 90% algae efficiency², you would need at least about 90W&#x2F;50W &#x2F; 0.5 &#x2F; 0.9 = 4x as much production. So your setup could not scrub a typical person&#x27;s CO₂.<p>Nevertheless, fully optimized 17l of algae do seem believable, if well cared for.<p>¹ ignoring diet levels and differing CO₂ &#x2F; H₂O ratio for fat vs. carbs etc.<p>² no idea how efficient algae are, but wikipedia says they are very efficient')
