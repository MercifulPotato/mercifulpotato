Item(by='thisiszilff', descendants=None, kids=[25462882], score=None, time=1608251710, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25460087, text='From what I&#x27;ve gathered the contents of the email were largely like &quot;Either we do XYZ or we can work towards setting a date where I leave the company.&quot; So it is open to interpretation and vague enough that both sides can get their interpretation in. The way I phrase it to myself is that she was fired for threatening to resign. IE, that relationship wasn&#x27;t good to begin with and this was just the last straw that pushed them to severing it. I suspect that people who try to claim she was fired&#x2F;that she resigned don&#x27;t focus enough on the broader context where that relationship was bad in the first place. This doesn&#x27;t seem like it was something out of the blue, this has definitely been going on for a bit, so given that, which party took it over the line to breaking up their employment relationship seems like a detail rather than an important fact.')
