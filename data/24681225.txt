And have them hard-wired to a fairly high-end receiver.  The sound quality is so much better.  I listen to a lot of vinyl, so that makes it an easier choice too.   We use the smaller WonderBoom speaker when we do need it for the beach or something, but when at home, I will always chose to get the hard-wired path.  Regardless how quickly the Sonos speakers connect to your source, hard-wired is better quality and is always connected.')
