An <i>inferred</i> return is a separate feature where the return type is known by the compiler, but not stated explicitly by the programmer. (Note that the code in question uses both.)<p>Ruby, of course, technically has both as well. However, inferring a return type in a dynamically-typed language is probably less noteworthy ;)')
