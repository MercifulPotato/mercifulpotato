Maker days are supposed to be no meetings unless it&#x27;s an emergency, while meeting days are just normal work days.<p>Personally, I&#x27;ve found meeting days to be pretty much unbearable for working from home, while I love my maker days from home. Anything that requires collaboration of more than 2 or 3 people just sucks to do over Zoom, IMO, but being able to lock myself in a quiet room and turn off notifications is a godsend for writing code.<p>In my experience, I&#x27;ve found that this seems to match up with the opinions of the people I know. The people who work in jobs that require a lot of meetings are completely burned out on WFH, while the people I know who are mainly individual contributiors absolutely love it. I&#x27;m curious if that is the experience others are having, but personally, it seems to me a good explanation why opinions on WFH seem to be all over the place.')
