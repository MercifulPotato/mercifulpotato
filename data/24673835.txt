My understanding is that the impurities (sulphur mostly) in bunker fuel are bad for people to breathe and create smog, so they shouldn&#x27;t be burned around population centres. The main greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide, and you produce roughly the same amount of that per watt of power no matter what hydrocarbon you burn.')
