We are going to try to see what the OEMs are charging for it.<p>You can connect them together in more efficient &quot;hives&quot;<p>&gt; Having three Infinity Fabric pipes per Arcturus GPU allows a NUMA-like coupling of four GPUs and 128 GB of HBM2 memory into a much bigger virtual GPU, much like UltraPath Interconnect at Intel<p>Whereas before it was less efficient<p>&gt; With only two Infinity Fabric ports on the Instinct MI50 and MI60 cards, banks of GPUs could only be hooked to each other in a ring topology and the larger the number of GPUs in the ring, the more latency between the devices.<p>I&#x27;m sure this is an incomplete list of highlights, but these all jumped out at me')
