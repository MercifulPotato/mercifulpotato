They are saying that humans have been doing massive changes to global-scale systems for a while now.<p>That mean they are trying to say that the simple chemical property of increased CO2 in the atmosphere increases heat retention isn&#x27;t false, or that humans aren&#x27;t doing it.<p>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more akin to them warning there may be more insidious or less-well-understood dangers to human civilization and the Earth biome than just global warming.<p>Personally, mass extinction of species comes to mind. A wide variety of species enables equilibriums to be established with changing conditions, given a proper allowed rate of evolution.<p>Current anthropomorphic changes to the world are far faster than typical climate shifts, which occurred on the scale of 1000s of years, not decades.<p>Combined with humanity reducing the number of available species to adapt, mass extinctions seem akin to us playing russian roulette:<p>- did killing off this species collapse the entire system? No? \n- how about this one?\nNo?\n- how about this one?\nUhoh.')
