Any attempt to locally optimize to keep everyone busy sooner or later kills the overall productivity of the system.<p>How this slack is used by the workers is a different question, but if someone wants to use it to improve the system, to improve themselves, or simply to recharge, I think it&#x27;s up to the worker. The goal is not to keep everyone busy; the goal is to provide optimal results using available resources.')
