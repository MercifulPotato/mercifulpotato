Item(by='tetrazine', descendants=None, kids=[25891766, 25890633], score=None, time=1611479033, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25889782, text='&gt; Scientifically, this MUST be superior to simply replacing the cork (or screw cap in Australia).<p>Why must this be the case? This is a genuine question, not a pure objection.<p>Consider two oxygen levels, o_1 and o_2, where o_2 &lt;&lt; o_1 due to vacuum removal. Consider a set of chemical reactions that occur between wine and the surrounding environment. Of oxygen, glass, trace chemicals, cosmic rays, astological auras, etc. Let ℜ be the set of chemical reations that affect phenomenological quality (flavour) (presumably negatively, as a just-opened bottle of wine is at the peak of quality and can only degrade).<p>Why must it be the case that o_2 is the limiting factor for all, or even some, of the elements of ℜ? What if another quantity (surface area, pressure, etc) limits the pace or extent of the reaction, and just as much degradation occurs with partial vacuuming (o_2) as without (o_1)?<p>Perhaps you or someone else is a wine chemist, professional or amateur, and can enlighten me. Until that point, there are more things in heaven and Earth, dear dhsysusbsjsi, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.')
