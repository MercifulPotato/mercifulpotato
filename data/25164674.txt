Item(by='Shared404', descendants=None, kids=[25167886], score=None, time=1605904696, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25164363, text='&gt; linux on a laptop is bad.<p>I think it at least partially  depends on the hardware.<p>&gt; - Suspend rarely worked without hacks, even with hacks laptop would often wake and heat up to thermal shutdown in backpack. Hibernate was similarly bad.<p>I did experience this a little bit, but it&#x27;s been 2-3 years since the last time it happened.<p>&gt; - &#x27;Normal&#x27; apps often didn&#x27;t work or worked poorly (Netflix, flash, Spotify, 1Password), things are a lot better on this front now.<p>No comment on this, I haven&#x27;t really used any of these on my laptop.<p>&gt; - Monitor support was typically bad and caused problems, connecting to monitor, multiple monitors, resolution issues on wake, etc.<p>Only issue I had with this was one TV wouldn&#x27;t take HDMI output at the same time as displaying to my laptop screen.<p>Everything else has worked great.<p>&gt; - WiFi was often a hassle and either wouldn&#x27;t work without hacks or would stop working for an unknown reason.<p>Haven&#x27;t had any issues with this, but I would imagine it would be highly dependent on the wireless card you had.<p>&gt; - Sound would stop working for unknown reasons.<p>Yeah, audio on linux kinda sucks right now. I&#x27;ve never been stuck without a workaround, but I&#x27;ve needed workarounds multiple times.<p>&gt; - Bad anti-aliasing&#x2F;font support in general.<p>I&#x27;ve not noticed this, but I also haven&#x27;t looked.<p>&gt; - Personally I thought the UI (mostly gnome, then unity) felt slow and UI elements&#x2F;chrome often took up a ton of visual space - in general things were uglier.<p>GNOME + Pop_shell at least has gotten fast enough to keep me from installing i3 again. This is of course a matter of personal preference.<p>I personally trust neither Apple or MS, but they both have their upsides.<p>To each their own, and happy hacking!')
