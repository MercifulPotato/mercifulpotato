Right now most of the 8086 (8088 technically but no difference at this point) is done, memory works, CGA has text mode support, and a basic implementation of most of the essential support chips is done (PIC, PIT, etc.). It&#x27;s an Xcode project but the only dependencies are SDL and SDL_TTF so it can easily be ported to other platforms.<p>I&#x27;ve run some automated CPU tests and the CPU is reasonably good, but like I said still missing some instructions (DIV for example). I wrote it all by hand, only looking at other emulators when I got really stuck for a particular specific item.')
