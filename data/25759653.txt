Item(by='desolley', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610527317, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25724998, text='&gt; That ex-PM of Malaysia literally called for genocide of millions of French.<p>That&#x27;s inaccurate. What he &quot;literally&quot; wrote was: “Muslims have a right to be angry and to kill millions of French people for the massacres of the past.”<p>I read his whole quote. He&#x27;s a nutjob but accusing him of calling for genocide is inaccurate. Also, perhaps France should consider saying sorry for testing nuclear weapons in the South Pacific and maybe relinquishing its occupied islands and terrorities like French Guyana back to the indigenous people that deserve independence. It is 2021, not 1821 anymore.')
