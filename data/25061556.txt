I&#x27;ve always appreciated that iPhones are &quot;secure by default&quot; (more or less) and I want to replicate that, if possible, on Android. Are there any defaults that I must change, or any dumb settings that put one at risk? I&#x27;m having trouble finding up-to-date Android security recommendations from competent sources, that are not just security theater...<p>Thanks!')
