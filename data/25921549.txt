They don&#x27;t need venture capital at all. So there must be some other reason (profitability? SV culture of valuing engineers?)<p>When I was at Google, I learned from an internal pay comparison spreadsheet that a person in the same job at the same level is paid much worse in Waterloo (and in the UK as well) compared to SV &#x2F; NYC, and the reason cited was &quot;cost of labor&quot; or some such fancy term which essentially meant &quot;we want to pay as little as possible, so a little bit more than our competitors&quot;. So ultimately, it boils down to &quot;prevailing wages&quot; in Canada (and the UK).<p>The first company to offer SV level wages in Canada &#x2F; UK will see a deluge of high quality applicants who want to stay in those locations for whatever reasons. I wonder why no one has tried that yet.')
