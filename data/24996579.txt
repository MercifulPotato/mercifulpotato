It doesn&#x27;t have a lot but the functionality it has was polished to perfection. Extremely fast and smooth and never gets in the way.<p>Although I&#x27;ve stopped using workflowy several years ago. Don&#x27;t really know why, just wanted to explore alternatives, never found anything better, so instead my notes are divided now between half a dozen online and offline applications (Google Keep, vimwiki, etc).')
