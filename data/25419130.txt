This is simply true of <i>all</i> human communications.<p>I can’t really see what you are trying to accomplish by insisting there is something called a ‘good’ essay, whose hallmark is it’s persuasiveness in the <i>absence of knowledge about the author</i>.<p>Certainly there are some sincere essays that do fulfill this criteria, but it’s what also exactly what a cult leader or marketing agency would be aiming to achieve with their writing.<p>I would make the case that being persuaded by an essay is an epistemically salient signal which can be thought of as <i>a red flag that we may be being manipulated by someone we wouldn’t choose to be manipulated by</i>.<p>When we experience it, the responsible thing to do is to <i>inform ourselves more about the author and their experience</i> rather than to lionize the piece of writing.')
