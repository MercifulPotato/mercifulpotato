It&#x27;s up to us in tech to always have that bright-eyed optimism for what is possible, because we&#x27;re the ones building it day-in-day-out. Observer critics don&#x27;t really have a place in this, unless that criticism is coming directly from folks who are meant to be the initial customers&#x2F;users of technology.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.laphamsquarterly.org&#x2F;revolutions&#x2F;miscellany&#x2F;paul-krugmans-poor-prediction" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.laphamsquarterly.org&#x2F;revolutions&#x2F;miscellany&#x2F;paul...</a>')
