It&#x27;s a terrible drug, and consumed in a filthy way through the nose which damages it and adds extra mucus. And as for the effects - it just makes your heart beat faster and makes you loquacious&#x2F;chatty. But that&#x27;s about it. For me it doesn&#x27;t make me feel &#x27;buzzy&#x27; or even trippy in any way, just makes me feel like I had a good running session, but without the effort of running (even with purer&#x2F;strong coke). And it was even an ingredient in Coca-cola until it was eventually removed after cocaine became widely prohibited. For me adding lignocaine[0] to a bit of caffeine produces the same effect. I just don&#x27;t see the allure and fascination. Anyone else think it&#x27;s a shitty drug?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lidocaine" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lidocaine</a>')
