If you didn&#x27;t know the terminology and implications, it might be hard to decipher without someone else doing the heavy lifting but that&#x27;s no different than any other market analysis.<p>For WSB, this is a perfect <i>positive black swan</i>. The downside was capped ($250 at the time) and the upside is unlimited.<p>CNBC, et al need to look past the shitposting and see this is a new creature.')
