The driver doesn&#x27;t care about either the restaurant or me, so he chucks the pizza vertically in his box, ruining it. I get a shitty pizza, I won&#x27;t order anymore from the restaurant.</i><p>As someone who sometimes orders from Deliveroo and who has had this exact experience I agree with your premise but not your conclusion.<p>When this happens I understand that this is the delivery guy&#x27;s responsibility and I don&#x27;t blame the restaurant for it. This may put me off using Deliveroo but not the restaurant if there is another way I can order from them.<p>Now if this happens with an in-house delivery guy then yes, that would put me off ordering from the restaurant again.<p>Interestingly when this happened to me it was partly because the Deliveroo guy was riding a bike. Thus I put the &#x27;blame&#x27; on Deliveroo and their organisation and process because trying to deliver a pizza by strapping it on the back of a bike can only end badly...')
