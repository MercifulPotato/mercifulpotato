I find it difficult to understand as well, but I think what happened is that emotional human contact was overrun by corporate&#x2F;nation-state bots. Bots cannot be convinced that their positions are wrong; they exist solely to spread discontent and fear. This is far different than the early Internet where you could safely assume everyone you were talking to is a real person. They may be a dangerous person, but a person nonetheless. You could equally assume that their day job does not consist of demoralizing or confusing people, and their positions on the issues were a result of genuine thought and strategy rather than a built in set of beliefs meant to serve some mystery person or group&#x27;s end game.<p>Basically, free speech only works if we have reason to believe the people holding onto the &quot;bad&quot; ideas in the idea marketplace listen. It stops being a solution when there are no consequences to being wrong, when your reputation doesn&#x27;t matter, and when you can be as immoral or insidious as you want without a care in the world.
