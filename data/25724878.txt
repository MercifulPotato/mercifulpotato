The democrats who refused to call out rioting and looting (as a separate incident from the peaceful protesting), those who called for the short-sighted defunding of police departments in cities with high crime (look up the uptick in shootings and murder in NYC after the city removed  $1 billion from the police department) have meaningfully facilitated illegal insurrection in their own communities, in my opinion.<p>I agree that Bannon does make egregious comments, but I tend to think the media blows his comments out of proportion.  Due to his military background, he often uses war analogies, which make for the detestable quotes you mention.  For example, in the Fauci &quot;head-on-a-pike&quot; comment that he made, it was clear to me that he was not suggesting for folks to literally murder Fauci.  He was suggesting for an example to be made out of Fauci by removing him from power.  It&#x27;s similar to when athletes say they want to &quot;kill&quot; the opposing teams.  Regardless of this, I agree with you that comments such as the one I mentioned are in bad taste.<p>On the other hand, left-leaning celebrities who posted picture depicting Trunp&#x27;s dead body (e.g. Snoop Dogg)  did not seem to face similar consequences from big tech.')
