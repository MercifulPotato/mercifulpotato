Item(by='adrian_b', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601848110, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24681577, text='Of course, by mixing any substances you will never obtain anything, because eventually the system will reach some equilibrium state.\nWhat is needed is a continuous flux of energy and precursor substances, like a source of volcanic gases, or, more likely, an alkaline hydrothermal vent.<p>Only under the action of such a continuous flux, complex systems may emerge. The simplest example is the appearance of oscillations when you attach a source of energy to various simple arrangement of devices.<p>For the appearance of life, besides the continuous flux of energy and simple molecules, catalysts were required, which must have been metallic sulfides, mainly of Fe, Co and Ni.<p>If we would reproduce such a setup now, a large variety of organic compounds would be synthesized. A similar process can be used to obtain synthetic gasoline.<p>Nevertheless, for the unlikely event of creating a self-replicating system, a very long time will be needed and also the chance of the right combination of metallic sulfide catalysts being located in close proximity and the chance of favorable proportions of the precursors in the flux of gases.<p>For now, we do not know enough to be able to estimate how likely or unlikely was the appearance of life, but we know that it was possible (I mean we know that this is possible from chemistry, independently of the fact that we know that we exist).<p>Such an estimation would become possible only after someone will succeed to design a self-replicating system similar with the first life forms.<p>The first life forms probably not only did not have nucleic acids but also did not use yet phosphate in any way and they were not cellular but they were attached on the surface of minerals. At some point, but probably later than achieving replication, they might have had the form of membranes closing pores of minerals in hydrothermal vents, before the membranes became able to close, forming cells with an interior separated from the exterior. Closed cells could appear only after having a more complex metabolism and various kinds of ionic pumps, while the earlier membranes closing mineral pores could passively exploit the ionic fluxes of the hydrothermal vents.')
