They trusted you with some autonomy to get things off the ground and found out you are making business decisions on your own that don&#x27;t fit into resource constrained startup operations. There is always a trade-off and corners can be cut, and my advice is to be upfront about the general approach about those and find out how much they are willing to invest in robustness and product quality at a certain stage.')
