Each side has in interest in presenting it as higher or lower, particularly relative to the flu. The true value is unknowable as it requires perfect test data. And the available data (case fatality rate) is rejected by the &quot;it&#x27;s just the flu&quot; camp, because they say the true denominator is much higher.<p>But honestly, who cares about the actual number? The flu death rate is subject to the same problems. Nobody gets tested for asymptomatic flu. We&#x27;re should be comparing the CFR for flu to the CFR for COVID, and this shouldn&#x27;t be an argument.... But it is.')
