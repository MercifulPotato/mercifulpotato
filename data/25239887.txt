If I take a command line app I have written and running on SQ1 and copy it over to an M1 based machine, will it execute?<p>I presume the graphics instructions is quite different between the 3 and that requires specific compilation?<p>The neural engine, I am having a really hard time finding concrete information on, such as instruction set.<p>The MacOs abstracts its details with libraries that talks to the neural engine.<p>When Linux is running on the M1 the compiler would need to know about that instructions as well.<p>These are all based ARM at the foundation at least.<p>Also how hard would it be for Microsoft to get their Arm based Windows 10 os to run on the M1?    That will probably never happen so the reverse might make more sense.<p>Will it be possible for enthusiast to create an M1 hachintosh from Window compurs running SQ2?')
