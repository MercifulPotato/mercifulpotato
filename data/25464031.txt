The more I think about it the more I am convinced that until there&#x27;s a large body of crime that the news cycle can point to and be outraged about, nothing substantial will be done. The hack occurred and nobody knows if anything was taken or if it was just information that was collected. It will take months for a conclusive investigation.<p>So far negligence in cybersecurity hasn&#x27;t resulted in anything spectacularly failing like a giant explosion or a building collapsing and hundreds or thousands of people dying. Until something horrific like that happens there won&#x27;t be pressure or political will to exert the appropriate measures that responsible governance should put in place.')
