But at first, I was like &quot;wait a minute, why should I have to have images on <i>to pay a bill</i>?&quot; and I clicked a bunch of things I&#x27;d never tried before to see if there was an alternative. It appears that you have to be able to do either the image captcha or some sort of auditory thing. I guess accessibility doesn&#x27;t include Helen Keller, <i>or</i> to someone who has both images and speaker turned off (which I have done at some times).<p>Maybe this is hard for someone younger to understand, but when I was first using computers, many had <i>neither</i> high quality graphics nor audio - that was a special advanced thing called &quot;multimedia&quot;. It feels like something is severely wrong with the world if that is now a requirement to interact and do basic stuff online.')
