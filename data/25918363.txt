But it does mean that when someone is telling you with a straight face that they needed horizontal scalability for performance, you should assume that they were probably wrong.  (Though probably saying that is not the wisest thing - particularly if the person you&#x27;re talking to is the architect whose beautiful diagrams you&#x27;d be criticizing.)<p>So yes, there are problems that require a distributed architecture for performance problems.  That doesn&#x27;t contradict the point that every other option should be explored first.')
