POSIX is carefully worded to not give any durability guarantees. Naturally, writes are generally not atomic w.r.t. unexpected system maintenance and there are no ordering guarantees at all unless you give ordering hints (like fsync&#x2F;fdatasync&#x2F;sync_file_range) yourself, which the system (kernel, filesystem, hardware) may or may not honor.')
