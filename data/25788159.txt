After Kennedy&#x27;s assassination Lyndon Johnson lent his enormous political capital to revive a dying civil rights bill and get it passed, and that was a big push, so much so that it lost his party the south for 50+ years.<p>I fully agree media consumption doesn&#x27;t fix a whole lot, and certainly not in today&#x27;s media environment, I merely advocate for staying informed and engaged enough to discover a useful way to make impact. I <i>want</i> to live in a world where we mostly just live our lives as we please, but society&#x27;s state right now is such that I don&#x27;t think it will let us off that easy.')
