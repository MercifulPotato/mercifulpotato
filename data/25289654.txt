Item(by='martamorena9182', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607008893, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25286989, text='Yeah sure, if you have significant experience before, but then E4 would be a total mis-hire.<p>Then E5 or E6. But E6 would already mean you were essentially a team lead before you even started. Will they mis-hire you two levels apart? Maybe, rarely, if you really screwed up that interview?<p>But the OP also says he &quot;became a good engineer&quot; and he &quot;became a team lead&quot;. And that is simply not possible. We do not talk about people who &quot;were&quot; a team lead and didn&#x27;t know it. We are talking about people legitimately hired at E4.<p>PHD? Perhaps you can do it in two years, but a PHD very likely has a lot of the skills you need already, so it&#x27;s not a fair basis to start from and they studied up to 6 years longer than a normal Master.<p>What bothers me more is the E6 -&gt; E7 -&gt; E8 promotion with the associated salary. That is just legitimately NOT possible at Amazon. This would mean you went from junior engineer to Senior Principal Engineer in 8 years. Well good luck with that. Maybe if you were the next Steve Wozniak, you could pull that off. I know A LOT of very smart people, people from M.I.T., Carnegie Mellon, etc. and they are challenged by just being a Senior Engineer at Amazon. Principal and Senior Principal just requires a skillset most people will never develop and according to the OP, that is not required by Facebook. In which case I consider it possible to get promoted to E8 within 8 years. This just means Facebook levels mean literally &quot;I was successful&quot;, not &quot;I am a competent leader&quot;. Which is fine and I will keep that in mind for the leveling discussion should I ever be on the lookout for a job there...<p>If you are smart (and I think the OP is very smart, don&#x27;t get me wrong), and you have a good portion of luck to be in the right place at the right time, I imagine the OP&#x27;s path to be possible if levels are handed out by &quot;success&quot;. But this isn&#x27;t meaningful to anyone else. The OP may have had a very different experience without a good portion of luck. Or at a different company, like Amazon.<p>To prove my point, I would encourage E8&#x27;s at Facebook to try to apply as (Senior) Principal Engineer at Amazon and see how it goes.')
