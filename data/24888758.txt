You did this by responding to a comment that was addressing it. You made the comparison because the gp brought up Tiananmen Square as a comparison for Zoom being different. You countered this by saying Google and Facebook are the same because they canceled an event with someone who is classified as a terrorist. Now I&#x27;m saying &quot;these two aren&#x27;t the same, that&#x27;s not a fair comparison.&quot;<p>Does that clear it up?')
