Another way to think about it perhaps is that, I don&#x27;t think any race can be avoided just by slowing things down somehow, the rules of the game are only slightly changed in that case, and perhaps not in a way that has any benefit to slower traders.<p>For example at IEX when they introduced their speed bump, it was to protect their so-called &#x27;mid peg&#x27; hidden orders. What they found was that these orders were still the target of adverse selection because some HFT trader could submit speculative orders well in advance, by predicting price movements based on fast information from connectivity to the order books of other exchanges.<p>That PDF is an awesome read ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iextrading.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;The%20Evolution%20of%20the%20Crumbling%20Quote%20Signal.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iextrading.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;The%20Evolution%20of%20the%20Cru...</a> ), but I think it speaks to a more general problem of trying to slow down. Even if auctions on all exchanges only occurred once every 10 seconds, there will still always be an advantage to whoever can aggregate information the fastest and use this to submit a best price at the latest possible moment to participate in the auction.<p>In my uninformed state, it doesn&#x27;t seem possible to truly reverse this process, and I&#x27;m left wondering what problem would be solved by attempting to eliminate HFT from the markets')
