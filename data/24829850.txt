Many insects can fly several Km routinely. Bees do it constantly. The beetles probably could do it also. So either you remove all trees in a radius of lets say &quot;4 km&quot; or beetles just keep growint. But if you remove all trees in a few Km, then you don&#x27;t have a forest anymore (neither water, wood, or the other environmental services that the forest provides).<p>More pesticides equal to less birds and bats. Not having birds and bats plus sucking all the water that trees need equal to more beetles. The disdain of politicians (and their voters) for this themes is the root of this problem.')
