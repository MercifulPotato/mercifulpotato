Their communities are more structured, and have less crime and violence. Their families larger, more nuclear and more supportive of each other. Their members are more relaxed, and have more purpose to their lives.<p>Evolution would state that, eventually, only the religious will survive. If there is a God, He is laughing.&quot;<p>Nonetheless, I don&#x27;t think that would help here - the  society has passed critical mass of crime, the incentives are for everyone to be criminal, and religion itself would be subverted for its use.')
