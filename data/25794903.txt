The goal, again, is not to make people meet, is to get the more users as possible. By making girls making the first move, you empower girls, you prevent them to get a insulting message from all your matches, you make them feel they decide. Girls are happy of this environment and stay on the app. More girls means more guys. Overall it means more users. And one day it will means more money<p>&gt; I&#x27;m surprised they haven&#x27;t allowed men to pay more to get ahead.<p>That&#x27;s not their goal their. Their goal was to grow in term of users. Now that they become public, and they focus on profitability, don&#x27;t worry for them, price will go up<p>&gt; I wish companies did more to encourage people to actually interact once matched.<p>Not going to happen, the more people interact, the more they meet and the more they quit the app.<p>&gt; I suspect that there&#x27;s much, much more that these apps can do to make it a win-win environment for their users<p>As long as dating apps founders want to make money thats not going to happen. You will always make more money by addicting your users to your app. That doesn&#x27;t mean there is no solution. Actually one of my life goal is to create that kind of app, but I need at least $50M to create it. So you will have to wait a few years')
