Item(by='znpy', descendants=None, kids=[25621991], score=None, time=1609680005, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25619319, text='&gt; Do not use a UID below 10,000<p>I see the point but this kinda looks like extreme paranoia.<p>I actually advise developers that are not so strong at docker and containers to use his 1000 in their container. Such uid is usually the default first uid in Ubuntu and thus makes running containers in their development machine easier (since now they don&#x27;t have to deal with file permissions and uids without a corresponding user on their system).<p>Someone will boo this and maybe even downvote, but it really helps developer &quot;think operationally&quot;, and gets their dev environment closer to prod.')
