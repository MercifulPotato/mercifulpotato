The Amazon cost-benefit calculation must have been trivial (minute AWS payments compared to talent and reputation costs of hosting Parler).<p>Yet, this also validates the choice of competing retail chains to not host on AWS. Sure we can excuse this use of power by Amazon, but it&#x27;s not impossible to see Amazon abuse it - there&#x27;s no transparent criteria offered by Amazon* and no way to appeal. Best not to give them the temptation to use this power for bad.<p>* E: Yea, they give out a criteria in the article, but for all we know there&#x27;ll be another criteria for someone else when it suits them. I think one could make a balanced way which would achieve the same result (banning Parler), as quickly, without giving Amazon too much power.')
