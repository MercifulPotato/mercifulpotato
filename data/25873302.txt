Groups, independently of their size, are not E2E encrypted.<p>Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but isn&#x27;t WhatsApp E2E encrypted by default for a while now?<p>&gt; The fact that Telegram does not publish server-side code while Signal does has no impact in the security assessment of these services... Still, from a security standpoint either of them is a better choice than WhatsApp<p>So if WhatsApp published the client code it would be at least as secure as Telegram, maybe better because it has E2E encryption enabled by default?')
