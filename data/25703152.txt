I have been living in DC for nearly 10 years and watched the crime in the area go up alarmingly during the quarantine. People being robbed in broad daylight, Porch pirates, Arsons, burglary, auto theft - not to mention other threats and hazards in the capital go on without being apprehended. I am specifically interested in the smart-city Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) cameras which could identify sick people, terrorists, gun shots, and all other kinds of hazards, threats and security issues.')
