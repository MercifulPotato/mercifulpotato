Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605811653, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25152279, text='&gt; Itâ€™s not particularly utopian....A student who has been taught to read comprehensively, communicate clearly and think critically should have no trouble acquiring that knowledge.<p>That sounds pretty utopian.  Firstly, I don&#x27;t think you can reasonably assume <i>any</i> mass educational program will reliably produce students like that, so any program that assumes that will likely fail a large proportion of its students in pretty significant ways.  Secondly, your exclusive focus what you define to be &quot;fundamental skills&quot; and exclusion of anything that you deem &quot;not fundamental&quot; seems more of a personal bias than a well-founded educational program.  There certainly exist bright and highly-motivated students (perhaps you were one of them) who would build on that foundation and complete their education like you assume they would, but I&#x27;d judge they&#x27;re a minority.  Thirdly, there&#x27;s a social aspect to education that your focus on skills misses.  Things like civics need to be part of the curriculum, because even if a student would have no trouble learning the subject independently, there&#x27;s no guarantee they would actually choose to do so.  However, the American system of government (unlike some other systems) can&#x27;t function without widespread civic knowledge and engagement.')
