I see it advertised a decent amount). ID 4 is coming, VW group members will all offer EVs based on the same platform in following years.<p>Electric cars are becoming a reality, charging networks are getting built, and most of the things I see around here is not Tesla. I bought a new car recently so I won&#x27;t be in the market for a new one for at least 3-4 years but I fully expect my next car to be electric and I doubt it will be a Tesla (I have my eye on Jaguar ipace but who knows by then).')
