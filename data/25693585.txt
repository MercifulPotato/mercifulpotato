The reason that people need to talk with the legislature is because those are the peopleâ€™s representatives.<p>Totally different, were it not for the fact the president is also the Chief of State: The chief public representative of a country.<p>Besides, even if this wasn&#x27;t the case, humor me and suppose it was (which it actually is), would you then conclude that the president should simply be accessible at will by 300 million Americans? It makes absolutely no sense.<p>Just because something is publicly accessible doesn&#x27;t mean you throw all reason out the window. Plenty of national parks are simultaneously open to everyone, as well as require registration and some basic ground rules to entrance. Similarly, it&#x27;s entirely uncontroversial to argue that accessing the capitol is freely available to all, but there will be some minimum security checks, and some areas (e.g. private offices or places holding confidential data) are off-limits. Virtually all democracies have no problem separating visitor&#x27;s areas from private working offices, and implementing appropriate controls in both.<p>The notion that the speaker of the house&#x27;s laptop could be casually stolen by people without heavy equipment walking in is a joke, pure and simple. Claiming it has something to do with the fact she&#x27;s a representative thereby implying her laptop should just be freely accessible instead of secured by some basic measures, as some (not you) have done in this thread, makes no sense if you ask me.')
