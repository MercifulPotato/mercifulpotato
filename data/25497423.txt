My Sony A7ii will take a 2&#x2F;3s of a second exposure by stacking four shorter exposures and using stabilization.<p>2&#x2F;3 of a second with an f&#x2F;2 or f&#x2F;2.8 lens means you can take pictures lit by not much more than starlight.<p>Actually, even without this, with an F&#x2F;1.4 lens I can take a handheld picture using only light pollution.')
