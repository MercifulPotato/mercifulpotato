Sure, individual people in charge may go away, but the systems are far more resilient than that. Even when Kings existed and held the position for life, the institutions they represented pre-dated them, and in many cases lasted long after they were gone.<p>Their assets also live on, for the most part, and heirs get a huge headstart, compared to the overall population.<p>&quot;Progress is made one obituary at a time&quot; is both true and false. People dying of natural causes do enable other people to fill their position, but it is not the only mechanism.<p>&gt; And that&#x27;s ignoring finite resources on the planet.<p>Reproduction is exactly what exhausts resources. And, for now, we don&#x27;t have a solution. Population aging requires people to reproduce, but <i>they don&#x27;t age quickly enough</i>. The number of people who are still alive but no longer productive only grows, as does the overall population number. In the past, mortality rate was high enough that this wasn&#x27;t really a problem, the overall population age was relatively low.<p>Now, if people are not only immortal but also operating at a level that enables them to be productive, then we only need to reproduce to replenish losses by attrition.  We wouldn&#x27;t have to make a &#x27;savings&#x27; tradeoff, except to account for disabilities (if those aren&#x27;t also fixed). We wouldn&#x27;t have to save enormous amounts of cash to use when we can no longer work, which means social security requirements would be lower.<p>Why would not having to have children be a bad thing? Yes, it&#x27;s been ingrained by both nature and nurture, but is that what most people actually want, or are they just doing what&#x27;s &quot;expected&quot; of them.<p>Once there&#x27;s no need to pass down the family name to the next generation, or to have &quot;someone to take care of you when you are old&quot;, and you are young forever(so no &#x27;biological clock ticking&#x27;), I bet most people will realize that it is actually a choice, and won&#x27;t bother.')
