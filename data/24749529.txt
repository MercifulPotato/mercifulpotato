One bright one to my right-front, and a dimmer one to my left.  I couldn&#x27;t get a good bounce panel setup with the way my apartment is arranged.  Note that my apartment is really dim, even during the day, due to the way the windows face. If you get more sunlight you can probably get away with a single light.')
