But it&#x27;s hard to imagine either of them making something that&#x27;s a joy to use.<p>Something Linux-based could work, but Linux is kind of stuck with a lot of decisions made thirty years ago.  The kernel is pretty good, but the basic abstractions of POSIX-like operating systems are perhaps not what you&#x27;d design if you were creating them from scratch in 2020.')
