Because the film industry works on a freelance basis, the union only has bargaining power if it doesn’t exist alongside a non-unionized body of workers who are willing to work for cheaper. By requiring that union members only work unionized jobs, they ensure that no non-union production can ever benefit from <i>any</i> non-union labor. This pushes productions to negotiate terms with the union in order to get talent, and that in turn helps union members get jobs.<p>It’s not about whether the union likes you or thinks you deserve to work. It’s about whether the production is willing to play by union rules.')
