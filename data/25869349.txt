They thought of their internal cloud infrastructure as a competitive advantage to be kept to themselves. Very similar to the Intel&#x27;s thinking of their own fabs which has brought Intel to the current failure.<p>Wrt. moonshots - one need to have huge political capital inside the company to carry the high risk of large investment.
