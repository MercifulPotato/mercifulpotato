More deadly, faster spreading, potentialy resistant to the vaccines.<p>So far UK and South Africa have two strains that are faster spreading (and hopefully that&#x27;s the only difference). If there&#x27;s nothing special about the one from Japan, I bet that this is just getting attention because the other two are in the news. Either news orgs jumping on a bandwagon or HN readers expecting that it&#x27;s similar when it&#x27;s not.<p>But maybe this one actually is notable too, I don&#x27;t know.')
