But IMO the best candidates are the ones that can teach themselves and know where to look when they have trouble, and in the post COVID world a remote interview is all you have.<p>So let&#x27;s say you asked them to print out the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, nicely formatted.  Could they figure out what you&#x27;re asking, learn the 4-5 basic elements of your language (declare some variables, set up a loop, add two numbers, and print it out) and send it back with less than an hour&#x27;s work?  I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s reasonable.  If they sail through that first gate than you can always ramp up with a second assignment that goes deeper.<p>But I&#x27;d provide a language reference right from the start to save time. Don&#x27;t make this an internet scavenger hunt for no reason.')
