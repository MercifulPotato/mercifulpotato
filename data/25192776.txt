Item(by='nsajko', descendants=None, kids=[25195247, 25193137, 25193990], score=None, time=1606170967, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25191277, text='&gt; command-line partitioning is just too risky<p>So partitioning a device is less risky with a GUI? That doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>EDIT: I should be more constructive:<p>I know that the command line scares some people, but that&#x27;s just like computers in general scare most people, it&#x27;s just something you have to get over with.<p>Another &quot;scary&quot; thing is the choice that exists between multiple available partitioning tools, I know it took me some time before I decided that the good old <i>fdisk</i> was my choice, but really, it probably doesn&#x27;t matter, any should be OK. You probably won&#x27;t actually do it directly from the command line anyway, e.g. fdisk is dialog driven instead.<p>Lastly, I doubt that it isn&#x27;t possible to fire up Xorg from the Gentoo install media and then partition from a GUI tool, if that&#x27;s what you want.')
