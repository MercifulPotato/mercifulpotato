You can go to your local electronics components store get a few bits and start programming AVR chips within a day.<p>Using KiCAD, then waiting for the equipment and then soldering - that is already a barrier.<p>Imagine you need a small voltage regulator on your DC supply line, because your cheap power supply spikes randomly... Are you going to wait for your PCB to be printed and a month for delivery(sometimes 2 months) and pay $6+ for a single board for delivery(components excluded, obv)... or you&#x27;re getting a 10 pack of perfboards for $5, cut our the right size and have your voltage regulator within 10 minutes at a fraction of the cost...')
