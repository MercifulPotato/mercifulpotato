Or if you like you can think of the determinant as a function of a square matrix (grid of numbers), rather than a function of a collection of vectors.<p>When you take the basis out, that&#x27;s the wedge product, which inherently includes the orientation. Conveniently, there is only one degree of freedom for n-vectors in n-dimensional space. When we take the quotient of two n-vectors in n-dimensional space we therefore get a scalar.')
