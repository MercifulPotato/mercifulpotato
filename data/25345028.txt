I remember many people stated they would wait until the 3rd generation of VR headsets before purchasing one.<p>I guess some knowledge &amp; intuitions don&#x27;t generalize.<p>Reminds me of a tech-savvy Youtuber that stated &quot;I&#x27;m teaching myself to trust Tesla autopilot and ignore my need to fearfully jump to the wheel every time FSD moves me too close to objects on the road&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m getting better at it&quot;... implying that 100s of thousands of years of evolutionary development&#x2F;intuition&#x2F;skepticism can be discarded when 1st gen tech enters the room.<p>*Note: I don&#x27;t see my comment when logged out, shadowbanned perhaps...I&#x27;m starting to understand what &quot;the right&quot; has been talking about free speech-wise...will the tech overlords grant me permission to share my view...?
