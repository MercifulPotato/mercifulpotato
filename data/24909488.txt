It was a functional, reliable car, but it had no keyfob to lock the doors remotely.<p>Getting out of your car, pressing the lock button on the inside of the driver&#x27;s side door, and shutting the door are all routine, boring actions that make it easy to forget your keys inside the car. The keys can go in all kinds of places as you climb out of the car - jacket pocket, pants pocket, center console. It is very easy to lock your keys in your car.<p>I quickly learned to hold my keys in one hand, say out loud, &quot;Keys in hand,&quot; and <i>then</i> lock the door with the other hand.<p>This technique is perfect for any repetitive action that could go wrong with non-trivial consequences, and there&#x27;s lots of that in everyday life.')
