Isn&#x27;t that the case here as well?<p>Granted, employees of Elastic, might have unknowingly written code that is now under a proprietary license. But code of most other external contributors should still be under the APL2.0, right?<p>&gt; Maybe, but it still doesn&#x27;t make it right. This wasn&#x27;t an accident, or the consequence of a company gradually succumbing to attrition. It was deliberately done for the profit motive in an already profitable company, and excused away with gaslighting and misinformation.<p>You are blaming a for-profit company for making supposedly for-profit decisions, which is nothing new. If you could show that their actions where dictated by short term greed (which is mismanagement in a for profit company), then this argument would bite more IMO.<p>A good argument for your critique is also their press release, where they try to explain &#x27;nothing has changed&#x27; while in fact the license has.<p>&gt; This is why I chose to criticize them on my blog.<p>Of course its a very annoying situation and IMO you are right in criticize them for causing it.')
