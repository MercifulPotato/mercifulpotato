Nothing specifically causative that I&#x27;ve seen (AFAIK, the link to the wet market as the source rather than an early transmission location isn&#x27;t even well-established).<p>I suspect that, given we&#x27;re a year on from the initial transmission of the virus in humans, unless the Chinese government has more research they haven&#x27;t made public, we&#x27;ll likely never know the truth.')
