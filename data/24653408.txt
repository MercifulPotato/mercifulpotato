Do you need to keep your product data (Postgres) in-sync with Hubspot, Marketo and Zendesk?  Do you want to limit the PII that leaves your firewall but still build robust email-marketing cohorts to use in Mailchimp?  Do you want to enable your Marketing team to experiment with new definitions of what “high LTV customers” are, and try new ways to re-engage them… without you needing to write any code?  That’s what Grouparoo does.<p>As our first hire, you’ll be a Founding Engineer at Grouparoo. You will be responsible for helping to craft the roadmap, developing features, fixing bugs, and building products that make our customers happy. We are a small team, and so we are looking for generalist engineers who are interested in learning about a wide variety of tools and technologies rather than becoming experts in any one part of the stack. We connect many different APIs, databases, and vendors, so there’s always something new to learn.<p>Learn more about the position @ <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.grouparoo.com&#x2F;jobs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.grouparoo.com&#x2F;jobs</a>')
