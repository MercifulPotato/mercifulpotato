I guess probably avoid it on base last gen consoles. Everyone I know in real life is enjoying this game despite occasional bugs. Cyberpunk is about as buggy now as Fallout 4 is after years of patches. People on the internet get way more enjoyment being overly dramatic about games than actually playing them.')
