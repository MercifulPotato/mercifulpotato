Chronic conditions are life changing, and no part of it is good.<p>It&#x27;s different, but as an example, I injured my back (i don&#x27;t really even know how) and was in intense pain for approximately 8 months. You know that feeling when you burn your hand on something? It normally last 5-15 minutes, well it was like that, but inside my lower spine all the time, for a solid 4 months...and then in duller state for another 4. I am still struggling with pain from time to time, but i&#x27;m once again able to sleep a full night (something i couldn&#x27;t do for around 5-6 months), do physical things and not regret every movement. At the start of the injury, i was probably the fittest I&#x27;ve ever been, but now i&#x27;m probably the least fit i&#x27;ve ever been. It&#x27;s seriously sucked. Who am I kidding, it still sucks...coughing hurts...but its improving and that gives me hope that one day it&#x27;ll be &#x27;normal&#x27; again.<p>Until you&#x27;ve had a long term injury, you have no idea how to sympathize. Right in the middle of this i had a close friend get upset with me that I came over when I knew he was painting, and didn&#x27;t offer to help. I was frustrated he even considered it a possibility, i was struggling to sit in a car for more than an hour, how was I going to paint a wall or ceiling? People just don&#x27;t understand.<p>To everyone suffering with something that inhibits their ability to enjoy life, i&#x27;m sorry but wish you the best. To everyone looking in from the outside, assume its 10x worse than what you see and reconsider your next move.')
