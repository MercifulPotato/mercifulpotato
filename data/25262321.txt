The problem is, most of us aren&#x27;t algebraic topologists.<p>I want to find a better set of analogies between category theory and software engineering, that aren&#x27;t so coupled to yet other fields of mathematics. I <i>feel</i> like they exist, but in a lot of ways, I&#x27;m still in the pre-rigor phase on category theory :(')
