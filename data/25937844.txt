It&#x27;s a classic bubble. Some early people on the hype train reaped eye-popping gains as more jumped on and bid up the price.<p>A cursory look at &#x2F;r&#x2F;WallStreetBets suggests this is statement is mostly wrong. You&#x27;re suggesting the price is rising due to speculation&#x2F;hype, but this phenomenon is fundamentally different. The reason for this rally is clearly activistic in nature, an attempt to bankrupt the hedge funds who engage in vulture capitalism.<p>Some might be greedy, but many aren&#x27;t trying to make money and greed wasn&#x27;t the cause of the rally. At the end of all this, there will absolutely be a redistribution of money, but even if the &quot;diamond hands&quot; investors walk home with a loss, they (hopefully) will have strangled a few hedge funds far greedier than the speculators who are taking advantage of this market dynamic.<p>This is far from a &quot;classic bubble&quot;, driven by over exuberance, or a classic squeeze, driven by greed. This is an example of a new phenomenon that will change how hedge funds operate in the future.')
