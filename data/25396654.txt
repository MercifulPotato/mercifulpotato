Difference is causation vs correlation:<p>If I learn how to boil water for example, there is close to 100% causation that heating water causes it to boil (notwithstanding we do not know everything about Physics, eg before we would say the earth is flat because we learnt it so, but that was incorrect, ie not everything we learn is true, it’s just a super high level of correlation)<p>However if a machine learning model says the probability of water boiling is 99% after heating water, that is actually correlation. So I would distinguish it from learning<p>In this example there’s not much different. But when you apply to more complex examples, the difference between causation and correlation become clearer')
