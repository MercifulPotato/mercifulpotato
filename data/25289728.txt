I don&#x27;t quite know what to do with them. in theory, they&#x27;re worth a decent chunk of change. looking at used sets on ebay, I&#x27;d estimate it&#x27;s somewhere in the four figure range easily. trouble is they&#x27;re all disassembled and jumbled together. I can&#x27;t even find someone who would take a bag of random bricks for free, let alone the whole pile.')
