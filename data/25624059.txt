Asset creation often starts a long time before shots or cameras are locked down.<p>If you don’t know how an asset is to be used it makes sense to texture all of it upfront as if it will be full screen, 4K.<p>Taking an asset off final to ‘Upres’ it for a can be a pain in the ass and more costly than just detailing it up in the first place.<p>In isolation it’s a insane amount of detail and given perfect production planning it is normally not needed, but until directors lock down the scripts and shots it can be the simplest option.')
