One should expect centrist candidates to dominate national elections and more extreme candidates to win state and local elections. When you&#x27;re trying to sell something to the whole nation, the more bland, the more it&#x27;ll sell, extreme is niche, this applies in music, movies, and political candidates.<p>Local candidates answer to local populations, they should be what that population wants; national candidates have to represent everyone, they should not be extreme in any direction or they&#x27;ll be despised and hated by half the population that swings the other way.')
