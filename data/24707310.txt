With higher speeds all the user facing stuff, like cables, connectors, power without noise - all start to matter too. You know how 100 mbit ethernet works well even with crappy connectors and crappy wires, you literally don&#x27;t need even a twisted pair for it, but pushing gigabit ethernet over that doesn&#x27;t work reliably anymore or even at all. It&#x27;s very much a universal problem with higher speeds. And the notion that &quot;you can make any speed reliable and fool proof&quot; is just absurd denying physics.')
