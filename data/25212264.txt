From Wikipedia:<p><pre><code>  s := &quot;this is a string&quot;\n  s ? {                               # Establish string scanning environment\n      while not pos(0) do  {          # Test for end of string\n          tab(many(&#x27; &#x27;))              # Skip past any blanks\n          word := tab(upto(&#x27; &#x27;) | 0)  # the next word is up to the next blank -or- the end of the line\n          write(word)                 # write the word\n      }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nI really think we lost out when we went toward regular expressions rather than SNOBOL&#x2F;Icon syntax, but I don&#x27;t think a direct substitute is as much the issue.')
