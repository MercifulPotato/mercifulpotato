Item(by='ClosedPistachio', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610993893, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25822771, text='&gt; Hilbertâ€™s 13th problem asks whether seventh-degree equations can be solved using a composition of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division plus algebraic functions of two variables, tops.<p>Later in TFA, there&#x27;s mention about how everyone thought the 13th problem was solved in the 1950&#x27;s, but in fact wasn&#x27;t, leading to this renaissance of thought for this Hilbert problem. It&#x27;s wild that these unsolved gems are still out there, waiting to be finished!')
