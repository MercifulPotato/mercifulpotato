It also doesn&#x27;t help that the visible &quot;leader&quot; of the US happens to be an extreme narcissist. Due to trickle down culture, behaviors, and attitudes things are getting worse. I&#x27;m see the following becoming the motto across a large segment of the population: &quot;Rules (laws) for thee, not for me.&quot; Which follows the idea of tribalism and the hidden and unconscious idea of the ingroup and outgroup and that government and laws exist to protect the ingroup from the outgroup.
