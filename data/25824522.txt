I have some HF stuff as well but all my wood working stuff comes from name brand companies. Also China makes some good stuff, but you have to pay for it. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re building dams and airplanes with HF tools :) . I helped a friend on his motorcycle a couple of weeks ago and I was kind of shocked at how loose some of the HF wrenches were on bolts bordering on ready to strip them. I stopped and went home and got my set of old craftsman I got handed down and they fit much tighter. I would suggest getting some of the more &quot;expensive&quot; tool lines at HF if you&#x27;re going to go down that alley for hand wrenches&#x2F;screwdrivers.')
