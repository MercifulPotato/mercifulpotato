They could charge anything they like -- 100%.  It&#x27;s a voluntary contract, and Epic doesn&#x27;t have to engage in it.  We don&#x27;t have to engage in it.  There&#x27;s no fundamental right to offer an app on an app store, and if the scope of the market is defined as the market for video games&#x2F;content, then none of these places are monopolies and companies&#x2F;people are free to set their desired prices.<p>Who is the court, or any of us, to say what <i>should</i> be the charge for selling a game on a marketplace?   That&#x27;s like someone telling you what your profit margin should be for a product that everyone wants.  Why should it be tied to your costs?<p>I mean, in many cases it is, due to customer demand reasons, but there are tons of things that you pay for that have prices nothing close to what it costs to provide.<p>That&#x27;s why I think it will fail in court at least (maybe not the SEC, or Congress).  The argument that 30% is unfair goes nowhere in court -- so what should it be?   Courts are not the forum for that question.<p>Anyway, I finish with snark: if Epic invoked its same logic on itself, clearly it should reduce its profit &#x2F; subscription charges to a &quot;reasonable&quot; level.  Epic is the only one I&#x27;m able to buy Epic games from -- clearly they&#x27;re a monopoly and need to have their market-abusive behavior and extortionate pricing regulated?  Right?<p>I find irony in many people who get probably so knee-jerk opposed to Google&#x2F;Apple and &quot;on Epic&#x27;s side&quot; will find themselves justifying why they should be free to set their own prices when they launch their next product.')
