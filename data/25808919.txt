They don&#x27;t perceive themselves as flip flopping, because of course they have not changed groups.<p>If a &#x27;strong&#x27; leader of a group such as the President, characterizes something as positive, followers will buy it.<p>Especially when there is a political divide, people tend to be &#x27;against&#x27; ideas as well, much more so if &#x27;the other side&#x27; approves or proposes them.<p>If you gave any number of policy recommendations to a random group, and indicated at random they were proposed by either Republicans or Democrats, I suggest you&#x27;d get responses more consistent with group alignment than ideological alignment.')
