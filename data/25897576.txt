(your words lol)<p>In my estimation, there are few trustworthy foundries that can facilitate the kind of scale that an automaker would need. If you&#x27;re in a hotly competitive industry, you&#x27;re not likely to contact some random fab freelancer to do a few runs of some chip you need, even if you have the design and everything ready to go. They&#x27;re unlikely to do it at the quantity you need, on the timeline you need, to the degree of quality that you need, and with the secrecy that you need.<p>I mean, if you&#x27;re Denso or Bosch, shouldn&#x27;t you be able to make your own chips? Auto parts have a long life cycle, so you can amortize the cost of the machinery over many years.')
