Your example of Libya shows just how badly governance has to break down in order for slavery to regain even a shadow of its former importance. The number of people enslaved has gone from substantial portions of humanity to a fringe activity, mostly on the margins of society.<p>The destruction of chattel slavery as a prevailing institution (after it being  normalized for thousands of years) should be counted as one of the greatest human triumphs. That you think the historic slavery in the Americas, Africa (especially in the Congo), China, etc.. is somewhere in the same ballpark as what goes on today is astonishing to me.<p>To say slavery is &quot;flourishing&quot; is not only incorrect, it is cynical aned likely demotivating to those people who actually work to reduce debt bondage, sex trafficking, child labor and other forms of &quot;modern&quot; slavery. What is your motivation here?<p>Pointing out that the battle against slavery isn&#x27;t completely won yet is reasonable, saying &quot;wage slavery&quot; exists is also true, but pretending there was no transition away from slavery starting in the 1800s is just wrong.')
