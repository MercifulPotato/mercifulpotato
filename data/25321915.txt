I curate my friends and groups pretty carefully so it&#x27;s a positive experience. My Twitter journey has been a little strange. I didn&#x27;t really start using it until I retired. I was surprised at first that the younger people didn&#x27;t seem very keen on having an old white guy comment on their tweets but now I get it - white male patriarchy, colonialism and all that, even from a friendly non-controversial person. Twitter is also surprisingly cliquish. I&#x27;ve good luck lately by only retweeting with comments. Then if they want to visit and see my comment they can. I&#x27;ll get an appreciative like out of that sometimes. There aren&#x27;t many cool old people on Twitter except the great Stewart Brand and Joyce Carol Oates.')
