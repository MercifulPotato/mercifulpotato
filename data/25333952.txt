Forget about the transition period for a moment, what do we want the industry steady  state to look like. And I think it&#x27;s exactly this. You are licensed and trained to work with personal data. Your license is on the line for misuse. You have all the incentives in place for the right behavior, and companies have the right trade-offs to consider when choosing to use it or not.<p>You can do tons of software development without needing personal data, and when you do need it you have someone in place who is accountable for it.')
