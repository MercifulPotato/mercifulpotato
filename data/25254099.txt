I&#x27;ve always argued that blind ?-style shortcircuiting in Rust is extreme code smell and guaranteed pain for future production outages, and that it&#x27;s not an actual solution to error the handling problem (which seems to come up often in Rust&#x2F;Go flamewars). And I&#x27;m glad that this idea is picking up traction.<p>Error handling is hard, Go doesn&#x27;t hide the complexity, but a lot of other languages try to handwave the complexity away. Either way, programmers are by default lazy, and you end up with &quot;Error 500: connection refused&quot;.')
