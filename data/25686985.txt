Item(by='jmt_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610126207, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25684712, text='Learning CSS selectors and HTML structure, inspect element and the other dev tools builtin to your browser, and something like BeautifulSoup (for static&#x2F;non-JS heavy pages) and Selenium (JS and other complicated pages) is pretty key imo. My background in web dev helped me with the HTML stuff. Basically, you fire up the page in a browser, inspect element to see how you can use CSS selectors to uniquely identify that data, then using BeautifulSoup or Selenium to parse and interact with the DOM will cover most web scraping cases.')
