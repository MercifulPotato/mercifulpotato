Livewire is pure ajax (at least for now, may change in the future, a rewrite is in the works), Hotwire is mostly websockets. Livewire does DOM diffing in the frontend, Hotwire does it server side (sorta? didn&#x27;t dig a ton but that&#x27;s my understanding). Performance characteristics are pretty wildly different depending on the usecase.')
