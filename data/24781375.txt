So pretty soon the 50 or so shows fall into two categories. Things you have no desire to watch or things you&#x27;ve already watched. Making it feel like the catalog is _EVEN_ smaller than it already is. Why it puts things you have already watched into the normal categories when they are already in the &quot;watch it again&quot; category I will never know.
