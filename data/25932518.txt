Build a bunch of tiny “stupid” things of increasing complexity and before long you’ll step back and realize how much you’ve improved. I trying to instill this in folks as I teach React - rather than building some portfolio masterpiece out the gate, do a bunch of little fun things to build skills and confidence.<p>The trouble with any of this stuff is that no course&#x2F;book&#x2F;tutorial can prepare you for every eventuality, and sooner or later you’re going to want to do a thing that nobody explicitly taught you, with a combination of tools that differs from any tutorial you can find. I think building up skills in the way you’re doing it is great preparation for that eventuality.')
