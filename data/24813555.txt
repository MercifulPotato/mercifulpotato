And let them all back each other up as needed.<p>On the other hand this stuff makes no sense at all:<p>&gt; “To abolish police we need serious affordable housing. We need food programs,” he said.<p>So people with homes and food don&#x27;t commit crimes? That&#x27;s contrary to my experience. And a call to abolish the police is just a call for the return of warlords, where the most belligerent and violent thugs make the rules. For all the problems we&#x27;ve got, that&#x27;s not a step forward.')
