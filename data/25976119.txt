Slowly society moves from primary industry, horrible jobs to a different class of labor; and along the way all collective bargaining should be surrended because the capital side of the equation is beneficial and benevolent, all the time?<p>Its an entirely false division: someone working in a factory a hundred years ago facing being maimed, vs a white collar worker facing sexual harrassment or systemic bullying today are both examples of real harm, and both deserve collective action to protect the worker interests.')
