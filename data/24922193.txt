It&#x27;s that at it&#x27;s not different enough. I&#x27;ve been waiting for a really good Linux desktop experience and windowing system since I first started using Linux in 1991. I&#x27;ve always found X hacky and awkward in the entire almost-30 years I&#x27;ve been using it -- it&#x27;s definitely improved from the era of manual modeline and input device configuration, but it&#x27;s still ... yuck. Especially things like clipboard. But I don&#x27;t feel like Wayland is the thing that&#x27;s going to move us towards any world of consistency and usability. It&#x27;s just another way for very heterogeneous and mismatched applications to draw arbitrary stuff on the screen.')
