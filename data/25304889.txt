Not to mention constant advertising for free in their apps. They had the “no on prop 22” people hopelessly outgunned.<p>Even the idea that Uber drivers themselves wanted to keep their contractor status is questionable given that they collected those statistics via polls in the driver app. There is&#x2F;was legitimate concern that Uber et al would collect that info and retaliate. There is no recourse for this on the workers’ behalf because they don’t have a union! This is a TEXTBOOK example of why gig workers need to be given the right to collectively bargain. Now, thanks to prop 22, overturning its provisions needs a 7&#x2F;8 majority in the state legislature. Aka, not gonna happen, and that’s by the design of some really cynical lawyers.<p>More generally, the prop 22 campaign is an indictment of the referendum process, and how easily it can be abused in the absence of sensible campaign finance laws.')
