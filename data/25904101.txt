The spec says that the browser can return &#x27;random&#x27; data, but I suspect that Chrome won&#x27;t let you do that, or at least not for long.<p>Instead of the user disabling third-party cookies, every single page author would have to set a new HTTP header to have their page excluded from the machine learning.<p>It also looks like a massive GDPR pitfall.\nSay you track conversions to a campaign, and track what &quot;cohorts&quot; a user entered your sales pipeline through. The moment you connect this data to the customer, it&#x27;s personal data IMHO. If you operate in Europe, the user should be able to retrieve&#x2F;delete the data, and request it changed if they say it&#x27;s wrong.')
