There are a lot of other differences; Oberon is a truly statically&#x2F;strictly typed language wheras the type system in Dart is intentionally optional; you can write an Oberon parser in a couple of hours (in contrast to more complex and ambiguous languages like Dart or Go). Oberon was optimized for use as an educational language and was successfully used for this purpose e.g. at the ETH Zurich. Wirth wanted the minimum necessary for his language, without unnecessary luxury, which only increases the development and learning effort.')
