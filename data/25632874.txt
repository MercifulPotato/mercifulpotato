I may switch based on the rationale that a product is only as good as it needs to be and crapiness that persists can be a leading indicator of growth. While bandcamp is earnest and comfortable for the kind of stuff I do (just a place to share with friends), it may be a bit too cool for school if I actually ended up producing something people want.<p>Soundcloud really looked like they were growing faster than their ability to handle it. Thinking it may actually be the smarter play.')
