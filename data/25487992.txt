Instead they see other people making more than them by half-assing their profession.<p>I was a Carpenter and Joiner. Crappy gangs with nail guns and battery saws could compete with me on some of my work,  leaving too little of the skilled stuff to make a living.  CNC stair builders churned out a demonstrably worse but cheaper version of what my workshop made.  My Dad, long past retirement age, is still living on the crumbs these kids leave behind. When he dies there will be none left in our old patch that can do some of the old skills, like traditional roofing (where prefab trussed rafters can&#x27;t be used).<p>I am not 100% clear that this is a better world.<p>I use the tube in London, but black cabs are still the premium service.')
