Large companies have loads of users who rely on their applications; they are much more conservative than small developers, and have longer procedures for testing and validation before each release. Some lag is expected, and their applications are useable in the meantime, anyway.<p>You’ve got things completely backwards.  Virtual machines running on M1 Macs at the moment are ARM, they don’t emulate x86_64 (yeah, I know, there are experimental versions of some emulators; none of them are ready yet). So a virtual machine is not going to help you running Intel binaries.<p>Rosetta 2 is a translator (takes binary, spits out binary once, which is then run), and has nothing to do with a virtual machine.<p>Besides, what matters is that the resulting executable work, and with more than adequate performance. You install programs to make them run and do useful things, not just for the intellectual pleasure of having done it The One True Way, which is bullshit anyway. Do you also go trolling that Linux is terrible because Python scripts are interpreted?')
