You think you can do better? Go build a better browser that&#x27;s free yourself.<p>So criticising an entity that claims to be creating a freer internet somehow requires us to do better than it has have?<p>Of course we have the right to challenge a public claim that is not accurately made. I can&#x27;t use FF to group call using FB and Google Meet but I don&#x27;t seem to mind that but when you remove choices (e.g. Requiring the user to change profile-specific about:config flags and subsequently forcing users to resort to a custom userCSS file which requires not only having a legacy feature manually enabled but also a bit of know-how to remove the new behaviour after introducing a new megabar that seemingly adds absolutely nothing useful to the UX and trying to prematurely push a complete redesign of the Android browser to the masses without even considering the number of things it is going to break) without a proportionate incentive to do so, I draw the line there. I&#x27;m still using FF (both on my PC and my Phone) but I&#x27;m nonetheless saddened by what seems to be happening there.')
