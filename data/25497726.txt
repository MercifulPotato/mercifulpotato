I&#x27;d say 5~7 hours print-job on each, depending on the printer, milling it could be done in half that easily, but a qualified operator&#x27;s time cost a fair bit more than someone keeping an eye on two (or more) printers while doing paperwork.<p>(As long as they don&#x27;t need more than the ten pieces we get (at most) at a time at least.)')
