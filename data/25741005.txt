The hardware seemed neat, but even as somebody very familiar with routing &amp; switching I found the UI to be rather obtuse.<p>The other reason I decided to &#x27;roll my own&#x27; was an in-line IDS. There seem to be &#x27;hacky&#x27; ways to get Snort installed on the RouterOS platform, but the CPUs aren&#x27;t really powerful enough to run DPI with a sufficiently large ruleset.<p>I also like the ability to use Ansible to manage my router&#x2F;firewall. There are modules available to do this with RouterOS, but they don&#x27;t seem nearly as robust and mature as the built-in Linux utilities.')
