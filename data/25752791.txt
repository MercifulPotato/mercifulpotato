Most of the cost is in salaries and the salaries are the same because the technology is scalable.<p>Once they have the market of hundreds or billions of users, almost nobody can compete with them because even paying enormous salaries the price per user is very small.<p>The problem with decentralization is that they don&#x27;t have scale, so it is a serious problem just paying a single engineer salary.')
