And potentially rather dangerous.  If you&#x27;re willing to invest that much in dubious self-medication, use that money to get better insurance (edit: if possible), which should in turn pay for a PCP visit and some basic blood tests.  And a prescription--if you need it.  Edit: If you don&#x27;t have that option, you probably shouldn&#x27;t be dropping money on supplements, and you&#x27;re probably not going to appreciate someone on HN telling you to prioritize such matters in the first place.<p>Edit: People who are in difficult situations financially shouldn&#x27;t be focusing their energy on self-medication with random supplements.  Those resources are better spent elsewhere.  It may be the case that no, they cannot get insurance or blood work for the cost of self-medication--but that doesn&#x27;t mean they should go ahead and do it anyway.<p>Asking someone in a financially difficult situation to spend $15-30&#x2F;mo on Vitamin D is silly.  That&#x27;s a lot of money.  It would be better spent getting more or healthier food (the latter of which comes at a premium in the US), or perhaps setting it aside for the inevitable medical costs that life always brings.  If you can afford to drop $15-30&#x2F;mo on vitamins, you can afford to visit a PCP once every year or two--even out-of-pocket, the PCP visit is going to cost less.<p>Could you get the vitamins online for a fraction of the cost?  Sure, but there are people who often can&#x27;t pay with anything but cash or food stamps.  Suggesting that they&#x27;re in a position to order products online is rather dismissive of the reality that many of these people live.')
