Anyway, for me and my home currency everywhere was expansive in Europe, so what I mean is Venice felt particularly expansive.<p>Then, tumbling around, one day I ended up in Switzerland. You&#x27;ve got to use up that rail pass after all. I left Switzerland within a a day. It felt too artificial and out of reach (maybe that&#x27;s why too artificial) for me. Maybe I didn&#x27;t go to the right places or with the right budget. Left Switzerland aside for when I will be filthy rich.')
