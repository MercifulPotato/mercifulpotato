There is also a usability problem. I despise email archives.<p>&gt;Theoretical responding author:<p>&gt;Yes, but there is a good reason for that.<p>There is an example linked [0] in the first blog post and I honestly don&#x27;t understand how to read it.

The response hierarchy is inverted.<p>&gt;Theoretical responding author:<p>&gt;You&#x27;ll get used to it in no time.<p>The idea of responses being a quote inside the text they are responding to is absurd. I honestly can&#x27;t comprehend it.\nUsually people quote the text they are responding to, not the opposite. Why do things have to be so complicated? Github doesn&#x27;t even have a hierarchy. It&#x27;s just an ordered list of messages.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.sr.ht&#x2F;~philmd&#x2F;qemu&#x2F;patches&#x2F;5556" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.sr.ht&#x2F;~philmd&#x2F;qemu&#x2F;patches&#x2F;5556</a>')
