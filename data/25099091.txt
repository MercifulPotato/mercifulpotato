Did well in undergrad, graduating in 3 years and got a fellowship at a good grad school. Studied theoretical high-energy particle physics. In the background of all this I was programming the whole way, worked in the computer lab, etc. Ultimately I decided to drop out of the Ph.D. program with my M.S. and dive into software engineering, my real love. Haven&#x27;t really looked back since the choice to drop out. Still program everyday as a VC. Having your favorite hobby as your job I still think is as good as it gets. Even better if it grew up with you and is now lucrative and as exciting as ever.')
