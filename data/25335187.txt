I remember a lot of people talked down on Sac when I lived in the Bay. It feels like I’ve discovered a secret by moving here.<p>EDIT: Here are a few more things to like about Sacramento.<p>There seems to be a large population of highly educated ex-military types concentrated here. It’s been an unexpected source of high quality hires. I never saw these people in the Bay.<p>I’m in an international marriage. We were worried we wouldn’t be able to find our people upon moving here. That hasn’t been a problem at all. Fellow expats are everywhere. It’s a fairly diverse area.')
