Starting with ISPs, DNS providerd, etc. And even if we were doing the lower levels, it still wouldn&#x27;t be, but we might relieve the perceived need.<p>What amount to algorithmically assembled personalized magazines, like all the newsfeed-focussed social media outlets, are pretty much the least utility-like and most-media-outlet like (hence, the name) parts of the internet, and regulating them like state-directed utilities makes as much sense as treating the New York Times as a state-directed utility.')
