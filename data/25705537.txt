No one was injured, but from the videos it seemed very close to getting out of hand.  (Marchers coming off the street to verbally accost people sitting outside at a restaurant, grabbing drinks off their tables.  Marching into a McDonalds and verbally harassing the manager...about something.)<p>And of course police going off on protesters, looking for excuses to escalate the use of force.<p>And with police reluctant to engage in communities where they are...unpopular...(with reason), murder rates are at their highest rates in years in many cities.<p>And now the unprecedented attack on the capitol.<p>I feel like I will get responses saying I am understating or overstating the violence from &quot;one side&quot; or the other.  But my point is no one can deny the amount of violence is rapidly increasing, and no one really knows if it will get a lot worse before it gets better.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone coming to the US right now, without a good reason.')
