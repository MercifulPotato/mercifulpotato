Item(by='tptacek', descendants=None, kids=[25959663, 25959116], score=None, time=1611933330, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25957944, text='There is a technical definition for a &quot;zombie&quot;, which is apparently a term of art. As his own link points out, a &quot;zombie&quot; is defined as a company that can cover its operating costs and debt service, but not debt principal. Those companies include many that <i>nobody</i> believes are &quot;functionally dead&quot; or &quot;phony-baloney&quot;. I keep making fun of him for linking to an article about zombies that counts Moderna --- <i>Moderna</i>, for Christ&#x27;s sake --- among their numbers, but nobody thinks that Exxon is about to go under, either.<p>I&#x27;m not really here to debate the definition. It&#x27;s <i>his link</i> that enumerates the companies I&#x27;m pointing out. Which is why I&#x27;m making the case that he hasn&#x27;t really read the stories he&#x27;s linking to.<p>We could go further into the analysis: a whole bunch of companies, like Delta, which Taibbi implies will never be worth anything again, are distressed because of the pandemic, which will clear up this year. Demand for the products of these kinds of companies will return and the list of &quot;zombie companies&quot; will change, as it has in the past (per Bloomberg, take Sprint as an example). But this is really dignifying Taibbi&#x27;s polemic, isn&#x27;t it?')
