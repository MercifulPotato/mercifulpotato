Item(by='massysett', descendants=None, kids=[25547977], score=None, time=1609015459, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25544719, text='In my experience I simply search for &quot;contact us&quot; in the Amazon search box (it&#x27;s not easy to find otherwise) and it brings up a chat bot.  I tell it my item never came, and it shows me orders and asks &quot;do you mean this one&quot; until we zero down on what item.  Then the bot issues an immediate refund.  I use this where tracking says the order has already been delivered (sometimes delivery personnel lie and say they delivered something they didn&#x27;t; sometimes they deliver it to the wrong place.)  If tracking shows that the item has not even been delivered, this is doable from the &quot;My Orders&quot; webpage directly.<p>Pretty easy in my experience--I expect this process with any other vendor would be much more time-consuming--but as you say it may vary depending on whatever arbitrary factors.')
