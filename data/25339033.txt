Tiny piece of shit houses built in the 60s still go for a million plus in much of the SFBA. The problem is there&#x27;s a real housing shortage so there&#x27;s untenable minimum prices for houses.<p>At a million dollars you need a fairly large household income to afford luxuries beyond your house. Even putting down 25% on the house with a good 30 year fixed rate loan you&#x27;d be looking at just under $4k a month for your mortgage. After utilities you&#x27;re easily over $4k a month. If you scrimped you could maybe keep your other household costs under $500 a month (realistically you&#x27;re looking at $1k). So you&#x27;re looking at a take-home of $4.5-5k to just stay afloat.<p>That&#x27;s all for a shitty house that needs work, doesn&#x27;t have great insulation, and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of usable space. If you&#x27;re 30 when you buy they place you only have to keep that income until you&#x27;re 60 or hope that you build a ton of equity in the meantime and cash out.<p>That&#x27;s the minimum for most of the SFBA. There&#x27;s plenty of places with even more outrageous prices for shitty houses. To buy a house for not completely outrageous prices you need to go pretty far afield with hour plus commutes.<p>Treating yourself to ramen once a week is not a luxury.')
