There&#x27;s nothing special about Musk; he just happens to be high-profile about it and managed to extract more from California before decamping to a &quot;cheap&quot; state than several of those who came before him.<p>I disagree with your assessment that Texas has wide acceptance for opposing viewpoints, at least out in the suburbs where I grew up.  If you were not religious and conservative (I have my own anecdotes), you did not fit in.  Only when I went to college in a college town did people largely seem to want to live and let live.  Sure, inside the larger cities it is more cosmopolitan, for lack of a better word, but lots of people live in the &#x27;burbs and around the smaller areas and do not get the benefit of this peaceful coexistence.  For example, to this day I do not recommend being openly gay and living near Tyler.<p>If someone moved to Texas, they made a choice to accept it and I will not knock people for their individual choices.  But my experience is not that the prevailing view is open acceptance of people of all stripes like found in other parts of the country.')
