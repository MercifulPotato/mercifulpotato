Almost all security issues go away with locally hosted (i.e., same domain or another domain controlled by the website), plus you avoid an extra DNS lookup, and you still get caching on the same site.<p>I realize there are benefits, but are the benefits so extreme that they merit all the hype around CDNs?  So many developers talk about them like the web would crawl to a halt if they were stopped, but I think that they have their own slippery-slope of problems that has resulted in folks just hand-waving away the expense of web assets since it&#x27;s a hidden problem from the developer.  I doubt actual bytes transferred and latency are affected in a significant way as folk that promote CDNs claim.<p>It&#x27;d be nice to see actual comparisons in a real world scenario.  Keep in mind, web site responsiveness is not just linked to download time&#x2F;size, but also asset processing.  If your page is blocking because the JS is still being parsed, the time you saved downloading it is moot.')
