They each have different events which they consider the present. Now imagine that there is an alien government in Andromeda debating a possible invasion of Earth. To the person on Earth who is moving, the debate still going on, but in the reference frame of the stationary person, it&#x27;s a day or so later in Andromeda and the invasion fleet is already on it&#x27;s way. If there is no absolute reference frame, and both observers reference frames are equally valid, then the outcome of the invasion debate is a foregone conclusion. This is the crux of the Andromeda Paradox and the Reitdijk-Putnam-Penrose argument. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rietdijk%E2%80%93Putnam_argument" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rietdijk%E2%80%93Putnam_argume...</a>')
