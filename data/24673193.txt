Item(by='nercht12', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601743804, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24671575, text='Actually, it can take multiple. gte(a: b: c: d:) is equivalent to (in C) a &gt;= b &amp;&amp; a &gt;= c &amp;&amp; a &gt;= d. By making operators like functions, you can group like-operations and simplify code. Admittedly, it&#x27;s not as readable for someone accustomed to seeing C style.<p>Last note: gte(a=100) would produce an error in Copper because a=100 is an assignment statement that returns &quot;a&quot; (a function), and gte( function ) means nothing.<p>Edit: I see you&#x27;re referring to Python, but I figured I&#x27;d keep the note of comparison.')
