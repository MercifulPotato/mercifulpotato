If you have a bunch of slow cores that are half as fast but use a quarter of the power [1], using threads to split up the work so you can still meet your deadline can definitely save power.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.semanticscholar.org&#x2F;paper&#x2F;Power-aware-task-scheduling-for-big.LITTLE-mobile-Yu-Han&#x2F;6f58170813145d30668521e9cbd6e71758cbbedb&#x2F;figure&#x2F;0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.semanticscholar.org&#x2F;paper&#x2F;Power-aware-task-sched...</a>')
