It&#x27;s supposed to indicate greater power efficiency -- more cycles on more cores with less power consumption.<p>&quot;Latest Laptop PC Chip&quot; is just deceptive -- and it&#x27;s confusing, too. How would it look compared to laptops with the Ryzen 4000 mobile series? Not quite as good. They&#x27;re not obligated to add that, but if a (presumably smaller) business is trying to emulate that marketing strategy, it&#x27;s not going to work quite so well because smaller businesses have to market in the teeth of skepticism while companies like Apple do not due to their massive brand equity.<p>Apple has seen a massive boost in sales this year for Mac laptops. You could attribute this to Covid and you could partly attribute it to product improvement. I don&#x27;t think it has much to do with the marketing, which is just Apple boilerplate.<p>How to market CPUs in the contemporary marketplace is really hard in general because they are so much less comprehensible than in the era of &quot;more mhz means more faster &#x2F; 2 cores better than 1 core &#x2F; 4 core better than 2 core&quot;). For the huge majority of users, it&#x27;s nearly incomprehensible. It&#x27;s not an easy thing to communicate about to the normal market. Talking about battery life and general performance is probably the best that you could do. So I&#x27;m not saying that this is an easy thing to present in a Powerpoint, just that I didn&#x27;t think that Mac&#x27;s sales strength this year has much to do with their marketing and has more to do with the circumstances of 2020 and the strength of the product itself.')
