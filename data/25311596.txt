Most needed stuff was sold within a few blocks. Thanks to  great nearby transit connects to anywhere in the region, sold my vehicle after a year.<p>Lived there 12 years ... 120k miles less gas &amp; maintenance. Miss it a lot now (one bus, nearest stores 2 miles, nearest transit station is a 15 min ride away. Perfect for Covid I guess.)')
