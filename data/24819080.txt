But if we&#x27;re talking about a honeypot, your browser could be easily tricked into downloading large-enough files even from a plaintext website (just add several megabytes of comments in the webpage source for instance).<p>&gt; In order to be really anon you would need a custom client side engine that randomizes the order of external resources, and pauses&#x2F;resumes requests (given 206 or chunked encoding is supported), and&#x2F;or introduces null bytes to have a different stream bytesize after TLS encryption is added.<p>It&#x27;s unclear to me how any of this helps avoid traffic analysis. I believe tor already pads data into 512-byte cells, which might help a little bit.')
