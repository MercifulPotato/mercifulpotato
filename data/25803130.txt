I would agree that if it were the case that she was offered a full faculty position after a 90 minute remote interview, that wouldn&#x27;t pass the sniff test. But that&#x27;s not what she claims in this post. It&#x27;s very plausible that a working journalist would teach at Harvard Extension School. Though it&#x27;s at least a bit of a stretch that Harvard would relocate someone from India to do so.
