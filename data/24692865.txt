Orleans and the core team are relatively unopinionated on design patterns that developers employ. I&#x27;m much more concerned with developers writing code which cannot perform well at scale, or which becomes unreliable at scale, where machine failures are common, than I am with whether or not something fits some set of prescribed design patterns.')
