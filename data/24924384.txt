I think they&#x27;d be hard to prioritize as they are so minor (outside of perhaps a &quot;minor bugs only&quot; sprint or similar, as some projects do). But they do add up very quickly.<p>To illustrate, here&#x27;s some of the paper cuts that instantly come to mind: mod-s not working in panel editor, gradient fill incompatible with series overrides, various missing tooltips, missing query error reporting and syntax highlighting in variable editor, variable editor needing many clicks for most common actions, hidden variables can only be changed by repeatedly opening and closing the settings, some dashboard settings pages being easy to accidentally close without saving, g+[key] keyboard shortcuts randomly not working, random scroll jumps with multiple queries in a panel, switching between cursor modes with mod+o is super slow, Prometheus autocomplete not working when editing existing queries, clicking the dashboard name filters by folder while clicking the folder name shows all dashboards, adhoc filters silently don&#x27;t work, etc.<p>The &quot;not responding&quot; one specifically happens a lot while editing queries. It&#x27;ll randomly decide to evaluate the query while I&#x27;m typing, get thousands of results and lock up.')
