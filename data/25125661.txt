Git is a glorified save&#x2F;share&#x2F;undo tool, demanding people spend several days reading the manual is an absolute caricature and yet you&#x27;re seriously saying that.<p>The reason people are mad at you is that people have <i>lived experience</i> of the interface sucking and failing to do the job an interface does - <i>convey via context what it does</i> and you&#x27;re basically blaming them for wanting to fix the problem they&#x27;ve experienced instead of sucking it up and Being A Real Man and solving problems they don&#x27;t have as a workaround for the tool failing to solve problems they <i>do</i> have.<p>And it&#x27;s not like Git&#x27;s interface problems are subtle. It&#x27;s an absolute joke, and you&#x27;re not even claiming it&#x27;s an acceptable interface so much as rejecting the entire concept of user interfaces at all. I&#x27;m not sure how to explain how utterly infuriating that is.<p>You&#x27;re saying &quot;you&#x27;re doing it wrong, so I don&#x27;t care&quot; while simultaneously complaining that some of the solutions could hurt other peoples&#x27; use-cases.<p>What is the correct response here? Reject their own memories and emotions and yield to your blame, or call you a willfully-oblivious fuckhead?')
