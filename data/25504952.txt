Item(by='konschubert', descendants=None, kids=[25505033], score=None, time=1608634017, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25504771, text='&gt; It&#x27;s easy to buy some &quot;random&quot; sensor that was around for years and most certainly has &quot;meh&quot; quality by today&#x27;s standards, but we need a good one, with good dynamic range, HDR capabilities and low-light performance.<p>So maybe it&#x27;s a matter of time until these &quot;good&quot; sensors reach the open market, can be bought in smaller quantities and become commoditised. Then, we may see a good upmarket webcam.')
