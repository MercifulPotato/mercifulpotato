I often wonder, what if you had two distinct lenses, each with separate transmit?<p>EG, both operating at once.  Or multiple lenses?<p>Now you could do things, potentially, such as use a high-fidelity lens to tag individuals.  EG, license plates.  Facial recognition.  That sort of thing.<p>Once tagged, another lens, one which records the entire surface of the continental US, would track objects the size of vehicles, or even people.  Determining who or what each was, would not be vital.  Only high probability tracking, and those other lenses coming into play for closer viewing, to tag.<p>Now you&#x27;re just tracking dots as they move.  And once someone is tagged (phone, or license plate), they don&#x27;t need to be retagged.<p>If not already being done, it won&#x27;t be long until it is done.  And once tagged, you&#x27;d never shake that tag easily.<p>We&#x27;re all familiar with facial recognition tech used by SV giants, and we know of many things, such as gait recognition used in China.  Yet what amount of tagging, facial recognition could be done, when budget was of absolutely zero concern.  If computing power was of zero concern.<p>All you need at the images from the satellite.  Ground based computing power can do the rest.<p>What if you had trillions in computing power to throw at this?<p>Well.  Regardless.  If it isn&#x27;t a problem now, it <i>will</i> be a problem eventually.')
