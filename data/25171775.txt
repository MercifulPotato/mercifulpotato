It varies, but at least for ACT, they waive stamp tax on new electric cars, and registration is $100 cheaper.  I also didn&#x27;t include GST tax for fuel in my numbers above (10% of total fuel cost).<p>So yes, luxury tax does kick in at a lower number (which I find silly), but I think overall, you&#x27;re still creating a situation where electric is paying less to use the same roads.<p>That said - Agree with the line you quoted.  I think an even and fair tax makes sense, but I don&#x27;t see how you do that at the local level when the fuel tax is federal.')
