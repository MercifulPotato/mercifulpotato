It&#x27;s equivalent to programming using only combinators as the fundamental unit.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tacit_programming" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tacit_programming</a><p>All programs are actually pipelines of data flowing from a low entropy state to high entropy state with IO and state as the endpoints of the pipes-. Using the point free style or flow based programming makes this entropy and the pipelined nature of all programs more explicit.<p>Using OOP or regular programming the pipeline nature of data flowing to and from state and IO becomes less evident and more convoluted.')
