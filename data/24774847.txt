They try to create a fully functional fake of the original class.<p>So shouldn&#x27;t fakes have their own tests as well? Mocks don&#x27;t need tests (at least in C# with a framework) because no new class is ever written.<p>Anyway most of these issues are inherently linked to the nature of OOP and are a direct trade off to its benefits.<p>Both Mocks and Fakes have advantages and drawbacks, but the OP doesn&#x27;t reflect that.<p>I wish articles written on that subject would take a step back and explore how code can be written so that the burden of testing is reduced to a minimum.')
