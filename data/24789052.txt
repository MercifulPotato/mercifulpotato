That&#x27;s a widely known problem. The stats are glaring and blatant. It&#x27;s difficult to fix, but we generally know some strategies that work. The challenge is building political will.<p>This article is about a problem that is not widely known, which is obviously why she chose to write about it.<p>Forgetting about whether elementary school performance results in leadership positions, first look at the effects of penalizing high-energy children (regardless of gender):<p>- ADD over-diagnosis<p>- poor grades due to teacher bias, which the article mentions (academic grades are artificially deflated based on unrelated behavioral issues)<p>- school-to-prison pipeline (not mentioned in the article, but a huge problem for boys and not at a problem at all for girls)<p>Maybe a solution <i>would</i> be to have gender-only schools, but that might cause other problems. It seems that most of the problems in education are a result of treating children as a homogeneous group instead of individuals, which is another thing this article points out.<p>There may not be enough money to have individual lessons for children, but perhaps a more college-like system (where high-energy children can enroll in physical classes while low-energy children can choose to do something else) would work.<p>For the record, I was extremely high-energy and not athletic at all. The solution for me was not to do competitive, physical classes. It was to do active classes that involved working (even if &quot;working&quot; was just filling out worksheets) instead of sitting still and listening to a lecture.')
