The examples you provided are obviously not incitements to violence.  If someone wants to twist those words to get us to believe they are, we can look at the facts on the ground: no one became violent because of those words.  (Of course that&#x27;s not possible when you&#x27;re judging speech immediately after it&#x27;s said and don&#x27;t have hindsight.)<p>On the flip side, quite a bit of violence did occur on the 6th; the speech that got us there was pretty clearly intended to get us there.')
