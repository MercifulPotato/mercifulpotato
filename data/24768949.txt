Few months ago I decided to quit my job and try to make something on my own. Please check it out.<p>Monitoria is an active monitoring service for websites or basically any HTTP&#x2F;S endpoints. It will periodically send HTTP requests to the selected URL and when it starts receiving errors, it will send you a notification.<p>The whole service is hosted on Digital Ocean costing about 45$ per month. It consists of PostgreSQL managed database (15$), two web servers (2x5$) behind a load balancer (10$), and two worker servers (2x5$) used for sending monitoring requests. CloudFront for hosting CSS files and SES for sending notification emails.<p>I&#x27;m using maybe a little bit boring stack - Java and Spring Boot. Plus Tailwind CSS library for styling. Worker service is using a scheduling library to trigger monitoring requests at regular intervals (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kagkarlsson&#x2F;db-scheduler" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kagkarlsson&#x2F;db-scheduler</a>). Payments are integrated with Paddle service (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paddle.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paddle.com&#x2F;</a>).<p>Please check it out and let me know what you think. I would be happy to hear any comments or ideas for improvement.<p>If you think about any feature that may be useful for you, send me an email. I may be able to build it.<p>Thank you very much!<p>Robert')
