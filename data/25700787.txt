United States). It has no relation to actual violence, and is in fact a fantastic example of how “harm” by speech can be abused by a malicious government to jail people for what should be protected speech.<p>It’s no longer good law, thank goodness. Now we have the <i>much</i> narrower Brandenburg test, which requires that speech be likely to cause “imminent lawless action”.')
