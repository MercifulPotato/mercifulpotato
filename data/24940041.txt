The choice of license impacts this goal.<p>One could also make hand wavy arguments about more use leading to better software. That&#x27;s certainly the case for much of my code. If fewer people used it, it might not have improved as much as it has. (Obviously &quot;more use&quot; is not the <i>only</i> path to better software! And it does not guarantee improvements either.)<p>I can say that without a doubt, if I had released, for example, ripgrep under the AGPLv3, far fewer people would be using it today.')
