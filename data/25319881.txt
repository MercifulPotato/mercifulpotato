Like SQL, make is an integral part of the programming world ... that most people want as little as possible to do with and which some people violently hate and a few people enjoy playing with.<p>And I think this shows language that just tell the computer &quot;what you want&quot; and not how to get that something tend to not scale with the length of the command or the amount of data processed.
