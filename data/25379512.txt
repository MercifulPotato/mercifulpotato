From the article: &quot;Jonathan Porter, a vice president and general manager at the private forecasting firm AccuWeather, warns that the agency’s proposed solution would harm the timeliness and accuracy of forecasts and severe weather warnings. He said the collection, processing and distribution of weather information are the agency’s “most important services.”&quot;<p>Apparently not getting all that NWS weather data for free and then being abl to use it in their commercial weather forecasts would put a bit of a dent in their business model. Actually, I think commercial organisations like AccuWeather probably be the main ones affected; ordinary end users aren&#x27;t going to be requesting large quantities of data.')
