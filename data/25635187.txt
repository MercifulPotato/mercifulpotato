Item(by='vidarh', descendants=None, kids=[25635920], score=None, time=1609782917, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25634443, text='&gt; Consider that if I were to walk through London wearing a teeshirt emblazoned with “Atheist” I’d be perfectly safe. I suspect doing the same in many US towns or cities might result in assault - contrast “liberties” with “effective freedoms”.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, political free speech is pretty much absolute in the UK - it’s citizens putting the boot in to each other in public that tends to attract Police interest in keeping the peace.<p>While I have a lot of sympathy for your argument about effective freedoms vs. de jure liberties, someone <i>was</i> stopped and told to cover up her &quot;fuck Boris&quot; t-shirt by police in London not that long ago[1]. (Though, while I consider the stop ridiculous, at the same time at least the officers in question otherwise conducted themselves calmly)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;uk&#x2F;home-news&#x2F;boris-johnson-tshirt-police-black-lives-matter-protest-a9549911.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;uk&#x2F;home-news&#x2F;boris-johnso...</a>')
