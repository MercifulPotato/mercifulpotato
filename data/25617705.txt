The only accounts left are LinkedIn, HN and Reddit. (I use them for professional&#x2F;intellectual reasons so I doubt I will delete them)<p>- I no longer keep phone next to me while sleeping.<p>- blocked access to all &quot;news&quot; websites- cnn, fb, twitter<p>I had been been on journey to digital detox anyways (disabled all notifications everywhere etc) but getting rid of social media definitely felt better than anything else.')
