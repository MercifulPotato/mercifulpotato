I dug it up, seems to be this post: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;redsismicadepuertorico&#x2F;photos&#x2F;a.10150181523721108&#x2F;10159028057111108" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;redsismicadepuertorico&#x2F;photos&#x2F;a.101...</a><p>&gt; The Puerto Rico Seismic Network (PRSN) is saddened to learn about the collapse at the Arecibo Radiotelescope Observatory this morning of December 1st, 2020. PRSNâ€™s seismic station AOPR, located within the premises of the observatory, detected the timing of the failure. This seismic station has been a long collaboration between PRSN and the Arecibo Observatory. Here we publish the seismic record of AOPR at the time of collapse, which coincidentally occurred during the passage of seismic waves through Puerto Rico from a Dominican Republic earthquake of M4.0 that occurred at 07:51 AM AST. The figure below shows 07:52:42 AM AST (11:52:42 UTC) as the exact time of collapse at the AOPR seismic station, denoted by a sharp impulsive signal, right after the arrival of the S wave of the earthquake. It is a sad day for Science and a tragedy to lose such an important, iconic, valuable, and unique scientific instrument and allowed so many scientific advances and discoveries to humanity.<p>That facebook post is waaaay better than what I as a layman was able to come up in the post above. We made both posts at the same time though, so I couldn&#x27;t know any better.<p>Also thanks for posting the link to the video, it&#x27;s precisely the kind of breakdown I like :).')
