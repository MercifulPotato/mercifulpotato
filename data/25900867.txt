The magic happens when we call them all one, give it a symbol, and make them all equal. Now &quot;one&quot; has a unique existence of its own on a piece of paper on a mathematicians desk, scribbled alongside other unique symbols, whose relationships come complete with proofs. And the only question then is whether what was scribbled says something true, as in, something that aligns with the reality it came from, because that would make it useful.<p>Math is a map. Maps are only real insofar as being a map, and only useful insofar as being true.<p>The drawing of the streets may be drawn with your pencil from memory, but the truth your friend relies on to get them where they need to go is real. The paper and pencil are real. And the physics of the informative truth that transcends from the streets to the paper is also real. Computers are the machines we&#x27;ve built based on the physics of logic, abstraction, and meaning. A computational value is something that means something to something else.')
