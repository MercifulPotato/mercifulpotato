Then at the destination end, have your choice of RTSP client&#x2F;stream-receiving software pulling the video feed.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=ffmpeg+rtsp+stream" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=ffmpeg+rt...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aler9&#x2F;rtsp-simple-server" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aler9&#x2F;rtsp-simple-server</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.mistserver.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;71&#x2F;An+introduction+to+encoding+and+pushing+with+ffmpeg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.mistserver.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;71&#x2F;An+introduction+to+encod...</a><p>Some of the back end software pieces to do it are not very dissimilar from a typical &#x27;zoneminder&#x27; install on amd64 debian. Yeah I edited that in after I forgot to include it before hitting the post button...<p>on something like a raspberry pi 3b+ or 4 you might get good results by using a video frame rate around 5fps. Or even if you went down to 2-3fps that would be functionally equivalent to a constant stream of still images, depending on what the stream is needed for. If it were a security camera that needs to see peoples&#x27; faces the frame rate could be too low, a moving person might pass through the frame without any good shots of their face.<p>If you have lots of network bandwidth you can do a great deal with ffmpeg by not transcoding the video from the format it&#x27;s acquired from, which is very helpful on systems with limited CPU power.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.mistserver.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;71&#x2F;An+introduction+to+encoding+and+pushing+with+ffmpeg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.mistserver.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;71&#x2F;An+introduction+to+encod...</a>')
