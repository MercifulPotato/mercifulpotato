Try to see what existing functionalities are there and how exactly the code is being executed line by line by putting debug points on the codebase.<p>2. Try to change the local codebase and see how the changes are affecting the application.<p>3. Whenever stuck - try your best to find out the errors and search for the solution for the errors present on the console. If facing more difficulty, better take help from seniors.<p>4.
