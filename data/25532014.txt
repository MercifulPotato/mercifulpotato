I&#x27;d encourage you to read briefly through [1] that I linked above, it shows why hooks are needed rather than just functions. Basically you&#x27;re passing state around in a Closure such that you can hook into life cycles from any part of the app. This means that I can create a self contained hook for something like making an animation for a component and making it usable for any component I want, rather than wrapping everything into an AnimationComponent just to get the lifecycle state. I can reuse this behavior anywhere else in the app.')
