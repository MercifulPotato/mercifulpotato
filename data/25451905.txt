Item(by='lwansbrough', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608174121, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25448807, text='&gt; hand tracking is a thing, and on its way to a user friendly input<p>Which is about where it was last time I checked in. Most VR games require use of controllers do they not? As long as you have cumbersome interfaces like handheld controllers or hand tracking that doesn&#x27;t handle occlusion you can&#x27;t maintain a suspension of disbelief. If it&#x27;s not clear why controllers are a negative, you&#x27;re not really getting what VR <i>should</i> be. I don&#x27;t criticize the PS5 for having a controller because the main focus of game consoles isn&#x27;t the display technology. The screen has succeeded as a timeless medium for bringing people into another world. It&#x27;s less awkward and cumbersome than VR, so it&#x27;s actually better at creating a virtual reality than an HMD.<p>&gt; 50% more pixels, for a device where pixel density is important for usability. A 25% ($100) price drop, in a device that is now significantly cheaper than gaming consoles.<p>Resolution is actually one of the least important aspects of VR (unless of course, the rest of the experience is so mediocre that it&#x27;s all people can focus on.) The breakthroughs in VR will come in the form of human interfacing improvements. Only once a device can truly understand your intent can it become believable. For as long as you have to hold a controller or think about how you interact with the device, VR will continue to be a gimmick. It&#x27;s a UX problem as much as it is a hardware problem, but the UX will be obvious once the hardware is solved.<p>&gt; &quot;nobody is buying these things&quot; appears to be incorrect, literally and directionally.<p>I guess it took the entire world sitting at home to get 3M people interested enough to buy the latest VR system. Cool. If it was actually what people wanted, everybody would be scrambling to get one. 3M says to me that it&#x27;s more of the same. I feel like I&#x27;ve taken a time machine to 2005, being told how great the latest Palm phone is while knowing the iPhone is just around the corner. Can&#x27;t you see that the technology just sucks compared to what it <i>should</i> be? Only once it <i>is</i> what it <i>should be</i> will it be what you want to believe it is today.<p>&gt; me and my friends haven&#x27;t bought one<p>Again, why would I buy a device I can&#x27;t use?')
