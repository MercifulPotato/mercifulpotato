The cooks and hosts make the same wage because the tips aren&#x27;t enough to make up the difference.  The waitstaff makes less because their tips are deducted from to pay the cooks and hosts.  The customer looses because they payed extra for their meal, but didn&#x27;t actually increase the wages of the people who made it and served them.<p>The only winner is the restaurant owners who get away with paying their staff less.')
