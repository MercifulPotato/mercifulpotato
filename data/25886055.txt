I shouldn&#x27;t take the bait but, hey, you played a GAME that was structured such that you&#x27;d have a 50&#x2F;50 shot of being right. Rather than assume that the balance of demographics in the photos were waited towards that game&#x27;s premise, 50&#x2F;50 split, you used your own biased heuristic and happened to get a good score. You happened to get a set of 10 that included no female language developers. I had a mixed set. 8 coin flips out of 10 of heads is not special. I had a heuristic too and I&#x27;m probably equally wrong about it meaning something. I&#x27;m being honest with myself, though.')
