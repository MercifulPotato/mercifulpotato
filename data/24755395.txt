Considering the sloppy bullshit that is the root cause of 95%+ security vulnerabilities today, I think talking about &quot;0 security&quot; bugs is a distorting strawman.<p>2. No one said no recalls. The issue here is Microsoft is going after the exploiter rather than the bug, taking the law into their own hands over dubious pretenses.<p><pre><code>  That&#x27;s somewhere in between taking the drivers licenses of Corvair owners and recalling the Corvairs themselves. (We could make a better anology if a black hat actor triggered the car defect.)\n</code></pre>\n3. This could easily be precedent for scenario:<p><pre><code>  1. Security researcher finds bug and discloses it\n  2. Big crop declines to pay up &#x2F; doesn&#x27;t fix in timely manner, etc.\n  3. Security researcher goes public\n  4. Malware is made with exploit\n  5. Big corp goes vigilante on malware like this *and* sues security researcher, using this trademark justification in *both* cases.</code></pre>')
