Item(by='CoolGuySteve', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612192654, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25988022, text='I&#x27;m not necessarily a fan of your tone, seems pretty shrill.<p>But at Apple we were well aware that accessibility features like subtitles were often used by people with no disabilities.  We would add stuff knowing that all sorts of people would find uses for it.<p>I can easily imagine a language tag would also be useful for filtering out a German-language gemini for instance.<p>This was a double edges sword however.  Like with subtitles, we knew that many people using them that had hearing issues were older and also likely had out of date glasses prescriptions.<p>But this didn&#x27;t stop the AppleTV designers from lowering the contrast of the font by displaying it over a transparent background, lowering the font size, and removing the position text component that indicated who was speaking.<p>All of these choices were made to appease people without disability who were using the feature for whatever reason.  I didn&#x27;t like it.')
