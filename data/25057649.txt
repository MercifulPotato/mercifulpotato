Once a user pointed this out to me, the next release fixed the underlying issue in a better way. After years in which the Debian folks didn&#x27;t file an issue or report the problem in any way that I could tell.<p>the maintainer made an error there. did you open a bugreport that you fixed it so the patch is not necessary?<p>&gt; And to be fair, I think this rather depends a lot on the downstream package maintainer; I&#x27;ve witnessed this with other projects where they were quite good in interacting with upstream to get something sorted out. I am not really sure if any policy Debian&#x2F;Fedora&#x2F;... could enact would really help with it; people can (accidentally or intentionally) ignore them.<p>yeah and that&#x27;s the point. people in this thread (not you as far as i see) say they do not trust debian because of this, but other distributors and packagers? do they have technical or organisatorial fences for avoiding such mishaps? if not, then other distributions are as problematic as debian, even arch.<p>debian did a whole lotta good for Free software and i really start to dislike how people shit on the project (again not you).')
