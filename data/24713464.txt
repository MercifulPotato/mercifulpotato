It&#x27;s a bunch of straightforward questions, a pretty high bar for how many you need to answer, and so it&#x27;s pretty random how many of them you mess up, so it&#x27;s kind of like a die roll to get a job. I had a <i></i>really<i></i> bad interview at a peer company once, and I&#x27;m well aware how it goes.<p>But I kind of miss the old Google where you DID need to be a genius. I interviewed with Google probably around the year 2000, and there was a genuinely hard ball packing problem. I&#x27;m kind of curious what happened. Anyone who could answer that question would find this one trivial -- and not just the dynamic programming solution, but the O(log n) one which apparently no one at Google (or even applying to Google) noticed.<p>What I hate about Google is that everyone there still <i>thinks</i> they&#x27;re a genius. In 2000, it felt okay, since for the most part, they actually were. Today, it&#x27;s kind of obnoxious.')
