Last time I tried, I got the correct answer after about forty minutes or so. I could get it down with practice, but it doesn&#x27;t matter-- I think slower than I type. That&#x27;s a no hire. The point of the interview is to hire extremely talented engineers, not engineers as talented as me.<p>The humor is so thick in that paragraph that you could cut it with a knife.')
