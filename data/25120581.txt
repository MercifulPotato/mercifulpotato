I tried to be as comprehensive as possible, but a lot of these don&#x27;t have much mental overhead at all. For example, I&#x27;ve forgotten and rediscovered squoosh multiple times when looking up how to compress images — and the extent of my use is basically dragging an image into the browser and maybe fiddling with the settings a bit.<p>On the other hand, maybe this is a testament to how many moving parts there really are in an app like this. I do try to keep things as simple as possible, but there&#x27;s definitely a minimum possible complexity — every web app <i>will</i> need a DNS provider, a web host, a database, etc.')
