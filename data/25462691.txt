Many things I want to do, are just not possible on the average machine (but thats the bonus from developing on average hardware, you find out about that early on).<p>I still dream of a voxel sandbox gameengine with integrated chemistry and physics. There are quite some projects promised that years ago, but apparently it is not yet possible with todays hardware. Maybe soon?')
