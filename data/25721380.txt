Or, if not based on GTK they will use whatever other file picker their toolkit provided.<p>Well, not really. Anymore.<p>Recently (give or take few years), toolkits and applications started to use desktop portal - mainly as a preparation for sandboxing (i.e. putting the app inside flatpak &amp; co). The application, optionally inside sandbox, doesn&#x27;t use the framework&#x27;s common dialog - because that would not give it access to files outside sandbox - but talks to the desktop provided one via dbus.<p>That desktop provided one does not have to be implemented by the framework that the application uses. It is implemented by the DE that the user chooses.')
