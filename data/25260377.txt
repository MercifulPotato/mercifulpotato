But this would be less than 1% of the 10,000km of the salar. Factories aren&#x27;t very attractive, but enormous dunes of lithium-depleted salt might even be pretty. A matter of taste, let&#x27;s say, but again, the great majority of the landscape would be untouched.<p>It would also create some subsidence, I imagine. But this wouldn&#x27;t be visible.<p>And this must be balanced against the great good to humanity which is realized by the enormous amount of lithium batteries which could be manufactured with this resource.<p>I&#x27;d say this is worth persuading the Bolivian people to accept, and isn&#x27;t worth overthrowing their government over. But I don&#x27;t get to make these decisions, alas.')
