But then I learned that the Oxford trials PCR-tested every participant regularly, while the Pfizer and Moderna trials only tested participants that were showing symptoms. So there&#x27;s a very real chance that behind that ~95% number the mRNA vaccines also had asymptomatic cases that were never discovered during trials, and the actual protection is nearly the same as the Oxford one. The mRNA vaccines still seem like a great leap forward, and they don&#x27;t come with the potential complications of resistance to the vector virus that adenovirus-based vaccines do - but I&#x27;m less sure now that they actually offer better protection overall.')
