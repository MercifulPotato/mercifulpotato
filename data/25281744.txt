The source may be the President of the United States, but they&#x27;re still reporting what the source told them, because they weren&#x27;t there they don&#x27;t know they didn&#x27;t see it with their own eyes. They just know what they were told and so they quote that.<p>It&#x27;s a principle, and sometimes principles look funny but the point is you always do it... on principle.')
