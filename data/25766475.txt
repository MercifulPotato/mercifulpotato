Looking at their income statement [1] DropBox is not a very efficient company:<p>Cost Of Revenues: $413.7M (22%) in software companies this includes Operations and customer care. There are spending as much as video sharing sites or video conferencing app.<p>R&amp;D Expenses: $727.8M (39%). This is an insanely high number for a company that is not a startup. The average for bigger companies is below 20%.<p>If their growth doesn&#x27;t recover, which will be difficult, they are going to be a prime target for acquisition from Private equity.
