I can&#x27;t look it up unless I know it exists. With flash cards, I am reminded that it exists every once in a while.<p>As an example, here&#x27;s a simple card: What is the recommended way to traverse all the files (including subdirectories) in Python?<p>Answer: scandir and <i>not</i> os.walk<p>os.walk is my standard goto. Then I learned about scandir, but kept forgetting that there was a better alternative to os.walk. So I made a card for it.<p>The other answer, of course, is speed. If I&#x27;m going to Google &quot;what is the alternative to os.walk?&quot; or something similar every time I need it, it adds a lot of friction and I simply won&#x27;t bother. And no, I don&#x27;t do this often enough that looking it up each time will force it to become ingrained.<p>And frankly, when you do math&#x2F;physics, you do need a number of concepts in your head. Solving a complex problem requires multiple parts&#x2F;stages, and solving requires you to have them in your head so you can put them together. My biggest mistake when I was in grad school was thinking I could get by <i>without</i> memorizing. It worked fine for undergrad level math, but it was a real problem when I took higher level courses. The professors were split on whether memorizing is a good idea, but the fact is the professors used this stuff a lot more than I did.')
