I recently built a &quot;StumbleUpon for eCommerce stores&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.shiny.sale&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.shiny.sale&#x2F;</a>) and did quite a bit of research trying to find a good screenshot API. I eventually settled on ApiFlash.<p>I would definitely use this once I got into editorial content. I have a few suggestions for your homepage though:<p>1. The 3 steps you outline are still too vague, especially step 3 (&quot;upload it to your blog post&quot;). Makes it sound like this will be one of my main images. I&#x27;d suggest some more detailed instructions for different blog platforms.<p>2. Is there no API or other way to auto-generate an image? If not, I&#x27;d suggest that be your next feature.<p>3. One of the examples (BBC) I generated resulted in a 3.3MB PNG file. You maybe want to provide some better compression&#x2F;minification options for people. You definitely shouldn&#x27;t be creating high-res PNGs when images are involved.<p>4. It was also 2400x1260 which doesn&#x27;t qualify as a &quot;Thumbnail&quot; IMO. You may want to generate files closer to the preferred social specs. Twitter, for example, wants files &lt; 5MB and don&#x27;t need to be anywhere near that big[1].<p>Anyway, hope that is helpful feedback. Great idea and MVP. Keep it up!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.twitter.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;docs&#x2F;twitter-for-websites&#x2F;cards&#x2F;overview&#x2F;summary-card-with-large-image" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.twitter.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;docs&#x2F;twitter-for-websites&#x2F;c...</a>')
