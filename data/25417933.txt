Realistic options would be &quot;a good-quality public option available at the federal level&quot;, or &quot;single payer&quot; healthcare where the government becomes the single main insurer, at least for basic preventative care and emergencies, or some other policy that ensures there is a &quot;social safety net&quot; in place that includes access to modern healthcare.<p>Sanders misjudgment about Venezuela is a valid criticism, but let&#x27;s stop with the Red Scare rhetoric about <i>socializing</i> things. If we were going to <i>socialize</i> something, we would be talking about directly worker-owned enterprises. Ironically, that might actually be much better than just having the government run everything.<p>Also, you have deluded yourself if somehow you don&#x27;t already think the US government is an abusive beast that exists in large part to create and maintain power for itself. Is healthcare really the straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back? Is the government really that much worse than a private corporation that has almost no exposure to market forces? I can&#x27;t exactly vote for the CEO of Aetna.<p>I think many people would be open to something other than &quot;medicare for all&quot;, but so far that is the only serious public proposal that achieves the goal of ensuring access to modern, humane healthcare for all Americans.')
