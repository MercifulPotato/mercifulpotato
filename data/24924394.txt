What I was trying to convey is that reducing new emissions to ~0 is a necessary win condition. It&#x27;s not optional...and it&#x27;s also <i>urgent</i> because those emissions <i>reproduce</i>. We&#x27;re going to have to cut emissions to 0 <i>anyway</i>, so the sooner we do so, the better...by a LOT.<p>And besides being urgent, it&#x27;s also something that we know how to do. As in, today. We have the technology! (It&#x27;s called massive carbon taxes). Or at least we&#x27;re much closer technologically than we are to any sort of clean, insanely efficient sequestration tech.<p>Perhaps this is obvious to you, but if you read the replies to my comment you&#x27;ll see a number of replies where the tenor is &quot;it&#x27;s impossible to enact carbon taxes to reduce our emissions so let&#x27;s work on sequestration instead.&quot;')
