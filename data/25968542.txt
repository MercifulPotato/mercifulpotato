The UK and US have administered 12 and 8 respectively.<p>The EU treated this like a procurement exercise, fussing over price and process and not buying sufficiently diverse portfolio.<p>UK and US treated this  like an emergency. Every day of lockdown costs close to total vaccines expenditure, so they moved fast.<p>Now the EU is scapegoating a company that is producing the vaccine at cost, faster than other firms, because it is more advanced in its separate UK supply chain, that was established and approved to start distribution months ahead of EU.<p>Saying the EU process was different so it is understandable that it took longer, because it saved some cost or saved some duplication of procurement energy is missing the point. This is a disaster. The only thing that matters is speed!<p>Spiegel&#x27;s article is not a &#x27;lie&#x27;.')
