Just look at your typical npm package description, it is not XML, yet you would never be able to write it by hand. For sufficient complexity, XML is quite good and human parseable.<p>Also, it simply doesn’t matter. Noone writes 344 hello world projects. What may be missing (but is there with spring boot for example) is an auto-generator for projects.')
