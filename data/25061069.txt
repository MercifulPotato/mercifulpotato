It leads to most of the published work following very safe and boring research directions that everybody else is already working on. There is less scientific progress as a result. Contributing something that is useful and novel is often not rewarded. Risking yourself exploring a new branch of your field is very dangerous for your career. In my own biased opinion, about 90-95% of published papers are contributing nothing new to the field.')
