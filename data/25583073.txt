I feel like the positive fake reviews are all 5 stars (based on what the little notes I get in my Amazon packages, the vendors will only reward you for 5 star reviews) and I&#x27;m guessing the negative fake reviews are all 1 star.  So that leaves those reviews in the middle as the only ones worth paying attention to.')
