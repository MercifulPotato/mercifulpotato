I have friends that were pushed to learn a musical instrument. They hated being pushed as a kid but as an adult they are so happy to have been pushed. My father was a musician but his POV was unless I showed an interest he didn&#x27;t push. I&#x27;m jealous of those who got pushed.<p>Similarly I have American friends that speak a 2nd language because their parents forced them to go to language school on the weekends. As kids they hated not being able to go play on Saturdays like their friends but as adults the love speaking the 2nd language. Conversely I have a friend who&#x27;s parents sent him to language school but around 11 or 12yrs old he complained enough they let him stop. He still regrets it to this day.<p>I have no clue where the balance is but I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s 100% only do it if the kids want to side of the meter.')
