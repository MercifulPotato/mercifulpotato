Email makes me sad.<p>I&#x27;ve brought a <i>tiny</i> bit of sanity to my Outlook inbox [0] by using many, many rules. The goal is to move an email out of my Inbox and to a folder of my choosing on receipt. I hit about 80%. (And every week or so I update the rules to try to capture more of the 20%. But the goalposts constantly move.)<p>I then use a search folder to show &quot;all unread messages&quot;, group the view by &quot;in folder&quot;, and treat that as my inbox. (It still shows messages in the actual Inbox.)<p>I find this very useful in removing some of the cognitive load of email.<p>Before:<p>- 10 emails arrive in Inbox.<p>- Email 1 is about project x. You figure that out, switch mental context to project x, action it perhaps, move on.<p>- Email 2 is about project y. You figure that out, switch mental context to project y, file it, move on.<p>- etc.<p>After:<p>- All (most) of the email regarding project x is filtered to the project x folder.<p>- When I choose to, I go there and do things.<p>- I never have to cognitively switch out of &#x27;project x mode&#x27; until I choose to.<p>Setting up and maintaining the rules is a pain in the ass, and Outlook fights you at every turn. But for me it&#x27;s 100% worth the effort.<p>[0]: Corporate environment, so it&#x27;s not like I can use any of these funky cloud services. It&#x27;s what I got.')
