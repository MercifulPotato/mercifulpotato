It&#x27;s extremely cathartic to know there are enough people who hate the language as much as I do, even if we are stuck with it for any number of good reasons.<p>All of the reasons we&#x27;re stuck with it related to datascience and scientific computing are the exact reasons why we hate it. It&#x27;s exceptionally fast to write code that does a very specific task without sparing a single solitary thought for any sort of software development best practices. It&#x27;s incredibly approachable, which means it can be used by any keen scientific or mathematical minds who spend more time reading and writing whitepapers than they do writing code.  The code, as an entity in and of itself, clearly shows that.  But the _output_ of that code also shows that, which is why it isn&#x27;t going to go away or be swapped out for anything else.<p>This is like the ideal breeding ground for further scientific or academic pursuits, and since everyone is standing on the shoulders of numpy&#x2F;scipy&#x2F;sklearn&#x2F;pytorch-esquian giants, you&#x27;re stuck in the scenario of having to replicate all of these libraries in <i>any</i> other language.  I can&#x27;t honestly say it&#x27;s worth the effort to replace the entire stack, and it&#x27;s also not going to help when these same researchers continue to use python going forward and start using some other library that you didn&#x27;t port yet.<p>And so, they will continue pumping out new papers and prototypes-masquerading-as-quality-libraries, and we&#x27;ll continue roping them in and duct taping fix after fix after fix on this kaleidoscope of horrors and we&#x27;ll continue self medicating to dull the daily frustration of python while also accepting that it&#x27;s the price we&#x27;re going to need to pay if we want to work with these brilliant minds with all their neat new ideas pushing forth such a breadth of new understanding from the data _we already have_.  Or at least that&#x27;s what we say when we try to ignore the growing bald spot and bursts of incandescent rage every time we get a &quot;quick script that needs a little polish&quot; that clocks in at 2000 loc and literally doesn&#x27;t have a single function definition in it and variable names that identify up to 14 different types depending on some global state and...<p>You know, I&#x27;m going to stop typing this.  It&#x27;s christmas eve and I wasn&#x27;t planning on being this angry today<p>Edit: Some people weren&#x27;t liking this, it may be because they think I&#x27;m being sarcastic when I talk about these brilliant people. I want to just clarify - I am not being sarcastic. They ARE brilliant. They&#x27;re far more intelligent than I, and they&#x27;re really pushing the boundaries of human understanding in mathematics and sciences. I acknowledge they&#x27;re bring a whole hell more good to the table than they are bad, and there&#x27;s a damn good reason why I am going to be doing this thing I&#x27;m doing in perpetuity, or until I can&#x27;t handle it anymore.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t mean their coding practices aren&#x27;t often _abysmal_, and I won&#x27;t apologize for my frustrations in this and the language that just _lets_ them do it.')
