When one side has the support of the ruling party, you need some sort of way to rally people and, sadly, politicizing issues is the quickest way out. Many of their calls, which you summarized in an unflattering way, are also about making sure that CO2 emissions aren&#x27;t encouraged and basically not allowed. Having a tax isn&#x27;t going to stop them so people are calling for radical solutions. Is that a good thing? I&#x27;d say no but it&#x27;s better than denying it or saying the problem is overblown, like many seem to. I&#x27;d rather people worry too much than not at all.')
