The fact it may sexually excite some people mistreating dogs is not really relevant...<p>You&#x27;ve missed the point. If you kill puppies to make a movie denouncing dog mistreatment, the puppies are dead.<p>If you exploit children to make a movie denouncing exploiting children, the children are still exploited.<p>It has nothing to do with the subjective reception of the film at all.<p>Specifically to this point, the actresses that played the young girls in the film all auditioned in front of the director, doing the sexually explicit dances behind closed doors, along with many others that didn&#x27;t get the part. The creator of the film was a victim of sexual exploitation like this at a younger age.<p>Additionally, it is very common for victims of various traumas to inflict those traumas on others, and it&#x27;s also common for them to be in denial about their motives for victimizing new victims in the same way they were victimized themselves.')
