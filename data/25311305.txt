Item(by='mactrey', descendants=None, kids=[25311969], score=None, time=1607137339, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25310443, text='That&#x27;s true, I generally don&#x27;t care about the welfare of apple sellers, and I&#x27;ll take a deal when I see one.<p>But, and I hate to stretch this analogy to its breaking point, it&#x27;s more like the overwhelming majority of Americans are apple sellers (read: wage laborers) and they have no way to achieve basic human rights like food, shelter, and baseline medical care without selling their apples. And they can only sell to one buyer at a time as part of an apple contract (employment contract) and if that buyer decides to stop buying from them (&quot;restructuring&quot;), which the buyer may do at any time (right-to-work laws), our apple seller has to go looking for another buyer (job search) which can take months all while their savings dwindle...<p>So you can see why some people might think this is not the optimal way to structure a society. Or to just put the analogy in its coffin, they might see this situation as more complicated than just a few apple-buyers getting a bargain.')
