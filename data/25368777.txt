The partisanship system does affect even active member&#x27;s of the US government and this does seem to be a partisan issue driven solely by politics.<p>&gt;Perhaps you should extend your inquiry, and ask how it is that much of one party and its leader are demanding that an election be overturned or declared invalid, using a variety of extremely tenuous arguments.<p>Then the other party should counter those arguments and wait for things to resolve as they will. This will happen whatever the average person believes. The election will be decided by the electoral college, or possibly the courts if any of those lawsuits end up having substance. People posting videos about anything won&#x27;t change this.<p>&gt;Please consider that these demands originate with people who have also demanded tech companies be stripped of legal immunity for content publication and regularly expresses a wish to sue media outlets out of existence, topics which seem to have earned little discussion on HN.<p>The section 230 issue seems like a separate issue being spun as a response to this issue in ways that make no logical sense. But are being pushed as a response to actions like these. I don&#x27;t support the repeal of this, but I do think this kind of obvious, government urged censorship is good either.<p>I didn&#x27;t like when trump went on about fake news and I don&#x27;t like when the other side of the government goes on about misinformation. I don&#x27;t believe the government, either side, should be the arbiters of what is real news or real information.<p>When this happens, all the average person is left with is state sponsored propaganda.')
