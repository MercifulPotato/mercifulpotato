Platforms have valid civil liability concerns with or without Section 230.<p>Nobody banned &quot;conservative twitter.&quot; They banned the people who have been whipping up the gullible and stupid with unfounded conspiracy theories and outright lies. Alternate realities are bad but tolerated until they lead to violence. Meghan McCain is still on twitter. Her husband, a Federalist founder, is still on twitter. There are plenty of conservatives who are still there.<p>Pretending that they banned a political philosophy is hilariously disingenuous.')
