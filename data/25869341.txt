There’s a reason that through the 90s and 2000s serious developers routinely ignored spending significant time optimizing code because the hardware doubled the speed of ALL code every ~12-18 months. So even though there are low-hanging fruit for software optimization, such low-hanging fruit can be missing from already heavily optimized code (eg games, scientific computations etc) and is orders of magnitude more expensive than “run this on newer HW for faster perf”. If you can do this “transparently” (max some OS&#x2F;compiler integration and you can use the new Hw for perf wins), then the cost economics are powerful. If it’s a special-purpose piece of HW then it gets trickier and will be relegated to accelerating certain memory-heavy programs (like GPUs accelerate certain kinds of mass-data algorithms).')
