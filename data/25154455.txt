Is this different from the normal understanding of free speech?  Because I haven&#x27;t actually said anything about &quot;free speech&quot; other than quoting Jack Dorsey.<p>While I do believe in the necessity of freedom of speech (not just the first amendment, but a particular set of cultural values) those abstract values <i>aren&#x27;t</i> my primary concern here.  My concerns (across the various tech platforms out there) are:<p>* the disruption to peoples&#x27; businesses that result from the opaque and largely incontestable content moderation process.  This is mainly a concern where the content in question does not violate either the law nor the TOS.<p>* The exploitation of consumers through the gradual degradation of privacy.<p>* The attempts to undermine consumer rights by removing users&#x27; options for legal remedy in the TOS<p>Basically, if users&#x27; are providing value to these platforms through advertising revenue, mine-able private information, transaction fees, etc. what expectations can the users&#x27; have with regard to the value they receive and how they are treated by the platforms?  I do not think the answer of &quot;nothing&quot; is acceptable.')
