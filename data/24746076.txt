Not read the paper yet, but plan to.<p>Reversibility is important in quantum computing. Quantum circuits must transform input to output in a &quot;unitary&quot; manner, which is reversible. If you consider the input to output as a linear transformation matrix (with complex values), then the complex conjugate of the matrix gives the &quot;inverse function&quot;.<p>This is probably useless info, but reversibility in the classical sense is also interesting due to the energy bounds of computation. The Landauer limit (kTln2) [1] gives a lower bound of energy that must be dissipated to destroy one bit of information in a computation. A reversible calculation does not destroy bits.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Landauer%27s_principle" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Landauer%27s_principle</a>')
