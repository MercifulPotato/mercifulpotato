How to light a fire under my butt?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I feel like I&#x27;m in a somewhat odd predicament with motivation here. Like a lot of people today, I&#x27;ve been on the job search most of this year due to not having a job. But this current trend for me started a few years ago, well before Covid hit.<p>My career started by working contract after contract for a few years, then jobs dried up around 5 years ago. No longer able to support myself I moved in back with one of my parents. Meanwhile I continued to search for jobs including full-time ones. Considering all this, though, I think I am stuck in a job search &quot;trance&quot;. Even though I barely have enough money for myself, with only small contract gigs (and ineligible for unemployment insurance) I am living comfortably with my family. I have no obligation to pay rent because the place is so cheap. My parents only care that I run errands for them. Job searching doesn&#x27;t get brought up often unless I mention something about it.<p>My parents don&#x27;t come from a lot of money- far from it. I grew up in a low-income household and paid my way through college with loans and Pell grands. My parents just managed to do a good job saving enough for retirement after their steady careers. So that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m dealing with.<p>As for me, I continue working on different projects to keep my work skills relevant. I participate in networking events and get mock interviews. But seems like I&#x27;m not pushing myself hard enough. The comfort of a free roof over my head is working against me without me realizing it for so long.<p>Being supported by my parents and my lukewarm opportunities appear to go hand in hand. So how do I boost this motivation when I have this warm, comfortable safety net? Seems like I have to really go cold turkey and live like a bum on the street or inside my car, but is that too drastic? Being homeless might actually look worse to employers as well.')
