Compared it with pretty much all the other options I found out there. The experience it&#x27;s just so much better.<p>I fully recommend you try it - it&#x27;s awesome.<p>All that&#x27;s left which I want are dark mode mainly and maybe a cheaper alternative to more powerful GPU &#x2F; something along those line. Tho, with the long-running tasks I don&#x27;t really mind.<p>Great job and congrats on launching!')
