Hydrogen is just too energy inefficient from an end-to-end efficiency perspective.<p>Lithium-ion achieves a 80%+ efficiency from energy input to usage via an AC motor, or more if DC is usable. Hydrogen fuel cells only achieve 40-60% efficiency, and that’s just one step (converting it back from storage to electric energy, not even the motor itself). No matter how much is being invested, this can’t just be wished away and effects how expensive something is per kWh.<p>On top of that, there’s a massive Li-ion R&amp;D and production train already under way that will be hard if not impossible to catch up with.<p>In short, right now it looks like this will only be useful for a few edge cases that battery electric can’t feasibly support.')
