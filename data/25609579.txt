That is not up to HR, and if a &quot;situation&quot; arises it&#x27;s too late anyways. Good interpersonal conditions are up to all persons and especially management. HR is just there as an executive, to sweep up the broken cutlery and make things look nice and tidy.<p>It isn&#x27;t that an HR department doesn&#x27;t want good working conditions. They are just in no position to impose them, only management is.')
