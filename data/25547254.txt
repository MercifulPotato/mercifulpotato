Why on earth carry out such a possible PR disaster before the face of your enemy’s intelligence services (and its many eyes)?<p>Maybe things didn’t go as planned or maybe some people intentionally broke Saudi Protocol, either for grinding an axe with Kashoggi or to harm MBS.<p>Something underreported is the role of Kashoggi: He is not just some mere dissident Saudi reporter. He was part of the uppermost Saudi classes, next in rank right after the royal family. A fact which explains how someone gets to make a journalism career inside of Saudi Arabia whilst criticizing domestic politics.  And how a dissident journalist could be a multi millionaire.<p>It also explains why Kashoggi was an Islamist and fervent member of the\nmuslim brotherhood. The religious mantle of the brotherhood serves as a tool of power for Saudi‘s upper class to overthrow the only layer above them.<p>The Brotherhood claims to speak in the name of religious freedom and democracy. They are the ones who demonstrate for free elections, but when they win the first of those elections they immediately proceed to cancel all further elections. Just see Egypt or Hamas. Or go see Turkey, which rulers are, alas, Muslim Brotherhood.<p>Which is where the link between Kashoggi and its place of death comes full circle: He was best friends with Brotherhood-Brother, President of Turkey, Erdogan.<p>A mere „dissident“ doesn’t get to be friends with the world’s most prolific „Brother“. And he doesn’t just get murdered coincidentally in this Brother‘s backyard.<p>This is wild speculation but for me it is much more likely that Kashoggi was the sacrificial offering, to help further the Brotherhood‘s cause since prior to Kashoggi‘s death MBS went on a rampage against Saudi Arabia’s rebellious upper class. A class Bin Laden was part of and a class that if it would win power in Saudi Arabia, would change the Middle East power dynamics entirely.')
