Many actions during union strikes (e.g. not respecting a back-to-work legislation or picketing on company property) would fit the definition too, even if the only reason for the strike is disagreement over remuneration, i.e. <i>profit motive</i>. In fact, the Wikipedia article for civil disobedience has a picture of a union member on strike about to be arrested.')
