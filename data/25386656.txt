People that struggle the most with their partners during the pandemic seem to be people who need socialization to distract from their own relationship problems.<p>If two people can be &quot;alone together&quot; in a room for awhile, they can still refresh, and restore their energy. This allows them to be more supportive and close when they need socialization because they aren&#x27;t exhausted.<p>Loneliness is being forced to deal with your fear of being alone, without every taking the time to be comfortable being alone.')
