I&#x27;m fine with manufacturers making these products. I&#x27;m fine with new repertoire being written for them too. There&#x27;s just no getting around the fact: large hands are an advantage in piano music. If you can reach a 10th easily, that&#x27;s great. If you can reach an octave very easily, thats very great. If you can&#x27;t reach an octave easily, you will never master a large fraction of passages in Romantic and later music.<p>For instance, try playing the octaves in Nocturne Op 48 No 1 by Chopin with small hands...far harder!')
