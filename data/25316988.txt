So you&#x27;d be happy if every laptop manufacturer installed crypto-miners on a new laptop you purchased without telling you before purchasing the device with no way to remove it. \nIt&#x27;s no different than ads, they are using your resources without your explicit permission after the sale of the device to generate income for their company.<p>It&#x27;s madness to me that people find this acceptable. These companies are profiting off the ignorance of people and misleading customers on what they&#x27;re actually selling them.')
