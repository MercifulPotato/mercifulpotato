I&#x27;ve walked&#x2F;biked the city hundreds of times up and down from GGB to Stonestown and Dogpatch. Visited every nook and cranny of the city, tried living in different neighborhoods and I have always been sorely disappointed by the rampant crime and homelessness. I made life-long friends, attended tens of meetups from hiking, to biking and tech. Tasted food from all over the world, sailed on the bay, saw all the touristy and local spots. Day-tripped all over the bay and hours in every direction. Got an amazing workplace experience that is unlikely to be rivaled anywhere else in the world.<p>Yet, I can&#x27;t ignore it forever, I end up driving through downtown to get to Sausalito or eating at a nice restaurant while this person decides I am a demon and begins screaming at me while menacingly coming towards me.<p>I had my bike stolen from my garage, my car window broken and been threatened by a random person on the street.<p>You really think most people haven&#x27;t had enough of this? I tried my best to love SF despite all of it&#x27;s serious problems but after all these years it got to me and I have to leave, no matter how cheap it would be to stay.')
