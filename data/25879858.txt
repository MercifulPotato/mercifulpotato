I think they&#x27;ve built an interesting Reddit alternative with what appears to be a solid effort from a small team. I don&#x27;t mind topic-based communities that specifically state their goal is to promote an idea or a particular theme and banning off-topic content. If they create a general Politics community and then proceed to do that, yes, that would be hypocritical.<p>Facebook and Twitter have always branded themselves as trying to connect the world. And now they (along with other big tech cos) have grown actively hostile to the half of the U.S. at least that considers themselves conservative. That&#x27;s a big issue.')
