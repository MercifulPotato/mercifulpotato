There&#x27;s obviously something different, in all countries where the concept of intellectual property exists, between say an M8 bolt and a sculpture.<p>You can do whatever you want with the bolt. Measuring the treads and making 3D printed copies, taking photos off it and selling those. It&#x27;s yours to the fullest extent.<p>You can&#x27;t create and sell copies of the sculpture, in some jurisdictions you can&#x27;t even sell photos of the sculpture. You can&#x27;t freely make a derivative work of the sculpture.<p>Ownership of a copy of IP is different than ownership of other things. And ownership of digital copies of IP is so very different that it&#x27;s almost not a thing.')
