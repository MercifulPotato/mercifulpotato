I guess foreigners have a different understanding of what heritage means. Heritage doesn&#x27;t mean being conquered and&#x2F;or exchanging words, food, building, etc. Heritage implies &quot;descent&quot;. Just because you eat sushi doesn&#x27;t mean you and a japanese person have a common heritage. Just because native american buildings like the hogan are in the US doesn&#x27;t mean we share the same common heritage as native americans.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;study.com&#x2F;academy&#x2F;lesson&#x2F;native-american-houses-facts-types.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;study.com&#x2F;academy&#x2F;lesson&#x2F;native-american-houses-fact...</a><p>We specifically say they are native american homes, not &quot;american&quot; homes because even though the natives were conquered, their heritage is different from ours.')
