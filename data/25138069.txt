Except they double down on thinking they deserved that 30% if not more. ( Perfectly Fine )<p>Did not take hard stand against developers and thinking themselves as so righteous. ( Also Fine )<p>But then suddenly turn around and act like Santa to <i>Help</i> SME or smaller developers, when Apple are under pressure in <i>multiple</i> countries for their App Store policy.<p>May be Tim Cook did not realise, Apple has turned into hypocrite  just like Google did in their Do No Evil era.')
