The perception that it is somehow fraught with parser vulnerabilities comes from various implementations that tried to implement BER&#x2F;DER parser by transforming something more or less equivalent to ASN.1 grammar into actual parser code by means of C preprocessor macros, which is somewhat obviously wrong approach to the problem, at least in the security context.')
