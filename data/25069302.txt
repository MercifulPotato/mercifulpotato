That is BS of the highest order. There will always be someone who owns and controls everything. It&#x27;s just not going to be you.<p>You will own nothing, you will be worthless. You won&#x27;t even be able to have a girlfriend&#x2F;boyfriend or friends for that matter; real human relationships are reserved for the elites. You will get as many VR friends as you want though.<p>Already it&#x27;s kind of happening. Look at how many friends rich people have; a lot. Look at how many friends poor people have; very few.<p>Of course, they&#x27;re not real friends, but still more real than light projected into your eyeballs.')
