Even more so if you were to run on GKE (which I use and adore).<p>When not to use it is a tough question. If I was ever in charge of a company, kubernetes would be the only way of running my product that I would consider. I am a fan of kubernetes as I use it every day but I have also been on the other side of the fence. I have run production systems on bare metal, VMs, EC2 instances, etc. The operational burden of anything non-kube is too much and takes time away from solving big problems such as stability, scaling, deploy, monitoring and more.  The solutions to the problems become standard, boring and consistent.<p>I say the above as someone that spent over a year migrating an entire platform&#x2F;product from ECS to GKE. It is not perfect but so many silly day to day interruptions have been eliminated. Retired and broken instances are a thing of a past. Scaling is easy. Stability is easier.<p>Side effects of the move are that our Ops team is 1&#x2F;2 the size it was a year ago (attrition&#x2F;covid), we are running 3 times the number of product stacks for 1&#x2F;3rd the cost. I should really blog about that one!')
