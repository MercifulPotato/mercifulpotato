It is not at all acceptable for Twitter, Facebook, or any other third party to intercede and decide  for me that what they said was good or bad. That is my decision to make. The fact that so many people here are willing and eager to cede that authority to faceless, unaccountable corporations is frankly appalling.<p>&gt;If you owned a website that allowed public postings, would you ever consider yourself obligated to protect a member of the government&#x27;s speech in a way you do not for a normal user?<p>That&#x27;s an excellent point. This freedom of speech should indeed extend to everyone, not just government officials.')
