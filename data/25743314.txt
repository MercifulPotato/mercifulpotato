One difficulty with developing a vaccine for the common cold is there are at least 200 different viruses that can cause cold symptoms, including rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenoviruses, and parainfluenza.1<p>&gt; Rhinovirus makes up about 75% of colds. Still, there are more than 150 strains of it circulating at the same time.<p>&gt; At this time, there is currently no way for one vaccine to protect against all possible strains that can cause the common cold.<p>It also goes on to say it self-resolves and only causes mild illness.<p>So they potentially could find a vaccine that covers most, but I&#x27;m guessing would be a waste of resources.')
