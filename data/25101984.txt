A wingsuit can reduce these speeds dramatically. A vertical instantaneous velocity of 40 km&#x2F;h (25 mph) has been recorded. However the speed at which the body advances forward through the air is still much higher (up to 100 km&#x2F;h [62 mph]).</i><p>Even mentions another jetpowered attempt with hydrogen peroxide rockets reaching a horizontal speed of 160 mph, back in 2007.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wingsuit_flying" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wingsuit_flying</a>')
