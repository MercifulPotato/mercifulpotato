E.g. dating and the getting married, learning to dance and weight lifting, which helped with the dating and getting married.  Also, Toastmasters got me comfortable speaking my mind.<p>I also try to achieve my goals in the easiest, most direct way.  E.g. ask for a raise instead of wait to be given one, find the fastest way to finish the degree, use online dating, become Catholic to end the despair etc.  Also, ignore the haters, of which there will be many if you follow my advice.  But, there will also be more people that respect you for being direct and decisive.  That being said, don&#x27;t be a jerk, and use what you gain to benefit others, especially look out for those that get sidelined by society and give them a chance.')
