Maybe they are citing &quot;research numbers&quot; that they can do in a lab but aren&#x27;t production-ready yet. I would certainly assume they are citing &quot;compressed&quot; data figured there.<p>Also bear in mind that tapes typically store data striped across the tape in multiple tracks and multiple bands.  There are four bands per tape and 12-52 wraps per band, so reading the whole tape requires up to 208 passes across the tape.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Linear_Tape-Open#Physical_structure" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Linear_Tape-Open#Physical_stru...</a><p>But yes, to agree with another parallel comment, tape data rates are quite high sequentially (abysmal in random of course, but that&#x27;s not how they&#x27;re used).  LTO-8 does 750 megabytes per second compressed &#x2F; 360 megabytes per second raw.')
