It then discusses implications and conclusions based on unfounded claims.<p>Prove that the number of Nobel Prizes is a good indicator of scientific process.  It doesn’t even sound right when said aloud.<p>To refine the point:<p>The number of Nobel Prizes establishes a lower bound on the number of “Nobel Prize worthy discoveries”.  That bar is ill-defined and constantly moving.  What’s more is that many Nobel Prize worthy discoveries may not be awarded for a very long time.  If prizes stopped being given to current discoveries and are all given to discoveries in the 70s and 80s then does that say anything about the rate of scientific progress or even large discoveries?  No.  We don’t know, with the information presented, if it is from changes in the community.  What drives Nobel Prizes being awarded?  None of this is seriously looked at.  It’s the most important part of the article.')
