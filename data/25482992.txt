In my mind, it is proven. But, I&#x27;m not acting on that because I don&#x27;t find it worthwhile.<p>On the other hand, if a stranger told me there was a police traffic stop in a particular direction, I&#x27;d probably take a detour - even if there was a complete lack of proof.<p>Proof doesn&#x27;t guide my action at all - I don&#x27;t require a burden of proof in order to act.<p>Burden of proof is a legal concept, not a philosophical one.')
