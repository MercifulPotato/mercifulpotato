Your immune system monitors this to detect cells that have gone haywire, whether by mutation or infection.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;MHC_class_I#Effect_of_viruses" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;MHC_class_I#Effect_of_viruses</a><p>I don&#x27;t honestly understand how the immune system decides which protein fragments are okay to develop a response to, but the point is that that is already part of the normal immune response pathway that learns new antigens every day; after the protein fragment shows up on the cell surface, the rest of the process is similar to the response to an attenuated-virus vaccine or a natural infection.')
