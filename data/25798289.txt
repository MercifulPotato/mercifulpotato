It teaches you systems programming alongside teaching Rust.<p>That said, you can get quite far without needing to understand pointers or memory management in any of the example languages you mentioned - &quot;Clojure, Scala, F#, Rust&quot;. In the first 3, the garbage collector <i>still</i> does most of the work. In the last, there is are no calls to malloc() or free().
