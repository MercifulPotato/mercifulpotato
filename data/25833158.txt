I wanted to become a musician, and my parents were ok, even supportive, of that. I eventually then found out that it&#x27;s not easy to make a living as a musician, and later decided to pursue tech.<p>On the other hand, have friends that grew up in very different homes, where they were pretty much forced to pick medicine, law, or engineering, not ifs or buts. Many ended up switching careers quickly after graduating, pursuing other professions.<p>In the end, most I know - myself included - ended up doing pretty good. People do adjustments underway, but I&#x27;m grateful for having had the chance to chase my teenage dreams, even if it didn&#x27;t work out as planned.')
