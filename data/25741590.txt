However, is that the only explanation?<p>In my experience, while an NFA-based engine has better asymptotic complexity, a backtracking-based engine can be hard to beat for patterns that don&#x27;t do much backtracking. In a textbook NFA automaton, the time spent maintaining a set of parallel states may be &quot;wasted&quot; if it turns out that the first state in the list is already going to succeed anyway.<p>Regex experts of Hacker News, do you know if there are any engines and&#x2F;or algorithms that try to get the best of both worlds? Fast execution for patterns that don&#x27;t need much backtracking, but avoiding exponential run time in the worst case?')
