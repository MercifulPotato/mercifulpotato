The image processing is all done by custom hardware so all that was needed was microcontroller level performance. It turns out there are very limited options in this space and all of them are quirky outdated architectures with limited available tooling.<p>The RAD750 in particular is a bit of a nightmare because of the high pin count, need for a support chip, and the 32-bit bus forces the use of more RAM and ROM than a smaller micro would need. I took a pass on that. I also never have liked IBM&#x27;s reverse bit numbering and the implications it has on SRAM power consumption.')
