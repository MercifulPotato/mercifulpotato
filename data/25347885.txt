While I personally never had a single issue with upgrading between Fedora releases, I also have the skills the resolve any potential ones if I would. I don&#x27;t want to deal with somebody&#x27;s computer suddenly being borked halfway across the world with no way to assist. So far CentOS fit that niche beautifully, with seldom major clean reinstalls (i.e. wipe root) when I&#x27;m there (7.x &gt; 8.x). I&#x27;m going to evaluate CentOS Stream and perhaps you are right and it&#x27;s a viable replacement.')
