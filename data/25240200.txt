I had always been a Windows user growing up, didn&#x27;t know how to program, and didn&#x27;t know what open source was. It wasn&#x27;t until 2016 when I watched Snowden that I became extremely conscious about taking control of my own devices, but it required a lot of time and effort to even know where to start.<p>I installed Arch Linux and had to learn everything from scratch. I didn&#x27;t know anything about UNIX, security, config files, environmental variables, compiling code, git, terminals, window managers, ssh, bash scripting, user groups, access control, boot options, or anything else. I wouldn&#x27;t trade the time I&#x27;ve invested in learning how to operate and customize an open system, but the amount of upfront effort is very intimidating. I can say with confidence that if I hadn&#x27;t simultaneously developed an obsession with programming that I would have very quickly given up.<p>&gt; The system came with a reasonable set of defaults and when or if they grew more proficient and wanted to change something about their daily working environment, they had the option to do so.<p>This is the root of the issue in my mind, what are the &#x27;sane defaults&#x27; for a UNIX system to someone completely uninitiated in how software works? There&#x27;s so much &#x27;don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know&#x27; for people that only knew Windows and Mac growing up. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone that doesn&#x27;t work with computers professionally or as a hobbyist ever thinking that spending years learning open systems is worth the opportunity cost of the other things they could be doing with their lives.')
