Arecibo was a world-class instrument. The next largest radar telescope isn&#x27;t even one-tenth as powerful. This is a giant loss and a colossal screw-up of prioritization. Building something new costs a lot more than maintaining an existing installation (they were only spending single digits millions per year on Arecibo -- nothing). And they couldn&#x27;t even come up with that.')
