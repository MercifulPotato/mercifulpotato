And I say that fully knowing how much of a (relative) PITA it is to stream data through a GPU.<p>I think it also works better to think of the DSP resources as a big systolic array with lots of local connectivity and memory and only sparse remote connectivity.  The SIMD model doesn&#x27;t really apply.')
