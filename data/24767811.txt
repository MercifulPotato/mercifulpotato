In general they were displaced rather than merged. Or their numbers were so low and diffuse that their contribution was little. Which makes sense when you consider population densities possible&#x2F;typical in a hunter gatherer vs agrarian lifestyles.<p>We&#x27;re back to population migration &#x2F; replacement theories being ascendant rather than the situation 30 years ago when cultural diffusion theories were preferred.')
