That&#x27;s higher than many award&#x2F;festival winners... And, amusingly enough, on par with the movie he prefers, Mulholland Drive.<p>It gets weirder when he later says that we should go by the average rating and what a minority found great instead of what a majority found out to be ok... Except if the movie is Star Trek (2009), I guess (it has a lower rating in imdb than in either RT or MC).<p>And then he says that we should like stuff that has stood the test of time... But all the examples of his favorites are within a decade and a half of each other and the oldest is 33, which is young if we take in account the history of motion picture. In fact, his anti-example is closer to most of his examples than any of them to our time. And, of course, people are still talking about that movie, including <i>him</i> even if to disparage it.<p>He finally gets to what I assume is his thesis that we should pay attention to what has stood the test of time... Except if we do that we miss a ton of great content.<p>Sturgeon&#x27;s law is a thing and it has always been. For every Godfather part II there were a hundred exploitation films. All the time, most of what&#x27;s produced is garbage, but also every year (except, of course, the anomaly known as 2020) more media is produced. So, again by Sturgeon&#x27;s law, that means that more <i>great</i> media is produced every year.<p>Apropos of nothing, my two favorite movies are a biopic&#x2F;lawyer drama and a campy spy action movie. I can&#x27;t choose between the two, and both were released the last decade (2010-19). I&#x27;ve also watched dozens of classics and I&#x27;ve liked most of them, but I&#x27;ve also hated a few.<p>So, ultimately, this is a matter of taste, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with having different tastes.')
