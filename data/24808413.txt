The VM has the bare minimum amount of software I need, access to a few folders from the host OS, other than that it&#x27;s stripped to the bare minimum. It doesn&#x27;t &quot;fix&quot; Windows, but the issues are much less annoying when Windows is just a launcher for the handful of things that I need it for.')
