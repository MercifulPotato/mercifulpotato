My use-case is that I want to be able to deploy a HTTP service across a heterogeneous set of distributed host, many of which don&#x27;t allow any incoming connections &#x2F; are behind NAT, and I am looking for a good solution to have these boxes connect out to a central gateway server which doesn&#x27;t involve OpenVPN or SSH reverse tunnels.')
