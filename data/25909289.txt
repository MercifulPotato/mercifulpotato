Item(by='AnimalMuppet', descendants=None, kids=[25910231], score=None, time=1611610821, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25908785, text='If I understand correctly, atomic weapons have a &quot;strong link&quot; and a &quot;weak link&quot;.  The detonation won&#x27;t happen without everything firing correctly and on time; the signal to do that has to pass through both the strong link and the weak link.  The strong link isn&#x27;t in place until the bomb is armed.  But couldn&#x27;t a violent-enough accident knock the strong link into place?  Yes, but that same amount of violence would destroy the weak link.  (That&#x27;s the point of the weak link.)  So even if an atomic bomb had an accident hard enough (and lucky enough) to arm it, it still couldn&#x27;t explode, because the weak link would be broken.')
