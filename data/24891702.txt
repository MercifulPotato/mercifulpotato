Here&#x27;s an example Makefile [0].<p>&gt; should I consider taking a look at some description of standard ml instead of rust? It seems like rust has pattern matching and immutability which matches to F# pretty good?<p>Library and tooling support in F# and Rust is significantly more developed than in Standard ML.<p>To me the best use case for Standard ML today is in language development.<p>If its ecosystem were more mature it would be a great choice for application development. But today that&#x27;s just not the case unless you use a version like Morel that is backed by the JVM (and its ecosystem).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;eatonphil&#x2F;dbcore&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;Makefile#L3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;eatonphil&#x2F;dbcore&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;Makefile#L3</a>')
