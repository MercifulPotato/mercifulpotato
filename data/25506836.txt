You may be hard pressed to find a billionaire who actually has $1 billion in cash.<p>Cash would most likely be the minority of their wealth. As inflation occurs, they do take a hit on their cash holdings. But their land, stocks, apartment complexes, etc may increase in value.<p>&gt; It should devalue the money that they already have, benefitting the poor<p>Even if all people both rich and poor held all their wealth in the form of cash, that would certainly hurt the poor too. Say a poor person works 8 hours a day. His 8 hours of work grant him buying power of 3 meals. After inflation his 8 hours of work grant him buying power for only 2 meals. This is not just a theoretical, look at McDonalds meal prices, you can&#x27;t get a sandwich for a $1 anymore.<p>There are some benefits to inflation. It&#x27;s cheaper to employ poor people willing to work the now cheaper paper. So it may create some new jobs that otherwise may never have been created.')
