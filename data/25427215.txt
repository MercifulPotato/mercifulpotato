Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=[25427417], score=None, time=1608008840, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25427113, text='&gt; Just because two pointers point to the same memory location, it does not mean they have an identical representation as an integer.<p>Yes, I know. That&#x27;s irrelevant here for two reasons: firstly, the pointers <i>might</i> compare equal (which is all that matters for this argument), and secondly, once again, <i>the comparison isn&#x27;t being made between pointers</i>, the comparison is being made between integers.<p>&gt; The entire page is a longer discussion on the meaning of these quotes. You can&#x27;t ignore the rest of the entire page and just quote the first part, since this is exactly what they&#x27;re dissecting. Read the whole thing, and look at the links they point to.What I quoted is the conclusion they come to based on the preceding quotes (including yours). The standard is not 100% explicit on the issue (hence the discussion and requests for clarification), but many of those who&#x27;ve looked into the issue so far have come to the conclusion I quoted.<p>Yeah, no, their conclusion is wrong (and frankly I don&#x27;t consider those guys a reputable source; they&#x27;ve said plenty of false things before, and they&#x27;re prone to exaggerating the extent of undefined behaviour because they have a vested interest in portraying it as more common than it is). They claim that making equality comparisons is undefined behaviour but their only basis for that is a quote from the section on relational operators which is obviously only talking about relational operators. Read the actual standard quotations in context and there is no confusion.')
