The Aerotech hybrid system looked really attractive to me at the time. I wasn&#x27;t in a financial position to take the plunge, though.<p>I&#x27;ve thought about getting back into the hobby and it looks like all the hybrid systems have disappeared. The ATF permitting for solid fuel motors seemed pretty onerous back in the late 90s (I always flew at launches where I could purchase reloads for my Aerotech RMS on-site so I didn&#x27;t have to deal with transporting motors) and I assume it got worse after 9&#x2F;11.<p>Anybody know what ever happened to the hybrid systems? Aerotech&#x27;s website looks like it stopped being updated about the time I left the hobby. Same goes w&#x2F; their competitor Hypertek (which I thought had a ridiculous ground-support system).')
