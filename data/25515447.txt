Hence it is considered the answer to the issue of stubble burning that is one of the biggest contributions to pollution in and around Delhi-NCR.\nThe happy seeder not only removes residue but also allows the farmer to seed the new crop without involving manual labour. It is usually mounted on the back of a tractor. Typically, in the month of October, a farmer sows wheat while removing paddy straw in the process.\nHowever, despite the government subsidising happy seeders, not many farmers want to use the machine. Here’s why:\n1) ‘Single Happy Seeder Can’t Till Land Beyond 8 Acres Per Day’\n2) Govt Subsidy Not Enough\n3) Potato Growers Can’t Rely on Machine\n4) Big Tractors Not Available\n5) Moisture in Stubble Forces Farmers to Partially Burn It\n[..]<p>You know..there are solutions. Small acreage farm automation as a service. Unless India steps up and stops farming like they used to..it’s going to get ugly.<p>But I can’t even get small acreage robots going here in the US..so I am really the last person who should be thinking about this.')
