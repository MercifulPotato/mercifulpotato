This is peanuts for large existing companies with billions of dollars of recurring revenue, but impossible for new entrants.<p>The guy who runs the FCC and decides this kind of stuff, for example, used to work for Verizon, one of the largest telcos in the country.<p>In most of the US, it is basically illegal to start a new ISP.')
