To give a silly example: the other day I upgraded a Fedora box, and suddenly DNS wasn&#x27;t resolving short names (foo, instead of foo.example.com). This is something that has worked Just Fine for 25 years, run an upgrade, and bam, it stops working. I wasted a lot of time figuring out that systemd was to blame in the first place, after all, why the hell would systemd be involved in resolving DNS? Well, apaprently systemd-resolved is now a thing. And as is the case with anything systemd related, configuration is a PITA.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just getting old and change is starting to grate on me. But systemd does feel like everything-and-the-kitchen-sink.<p>As for SELinux, sure, you can turn it off. At which point it&#x27;s useless. The pain begins when you actually want to use it and existing policies aren&#x27;t enough. It is <i>hugely</i> complex. Tooling (like ausearch and audit2allow) is, erhm, not very good. Want to allow something non standard? Better be prepared to spend a couple of hours. Don&#x27;t forget to turn your new policy into a module file. And then compile that into a pp file, which is another kind of module? And then don&#x27;t forget to install that file. I remember administering Windows NT and 2K boxen and really hating how its policies worked, well, SELinux now makes me feel the same.<p>Both of these tools make a lot assumptions about how things should be done, and they&#x27;re pushing these assumptions onto the user, whether or not they agree.<p>And hey, I get it, these are complex domains, and we should be very happy that people are giving us Free (both sense) Software in the first place. But boy, if I could pay €100 to have a sensible operating system, I would. Just not €100 per machine -_-')
