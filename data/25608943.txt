Item(by='steveBK123', descendants=None, kids=[25609597], score=None, time=1609547676, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25604862, text='I’m in a hybrid senior engineer &#x2F; project lead role with no direct people management responsibility.\nI’ve enjoyed working remotely as my wife &amp; I each have space for our own offices.  I save 90min commuting, plus have quick access to food&#x2F;coffee&#x2F;restroom unlike in my crowded office which is in an upscale food dessert despite being Manhattan.<p>There’s been a lot of managerial meeting bloat which has only been tolerable because of savings on above time sucks and really being able to multi task through BS during zoom calls you cannot in a conference room.  I find zoom has also been a great leveler as 30% of the team works in other countries.\nSo pre-covid 70% of us would be in a conference room the other 30% were dialed in through zoom and not participating nearly as much.<p>The issue is clear at the middle management level.  Firms are making broad vague commitments to not forcing anyone back to office anytime soon.  Senior leaders themselves seem to be enjoying the benefits of working from their vacation homes instead of their pied-a-terre.  More family time, no commute time.<p>Sadly some middle management layers above me have willingly gone back into basically empty (10% capacity) offices for no reason.  Sick of their kids &amp; face time &amp; workaholics basically. One team lead has actually bought a home closer to office while 15% of his team has actually gone the other direction and moved further away.<p>If you are already in an organization doing daily stand ups, bi-weekly sprints&#x2F;closing&#x2F;retro&#x2F;planning, project backlog reviews, post mortems, (easily 10+ hours&#x2F;week total).. plus tracking everything in Jira, with multiple active &amp; lively Slack channels .. it’s unclear to me how middle management can’t do their job at home.<p>They probably feel unable to APPEAR to be doing their job to the same extent, however as you can’t see them huffing&amp;puffing across the floor from one conference room to another back to back to back.....<p>Anyway I like it enough that if the pendulum swings all the way back at the end of 2021 to year-round, 5-day&#x2F;week in-office 100% then I’ll answer some of those recruiter emails that have been piling up.')
