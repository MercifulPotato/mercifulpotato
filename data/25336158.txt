I know when i&#x27;ve used Bootstrap in the past i saw a lot of JS, which turns me off. I primarily want a light CSS framework.<p>This is coupled with the fact that UI executed logic is handled by WASM in my use case (Rust). So the thought of decoupling JS puts up mental friction that Tailwind doesn&#x27;t give me the impression of.<p>Sidenote, i&#x27;ve tried some of the Bootstrap ecosystem in the past and it felt rather messy. I imagine this is partly due to the success of the Bootstrap ecosystem, but it felt messy enough that i&#x27;d probably only be interested in a streamlined CSS only Bootstrap offering.<p>&gt; And can you elaborate on the text heavy pages?<p>I guess i just mean pages where i want to see more dense information, like Wikipedia, rather than more sparse information which is common these days.<p>An easy comparison is New vs Old Reddit. A lot of design i see, even from Tailwind, organizes UIs like New Reddit. That might be nice for landing pages and customer navigation - but i loathe it for data. When i&#x27;m viewing long for data i want to see things both look good and be densely packed - within reason. New Reddit takes high volume information (lots of links&#x2F;descriptions&#x2F;comments) and makes navigating it ~5x less efficient.')
