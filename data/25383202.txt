Dreamhost right now has a discount for $4&#x2F;mo if you sign up for one year. Otherwise it&#x27;s $9&#x2F;mo in general. You get unlimited user email accounts. And you get web hosting should you ever want it.<p>Their email interface may not be great, but I download using IMAP anyway. And you could install your own preferred web interface on the shared hosting you&#x27;ll have.')
