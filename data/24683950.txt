If the marginal return to capital of providing rental housing goes up relative to other investments, then more capital will be invested in providing rental house, until equilibrium.  Likewise, if the marginal return to capital of providing rental housing goes down, capital will be moved out of rental housing.<p>If the risk of being a landlord is increased, then a small landlord has a bit of problem in that it will be hard to diversify their portfolio.  They will need to enter into some kind of risk-transfer transaction.  The simplest would be to purchase some kind of insurance that pays out in case of government-mandated rent moratorium.  Insurance company actuaries would work out a reasonable premium, and that premium would be added to the rent required of tenants.<p>All-in-all, that would be a reasonably orderly solution -- with the net effect of raising rents to cover the insurance premium.<p>Of course, we can all imagine a world in which we have both rent control and government-mandated rent moratoriums.  In which case, the return to capital in rental house goes down and the supply dries up.  Which means instead of an orderly market, rental units are transferred based on non-monetary consideration. I don&#x27;t see how this world is better for anybody.')
