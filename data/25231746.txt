It&#x27;s incorrect to dismiss a study based on sample size without a discussion of significance and effect size in the context of the data.<p>Moreover I reject the premise that you should be assessing this story quantitatively rather than qualitatively. But if you insist: what are your priors on whether or not a given company engaged in discrimination, and how do these change if you&#x27;re told 75% of employees of a particular demographic <i>stated</i> there was discrimination?')
