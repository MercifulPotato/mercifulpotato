I agree with the employment attorney idea and I think HR would help here.  There are other options, but they&#x27;re risky and you shouldn&#x27;t have to do this in the first place.<p>Who do you report to in the structure?  What&#x27;s the culture elsewhere in the company?  If the culture is positive elsewhere and upper management seem like decent people, I&#x27;d go over your manager&#x27;s head and explain what&#x27;s going on to an executive.  This sounds like a bad manager scared to have a difficult conversation.  Outline specific events, with dates and relevant people, then put it in business terms.  Employee retention, work quality, motivation as it relates to deadlines&#x2F;innovation, etc.  Whatever personal perspective you want to add, I&#x27;d keep it in a separate section because if they care, it&#x27;ll be obvious what the impact to you is and if they don&#x27;t care, they can focus on the business cost.<p>I guess if you&#x27;re feeling really empathetic, you could talk with the abusive coworker directly, but that&#x27;s a risk.  Even just trying to connect with him as a person - asking him how he&#x27;s doing or something non-work related.<p>I&#x27;m sorry you&#x27;re going through this and I hope you find a way out.  If it was me, I&#x27;d tell the boss that I won&#x27;t work with $abuser and to go fuck himself if that&#x27;s a problem.  Apparently that kind of behavior flies.')
