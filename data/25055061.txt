It&#x27;s an English word, and it is (believed to be) pronounced the same as in PIE: but it&#x27;s also a loanword from Yiddish.<p>Everyone in the New York metro area, and most people along the East Coast or large metro areas around the US, will know the word lox. That&#x27;s going to be about as many people as in the whole of England, it surely counts as a word in English, as much as &quot;hoon&quot; or &quot;anorak&quot;.<p>But it hasn&#x27;t been a word along the entire life track from PIE to modern English. It was preserved in Germanic languages and reintroduced later.')
