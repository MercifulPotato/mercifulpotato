So that&#x27;s a mere $35k in average lifetime value. But as anyone used to lying with statistics knows, the average revenue is much higher than the median revenue. In Apple&#x27;s case, the factor appears to be 56x [3].<p>So the typical App Store app makes $630 in total over its entire lifetime. That&#x27;s surely not enough to finance its development.<p>Accordingly, I am convinced that pretty much all iOS developers lose money on their apps.
