He&#x27;s also great with regards to social interaction, he&#x27;s seemed to keep close connections with every person he comes across when he&#x27;s traveled.<p>There&#x27;s a saying that &quot;if you&#x27;ve met one person with autism, you&#x27;ve met one person with autism&quot;, symptoms present differently in everyone and they&#x27;re highly responsive to environment. As a trend I&#x27;d say special interests are probably a decent contender for a hallmark, probably along with language difficulty and eye contact avoidance.')
