We need them for our development and ops work, and now these uber-cool Macs are out, buying old Intel ones has become a no-no too, so we don&#x27;t buy any desktops&#x2F;laptops at all!<p>If you read this and work at Apple, you can show this message to your bosses and I hope that it could entice the company to sponsor Homebrew with hardware + engineer time to help the project go forward. I am pretty sure than homebrew generates 100s of millions of sales for Macs (100k computers sold instead of Linux laptops if homebrew did not exist seems reasonable).')
