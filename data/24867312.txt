If &quot;massaging&quot; the truth to make it appear better than it is, and changing focus from the real problematic things to positive things isn&#x27;t the job I don&#x27;t know what is.<p>You can call it hyperbole and good marketing, but then it also goes to the extent of PR after oil spills, tailings damns wiping out villages and poisoning or risking the health of your own workforce, like for example Dupont and C8.<p>It&#x27;s hard not to be cynical about PR because you cannot do it effectively without creating &#x2F; propagating a distorted view of the truth.<p>But then again, the reason it still essentially needs to exist is because there is no universal truth, no universal sense of good or bad. So for example, do I forgive nuclear power and GM food companies from trying to influence public discourse on the safety of their work? Of course, it&#x27;s essential in a world where they are competing against lots of unwarranted negative attention, much of it baseless as far as the science goes.<p>Anyway in spite of my ranting and bias, really I&#x27;d conclude it&#x27;s a necessary evil, and the majority of the industry is innocuous and just trying to showcase the work and values of their clients...<p>Also newspaper editors are a huge part to blame, when these days loads of press releases make it to print almost unedited (and as has happened to myself and others I know, the bits they changed were even more wrong - including in national level newspaper)... Fact checking claims and sources is so lacking, especially in fast modern news cycle.<p>[edit] typo')
