CoCs don’t take into account that there is a small, vocal, petty minority that will always make life hell for others. These people are mostly ignorable and avoidable, if you simply avoid the sorts of things they enjoy  (for instance, don’t join committees, don’t buy a house in a neighborhood with an HOA, etc). Unfortunately, lately, these sorts seem to have wriggled into power, making it harder to avoid their nonsense. I’m not sure if CoCs have contributed to this, or if they’re just a symptom of it, but either way, it’s an undesirable outcome.')
