Compilers are famous for being branch heavy and random lookups... something that people have reported excellent performance on the M1.  Parsing is hard as well (like say javascript).<p>Of course for any CPU workload it&#x27;s going to be harder on the memory system when you have video going on.  Doubly so for a video conference (compression, decompression, updating the video frames, streaming the results, network activity, reading from the camera, etc).<p>Seems like the apple memory system wouldn&#x27;t have received as much R&amp;D as it did unless Apple though it was justified.  Clearly the speed, performance, and price show that Apple made quite a few good decisions.')
