You get all sort of issues with frame rate, data transfer bandwidth, not enough power to charge the laptop, overheating etc.<p>All because Apple couldn&#x27;t be bothered to either keep more ports in their &quot;PRO&quot; lineup, or at least design and sell a quality dock station for &quot;pro&quot; users that works without those caveats, performance and quality issues, overheating, etc. Apple only makes low-end single or max three ports adapters that aren&#x27;t capable of doing anything serious. It&#x27;s just lame that they aren&#x27;t making a high-end loaded dock station for pro users. I hope they just do it, and they do it without crazy price tag.')
