Speech recognition doesn’t work. The touchscreen is unresponsive - it can take a minute to type in an address. And sometimes the main touchscreen computer freezes and I have to manually reboot it, which means no A&#x2F;C or radio or navigation for 5 minutes.<p>I understand that the computer in my Model S isn’t as good as their newer ones. But I have to say the overall experience is terrible. My Volt had a more functional and reliable computer. I’m tempted to buy a new Model S just to upgrade the computer.<p>All of this is to say that Tesla may have great technology but it is unevenly applied and they are terrible at support.')
