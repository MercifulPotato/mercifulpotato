Didn&#x27;t own a house, but could&#x27;ve bought the Mississippi one you link to for cash easily.<p>What&#x27;d I actually do?  Found a series of startups, none of which went anywhere.  Fiddle around with technology, and learn some new technologies.  Fret about how I wasn&#x27;t being productive enough.  I didn&#x27;t read all that much - I read much more when I was in college.  I got out of shape.<p>I have a friend who retired at a similar age who said &quot;One of the worst parts about having money is realizing that most of your problems were not because of money in the first place, and then having to face them.&quot;  Retirement removes a lot of constraints, but that also means that if you&#x27;re still unhappy with your life, it&#x27;s because of <i>you</i> and not your boss or employer.')
