This is N times faster than adding up all the values, and subtracting. However... this bug can happen.<p>I suspect you have similar behavior occurring due to the smaller coefficients at the tails of the function.<p>That&#x27;s my 2cents, I hope it made sense, and helps explain what you&#x27;ve encountered.')
