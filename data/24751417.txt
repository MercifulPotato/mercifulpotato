The IEEE standard says that rounding in general (not just for the round function) should round-to-nearest-even. That means that rounding should go to the closest result, and if there is a tie then it should go to the even number.<p>So, if ceil(x) is implemented as round(x+0.5) then:\nceil(4) = round(4.5) = 4\nceil(5) = round(5.5) = 6<p>The first of those is correct. The second is incorrect.')
