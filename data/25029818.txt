Ability to store energy on a large scale could be the answer to making solar and wind viable as primary energy sources.<p>Many homes use gas-powered heating and hot water because it used to be cheaper.  It&#x27;s inefficient for power plants to burn gas, turn it into electricity + waste heat vs. homes just turning the gas directly into heat.  That likely won&#x27;t be the case for long since renewable electricity sources should drive down the cost of electricity.')
