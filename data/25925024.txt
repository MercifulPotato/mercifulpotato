E.g. when dealing with tabular data, the columns (which might be used as type parameters) change frequently. In Julia, for example, see DataFrames.jl vs. TypedTables.jl for some trade-offs.<p>In general, type annotations are useful if you know the business requirements beforehand. Data science is exploratory, where type annotations can be a form of premature abstraction. Languages with traits (e.g. Scala) might be a decent compromise.')
