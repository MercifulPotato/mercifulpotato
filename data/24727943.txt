My understanding of copyright law is surely flawed, and perhaps the “original work” standard means that only descriptions of systems are copyrightable and not the systems themselves.<p>In that case I agree that my examples fail. Keys and clutches are mechanisms and filling gas is a process, and those aren’t copyrightable (but they are patentable). The file format example fails too, because the concept of laying out data in a particular way is a mere idea, and ideas aren’t copyrightable either (they are also not patentable, though a description of the format is copyrightable and a specific process for reading or writing the file might be patentable if it were nontrivial).')
