We tend to maintain client library by b&#x2F;e team (maybe ~90% of code by b&#x2F;e devs) for anything non trivial. The best documentation you can get is typed + jsdoc described library that you can just use. It is up to date. It&#x27;s cheap to add new calls and notifications, it&#x27;s easy to change apis where typescript guides you through changes required etc.')
