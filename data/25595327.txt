There is also tickets in GitLab, which all developers are happy to use.\nThere is a wiki as well, which, gosh, is just markdown in another repo! Markdown you can build beautiful PDFs from! And websites!<p>But nope, we need JIRA and confluence, because for some reason GitLab isn&#x27;t good enough. Now the tickets are separate from the actual work, there is another platform with a complex and slow ui, and our docs formerly markdown are now in some proprietary confluence RTF, which can export to word and PDF - with no custom styling.')
