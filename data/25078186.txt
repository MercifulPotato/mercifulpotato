The Constitution and its surrounding documents are foundational <i>simply because they&#x27;re foundational</i>, not because they are the final word on political philosophy or practical governance. The Constitution just has to be good enough to supply a floor for the quality of a government that has any pretense of following it and, for the past few hundred years, it&#x27;s done the job well enough to survive despite some <i>fundamental</i> failings.<p>And in practice, whatever anybody says, the <i>interpretation</i> of the Constitution has evolved massively over the country&#x27;s history, even along supposedly originalist views. The most important ideas in the Constitution—say, the First Amendment—are intentionally under-specified; the full meaning of the First Amendment is not in its 45 words but in centuries of legal scholarship and judicial precedent. While the Amendment itself has a couple of centuries under its belt, its practical manifestation in American legal practice is at least as sophisticated and modern as anywhere else.')
