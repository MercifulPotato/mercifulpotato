For example, I would never say, &quot;blind people excel at subtle manipulation; they learn this skill in order to work around their inherent social deficiencies.&quot; In fact, I wouldn&#x27;t even make any negative generalizations even when I have reason to believe they are probably true, like &quot;blind people tend to be less productive programmers.&quot;<p>I just think it&#x27;s fascinating how sociopaths are totally barred from this protection. We really do fear them, and that fear puts them out in the cold, outside the usual embrace of diversity. I wonder if you could make the statements you&#x27;ve just made about any other group of people with a genetic condition without incurring the wrath of the community or even the moderators.<p>I&#x27;m really not moral grandstanding here. I&#x27;m not sure you&#x27;re correct about typical sociopath behavior, but if you are then I have no issue with you saying it. I&#x27;m only pointing it out because I&#x27;m genuinely fascinated by this exception to a very strong cultural norm.')
