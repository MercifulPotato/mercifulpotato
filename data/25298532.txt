Alternatively, don&#x27;t give me the same suggestion again within a month of the last time you have it to me.\n- you&#x27;ve got the weather, that&#x27;s great. Now stop repeating the same unwanted information (the current weather) when I ask for multiple forecasts (what&#x27;s the weather for tomorrow and Saturday -&gt; the weather tomorrow is... Currently it is... There is a weekend advisory in effect...The weather Saturday is... Currently it is... There is a wind advisory...)\n- let me specify what information I want when I ask for the weather; it should be trivial to get the wind speed, UV index, it whatever other item I want every time I ask for current weather or forecast, not just if it&#x27;s going to be unusual.')
