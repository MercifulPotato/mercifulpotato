For example at one point redistricting was pushed by various people to help give minorities enough collective voice to have some influence.<p>To put it another way. Let&#x27;s says there are 10 seats representing 1000 people. Those 1000 people are 15% A and 85% B and spread out into 10 districts of 100 people each where no district has more than 20% A. By that, A can never get any representation where as if they let A form a group they can likely get 1 of seat of those 10 representatives and at least have a voice.<p>That kind of thing has been done in many different ways but your post seems to suggest you think it&#x27;s wrong.')
