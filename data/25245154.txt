When you say &quot;Who is &quot;they&quot;?&quot;. Are you saying Google and other tech giants?  They have huge advertising networks.  But that is a total guess since what you are saying is still very unclear.  It looks like you don&#x27;t want to be clear about this.  I&#x27;d really prefer you to just say it, rather than all this cryptic stuff.<p>But since you go on about advertising, that is a way for  groups that want it, is to be able to force people to listen to their message.  This robs people of their agency to listen to what they choose to.  Censorship also doesn&#x27;t allow people to listen to what they choose to.  This makes advertising and censorship very alike.  They both result in a persons loss of freedom to choose what information they get.')
