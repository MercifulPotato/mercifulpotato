Patients that are likely to have a Vitamin D level <i>checked</i> are different than hospitalized patients. Vitamin D levels are not checked routinely in hospitalized patients. I know this because I&#x27;m a hospitalist, but also because during the height of the local pandemic this 900+ bed hospital only had 216 patients with a vitamin D level checked. Presumably at least 1000 COVID patients moved through that hospital during this time, more likely several thousand.')
