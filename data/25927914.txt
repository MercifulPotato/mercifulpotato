It focuses on retail investors when arguably the big wall street guys had more of a role to play. By overshorting the stock (140% of outstanding stocks were shorted) they made themselves vulnerable to what happened afterwards.\nThe GameStop shares had a couple of things going for it:\n - Ryan Cohen who previously sold Chewy.com invested heavily and joined the board\n- Higher than expected sales of (legacy) games on discs\n- Strong cash position<p>So WallstreetBets picking up the stock does not come completely out of the blue. I would say the &#x27;Fiasco&#x27; has as much to do with Melvin and other short sellers making mistakes as it has to do with retail investors.')
