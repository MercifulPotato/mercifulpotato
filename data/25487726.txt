Then you can write a simple HTML page that uses a video player to play it back in a browser.<p>I used this to create a simple dashboard page for my home security cams (they provide an RTMP stream I can feed right into ffmpeg) after I got sick of the software I had eating too much CPU (I use &#x27;-v:copy -a:copy&#x27;, so no actually re-encoding happens).<p>Obviously, this owncast is cool for probably being easier to setup, definitely better looking, and having more features, like chat. I just wanted convey there&#x27;s nothing magic to doing your own streaming video. More people should do it instead of feeding into the YouTube&#x2F;Twitch behemoths and untrustworthy cloud IoT stuff.')
