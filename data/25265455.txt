Payments can be made to go to one party or have built in alternatives if they die prior to transfer.  Payments can also require specific documentation or have a time limit for transfer.  How exactly this might most commonly be used is all conjecture, but there are many possibilities and few built in limits.<p>Oddly enough making payments programmable also introduced some of the first bugs in payment programming which raises many issues with the whole concept.  In any case, it is all moving forward very fast.')
