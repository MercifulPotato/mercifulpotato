What you see in a mirrorless camera has already gone through a great deal of processing to approximate what you&#x27;d see naturally with an SLR system.<p>Which is fine for what it is!  If you aren&#x27;t shooting in a studio, the reduced mass of equivalent lenses with mirrorless systems is a big quality of life upgrade all on its own, for example.  But the color representation just isn&#x27;t there, and it isn&#x27;t going to be until we get better color in our display systems.  It&#x27;s being worked on, of course, but there&#x27;s a long way to go.')
