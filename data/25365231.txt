It turned out well for him but it was still a huge risk he took.<p>For sure Elon Musk is a very smart guy and he works really hard and he knows how to deliver amazing products and his PR skills are amazing... That said, we can&#x27;t deny that he got a lot of support from the US government. Without US government help (e.g. subsidies, grants, carbon credits), he probably would have failed flat on his face like all other geniuses. His ability to secure government support had more to do with luck (history and social connections) than skill.<p>So as great as Elon Musk is, he did socialize a lot of his risk.')
