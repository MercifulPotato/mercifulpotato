I noticed my FitBit (and I&#x27;m told with many other wrist-based heart rate monitors) don&#x27;t do well with sports like boxing and rowing. My chest strap is more accurate, but doesn&#x27;t get integrated with FitBit&#x27;s data. I&#x27;m sure there are many other unaccounted for issues and often these kinds of data sets can&#x27;t be disputed because the process is mostly automated and not transparent.')
