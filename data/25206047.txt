I can only say that I wasn&#x27;t the only one who didn&#x27;t like it (and I had every reason to love it as even at home I had a fully equipped GodBout&#x2F;CompuPro dual proc 8085&#x2F;86 S100 system running CP&#x2F;M and CP&#x2F;M86 which was pretty much the king of CP&#x2F;M systems. (Incidentally, I used to edit the HMXBIOS assembler code for that in WordStar in non document mode. For me it was a dream to used compared with. ED.<p>Even my resident assembler guru who considered any high level language you&#x27;d name too wasteful of CPU cycles, would send a file from a serial port on the CP&#x2F;M machine to his Intel development system and edit it there then send it back again rather than using ED.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this dichotomy many times amongst programmers and I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that it has to do with the ergonomics of the way people think and work.')
