A normal passenger car might be able to put out 300 hp, but only for a short period of time before blowing the headgasket (or destroying the drive train). Diesel engine with gobs of torque or electric is going to produce that power at a lower speed and more efficiently, so it will be able to do it longer. Being able to put out 70hp nonstop for hours on end is nothing to be ashamed of.')
