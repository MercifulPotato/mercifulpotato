Big Sur feels like the iOS 7 for the Mac, and I’m very sad that I’ll have to wait at least 4~5 years to see the new interface improve in a better state.<p>Some of my key annoyances (except for bugs):<p>* The new control center now requires more clicks, but due to the padding getting bigger, I can’t put all of the shortcut icons in the menu bar<p>* The new control center and notification center’s UI is so foreign from other parts of the macOS. It’s just… so custom.<p>* There are now multiple variants of the title bar thickness, and all of the Apple apps now use all four. It just feels ugly. The title ban of the Photos app and the Calendar app are almost the same — why does one use a .unified one and one uses a .unifiedCompact one? And why does Safari uses a .unified one when it doesn’t really have any information to convey?<p>* This is from Catalina, but the NSSwitch stuff collides with checkboxes… but well I’m guessing that’s for Catalyst trying to look native<p>I can go on and on… but my general feeling of Big Sur’s UI is that it would take multiple years to make this better.')
