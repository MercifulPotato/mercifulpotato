And a bit of brightness in astrophotography more generally.<p>Context is I&#x27;d like to sketch a primary-school &quot;atoms up&quot; learning progression, but emphasizing nuclei.  Nucleosynthesis then pulls in deep time, galaxy, and stars.  But many kids, and many teachers, have never seen a sky of stars.  So how might stars, largely unseen, be tied to their everyday lives?<p>I saw this graphic[1] go by.  But it&#x27;s physically unrealistic - even faint stars in darkest &quot;1&quot; are shown brighter than the sky in polluted &quot;9&quot;.  So how might it be done better?<p>Perhaps as an interactive. A slider for sky illuminance.  Another for exposure (pupil dilation, etc).  IIRC, retina dynamic range is similar to a screen&#x27;s.  Conceptual buttons, like day&#x2F;twilight&#x2F;night, moon and phase, urban to sea, altitude, clouds, etc.  These all next to a similar sky graphic, with room left over for secondary material.  So one might explore the space from cloudy day, to nights with eye and instruments, to above atmosphere, Hubble, and beyond inner-system dust scattering.<p>With some potential for fun stories.  Like once above atmosphere, being able to see a sky of stars in the middle of the day, as long as you&#x27;re not looking towards the Sun, or anything sunlit.  And for addressing common misconceptions.  Like the moon and stars are only up at night.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;miro.medium.com&#x2F;max&#x2F;700&#x2F;1*tMWGuSj2j3zs_oLTysYa3Q.jpeg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;miro.medium.com&#x2F;max&#x2F;700&#x2F;1*tMWGuSj2j3zs_oLTysYa3Q.jpe...</a> from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;starts-with-a-bang&#x2F;your-guide-to-the-best-meteor-shower-of-the-year-the-geminids-6324580cb5ad" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;starts-with-a-bang&#x2F;your-guide-to-the-best...</a>')
