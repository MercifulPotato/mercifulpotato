But for situations where groups like managers are expected to work outside regular working hours constantly.\nAnd this also comes to having clear laws that companies can&#x27;t retaliate(fire) someone if they don&#x27;t work outside working hours.<p>So if you are a developer and want to do 60 hour week writing code. You could do that under flexible hours. It is just that the employer can&#x27;t force you to do that or expect you to regularly work outside regular hours.<p>On other hand being &quot;on-call&quot; is something different. It can be compensated and hours worked will be considered overtime with multiplier.')
