Item(by='SeanKilleen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610648010, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25776119, text='Personal stance: I&#x27;ve heard direct feedback from others that it makes them feel more welcome and normalizes an idea that is important to them, so I tend to include them in various places.<p>Previous employer: A group dedicated to inclusion &amp; belonging recommended to HR, who clarified that including pronouns was certainly welcome but not required. Several people changed it.<p>Current employer: I just decided to include them in my signature as part of the &quot;name&quot; line. I did agree with another comment&#x27;s hesitation because it&#x27;s a sort of expression of a company&#x27;s brand, but I know enough about my current employer and their stance on D&amp;I that I&#x27;m not worried I&#x27;ll upset anyone.')
