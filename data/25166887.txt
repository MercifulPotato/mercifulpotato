Windows does try to make them fit into the pixel grid.<p>Personally, I&#x27;ve turned off AA on my PC (and it&#x27;s a completely useless feature on high resolution displays). What surprises me is as we have been moving into higher resolution displays, the OS makers have been making it HARDER to turn off anti-aliasing of text and this includes newer versions of Qt which have it turned on apparently so programs using Qt now pick up anti-aliasing even if your PC has it turned off.<p>People go on about how they love their blurry fonts. I don&#x27;t get it. I like crisp and sharp.<p>PS. The version of the font, and the font used also makes a difference. A number of them were made during an era when anti-aliasing wasn&#x27;t as common, so those are hinted to work well without AA, but I have also run into situations where an older version of a font works great with AA off and the newer version of it doesn&#x27;t because they screwed something up or removed the hinting in the newer version. So if you have a really good font, back it up.')
