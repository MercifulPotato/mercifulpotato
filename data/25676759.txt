I&#x27;m just saying the user experience is broken when you don&#x27;t allow it.<p>Telegram won&#x27;t let you just add contacts locally within the app (ie. stored privately within the Telegram app.) WhatsApp I think had a similarly bad experience.  You try to tap &quot;Add contact&quot; and it just tries to access your device contacts again.  No thanks.<p>I want my chat apps to have their own database of contacts, with basic CRUD for adding&#x2F;removing them, which stays <i>in that app</i>.  I don&#x27;t need them getting a dump of the hundreds of contacts I have on my phone so that they can upload all of it to their servers and &quot;suggest&quot; friends (and likely, sell the data.)<p>Hosting my contact information on their servers and using invite codes&#x2F;etc would work fine too (especially if it&#x27;s pseudonymous.)  But no, you can&#x27;t get a dump of my whole contact database just so I can keep track of who I talk to.')
