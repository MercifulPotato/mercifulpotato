I love going to see movies.  My wife and I used to go every week.  Until we had kids.  In the last six years, I think we&#x27;ve seen maybe two movies in the theater.<p>I have however watched every day-of streaming release that&#x27;s come out, even the ones that cost $30, just to support the idea.<p>I would gladly pay $20 to see new movies in my home.  My TV and sound are good enough.<p>I&#x27;d still like to see the big action flicks in the theater, and if I were a teen, I&#x27;d still prefer dates in a theater rather than at home, and I&#x27;m sure a lot of people feel safer having a date at a theater than at someone&#x27;s house.<p>When the VCR came out, everyone said it would kill moviegoing.  To prevent it, they usually waited 4+ years to release a movie on VHS.  It turned out, when they shrunk that window to 4 months, it didn&#x27;t really affect moviegoing.<p>I hope they find the same is true here -- that there isn&#x27;t a lot of overlap between people who want to watch at home and people who will go to a theater.')
