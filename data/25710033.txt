Freedom of speech is not the freedom from consequences. It may be perfectly legal for Zuckerberg to do something like that, but it would most certainly not be cool. He&#x27;d rightfully be considered an asshole, and his advertising revenue would probably take a large hit as a result of everyone else exercising their own rights of free speech and free association. As well they should.<p>However, that hypothetical isn&#x27;t a great analogy for the reality that we&#x27;re talking about here. It&#x27;s a decent enough parallel in a strictly legal sense. But let&#x27;s keep it real: one isn&#x27;t making nearly as much of an asshole of oneself by refusing to help someone undermine democracy. Nor is one making much of an asshole of oneself by refusing to support the activities of white supremacists.')
