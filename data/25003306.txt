The workers&#x27; work is the cost of building the bridge. The value comes from the infrastructure&#x27;s utility &#x2F; ROI.<p>If we assemble a group of workers to build some useless infrastructure, say a bridge connecting nowhere to nothing that won&#x27;t be used by anyone, we just effectively handed out money to this group of workers (for their time) without adding any real value to the economy.')
