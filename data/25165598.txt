Good enough for us to drop Slack. Google is slowly replacing all their messaging products with this - Hangouts for GSuite customers is going away, and presumably this is why they drop the Voice integration.<p>The way they do threading - everything being a thread, at the top level - is more natural than Slack&#x27;s.<p>Collaboration with external teams is seamless, you can add any GSuite or GMail accounts to a room. Much less annoying than being logged into a dozen external Slack workspaces.<p>Automatic permission management for Drive docs.
