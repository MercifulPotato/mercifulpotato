Item(by='charlesdaniels', descendants=None, kids=[25040586, 25040651], score=None, time=1604953895, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25032008, text='Though I&#x27;m not normally one to advocate for &quot;web stuff&quot;, what would stop someone from simply compiling a suite of shell tools to WASM, then distributing a &quot;terminal&quot; as a PWA. Of course there would be some slowdown compared to real native code, but I am told (not a web person) that WASM can be nearly as fast as native code, and is (?) supported by Safari. I have seen successful experiments where people have run AMD64 simulators in WASM that can boot Linux, so you could even go so far as virtualizing the whole system, though I imagine the performance would be even worse than &quot;just&quot; targeting WASM.<p>I guess this is somewhat rhetorical; the people who would be interested in such a tool are I imagine by and large willing and able to either jailbreak or buy an Android. Presumably getting a nice shell-type environment as a PWA would be tricky also considering the limitations of the browser (I know this makes networking hard).<p>I wish there was a product like an iPad that came with a root shell out of the box. I like the polish of iOS, but I&#x27;m not willing to trust random people on the internet with root code execution to jailbreak my iThings.')
