They have to have a standard they apply to everybody so as to prove there was no bias against any particular race, gender, etc. So in a non-regulatory world, they might have looked at the income you&#x27;ve had over the period of time and what you&#x27;ve done with it. That being said, it does look weird to a lender why you possibly make more than enough for a mortgage yet only have 10% to put down. In the pre-fiat days, 20-30% was the standard minimum to put down which was also a reason why houses were so cheap.')
