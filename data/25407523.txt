And many open-source 3rd party GUI components can be installed right from within the Lazarus IDE via the &quot;Package&quot; &gt; &quot;Online Package Manager&quot; menu option.<p>I&#x27;ve been using Delphi and&#x2F;or Lazarus + FPC for 15 years. It&#x27;s truly the most productive way to build a GUI desktop application, and makes it extremely easy to build powerful console apps.')
