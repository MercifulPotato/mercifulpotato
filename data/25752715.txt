I&#x27;m Tony, CEO and cofounder of Cosmic (YC W19). Since launching our headless CMS on HN during our YC batch (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19330262" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19330262</a>), we&#x27;ve been working toward finding better solutions to content management problems.<p>Something we&#x27;ve noticed is that traditional CMS systems have long relied on a draft&#x2F;published model for content updates within a single database. For many use cases this is fine, but many of our users want to create multiple environments to stage updates for review, preview the changes, then push the changes to production. There wasn&#x27;t an easy way to merge content changes between environments in review stages (such as Development, Staging, Production). This is especially true when you want to make large bulk edits to lots of content.<p>For this reason, we built Merge Requests. Much like software teams use Git to work in branches, make pull requests, and so on, this lets our users work in isolated content environments to add&#x2F;update content, safely isolated from production. When ready, a merge request is submitted to review content changes. Reviewers can be added to review and approve updated content. Preview links are available to preview bulk edits in the user-facing application or website. After approvals, a merge is performed. If needed, restoring to a previous version can be done in a few clicks.<p>The feature is free to anyone with an account, but if you want to see how it works without signing up (we know you, HN!), check out the screenshot videos on the blog announcement (linked at the top). To go deeper, sign up for a free account (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cosmicjs.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cosmicjs.com&#x2F;</a>). You can also install the Next Merge Starter (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cosmicjs&#x2F;next-merge" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cosmicjs&#x2F;next-merge</a>) which includes merge request preview capabilities. Read the docs to get more information on how to implement the merge request preview for your applications currently available via the REST API and NPM module (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.cosmicjs.com&#x2F;rest-api&#x2F;objects.html#get-objects-from-merge-request-beta" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.cosmicjs.com&#x2F;rest-api&#x2F;objects.html#get-objects-...</a>).<p>This is work in progress and we would greatly appreciate any feedback that you may have in the comments below!')
