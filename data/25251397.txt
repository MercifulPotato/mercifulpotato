Item(by='opportune', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606720199, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25250093, text='There is a cottage industry of financial advisors who do work with people on their personal wealth management. Of course there is a big difference between an investment bank, trading firm, and a person who does wealth management (I&#x27;d google it for precise terms, but I&#x27;ll get hounded by ads for it for weeks). I know because my parents have a &quot;wealth management guy&quot;&#x2F;broker and some of my friends&#x27; parents growing up were also in that business. And there are also of course mutual funds and pensions as you mention.<p>I am not super plugged into the financial industry so I can&#x27;t say for certain, but I think while people may not understand the difference between traders shouting on phones, &quot;wall street&quot;, and wealth management, people think about wealth management the most in the context of &quot;wall street&quot;, because that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re personally most familiar with. They think that even though wealth management seems to me to be very decentralized and not really something physically centered around Wall St.<p>I think wallstreetbets is mostly a pretty unsophisticated subreddit (which somehow declined in quality even more as it grew) but I think the parent was valid in pointing out that they willingly eschew the old-school strategy of diversification + &quot;value investing&quot; done by a third party on your behalf and the new-school (boglehead) strategy of putting literally everything in the S&amp;P 500 or a bond index with the allocation mix dependent on retirement date&#x2F;age.<p>There has undoubtedly always been a group of people micromanaging their personal portfolios with less risk-averse strategies like this, and WSB mostly takes things way too far, but at least for me it exposed me to the idea that maybe I could personally do better picking stocks on my own than just blindly throwing everything into VOO (and for people not plugged into the online-personal-finance-geek community, it could be the first time they even realize they don&#x27;t need to have a third party manage their investments for them).')
