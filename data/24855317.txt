DreamWorks was essentially built to do exactly what he had already been doing at Disney: Make and&#x2F;or distribute big blockbuster films. Film production is a pretty standardized thing, as is distribution, so if you know how to make movies then you can just plug into the distribution ecosystem and off you go!<p>Building and distributing apps is, however, not a consistently repeatable solved problem. Unlike movies, scale, budget, stars, and connections don&#x27;t dramatically increase your chances of success... even if the content is great.<p>So no, I don&#x27;t think Katzenberg has the type of &quot;founder&quot; experience that would naturally give him an advantage in learning how to understand a market that he has no experience with.<p>Tangentially, I was just looking at Dreamworks&#x27; filmography, and it&#x27;s VERY impressive. My mind is specifically blown, though, that Steven Spielberg released Minority Report and Catch Me If You Can <i>six months apart in the same year.</i> That is... pretty incredible.')
