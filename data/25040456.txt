However, if you know that the Pixel a-series is going to stay at the $350-400 price point, you could buy two $350 a-series Pixels 3 years apart and potentially get more value&#x2F;longevity than an iPhone at the $700 price point.<p>Of course, you could also buy a 2020 iPhone SE at $399 that&#x27;ll last you 5-6 years, so if you just stick with the cheapest iPhone you&#x27;ll likely save money over the a-series.')
