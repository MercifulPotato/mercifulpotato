Syntactic sugar for an assert statement in the constructor. It&#x27;s usually quick and straightforward to replicate the feature in a modern language with generics and first-class functions.<p>When people refer to &#x27;type safety&#x27;, they almost always mean compile-time safety. Not just ensuring that a value of 6 cannot exists, but ensuring that none of your code is trying to create one. The unwieldy enumeration allows that.')
