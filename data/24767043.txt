Apologies for not making that clear. Your post is great to clarify this all more specifically.<p>The cultural side of things definitely requires a lot of time. And that’s fun.<p>What also takes time is learned how ideas are shared. Not just grammar, but which version of the multiple correct grammar options that is more common.
