What I mean is, I can focus just as little when I am playing games and just get distracted by my smartphone. It&#x27;s been like this as a kid too, the game isn&#x27;t really that enjoyable when you can&#x27;t focus and pretty much miss the story.<p>Medication could have that effect but I experience quite the opposite. It almost makes me feel &quot;bad&quot; that I am playing a game and doing something more productive. That&#x27;s generally how these meds work, they &quot;stress&quot; you into doing tour work, so you don&#x27;t do it the day before you have to turn it in.<p>But I guess it&#x27;s different for a professional gamer. It maybe doesn&#x27;t feel unproductive when it&#x27;s your main source of income.<p>Another thing is, the H in ADHD stands for hyperactivity. To play a game however, you have to sit still.<p>I do still play some games, but only those that are non competitive and casual. For example, I really like playing Stardew Valley, it&#x27;s very calming and because it is open ended, there is no FOMO.')
