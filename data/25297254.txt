Item(by='xyzzyz', descendants=None, kids=[25297532], score=None, time=1607040179, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25296335, text='&gt; V, L and H-1 (including H-1b, but excluding H-1b1) nonimmigrant visas are explicitly, by statute, excluded from the rule requiring nonimmigrant visa holders to lack immigrant intent;<p>The US Code Title 8, Sec. 1184(b) has nothing to do with the &quot;dual intent&quot; thing. What happens there is that people on visas like B2 are _presumed_ to be immigrants, and need to actually argue that they are not in front of consular officers in the embassy and the immigration officers at the border. The holders of V, L and H visas are exempt from this, and they are presumed non-immigrant by default. However, contrary to what you say here, L and H visa holders are still required to lack immigration intent.<p>The dual intent rule stems from completely different piece o US code, see the section 205 of Immigration Act of 1990:<p>&gt; (h) The fact that an alien is the beneficiary of an application for a\n preference status filed under section 204 or has otherwise sought permanent\n residence in the United States <i>shall not constitute evidence of an intention\n to abandon a foreign residence for purposes of obtaining a visa as a\n nonimmigrant described in subparagraph (H)(i) or (L) of section 101(a)(15)\n or otherwise obtaining or maintaining the status of a nonimmigrant described\n in such subparagraph</i>, if the alien had obtained a change of status under\n section 248 to a classification as such a nonimmigrant before the alien&#x27;s\n most recent departure from the United States.&#x27;.<p>This is the source of the dual intent doctrine. Note what it says: it says that application for permanent residency <i>shall not constitute evidence of an intention\n to abandon a foreign residence</i>. The reason it says so is because prior to that, such application has in fact been used by Department of State to presume immigrant intent on behalf of H1 visa holders, and to deny them entry. This is the &quot;legal fiction&quot; rayiner is talking about: H1B visa holders are still required to have no immigration intent, and while the US Code Title 8, Sec. 1184(b) frees them from the presumption that they do have one and  requirement to prove that they do not have it, the dual intent doctrine was still necessary in order to bar government agencies from concluding that they intend to immigrate based on their application explicitly saying that they intend to immigrate.<p>&gt; But...it does say that in the statute.<p>No, H1B is still a non-immigrant visa, see section 1101(a)(15) which defines the non-immigrant visas.<p>&gt;  the exemption of H-1 and L visas from the no-immigration-intent requirement has been express in statute since the Immigration Act of 1990, so for the last 30 years the behavior you complain about has been strictly as directed by statute.<p>Right, the amended statute doesn&#x27;t make it actually illegal, but still the whole procedure is based on legal fiction of not concluding immigrant intent where there obviously is one.')
