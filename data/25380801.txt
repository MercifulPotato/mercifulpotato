Feudalism was an agricultural society. Peasants worked on farms. &quot;There&#x27;s no grocery store poor people can get to easily without a car&quot; wasn&#x27;t really a thing back then.<p>At-will firing? That&#x27;s capitalism, not feudalism. In feudalism peasants were attached the land. &quot;Go peasant for a competing lord&quot; wasn&#x27;t a thing either. More like at least the US idea of Europe being someplace where it is impossible to fire an employee once they get hired. That sounds like feudalism.<p>Days of vacation? &quot;While we may be accustomed to images of medieval peasants toiling away from dawn until dusk and be convinced from this that we have it better than they ever did â€” a 13th-century laborer could have up to 25 weeks off per year&quot;. Working all the time is capitalism, not feudalism. Europe is way more feudalist on this measure too.<p>Payday loans are feudalist? You think serfs got payday loans? Or car loans? Someone told a peasant back then, &quot;Oh sure, here&#x27;s a house, it&#x27;s yours, pay me back over the next 30 years&quot;?<p>Right to work? What does that have to do with feudalism? If you were attached the the land, you had to work it for the benefit of the lord, it wasn&#x27;t whether you paid dues to the Peasants Local 1347 or not.<p>Criticize capitalism all you want, but it is not feudalism.')
