They&#x27;re advancing the state of the art for some obscure corner of mathematics for the solution to some simplified model which itself is an abstraction of an abstraction.<p>It is astonishingly difficult to find &quot;down to earth&quot; mathematics for just about anything related to theoretical physics.<p>Meanwhile, a lot of what physics &quot;does&quot; is actually very simple mathematically, it&#x27;s just that that simplicity is intractable symbolically. (Nonlinear differential equations are notoriously difficult to solve algebraically, but relatively straightforward numerically.)<p>If you think about it, particle physics <i>must</i> be simple because while the Universe contains advanced maths degrees, it doesn&#x27;t <i>have one</i>. A particle zipping around and bouncing off of things doesn&#x27;t solve monstrously complicated Feynman Integrals moment-to-moment! The rules it follows can&#x27;t possibly be that complex.')
