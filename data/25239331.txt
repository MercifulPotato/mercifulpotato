Thinking in dynamical systems or evolutionary terms, a language and mental model of the universe just won’t stick around unless it’s useful. Imagining that the universe happens to be horribly complex, but has some emergent phenomena that happen to be simple, we’re almost inevitably going to think in those simpler terms and go “wow the universe is simple!”<p>Then if the foundation underlying those simple emergent concepts turns out to be horrible complex, maybe we get stuck with the foundations at some point. Or maybe simplicity is relative and a visitor from a different hypothetical universe would be astounded at all the shit we have to simulate because the answer isn’t just obvious.<p>Like how macroscopic objects are an emergent phenomenon, but they’re simple. Maybe the universe at a fundamental level follows some ultra convoluted string theory. Doesn’t matter for us, the same way that flipping a coin is 50-50 regardless of questions about foundational physics.<p>It’s taken a long time to develop the hierarchy of physical and mathematical concepts in which we can usefully describe much of the universe as simple. And those concepts, the best we have so far, still don’t tell the whole story.')
