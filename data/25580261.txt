However I lack any confidence that the british government will be able to roll this out at any sort of speed.<p>The government has had almost a year to plan for the rollout. Obviously there are some different logisitics for storing the various vaccines, however the last mile infra is exactly the same.<p>There is a plan to train 30k st johns ambulance volunteers, however if they want a smooth rollout, they should have been trained already. This hasn&#x27;t happened yet.<p>Getting the jabs in the people is only part of the problem, the jab needs to be prescribed, but doctor time is rare (as they are all being hoovered up to provide 45% extra intensive care beds)<p>Not only that, after the jab, you need to watch the patient for anaphylactic shock. This requires nurses, again very much lacking in numbers.')
