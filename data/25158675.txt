(I am not a math teacher, just someone who went though French school and was very interested in the school system in some other European countries).<p>It comes in pieces: you get to learn differentials and their meaning, usually then used in physics curriculum to denote speed and force.<p>Then you get limits and how to calculate them for infinity or when approaching a non-continuous function from both sides. And l&#x27;HÃ´pital rule, etc.<p>Again, it has direct implications in physics, and sometimes in biology (I saw that only once, when the teacher introduced enzyme kinematics).<p>Then second differentials to analyze convexity.<p>All this takes a huge chunk of math in high school, and you cannot du much in functional analysis without using differentials - so I am genuinely interested what was the pressure put on in your school (would you mind naming the country?). Trigonometry for instance? Or probability? (these are the two others I can think of that are the other important pieces they learn).<p>Some of the schools ended by introducing integrals, usually though the concept of calculating surfaces. It was quite useful to have a rough idea of integrals before going to university (where they were introduced anyway)')
