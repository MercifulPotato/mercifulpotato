I don&#x27;t see the real IP that it is receiving traffic on.<p>Also, if I have multiple IP&#x27;s with EIP&#x27;s attached so I can host multiple services (with unique IP&#x27;s) I have to write automation to make sure I bind the service to the right internal private IP for the appropriate external IP address. It&#x27;d be much better if the IP address were routed directly to my EC2 instance.')
