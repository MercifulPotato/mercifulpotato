There are always going to be invariants that the application may wish to enforce which cannot be enforced in the database (or, if there was some ideal schema to enforce them, the migration from the existing schema would be enormously costly). <i>This is the whole reason we have ACID transactions in relational databases - so the application can enforce its invariants</i>!<p>(Exercise for the readers: construct a set of invariants that <i>cannot</i> be enforced within a database schema.)')
