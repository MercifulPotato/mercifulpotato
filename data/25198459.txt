I consider myself a bit of an audiophile, your friend might be an audiofool... I have even heard someone claim that spotify sounds better than CD.<p>There is this audiophile article [0] that takes compares some different consumer level NAS devices. They used the same listening setup to play lossless audio files from different NAS devices. The article&#x27;s authors perceived a difference in sound quality and characteristics, depending on the NAS and RAID configuration!<p>The article is a solid example of a placebo effect. The bitstream is identical between the setups.<p>When it comes down to digital to analog conversion, there&#x27;s a lot of variables going on. I can definitely hear the difference between my laptop&#x27;s headphone output and the headphone output of my prosumer-level audio interface. A more expensive audio interface might introduce measurably less cross-talk and noise. Some headphones will sound weak if the headphone amp is not powerful enough.<p>In other words: some people focus on things that are measurable. Others seem to be deliberately chasing the placebo effect of expensive equipment.<p>0. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enjoythemusic.com&#x2F;hificritic&#x2F;vol5_no3&#x2F;listening_to_storage.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enjoythemusic.com&#x2F;hificritic&#x2F;vol5_no3&#x2F;listening_t...</a>')
