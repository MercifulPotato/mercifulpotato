Those have been in a slump and fewer launches existed. Maybe that will pick back up, but the largest part of that were for Internet and after that TV, both don&#x27;t seem like huge growth markets.<p>Small sats have become so powerful, that on a SpaceX Rideshare you can deploy basically a whole constellation in one shot potentially. Most sats today are no longer that large and heavy that you have dedicated launches.<p>Many of their launches are government, both domestic and foreign.<p>SpaceX has not reduced the price &#x27;that much&#x27; in the last couple of years. They were already the cheapest on the market and opted for more profit, so they could have better cashflow when going into Starship and Starlink.<p>What also has to be considered is that even that 12 is a pretty large number. Large rockets usually didn&#x27;t fly that at the rate SpaceX flies them.<p>The sat market is slow the respond, 4 years are very little in it. Hopefully people will come up with more great ideas how to use the capability SpaceX offers.')
