The workflow is usually like this:<p>1. Work on my branch.\n2. Checkout to master (with `git stash` if needed)\n3. `git pull`\n4. Do whatever I wanted to do with the updated branch (switch back and rebase, or test something, or start a new branch etc.)<p>In a code-reviewed, merge request-oriented workflow there&#x27;s little point in splitting `git pull` into separate commands.')
