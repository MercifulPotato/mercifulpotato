If anything I am complaining the government is not doing enough in the right direction to improve the proportion of Americans in tech jobs.<p>Every H1B petition from American companies is precisely saying the same thing: they need that worker to run the company effectively and they had no other choice.<p>I suppose each count of the petition ever made is legally binding. Should this be another such anti-trust lawsuit you mentioned, it will be very big! I don&#x27;t think they are joking this time.<p>Those H1B workers contributing to the state of the art technology are not replaceable anyway practically should the US want to innovate within its jurisdiction. Companies hiring for these positions are not declaring a ceiling on the number of positions, at least to pubic.. so anyone qualifying their interview gets the job, to large extent if not all the time. But fewer Americans study STEM or apply to those jobs meeting prerequisites. These companies consistently publish in media that they have shortage.. and the H1B petitions point they had no other choice.<p>Those H1B workers in IT consulting earning somewhat lower wages are easier to replace but still practically hard. Their petitions tell the same story: they had no other choice.<p>The right policy framework I believe could work is first making the foundation stronger:<p>- Heavily subsidize university STEM tuition for Americans next 5-10 years.<p>- Encourage them to pursue STEM in school. There is no way one focuses on English literature in high school and shows interest in engineering at university.<p>Then there might be enough talent pool that creates local companies and give strong competition to Indian IT companies.<p>How many home-grown IT companies are there in the US? What&#x27;s their size and valuation? The pipeline must be fixed from the beginning.. not just at the end.<p>With enough local sellers could the competition from outside gets weakened.')
