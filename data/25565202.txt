Item(by='sangnoir', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609202388, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25563586, text='&gt; Part of the reason is likely that black people, particularly dark skinned black people, are just harder to photograph than people of other ethnicities<p><i>If</i> that were true, that would just mean photography-based systems are currently not good enough to work across any population that includes dark skinned people. Society should not, and cannot collectively wrings hands and say &quot;Oh, well, it&#x27;s really because of the photons&quot; and go ahead make use of a provably unjust technology.<p>Thankfully, modern <i>phone cameras</i> can take great  high dynamic range photos <i>as well as</i> low-light&#x2F;night pictures - I&#x27;m confident to say capturing dark-skin is a much easier bar to clear (dynamic range can be much smaller if you only care for a person&#x27;s face). The fact that good-enough technology is not used (or mandated),  and the solutions providers &amp; their clients decide on cheap(er) sensors with exposures that only work well with light skin tones... well, that tells a story by itself, doesn&#x27;t it?')
