Because I read a lot of AOC, and have never seen anything I would remotely consider a violent statement. But you may consider things differently, what exactly &quot;violence&quot; means, let alone in a statement, is to some extent not entirely set in stone, I agree.<p>Can you provide an example (or three) of a violent statement from AOC you have personally witnessed, as you say?<p>She is a real person, it seems only fair to provide an example when making such an accusation.')
