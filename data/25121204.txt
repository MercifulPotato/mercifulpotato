We’ve all been hearing the ills of the large delivery platforms for a while now and I wanted to throw my hat in the ring and see if it was possible to do something. Some colleagues and I quit our jobs towards the end of 2019 to start the project and we’ve been operational since around May.<p>We’re structured as a solidarity cooperative, meaning restaurants, employees (drivers, support, devs, etc.) and consumers are all members who can vote and take part in the profits of the venture (if any).<p>We have quite a ways to go before we’re a totally viable alternative to the other platforms but we’ve been having progress and positive feedback from our members. Looking forward to hearing your feedback and ideas.')
