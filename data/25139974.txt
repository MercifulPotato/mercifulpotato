The idea of negative audio frequencies takes some getting used to, but works out very well in some DSP systems.<p>Negative frequencies are like when a 3 phase generator runs backwards... everything plugged into it also runs backwards... the sign of the frequency tells you the direction of rotation, and the frequency is the speed.<p>If you had 2 antennas 1&#x2F;4 wave apart, and used them for I and Q, you would then be able to tell which direction the signal was coming from along the I&#x2F;Q antenna axis.  With 3 or more antenna, you can determine compass direction of the source.<p>The same is true for 2 microphones, at any frequency where the microphones are 1&#x2F;4+N wavelengths apart.')
