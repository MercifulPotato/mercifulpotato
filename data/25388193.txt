Once you&#x27;ve learned a few languages, you can solve problems in any language. It&#x27;s just about having the manual and maybe an overview of available facilities so you don&#x27;t have to read all the docs upfront. The syntax doesn&#x27;t matter for data plumbing applications. COBOL is as good as BASIC as good as Java as good as Python etc. You might prefer writing Python (or Haskell, Clojure, Rust, C++, Go, Scala, Kotlin, whatever is en-vogue these days) because it is more concise, but if you can effectively hack in one language you can do it in COBOL too with a little effort.')
