I cycle regularly for fun and exercise, I do about 45 km at an average speed of about 30 km&#x2F;h, and I have a couple of near misses every time I go out.<p>Whether it&#x27;s someone opening their door on me, someone pulling out in front of me (either because they haven&#x27;t seen me or they don&#x27;t realise how fast you can go on a bike), or someone passing me so close I&#x27;d be able to rap on their window, or a myriad of other reasons.<p>I&#x27;m fully lit up day and night, I have high vis socks, reflective shoes, reflective strips on my bibs and jersey, I have a rear radar, my front light at full beam is as bright as a car headlight on main beam, and I cycle about a metre out from the kerb. Not sure what else I can do.<p>Having all those same issues, plus travelling at a much greater speed? No thanks.<p>Not judging people who enjoy motorcycles, I&#x27;ve bombed down a country lane which I know well (has no turn offs, good surface) at 80 km&#x2F;h on my bike so I can well understand the thrill being on a motorbike must give you. I would just never get on one myself.')
