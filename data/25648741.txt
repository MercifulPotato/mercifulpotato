It seems like his morally incompetent have admirable moral intentions (help depressed people with CBT), but suffer basically from implementation failures. They don&#x27;t know how to help effectively, and are taking all of wrong lessons from working in tech (searching for direct &amp; measurable impact, searching for technological solutions etc) and could probably be gently taught how to help more effectively. Dividing the world of people who want to help into binary &#x27;competent&#x27; and &#x27;incompetent&#x27; groups will just serve to discourage people who want to help but don&#x27;t know how.<p>I also don&#x27;t feel like I have a sense of what a &#x27;morally competent person&#x27; actually does, or how they design strategies to help effectively. The article feels like a lot of unfortunate self-flagellation for being &#x27;morally incompetent&#x27; and not as much constructive dialog about how to actually help better.<p>Edit: To OP - maybe there is a perspective where you don&#x27;t have to be so down on yourself here? Maybe this idea &#x27;failed&#x27; from a cashflow &amp; user acquisition perspective, but if it helped all of the people who downloaded and used the app, didn&#x27;t you do good in the world? Maybe you didn&#x27;t do good at billion dollar scale, but does that matter if you improved people&#x27;s lives?')
