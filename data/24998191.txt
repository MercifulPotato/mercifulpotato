You won&#x27;t hit the ground running, so you better prepare for disappointment.<p>This mirrors my experience as well - also there is a dollar cost to each try, and no undo button, which puts more pressure on each attempt.<p>I still enjoy doing hobby woodworking, but it&#x27;s not quite as zen in the beginning as I imagined.')
