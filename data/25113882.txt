I worked for him once upon a time and later I did low voltage electrical construction. He says that the standards change too often, and it’s different enough to be considered a totally different field.<p>When I went to do low voltage later I realized what he meant. Stereo and security installations just isn’t something you want your electrician, whose knowledge mostly revolves around huge, 1000+ amp panels, to be doing. There’s way more money in commercial installs, so most electricians only do residential work to tide them over.<p>My dad doesn’t even want to terminate anything more complicated than 4 conductor phone wire, and would pull me into a job just for that reason.')
