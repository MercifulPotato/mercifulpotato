We are users <i>and</i> customers. Google has many services where the customers are advertisers, and we are the product.<p>Their actual paid services (G Suite aka Workspace, Google One, etc.) are not their bread and butter, so tracking us is an existential issue for them.<p>&gt; <i>Google is more consumer focused.</i><p>No, they&#x27;re not! See above. I would call them one of the least consumer-focused companies out there. They don&#x27;t follow through with products, and most of their products aren&#x27;t even for consumers! They&#x27;re for advertisers.')
