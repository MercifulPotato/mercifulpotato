My answer was to this statement by the original commenter:<p>&gt; Twitter is already very judicious when it comes to any use of the word &#x27;kill&#x27; nowadays=s, or anything that could be violent. Just requires a report.<p>Which is not true. Even those counterexamples of conservative tweets being violent and Twitter not removing them proves my point itself. That no matter how much you report Twitter won&#x27;t remove violent posts. It doesn&#x27;t matter if the tweet is from left or right. Which is the entire premise of Amazon booting Parler from using AWS. That Parler isn&#x27;t removing such low engagement violent tweets (and cites 98 examples in their email). While Amazon signed a deal with Twitter renewing their cloud contract inspite of Twitter not removing thousands of low engagement violent tweets (be it on the left or the right). This is hypocritical.<p>However, whenever Twitter has censored it has censored right wing accounts. Name one prominent left wing account that Twitter has banned. Can you name even one? I&#x27;ll wait.')
