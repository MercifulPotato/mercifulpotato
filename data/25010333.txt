What even is the A78C?<p>The writer implies it’s a processor competing with Qualcomm’s 8cx, but the branding and Arm’s slides point to it being a variant of the A78 core. If that’s the case there should be a chart showing exactly how it diverges.<p>Additionally, the author seems not to know much about the 8cx. Half of its Kryo 495 cores are variants of Arm’s A76 and the other half are A55s. They definitely aren’t all custom big cores as the author claims.')
