Even in async context in complex enough applications functions can call other functions including your own, so async is not enough to guarantee reentrancy.<p>I do agree that parametrizing over the blocking strategy is a great idea, but languages that simply provide an async syntactic marker don&#x27;t necessarily allow that, and if your language is powerful enough you do not need the annotation in the first place.')
