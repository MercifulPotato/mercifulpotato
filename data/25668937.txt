TrainerRoad is fantastic (and check out their podcast!), Zwift is fun (races, group rides), also Sufferfest, Rouvy and others. However, since the resistance of the bike isn&#x27;t readable or controllable by other software, the Peloton is just for all other usage than the Peloton app just a dumb spinning bike. Instead I&#x27;m using a Kickr Core and my normal bike, no lock in there, and much cheaper.<p>Someone has also now made a physical device to adjust the resistance, so it can be used with other software [0]. I think Peloton really should use ANT+ and open up, would make the bikes usable for many more people. Of course, maybe it&#x27;s the subscription Peloton wants to make money on, not the bikes?<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dcrainmaker.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;shift-smart-trainer-first-project-to-make-a-peloton-bike-zwift-accessory.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dcrainmaker.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;shift-smart-trainer-firs...</a>')
