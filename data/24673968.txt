Item(by='kspacewalk2', descendants=None, kids=[24675457], score=None, time=1601751664, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24671304, text='&gt;[TV manufacturer] should just sell me a smart tv without customer hostile &quot;features&quot;.<p>The price will be much higher then. Right now, you&#x27;re sold the tv at a discount (at a loss, I&#x27;m pretty sure) because the manufacturer will make money off you down the road by stealing and selling your data to advertisers. It&#x27;s kind of like with social media (though to a lesser degree) - don&#x27;t make the mistake of thinking of yourself exclusively as a customer. You&#x27;re a product, too. Their advertising partners are the true customers.')
