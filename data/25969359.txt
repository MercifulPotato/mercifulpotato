Obviously, I was (and still am) a huge fan, but if you&#x27;ve managed 15 years of Linux on the desktop with &quot;nary a problem,&quot; you have had the most unbelievable luck of any human on the planet, and should start buying lottery tickets.<p>After running Gentoo for several years, and switching to Ubuntu, I was amazed at how much time I was saving not dealing with portage. Fair enough. I mean, I was asking for it by using a source distro, but I had that same sigh of relief when I finally bought a Mac, and realized that I was still doing a lot of maintenance to keep Ubuntu happy, even though it was (obviously) a huge improvement over Gentoo. I just couldn&#x27;t see it until it was gone.')
