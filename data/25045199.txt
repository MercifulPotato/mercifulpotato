This increases toner cart replacement price by ~4 EUR<p>- Third party toner quality varies a lot even from the same seller it&#x27;s hard to find a cheap supplier with constantly good quality<p>- After 7 years and about 3k pages printed, a white vertical line &#x2F; streak started to show up on the printed pages<p>Based on recommendations here I guess my next printer will be from Brother.')
