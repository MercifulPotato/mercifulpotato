Or both...<p>It&#x27;s not &quot;against&quot; anything. It&#x27;s pointing out that &quot;make impossible states unrepresentable&quot; is poorly satisfied by most typed languages themselves. The more of the language you lift into the parser (decidable! easily-analyzable memory bounds!), the less you need to worry about types.<p>As a trivial case consider a language where `5 + &quot;&quot;` would fail typecheck. But why even get so far? Why does your parser accept `lit-term := lit &#x27;+&#x27; lit` and not `lit-term := [str &#x27;+&#x27; str] | [ num + num ]`, etc.')
