I feel bad for Steve. Promoting crypto-networks have gone poorly for pretty much every pseudo-celebrity that&#x27;s done it.<p>This company is run by a bunch of random people. The very first thing I see is where to buy the token. There&#x27;s a bunch of growth charts that have nothing to do with the platform itself (more people are expected to use energy in the future, just in case you didn&#x27;t know). These type of blockchain pitches are way too familiar at this point.<p>Honestly without real standards&#x2F;regulation blockchain is just going to be synonymous with fraud and failure. Bitcoin is its own thing, not just &quot;blockchain&quot;. Companies are leveraging its success as if they&#x27;re offering the same features (like immutability) or growth prospects just by offering &quot;blockchain solutions&quot;.<p>Hopefully Steve can avoid the McAfee&#x2F;Segal ending.')
