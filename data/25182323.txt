It&#x27;s a blunt instrument, to address a blunt injustice that occurs at all levels of society. Just because you aren&#x27;t all men, doesn&#x27;t mean you haven&#x27;t had advantages that women are denied.<p>It&#x27;s just that these advantages are normalized in the system, so they aren&#x27;t as apparent as the corrective measures. It&#x27;s really easy to miss them, just like, for example if you play a shooter on an easy mode first, you don&#x27;t necessarily know how it would be harder.<p>That said, you want to talk to your director or learn about your career?
