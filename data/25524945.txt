Each time I have spent several weeks there - not a two day trip like airport-hotel-client-hotel-airport.  I had a chance to spend weekends with colleagues, and observe how locals spend time.<p>During the first stint (1998) I was impressed how proudly anti-communist the Taiwanese were.  Proud of their independence and held Chiang Kai-Shek in high regard.  The Chiang Kai-Shek mausoleum was bustling with crowds - I enjoed strolling around there on weekends.\nDuring my second stint (2008), the Chiang Kai-Shek mausoleum was a sorry sight - almost nobody around, most of it closed off for &quot;renovation&quot; and it felt desolate.  I also detected a significant shift towards unification with China among my colleagues.\nI can only hope that Taiwan paid close attention to Hong Kong.\nI&#x27;d hate to see such a bustling, open and full of great people country fall under Chinese control.')
