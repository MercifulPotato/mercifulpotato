Actually go read the Robinhood settlement period info.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;robinhood.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;support&#x2F;articles&#x2F;withdraw-money-from-robinhood&#x2F;#:~:text=Following%20a%20sale%2C%20your%20funds,will%20appear%20as%20withdrawable%20cash" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;robinhood.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;support&#x2F;articles&#x2F;withdraw-money-...</a>.<p>This is not explained clearly, but it is essentially 3 days to settle (T+2).  So if you sell a position you don&#x27;t have the cash to buy for three days.  If you have traded on Robinhood you have probably noticed that you &quot;immediately&quot; have the buying power from the shares you sold.  That&#x27;s not your cash, because it hasn&#x27;t settled.  For three days that&#x27;s margin and therefore you could get a margin call.<p>The instant deposit is limited to $1000 (margin).  But there were people saying they were forced to sell out of much larger dollar holdings.  Those were probably people that sold out of one stock holding and then immediately bought into GameStop, AMC, etc...  So they likely believed they were buying with cash, but they were in reality buying on margin.<p>Just to be clear, I don&#x27;t think this is a good thing at all.  A brokerage should not be invisibly providing you with margin, it should be very clear to users that this is happening.')
