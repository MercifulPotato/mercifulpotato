I&#x27;ve seen plenty of people use loose instead of lose for this reason. I learned English as a second language and the emphasis was on written first so quite a lot of times my spelling was better than that of native speakers. And that makes no sense, one shouldn&#x27;t learn English that way, write it first then speak it.  Personally I don&#x27;t care if people make these kind of mistakes as long as their communication doesn&#x27;t lose the meaning.')
