It immediately appears as a hazy simulacrum when listened to be an interested critical ear. Which can work to your point; there vast production use cases for ML-quality media issues background dressing, eg music for cheap&#x2F;free video games, infotainment videos , or any application where cheap production libraries will suffice. Huge amounts of human labor have been thrown at making throw away media assets.\nSimilarly a large proportion of serious, foreground art works consist of mundane background chores that ML can achieve with incredible efficiency.<p>But when ML generation is placed to the foreground, as the main focus, it appears like an unnerving vacuous simulacra. I canâ€™t yet see it being something beyond shovel-like, in its function and form')
