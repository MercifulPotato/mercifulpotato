Good luck finding an investor for that.<p>Why the market fetishism? The state of affairs needs price controls.<p>Prices do drop with innovation. Consider the praziquantel story. The compound was discovered in the early 1970s by a Bayer-Merck joint venture as part of a discovery effort for tranquilizers. It wasn&#x27;t psychoactive but very efficaceous against flatworms (schistosoma and tapeworm) and then promptly shelved because of its high price, the synthetic route was complicated.<p>South Korea had a schistosoma problem at that time and couldn&#x27;t pay Bayer for the compound or patent license, in the early 1970s Korea was still a threshold country, so at first they pirated it and then, because the original isoquinoline route required expensive starting materials the Koreans developed their own route. The glycine route made it possible to produce it cheaply for their own people and also opened up the worldwide veterinary market. This was actually the foundation for the Korean chemical industry.<p>The market works. It&#x27;s well understood, just it works not in  the way you think.')
