They often look very sleek, and people will comment &quot;wow, they should make it like this&quot; or &quot;I would use program X if it looked like this&quot;. The problem is that these mockups are often useless. They are just drive-by. No substance, no thought of a user-journey or how to accomplish tasks. Mostly all functionality has been hidden and some pretty colors added. (And these mockups never reach the projects anyway, just shared with other designers)<p>Whats needed is first and foremost UX people, not graphic designers drawing a pretty UI. That is the final touch. But making good UX is hard, and need a good understanding about how the software is used, and what&#x27;s technically feasible. All this takes much involvement and speaking to multiple people and back-and-forths over time.<p>My day-to-day involves a UX person discussing a feature with me, and us arriving at some rough sketches for how it should be. I will often start implement, and find an edge-case not considered or something, which will trigger a new discussion. My point is that UX isn&#x27;t something someone can do in a vacuum on their own, or as a complete rewamp. It needs to be continuous in the process for every user-facing feature, and thus involve everyone.<p>Attracting UX people to that kind of long commitment is the hard part. While for a developer I often feel it&#x27;s them just making a feature to scratch their own itch, with no consideration for the whole.')
