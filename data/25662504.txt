There&#x27;s no satiating the blood lust of a fascist movement like Q Anon--thats why people refer to fascism as a death spiral.<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m saying your blaming of the &quot;left&quot; is wrong: you&#x27;re just trying to shoe horn yourself into the protagonist of reality by saying that this mob of lunatics agrees with your pet issue. They are literally storming capitol buildings, yet you think that they will suddenly trust the government in the future.')
