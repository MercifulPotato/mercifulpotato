But they aren’t, so they don’t.</i><p>The jobs available on the market aren&#x27;t continuously and uniformly distributed on the pay axis between $0 to ${whatever corporate CEOs take home}. Most people can&#x27;t marginally improve their pay by marginally improving their capabilities.<p>&gt; <i>If they didn’t have the option of working low-wage jobs and supplementing that income with public assistance, they would be unemployed and completely dependent on public assistance.</i><p>Not if they had an option of working higher-wage jobs. The market pushes salaries down as much as it&#x27;s allowed. Apply some upward pressure, and the market just may find it in its heart to pay more for the same job.')
