Yes, i tried various gargles. I&#x27;ve been given antibiotics, and all sorts of stuff. Nowadays my doctor just gives me Vicodin when i complain that my tonsils are inflamed. I then subside a week on nothing but warm soup. (I cannot take vicodin - makes me feel like i am thinking through a fog. i hate the feeling).<p>Sadly, tonsillectomies on adults are actually quite complex and dangerous, but as a chronic tonsil sufferer, i assure you, removing them would not be a placebo. And every year, i have a week when i check hourly whether Laser tonsil ablation is available and approved in USA yet.')
