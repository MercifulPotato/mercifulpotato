Item(by='marcell', descendants=None, kids=[25769489, 25769165], score=None, time=1610578179, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25767719, text='While Tether may indeed be a fractional reserve, that doesn&#x27;t seem like an existential threat to bitcoin.<p>At any given time, a small scale bitcoin holder (&lt;1000BTC) can liquidate their entire position on Coinbase and withdraw USD to their bank account within a few days. A large holder would have to be more careful, but the market is big enough to liquidate 10,000 BTC over a week or two with minimal price impact.<p>Given this, we can see from revealed preferences that most small and large bitcoin holders are <i>not</i> liquidating their positions for USD. Whether or not Tether is a fractional reserve doesn&#x27;t really change this.<p>That said, if Tether is revealed to be a fractional reserve, it would almost certainly be a huge short term shock to the system for bitcoin. Liquidity between exchanges would be shot, and the news would scare many investors away from the market. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see an 80% short term drawdown in that scenario, similar to when Mt Gox crashed. But again, this doesn&#x27;t really change the long term dynamics I described above, since holder&#x27;s ability to liquidate BTC for USD was never an issue.')
