As far as I&#x27;m aware, no graduate would be eligible unless they&#x27;ve produced some kind of world renowned thesis.<p>Let&#x27;s say you join Google as a SWE on an O-1. If you just perform your duties for the duration of the visa, you won&#x27;t be able to extend. You&#x27;ll have to, during the visa, continue to do something &quot;above and beyond&quot; (in SWE, maybe tech talks&#x2F;events, host conferences, etc.) and show proof of all of this, plus obtain written documentation from employers about how amazing you are. It&#x27;s not for everyone.<p>The O-1 works for internationally regarded film directors who want to move to the US and produce work here, but it doesn&#x27;t work really well for software development.')
