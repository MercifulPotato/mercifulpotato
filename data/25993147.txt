Google taught me a lot that would be hard to learn elsewhere, and I also have enough savings that I can try and fail many times without it mattering, and very few people have that luxury.<p>I try to be cognizant of that in my writing and avoid making it sound like what I&#x27;m doing is easy or accessible to the average person. That said, I can only write about the experiences I&#x27;ve had, advantages or not. As much as possible, I try to share what I did and learned and not tell anyone else what they should do.')
