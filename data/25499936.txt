But people love Tesla and it&#x27;s the first choice EV because they&#x27;ve really thought through the UX of a semi-self driving car EV thoroughly&quot;.<p>No need to theorize at this point. Plenty have pointed out how overinflated Teslas value is at this point. It&#x27;s pretty much cult of personality that is propping them up at this point. Tesla is actually very similar to Apple in that they &quot;pioneered&quot; a new market and that has created an identity of leadership in that market. I&#x27;m not sure Tesla is going to be able to keep up as the competition continues to grow rapidly.')
