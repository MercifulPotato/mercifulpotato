One of the reasons the F-35 has had such a complex production history is that it&#x27;s designed to be both the last fighter platform flown by humans and the first flown by AI.<p>One of many, many ways that the F-35s cost and development timeline has been blown up by trying to do too many different and incompatible, or at least non-complementary, things with one platform.<p>As lots of critics were pointing out as a problem with the project from the beginning.')
