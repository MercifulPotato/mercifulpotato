The reason you would use this vs. Debian or Ubuntu is because you&#x27;ve got systems that need to mirror your production, but you don&#x27;t want&#x2F;need enterprise support on them.<p>When I worked for a hardware vendor we had customers who ran hundreds of CentOS boxes in dev&#x2F;test alongside their production RHEL boxes.  If there was an issue with a driver, we simply asked that they reproduce it on RHEL (which was easy to do).  If they had been running debian or ubuntu LTS the answer would have been: I suggest you reach out the development mailing list and seek out support there.<p>Whether you like it or not, most hardware vendors want&#x2F;require you to have an enterprise support contract on your OS in order to help with driver issues.')
