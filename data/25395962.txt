Or even just the headline and sub-headline: &quot;[It&#x27;s] Un-American, Wrong, and Will Backfire.  Silicon Valley couldn&#x27;t have designed a better way to further radicalize Trump voters.&quot;  Many of the points I might make, Taibbi did so in his article.<p>For the sake of novelty, I&#x27;ll make a different point: I see one way in which YouTube may have promoted democracy: by making their odiousness more clear (and in a public, &quot;everyone knows that everyone knows&quot; way), they may have encouraged quicker production or adoption of alternative platforms.  This seems unlikely, because websites like them have done lots of crappy stuff before, without usually causing much effect; but it is <i>possible</i> that this may be seen as enough of a &quot;They&#x27;ve declared war on the entire right wing&quot; to motivate a significant migration.  Two partisan platforms is better than one, for democracy and just for competition.  (Better yet would be either a platform that has made some kind of enforceable and very-painful-to-break commitment to neutrality, or some kind of decentralized system that no single company or party can decide to censor.  We may get there eventually.)')
