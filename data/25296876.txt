Given the size and weight of the hull, physics is operating at a different scale and “sharp” looks quite different from our daily experiences.<p>It reminds me of a Fermi estimate that my physics professor presented of how tall the tallest mountain on Earth or a generic planet of mass <i>M</i> could be. He started with the intuition that when the weight of a mountain overcomes the typical strength of chemical bonds, what we typically experience as “solid” rock will behave like a liquid and collapse.')
