Now, if we would allow the software to accept a smooth fingerprint as assign it to a person then this would allow anybody to impersonate that person without additional identification means. This is not a software bug, but a security feature.<p>Of course the software should be able to detect that there is no fingerprint and require the operator of that software to check for the identity by other means.<p>Sometimes we don&#x27;t always have human operators and more things are automated.')
