It doesn&#x27;t have to be a technical term for it to still have meaning (outside of Michael Lewis&#x27;s intent to change its meaning). It specifically refers to a broker trading based on the knowledge of their client&#x27;s intent to trade.  The examples you give actually are instances of the true definition.
