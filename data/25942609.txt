Item(by='imtringued', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611845662, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25937882, text='&gt;As a result of the belief among the pro investor crowd that GameStop was, essentially, doomed, they began shorting the stock -- essentially betting on it to fail. This happens all the time to a variety of stocks with very little fanfare. It is the way of the modern stock market.<p>This article somehow missed the abnormal part where there were more short positions than shares in circulation. It&#x27;s like doing fractional reserve banking with stocks except without any regulations. A short squeeze is just a bank run with this analogy. This does not happen all the time. It&#x27;s entirely dependent on those who kept shorting the stock without making sure that they can cover their shorts.')
