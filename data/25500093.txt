Unless you are fairly wealthy, are really on the low end of the academic quality spectrum, you&#x27;re going to get at least a modest &quot;feel good&quot; scholarship that lets you claim you went to college on a scholarship. It&#x27;s referred to in the industry as the &quot;discount rate&quot;, and the average for privates is about 50%. Public colleges and universities often clock in around 10% to 15%.')
