Trying to separate &quot;logic&quot; vs. &quot;emotion&quot; when dealing with humans is a fools&#x27; game in my opinion.<p>Not only that. Another aspect is that emotions and &quot;instinct&quot; are much, much older, from an evolutionary perspective, than our very recent reasoning abilities, and way more widespread amongst the animal kingdom than reason.<p>So, while far from perfect, they work. Emotions and instinct kept most of our ancestors and most of the currently living animals both <i>alive</i> and <i>thriving</i>. Which means that, despite their limits, they have their place and shouldn&#x27;t simply be discarded by a wave of the hand.<p>Took me some time to understand that. And I still have a hard time taking it into account in my everyday life and interactions.')
