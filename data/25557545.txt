Many countries have effectively ended starvation, and all of them did so by replacing most small scale farming farming with industrial agriculture. No country has ended starvation without this replacement.<p>So while AGRA may have issues, and the article does suggest a few, I&#x27;m very confident that a plan to keep most people stuck as low-productivity subsistence farmers will be worse. No strategy for &quot;distribution of power resources and control over agricultural inputs&quot; will overcome the fundamental problem that a nonindustrialized farm of staple crops produces too little value to keep a family fed and happy.')
