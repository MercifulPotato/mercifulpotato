Item(by='chrismorgan', descendants=None, kids=[25729071, 25731179], score=None, time=1610374089, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25728129, text='&gt; <i>Solar averages ~10W&#x2F;m^2 long term (days&#x2F;weeks)</i><p>That figure surprises me. What I’ve heard before is that full sun is roughly 1kW&#x2F;m², and that over time you should expect to get 4–5 useful hours (depending on latitude and weather conditions of where you are—some will be outside this range on either side), so if you take 21% efficient solar panels, the total would be 1000 (watts) × 4 (hours) &#x2F; 24 (hours) × 0.21 (efficiency) = 35W.<p>10W is a lot less than 35W. I presume I have some incorrect assumption or am overlooking something.<p>(I’m interested in this because I’m planning to build a velomobile and live out of it while going round Australia for a year. Power systems are something I’ve been putting a fair bit of theoretical research into, but I have no practical experience whatsoever. I’ve been planning to build solar panelling into the body.)')
