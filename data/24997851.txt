Starting with something <i>some</i> parents or sponsors can afford is a reasonable starting point. If this works for affluent parents, it&#x27;s not hard to get Gates or Schmidt or similar to drop $$$ for a pilot with less affluent students.<p>Changing education systems is a long process, but simply saying anything without a payback for <i>all</i> students within a 12-24 month timeframe, although aligned with the values of tech, is not a helpful model in education.<p>Policy decisions in education take 5-20 years to make, but they do get made. The slowness is a function of how long it takes to see impact (and not wanting to hurt students). If we could put all politics aside, the model would be:<p>* Develop a model (1-4 years)<p>* Pilot it (2-4 years)<p>* Research it (2-4 years)<p>* Scale it (many years)<p>Simply saying we won&#x27;t do #1 or #2 since it isn&#x27;t #4 isn&#x27;t productive.')
