While it does have a _very_ simple durable queue in the optional disk buffer feature, it is nowhere near the durability, fault tolerance, performance, etc of a full Kafka cluster and we would not recommend thinking of them as the same type of system.<p>That being said, we do know of a few cases where Vector&#x27;s in-flight processing and routing capabilities were enough that a full Kafka-based pipeline was no longer needed. This ability to push computation out to the edge and reduce the need for centralized infrastructure is one of the aspects of Vector that we&#x27;re most excited about.')
