So here’s a minor clarification for you:  The short interest (140% or more for GME) is calculated on the public float.  There is a significant chunk of GameStop shares that are not publicly accessible, but could be borrowed against (the shares do exist).  If you consider the total outstanding shares of GME, then only 99% or so of the company was shorted.  So it’s a crazy high amount, but there is no proof that any (actually illegal) naked short selling was occurring.  So long as the people holding the non-public portion allowed their shares to be borrowed, then nothing illegal is going on.  If, in the unlikely situation that EVERYONE needed to close their short positions at once, these non-public shares could actually be sold if the owner wanted to.  Of course, they could dictate a really high price if the public market volume isn’t enough to close out the short positions in the standard three day period.<p>The reason that short interest  is calculated on public float is because that makes the most sense for normal situations.  We just happen to have stumbled into one of those unusual situations.')
