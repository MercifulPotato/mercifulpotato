On iOS those people can extract your data as local backup, but they won&#x27;t be able to install any unapproved apps that run in the background and that monitor you. On Android it&#x27;s trivial to install spyware apps via sideloading and regular users most likely aren&#x27;t able to detect or uninstall them.')
