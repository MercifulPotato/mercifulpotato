I don&#x27;t really get it.<p>Conservative leaders, at least in the US, seem far more authoritarian and xenophobic than left leaning leaders. I&#x27;m curious what you see as authoritarian about the modern left.<p>Also, it is interesting that you associate shaming with authoritarianism. Shaming is intrinsically a grass roots thing - it&#x27;s the people, not some autocrat, that shames people. Authoritarian governments don&#x27;t need to shame people, they simply imprison them or take other direct coercive measures.<p>Societies shame people because they <i>cannot</i> physically do anything to them. That&#x27;s a huge distinction.')
