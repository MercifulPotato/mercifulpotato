Kids these days are all glued to their mobile phones, it seems if you want to blow a kid&#x27;s mind, something that turns their phone into a magic box they can tinker with would be so much better. Something maybe like a combo keyboard with IO breakout ports funnelled over bluetooth, and some matching software development environment closer to GWBASIC or maybe even VB3 than the usual Android toolchain<p>I&#x27;m also concerned this doesn&#x27;t mention much about how accessible the internals are. Can a kid crack it open?<p>Meanwhile, totally digging the nostalgia factor. Probably won&#x27;t buy one, but damn I&#x27;d love one')
