Item(by='Micsys', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1608419519, title='Freelancer.com', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I too have problems with freelancer.com as an employer. They don&#x27;t answer and if they do it is a standard answer, in many cases unrelated. - Now about releasing milestones too early, I got burned here too but now I have another case, I have a freelancer who can&#x27;t do the project and doesn&#x27;t release the milestone as I requested. I can not open a dispute because their system has many bugs and is not made for all operating systems. So I contacted them many times without success. I even wrote to head office but they just do not answer ! So the money is there but I can&#x27;t get it back because of the way they handle this ! I am sorry but freelancer.com has work to do.  Best regards.  Mike')
