If all you&#x27;re doing is reading, then the overhead will be pretty much the same as if you were using the Espressif SDK, because you&#x27;ll find the bottleneck is I&#x2F;O, not the extras that MicroPython provides.<p>A cold boot is slower, and takes a couple seconds, but after that most of the latency is comparable to if you were doing it with the SDK.<p>MicroPython is heavily optimised, and doesn&#x27;t supply a lot of the mutable madness that makes CPython so slow. (For example, a for loop in CPython is slower than a list expression. In MicroPython, they&#x27;re the same speed.)')
