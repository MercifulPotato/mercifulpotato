Intelligence is way too diverse to be broken down into a linear scale, even when it comes to just engineering or &#x27;talent&#x27;, as he calls it here.<p>- Personality is way more important than he makes it out to be. It can&#x27;t just be broken down into 3-5 factors. This isn&#x27;t a scientific process. In my experience, this is where most of the value of personal interviews is.<p>- I found the last section disgusting to read. He&#x27;s advocating for manipulating the candidate into accepting the job by asking successively harder questions, even though you&#x27;ve already made up your mind. What a great start to your business relationship. And then justifies this by saying that &#x27;people want to suffer&#x27;. This is almost like negging in romantic relationships. Just awful.<p>Slava, if you&#x27;re reading this, I&#x27;m disappointed. I respected you for your experience and your writing but this is making me quite sad.<p>EDIT: As lots of people have written here in the comments: On a second read, I agree this could indeed be satire. If so, well played Slava, well played!<p>I don&#x27;t think so though, unfortunately. This is what the &#x27;everything is measurable and science has all the answers&#x27; mentality brings, if taken to an extreme. These days, science, data-driven approaches and &#x27;measure everything&#x27; are more religion than anything else. Even if this article is satire, I think there&#x27;s enough people out there that think this way.')
