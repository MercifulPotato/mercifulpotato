That&#x27;s not game changing, but it&#x27;s a significant environmental improvement if you&#x27;re using renewables to produce it. It&#x27;s a fine way to utilize daily or even seasonal renewables overproduction in a useful way without blowing up tons of existing infrastructure. Many diverse steps - some small, some large - are needed to get ourselves to a carbon negative lifestyle.')
