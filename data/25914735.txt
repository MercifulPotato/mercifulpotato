The voter file was completely inaccurate. It was very common to go to a residence where voters:<p><pre><code>  a. had moved\n  b. had died\n  c. had multiple 12+ voters currently registered at one apartment address, none of whom live there.\n</code></pre>\nFrom my perspective there are real issues with sending unsolicited mail in ballots to homes because the government does such a bad job managing the voter file. Often it is deliberately mismanaged because &quot;purging&quot; a file is a loaded political term. Who wants to be that guy who deletes voters?<p>Moreover, my role as a campaign staffer was to collect votes. Often, people would ask &quot;what do I vote for?&quot;, and I would just point and tell them what to vote for. This is also common. It also feels unethical.<p>Based on this experience, I strongly support voting in person, with an ID.<p>Don&#x27;t trust me. If you would like to see this for yourself, volunteer with a campaign (any party) and canvass an apartment building in a swing state.')
