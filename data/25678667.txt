Developers often complain that users cannot at all understand computers - these kinds of practices are part of the reason that is the case.<p>It&#x27;s not that far conceptually from the tech support scammers that show you errors in your system&#x27;s Event Log to &quot;give the impression&quot; that you&#x27;re insecure, and then offer to sell you bogus security products at inflated markup. Same kind of ethics underneath.')
