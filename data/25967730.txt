Then the exact same app again using a Linux machine, text editor, C, and SDL2.<p>Doing things in C was far better - I just opened up the relevant SDL header files when I needed information, and was able to get basically everything non-iOS specific up and running without any internet.<p>I definitely drew on a fair bit of experience and hunches (e.g. writing audio synthesizers from scratch often involves picking a bunch of magic numbers, and if you pick them wrong it can sound completely awful).<p>Now I have a mac laptop again, I still would lean towards C+SDL2 over swift+SpriteKit (though I do continue to experiment).')
