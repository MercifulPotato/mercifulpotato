It looks really cool and there&#x27;s been a lot of work put into it, so I had to see for myself.<p>I kind of wish it didn&#x27;t depend on Nix and Cachix and stuff like that, compared to deploying as a Stack template. I can see how it simplifies setup of a lot of the environment but considering the various issues I had trying to run it through WSL2, it left me at a point where I couldn&#x27;t really understand what was going wrong.<p>I&#x27;m back to messing around with Servant, but that&#x27;s also because I&#x27;m not the target user for rapid web dev in this case. I want to learn Haskell my own way.')
