Decent rule of thumb is never do the same task more than twice.<p>There&#x27;s also tons of value in being a domain expert that can read and write code - if you&#x27;re in a highly technical field there&#x27;s almost certainly a company trying to automate your expertise. Try and find the people doing it and help them out!')
