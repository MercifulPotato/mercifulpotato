Item(by='nathcd', descendants=1, kids=[25182249], score=4, time=1606088495, title='Ask HN: What to do with old technical magazines and journals?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I inherited a lot of old computer magazines, journals, and books, dating mostly from the mid-80s to the mid-00s. They&#x27;re really neat to flip through, but I don&#x27;t really need them and they&#x27;re mostly taking up space. I haven&#x27;t had issues getting rid of the books (donating to libraries and a used book store) but I&#x27;m not sure what to do with the magazines and journals.<p>I&#x27;ve got hundreds of issues of:<p>- SunWorld<p>- SysAdmin<p>- SunExpert<p>- Server&#x2F;Workstation Expert<p>- ;login:<p>- ACM Queue<p>- Communications of the ACM<p>- Computer Communication Review<p>- ACM Computing Surveys<p>- The Internet Protocol Journal<p>- IT Professional<p>- Radio Experimenter<p>- Inside Solaris<p>- Packet<p>and fewer assorted issues of some others. I&#x27;m not trying to make any money, just trying to figure out if there&#x27;s anywhere that would value them so I don&#x27;t have to throw them away. Any ideas?')
