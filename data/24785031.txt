Once you have access to the user account of whoever is running any software that does any kind of crypto (or in some cases root, depending on kernel hardening settings re: debugging&#x2F;ptrace), you can always get the keys.<p>Those concerned about this attack vector should use hardware tokens, like a YubiKey.
