Plastics are composites so if you were to extract the elements out of them then you would end up with carbon and hydrogen which unfortunately aren&#x27;t plastic. With lithium all you have to do is extract the lithium elements.<p>Aluminum and iron recycling is viable because they are elements in their own right.')
