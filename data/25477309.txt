If I use terraform or vagrant, I see that I can use base images from different cloud providers, but I don&#x27;t know to which extent these base images are similar&#x2F;different.<p>I could find the &quot;source code&quot; for the images provided by Google Cloud (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GoogleContainerTools&#x2F;base-images-docker&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;ubuntu) so I know exactly what comes in the image. I couldn&#x27;t find similar &quot;sources&quot; for Vagrant Cloud and DO images.<p>For example, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.vagrantup.com&#x2F;ubuntu&#x2F;boxes&#x2F;xenial64 doesn&#x27;t tell me anything about what&#x27;s inside the image (in the way Google Cloud does)... it does however point me to http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud-images.ubuntu.com&#x2F;xenial&#x2F; (but here I cannot see how the images were built).<p>In any case, is it fine to use, for example, the &quot;ubuntu&#x2F;xenial64&quot; base image from Vagrant Cloud for my dev environment, and the equivalent Google Cloud Ubuntu 16.04 image for my prod environment? I will provision them equally, but my concern is that there could be small differences in the base images themselves. Same goes for the DO base image if I need to use DO as cloud provider.')
