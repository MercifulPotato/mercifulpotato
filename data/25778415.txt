What I mean is: 7 years ago I wrote an image pipeline for a company using traditional AI methods. It was extremely challenging. When we saw SSDMobileNet do the same job 10x faster with a fraction of the code, our jaws dropped. Which is why the dev ship turned on a dime: there&#x27;s something big in there.<p>The industry is stagnated for exactly the reasons brought up: we don&#x27;t know how to squeeze out the last mile problem because NNs are EFFING HARD and research is very math heavy: e.g., it cannot be hacked by a Zuck-type into a half-assed product overnight, it needs to be carefully researched for years. This makes programmers sad, because by nature we love to brute force trial-and error our code, and homey don&#x27;t play that game with machine learning.<p>However, places where it isn&#x27;t stagnating are things like vibration and anomaly detection. This is a case where <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;YumaKoizumi&#x2F;ToyADMOS-dataset" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;YumaKoizumi&#x2F;ToyADMOS-dataset</a> really shines because it adds something that didn&#x27;t exist before, and it doesn&#x27;t have to be 100% perfect: anything is better than nothing.<p>At Embedded World last year I saw tons of FPGA solutions for rejecting parts on assembly lines. Since every object appears nearly in canonical form (good lighting, centered, homogeneous presentation), NN&#x27;s are kicking ass bigtime in that space.<p>It is important to remember Self-Driving Car Magic is just the consumer-facing hype machine. ML&#x2F;NNs are working spectacularly well in some domains.')
