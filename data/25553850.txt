(For many reasons) the owners re-engineered their plants to substantially reduce overall accident rates.  &quot;Days since a lost-time accident&quot; became a key performance indicator.<p>A key engineering process was introduced: HAZOP.  The chemical flows were evaluated under all conditions: full-on, full-stop, and any other situations contrary to the design.  Hazards from equipment failures or operational mistakes are thus identified and the design is adjusted to mitigate them.  This was s.o.p. in the 1980s.
