I moved to a Seattle suburb and had &quot;Wave G&quot; (post-Wave CondoInternet).<p>I had throughput issues, first on my apartment. That got resolved via Reddit. Then the backbone is slow from time to time which persisted. Sometimes I get a Gigabit, other times I only get 10-20 Mbps.<p>What did Wave say? Let&#x27;s bring a tech out. I told them &quot;it&#x27;s a backbone issue&quot; and they didn&#x27;t understand me. I don&#x27;t know how I would explain how networking works to a field tech who only knows how to enable a port or run basic diagnostics.<p>Another time, I tripped Port Security, and told them they can re-enable my port. Wave said &quot;we need to bring a tech out&quot; as if that will magically solve everything.<p>This is made worse by my apartment&#x27;s exclusivity deals: only Comcast and Wave, nothing else. Ziply Fiber (bought Frontier) and Atlas Networks were denied.<p>Bigger companies like Verizon FiOS in NYC had better tech support, I could still get hold of a Level 2 tech for a much smaller issue (and not even on FiOS).<p>Wave G makes AT&amp;T&#x27;s forced router (but not the flipping bits) seem decent in comparison. I don&#x27;t want Comcast but I&#x27;ll happily take AT&amp;T Fiber over Wave G even if it means trading my pfSense box for a crappy AT&amp;T gateway (worse case scenario I could bypass or root the gateway, or pay $15 for static IPs).<p>I fortunately moved (for another reason) and have Google&#x27;s Webpass. Webpass may not give me a full Gigabit, but it&#x27;s usually 400-800 Mbps all the time and not 10-20 Mbps 95% of the time with an occasional Gigabit. I wish CondoInternet sold to Webpass instead of Wave (I don&#x27;t want a merger now, but still).<p>Surprisingly, I may have preferred CenturyLink Fiber if available mainly for GPON over a 60GHz PtP microwave link (less oversubscription!), well unless PPPoE+6rd kills my pfSense. But Webpass works pretty darn well, and I think I&#x27;ll stay unless CenturyLink suddenly gives me 2 Gbps FTTH or something, or I move.')
