A precautionary measure that prevents a worst case scenario doesn&#x27;t suddenly become stupid because the scenario it was designed to prevent does not happen. We hedge our bets all the time, and strategy people who don&#x27;t hedge will end up driving busloads of people off a cliff sooner or later. Reckless gambling has no place in policy decisions.<p>We also had some pretty fair warning from industries that use long-term thinking. Banking software was already breaking in 1969 (30 year mortgage logic). For many industries this was a long emergency.<p>Even by a cynical view that these were pork projects that didn&#x27;t &#x27;need to get done&#x27;, so what? We do these all the time. The cash infusions prop up industries or divisions, and often serve as cover for attacking deferred maintenance. Over beers you can complain about how stupid it is to have to get things done this way, but at work you take the money and run as far as you possibly can.<p>What bothers me most, I think, is that if you&#x27;ve worked in software for very long at all, you should know all of this.

When they didn&#x27;t blow up, I agreed to make plans involving alcohol for the evening. By the time Europe didn&#x27;t blow up, I figured we were gonna be okay, so Happy New Year to me.)')
