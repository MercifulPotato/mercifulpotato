The estimated IFR is close to zero for children and younger adults but rises exponentially with age, reaching 0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85. We find that differences in the age structure of the population and the age-specific prevalence of COVID-19 explain nearly 90% of the geographical variation in population IFR. Consequently, protecting vulnerable age groups could substantially reduce the incidence of mortality.</i><p>I think those results are in the same ballpark as what Ioannidis calculates. This isn&#x27;t good news, really, not for middle-aged-adults anyway.<p>IFR(age) = 0.1 x 10^((age-82)&#x2F;20)')
