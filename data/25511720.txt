I understand that in the abstract, people talk about all sorts of situations that may or may not be grounded in reality. Which is why I point out real life situations and real life case.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever met someone who has campaigned against random DUI checkpoints. You&#x27;re not allowed to leave until you&#x27;ve completed the DUI-test at the checkpoint. There was no evidence for a crime. So under most definitions of &quot;detained&quot; or &quot;detention&quot;, it seems to fit the bill.<p>I&#x27;ve heard that DUI measures can be too strict or that gaining a criminal record from DUIs is too harsh, but never really heard complaints about police enforcement of this particular issue. (DUI leading to jailtime is more of a judge &#x2F; jury issue than a police officer issue anyway).')
