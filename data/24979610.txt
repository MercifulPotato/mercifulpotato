It eventually uses all of its money to either pay dividends (or stock buybacks, their financial equivalent), salaries, business expenses.<p>We tax corporate <i>profits</i>, not income. That takes out of the dividend stream, so we tax capital gains (the tax the investors pay on dividends&#x2F;stock appreciation) correspondingly lower.<p>You could in theory get rid of the corporate tax and just tax capital gains at the same rate as income. It would fix a lot of problems. But you would upset a lot of people who don’t understand finance and taxation, like the people seeing red in this thread, who have some moral gripe with these corporations (who are mostly just doing what the law incentivized them to).<p>It would have one small effect though. Since the US taxes the worldwide income of its citizens and permanent residents, it would probably overtax them, making them pay the higher capital gains rate for profits made in countries that do retain the corporate tax. The most obvious ways to fix that would just reintroduce the problem of sorting out where the profit was “made”, which is where we are now. Ideally, you’d get all of the western countries to sign up to end this stupid corporate tax at the same time. That’s difficult because a few important countries have used low corporate tax rates as a way to attract business that would otherwise have no reason to be there.')
