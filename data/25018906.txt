You&#x27;re reading revisionism into a statement that is very nearly too short to contain any.<p>You&#x27;re also misreading it: my comment was about the Senate, not the electoral college. And I left out the part about how the Senate was explicitly anti-democratic, not just anti-majoritarian, in that it was originally elected by legislators and not the people.')
