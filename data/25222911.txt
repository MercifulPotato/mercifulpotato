The other problem is that it&#x27;s difficult to see what actually changed when a line is marked out of date without having to scan through the entire updated diff and then jump back and forth between the diff and conversation view.<p>Collapsing them by default makes it difficult to find the comment by scanning.  If they were uncollapsed until I marked them as resolved, then I could at least use the find feature in the browser and search for my username to find my comments.')
