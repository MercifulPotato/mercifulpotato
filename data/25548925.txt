Item(by='SilasX', descendants=None, kids=[25548954], score=None, time=1609044355, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25548719, text='&gt;I disagree about Chapel&#x27;s cost. A 5 cost Chapel would lead to extraordinarily unbalanced games where a good starting hand basically sets you up to win.<p>It already has that. If you draw 2 coppers in your first hand (and thus five in the second or vice versa), you can start out with the awesome five-cost card <i>and</i> chapel.')
