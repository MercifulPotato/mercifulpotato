Item(by='mehrdadn', descendants=None, kids=[24942583, 24943299], score=None, time=1604064376, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24941560, text='Sure :-) even then, you have even more fun... imagine if the next item was Sep 1-Dec 1 and the list was known to be sorted! The parser would need to be stateful to be able to disambiguate!!<p>Even worse (well, maybe similar, but more surprising): imagine if on Feb 28, you parse &quot;Feb 29-Mar 1&quot;... <i>both</i> of those dates could land in an entirely different year than &quot;Feb 28-Mar 1&quot; would, depending on whether the current year is a leap year...<p>I dare say I have not yet seen a single parser in my life that handles such issues. In fact I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen a parser that can parse a <i>date interval</i>, or that can even do &quot;parse this string assuming it is after that date&quot;, or anything like that.<p>And all of these problems are before we even consider time zones, leap seconds, daylight savings, syntactic ambiguities, etc... not just how they affect individual dates, but also ordered dates (&#x2F;intervals) like above...')
