Vibrant tech and VC community - not at the same level as SV but a not-too-distant second-or-third.<p>Uh, no.<p>Austin has a lousy VC community.  There are countless articles about it.<p>And, as for tech, for software it&#x27;s mainly only Tivoli alums--and a lot of the best ones decamped for greener (read: better salary not in Austin) pastures.  IBM as a technical presence has been gone forever (the Advanced Workstation Division was quite amazing and IBM Somerset was one of the PowerPC development arenas).
