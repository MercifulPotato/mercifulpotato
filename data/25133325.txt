The onboarding was not so smooth. I was constantly following up here and there to get things done (e.g access to tools with IT), more importantly to get to the part with whom do I need to follow up and how to follow up; figuring this out was another follow up.<p>I created an onboarding guide last week (for my team) which was a very small thing for me (created a document on confluence in an hour). But the amount of response I got was overwhelming (IMO bit too much compared to how i expected to be yet-another-document).')
