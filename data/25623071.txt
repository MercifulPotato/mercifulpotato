Broad federal consumer protection laws could be expanded. For example, misrepresenting an affiliation with a business by omission could be made an offense regardless of the industry. The test would be &quot;would a reasonable person think this (intermediary) is affiliated?&quot;. This is inspired by Australian Consumer Law.')
