Matlab code has brevity, but sometimes at the expense of clarity. For example, sum(x,axis=1) is more clear than sum(x,1). Especially when matlab has functions like diff() where the second argument is <i>not</i> axis.<p>Broadcasting in python is a lot more clean than the &quot;bsxfun(@plus, ...)&quot; abomination in matlab. If you think all the &quot;np.&quot; is too wordy then just do &quot;from numpy import *&quot;. For matrix multiplication you can use &quot;@&quot;. Numpy code can be dense but most people choose clarity over brevity.')
