If you have a data model where parts of the data is graph-like, and other classic relational, why would you not want to store the entire thing in the same database?<p>SQL is an implementation of relational algebra, and databases that implement it are relational databases for storing relational data.<p>Pointing at the name of a thing isn&#x27;t an argument, I admit it, but asking &quot;what could go wrong if we want to use a system tailored to relational data to deal with non-relational data?&quot; strikes me as the sort of question that might turn out to have a compelling answer 6 months in when it is too late to easily change the database.<p>If I were involved in a project, I would be representing very hard that the data comes out of the relational DB using &quot;SELECT * FROM table WHERE conditions&quot; and then the clever graph things start happening. If the data needs to be read from disk using clever graph based algorithms, then use a clever, graph-based database. There are a bunch out there according to Wikipedia.')
