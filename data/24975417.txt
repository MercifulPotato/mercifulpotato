Their recommendation is dated 01May2020.<p>As support for the OP protocol, they have a document collecting recent data on the use of ivermectin, dated 30Oct2020.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;covid19criticalcare.com&#x2F;flccc-ivermectin-summary&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;covid19criticalcare.com&#x2F;flccc-ivermectin-summary&#x2F;</a><p>The lead paragraphs are:<p>&quot;Recently, a wave of negative results were published from trials on numerous COVID-19 therapies, essentially eliminating any role for remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir&#x2F;ritonavir, interferon, convalescent plasma, tocilizumab, and mono-clonal antibody therapy. One year on, the only therapy considered “proven” as an effective treatment in COVID-19 are the use of corticosteroids in patients with moderate to severe illness.<p>Since March 2020, our expert panel, the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (www.flccc.net) led by Professor Paul Mahatrik, has continuously reviewed the rapidly emerging basic science, translational, and clinical data in COVID-19 with the aim of ensuring that our MATH+ Hospital Treatment protocol both continuously evolves and stays current. As of October 28th, 2020, based on the increasing and recently reported data from a number of published and unpublished trials, we have concluded that the drug Ivermectin, an anti-parasitic drug with increasingly well-known anti-viral8–16 and anti-inflammatory properties has demonstrated profound activity against COVID-19. Based on these data, we have devised a new prophylaxis and early treatment protocol against COVID-19 which we have named the “I-MASK+” protocol which we believe may serve as a global solution to the pandemic. The evidence base in support of this conclusion shows that Ivermectin:<p>1. Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, leading to absence of nearly all viral material by 48h in infected cell cultures.<p>2. Prevents transmission and development of COVID-19 disease in household members of infected patients.<p>3. Hastens recovery and prevents deterioration in patients with mild to moderate disease treated early after symptoms<p>4. Hastens recovery and avoidance of ICU admission and death in hospitalized patients.<p>5. Leads to striking reductions in case-fatality rates in regions with population-wide distribution and use.&quot;<p>This protocol is apparently being used extensively in South America with good results.<p>While Marik and The Front Line Covid-19 Critical Care Alliance may be jumping the gun here, it&#x27;s worth reading the document I linked above.<p>Edit:  I would also draw your attention to Fig. 3 in that doc - Haiti has been using Ivermectin to treat lymphatic filariasis on the national level.  They have almost no COVID compared to the neighboring Dominican Republic (or the US).')
