Paper filtered down to 75. Interview screened down to 30. Detailed interviews with 5.<p>How would you propose this work? 30 people seemed like a possibly good fit after 20 minutes. Should we randomly hire one? Should we hire all and have them fight it out madmax thunder dome style?<p>I think if the position has low startup time and is assembly line work or something we could hire all 30 and fire the poor performers. Outside of tech support, I’m not aware of any positions like this.<p>I’ve worked with managers who thought programmers were like this and would hire 10 or 20 at a time to see who stuck. It was very frustrating as an existing employee because they all had to be trained, reviewed, etc. After a year of arguing, I (and every other senior, over about two years) left that company.')
