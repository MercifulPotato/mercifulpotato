Item(by='peterkelly', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607433462, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25344155, text='Thailand has done an even better job, with just under 4,200 infections total since January. It has land borders with four other countries, the most porous of which is Myanmar. Very recently there have been some cases of infected people crossing over illegally from the latter; health authorities have been doing very thorough contact tracing so it remains to be seen if this will escalate. But last week was the first time in months there was more than a handful of cases nationwide, excluding foreign travelers in quarantine.<p>Why has it worked so well here? I don&#x27;t know the full answer, but by and large people have been very responsible. The last time I was at an airport, back in early February, every single person was wearing a mask, and in lots of public places the majority of people continue to do so. Mask wearing has not been politicised here. Also every shopping mall and most restaurants&#x2F;public places scan you for temperature on entry and have a book where you can (optionally) write down your name or register with an app to be notified if it is later discovered an infected person has been there the same day you were.')
