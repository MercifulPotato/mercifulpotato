Upon thinking about a lot of the people that I read content from, I noticed something in common with those saying this: they are all extremely ambitious people. Most of them are (serial) startup founders, a few are hardworking prolific academics, but it&#x27;s safe to say they know what having high expectations and moving quickly is like.<p>That is to say that there exists a large contrast with what they believe can and should be achieved with what the average politician or government worker has grown to expect: A paradigm of milquetoast results and  mediocre enthusiasm paired with general social gestalt that now <i>expects</i> bureaucratic and institutional failures to occur throughout the systems that we need so badly to help us.<p>Many have strong personal opinions on how we would start to improve this situation, but I think proper incentives, higher expectations, and skin in the game would be a good start.')
