I use it daily, and I would feel a bit less anxious if the language was standardized as this would facilitate alternative implementations outside Emacs. Right now, the implementation is the standard and that is a bit messy.<p>I don&#x27;t know about any other language that combines a plain text outliner, keywords, tags, timestamps, hyperlinks and tables. These are exceptionally good primitives to implement a myriad of workflows. And I&#x27;ve left out some incredible features I do not use, like literate programming.<p>Applications like Things or OmniFocus are nice, but they can&#x27;t adapt to alternative workflows. OmniOutliner was pretty great, and motivated some Org features during the GTD craze of late 2000s.')
