When I was growing up there was a very narrow window of acceptable ideas in the US, anything else was &quot;unamerican&quot;. &quot;The two parties are basically the same&quot; was a cliche when I was a kid.<p>The reaction to a relatively tiny number of new acceptable ideas in the discourse has been pretty surprising, even to someone who thought they already had a low opinion of American culture.<p>And yeah, sure, the ad-generated enragement feeds don&#x27;t help.
