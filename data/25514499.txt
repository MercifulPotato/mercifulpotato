I can&#x27;t find anything on their website about a (hopefully distant) future without Bill and Melinda. Are the covenants such that the organisation can continue and still have the same impact?<p>And the reason I care is that I always have doubts about the long-term effectiveness of charity contributions. It appears to me that their foundation has a more fundamental long-term impact than other charities. If I had some guarantees about the continuation, I&#x27;d be very interested in leaving my worldly possessions to this foundation, when my own time is up.<p>For reference: I&#x27;m in my 50s, have no children, and the thought about donating through my will is getting back to me more and more often.')
