Item(by='DennisP', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609466178, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25597891, text='&gt; ultimately a &quot;scalable&quot; cryptocurrency would be doing things exactly the same way as a credit card processor<p>That seems to be true of Bitcoin, but several others are working hard on scaling. The one I&#x27;m most familiar with is Ethereum, where:<p>- Zkrollups store transactions on-chain in a highly compressed format without loss of security. For simple value transfers, a zkrollup system in production now can handle up to 9000 per second, if the network isn&#x27;t doing anything else.<p>- Data sharding, coming in about a year, multiplies that by 64X initially. Rollups have minimal reliance on computation on chain, so just scaling the data is enough.<p>- Replacing merkle trees with more efficient data witnesses like polynomial commitments could multiply data capacity by another factor of ten.<p>= All of this is subject to quadratic scaling. As individual nodes get more powerful, it multiplies both the capacity of individual shards and the number of shards.<p>Of course several chains are doing away with mining, and several others have fixed the anonymity issue.')
