When they fail to pay that bill, which would be 5%-10% of their annual earnings, we all still pay for it. We just decided to layer in debt collection, anxiety, and depression onto the patient in lieu of cash.<p>As someone who still considers themselves a fiscal conservative, and also believes we need true universal coverage for all Americans, this seems like a no brainer to me at this point (and I say that as someone who would have not supported this in the 00s but has evolved significantly on this issue).')
