First and foremost, PowerShell basically has a command line parameter framework built in. You also have a runtime backed by one of the best standard libraries out there (.NET) - one in which you can easily reach into anywhere in your PowerShell scripts. It also has a module ecosystem supporting development in either PowerShell or C# proper. And now with PowerShell core it&#x27;s cross platform. PowerShell also supports pipelines, but I mention this last because it&#x27;s obviously not a distinguisher for it with bash. It&#x27;s really not even a contest, PowerShell is way more... well, powerful than bash. Since I&#x27;ve become proficient I would never go back to bash.')
