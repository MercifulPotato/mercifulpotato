It only has one hdmi port and the speakers are quite mediocre on it (rear firing). The color settings built into it are different things like &quot;shopping mall, outside, train terminal, etc.&quot;. All of its downsides are mitigated by a good hdmi av reciever and speakers, it runs hdcp just fine, no problems for me.')
