They may <i>start</i> as an attempt by a group of people to subjugate and extract wealth from a wider group of people, but they don&#x27;t grow and survive unless they offer all these &quot;extras&quot;.<p>In this way, they&#x27;re another step of the natural way people divide into hierarchies as the group size grows beyond a size that&#x27;s manageable through social conventions (which happens to be more or less Dunbar&#x27;s number).<p>Now that explains why they exist and why people accept them.
