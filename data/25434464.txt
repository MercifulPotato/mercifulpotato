You&#x27;ve got to start somewhere.<p>&gt; Anyway you&#x27;re right but it&#x27;s like, how would any of this concretely improve competition?<p>I don&#x27;t think this is just about competition. There has to be a recognition that social networks etc are natural monopolies, it&#x27;s very hard to have competition there. Regardless of HNs utopian view of open protocols and distributed and federated social networks, the reality is that it&#x27;s just not gonna happen.<p>So a I feel a big part of these laws isn&#x27;t about creating competition, it&#x27;s about making sure that mega-corporations like Facebook can&#x27;t amase more power than democratically elected governments. These law make it clear that if you get to big, the EU will step in and make sure you&#x27;re operating in line with their ideals, not the other way around.')
