Funded and led by the same people who were once the underdogs!<p>I am aware of history as much to know that the Internet was designed by a bunch of people who talked on Ham radio and wanted a secure place to sell drugs to each other without being caught by the fuzz. They hated Ma&#x27; Bell.  That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s designed the way it is. Then later it became the RIAA and the rest. I know all of that and if anything that&#x27;s <i>hardened</i> my position on this, not decreased it. We don&#x27;t live in the 1960s or the 1990s anymore, and what&#x27;s worse is everything the people said during that time about how society would be if we went &quot;full retard&#x27; into &quot;fight the man&quot; hipsterism and the subsequent deregulation of everything actually happened. Nobody laughs at Al Gore or Tipper these days, or Lars Ulrich for that matter.<p>Do you like musicians making a penny on a song leaving no room for art just lowest common denominator crap, the rise of the marxist&#x2F;fascist camps that are hurling what was once a promising country that was getting over it&#x27;s growing pains straight into 1920s&#x2F;30s Germany at lighting speed, the totally unfiltered and unmoderated filth that is 4chan, etc? Or do you just ignore it because &quot;some day blah blah blah dictator might take control&quot; yet we are the closest we have ever been to a dictatorship because of faceless social manipulation technique where we have no clue who or where anyone we talk to is, whether they&#x27;re paid, etc?<p>Not everyone is an engineer out looking for how things work. It&#x27;s the same error the founding fathers made with the enlightenment thinking everyone is going to become smarter if you just opened everything up. It&#x27;s complete baloney, people will just use the power vacuum to seize it for themselves because they make the most noise. Nobody cared about Aaron Swartz except the hacker community. Snowden sold out to the Russians from the <i>beginning</i>. And you&#x27;re sitting there still in the year 2000 when all this stuff was new and the only ones who spoke were nerds and we all agreed on basically everything.<p>The point is that everything that this theory set out to solve, became worse. More nationalistic, more poor musicians with even bigger giant platforms controlling their art, more corrupt, more propagandized, etc. Not less. Everyone knows it. The other point is that instead of tearing stuff down and engaging in subversive activities for the same ends, maybe it&#x27;s time to focus on making the systems you have better. Not turn it into some weird mix of The Matrix, Philip K. Dick, and William Gibson. They&#x27;re just as bad of an instruction manual as 1984 was to be honest.')
