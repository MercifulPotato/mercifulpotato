The fact that ARRAY_AGG (C) and COUNT(C) treat NULL differently is also a bit surprising, though in terms of usefulness I think the current behavior is not bad.<p>I also think the definitions is relatively clear: NULL means &quot;unknown&quot;&#x2F;&quot;missing data&quot;.<p>The MIN, MAX, and AVERAGE of an empty list is N&#x2F;A. SUM <i>could</i> have been 0, but then SUM(X) &#x2F; COUNT(X) would be different from AVERAGE(X).<p>The count of tuples (COUNT(*)) in an empty relation is 0.<p>The count of pieces of data on column X (COUNT(X)) of a table ((1), (NULL)) is 1.<p>If we have 2 tables A(ID, C1), VALUES ((1, 2)), B(ID, C2), VALUES ((2, 3)), and try to ask what value B.C2 has for A.ID=1, the answer can only be NULL.<p>IS NULL and IS DISTINCT FROM NULL are explicitly treating NULL differently, so it&#x27;s not that surprising that they can be both true and both false.<p>Records and Strings are not the same KIND of types, so I don&#x27;t see anything surprising about the fact that one can contain NULLs while the other can&#x27;t. It&#x27;s like complaining that a record in Haskell can have a Maybe field, while a String can&#x27;t have a Maybe character.')
