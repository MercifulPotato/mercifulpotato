Perm resident but not naturalized.  Arrived a year and a bit before Trump 2016 win.<p>This election was so polarizing I am very afraid the country can recover from it.<p>I am worried enough we have bug out bags packed, with critical documents, as I expect this could easily escalate to a civil war as both sides are convinced they are right; and more worrisome is that the other side is so completely corrupted that they are not Americans or humans and should be taken out like the trash.<p>We have Trump who will not concede and will fight this to his last moment; and then will continue to fight it from the side lines.<p>We have AOC on twitter asking people to send names for her registry of Trump supporters for future retribution.  You know who else kept such lists?  Hitler, Mao, Mussolini.<p>Really scary times down here.  Much worse than when Trump won in 2016.<p>The US needs all the help, prayers, and luck it can muster right now to find it&#x27;s way through this.')
