Nokia some interest in promoting these devices. The N770 was released in 2005, and the N800 came in 2007, just before the iPhone.<p>I was a student in Scandinavia and my CS department got gifted a few hundred N800 so that students played and developed applications. We developed some cool mesh networking tools, and a text chat on top. It felt so futuristic.<p>In parallel, I brought an iPhone 1 from the US and it never felt like a superior device. I recall sitting in a SAS plane in Spring 2007, whose departure was delayed for 1 hour due to technical reasons, and hostesses came to my sit as they were blown away by that little device I was watching some videos on. I also showed them my iPhone, and they were not nearly as impressed.<p>Then, suddenly, before the N9 release they totally dropped the ball. Still, that device won some accolades in the press.')
