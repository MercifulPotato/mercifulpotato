The OSI definition applies to <i>the license itself</i>, not the company&#x27;s motivations for its use, so that point is irrelevant.<p>2. I do not see how point 9 amounts to a restriction, for four reasons:<p>a. The &quot;other software&quot; is packaged together as a service by the company offering the service, not by the SSPL. The SSPL, in other words, recognizes what already exists. It does not create a new thing.<p>b. The example given by OSI relates to other unrelated programs simply sharing the same media. The SSPL targets programs that are bound together to provide a service. GPLs already recognize linking, for instance, so how does this not apply as a different kind of linking? It&#x27;s merely happening at the next layer up.<p>c. Open source is not a restriction - it is the opposite of a restriction. The entire point of free software licenses is to, as the preamble of the GPLs say, &quot;guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users&quot;.\n It beggars belief that integration of a program into a packaged product, modified for and made available over the network, should override that protection. If the SSPL is not &quot;open source&quot; for this reason, then neither is the AGPL.<p>d. Legal ambiguity is not a reflection on the open-source-ness of the license. All FOSS licenses are &quot;ambiguous&quot; until tested in court multiple times.')
