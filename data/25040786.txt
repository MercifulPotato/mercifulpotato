I worked on a project based around StrataXGS Tomahawk and some other chip I can&#x27;t remember right now. One of those chipsets would randomly lock itself and stop switching traffic somewhere about 5-6 minutes after rebooting. It took us ONE WHOLE FREAKING YEAR of debugging on our side and nagging them to make them figure out that they forgot to tell us that some specific PCI-E clock settings must be set in THEIR OWN DRIVER. It was paid support. Imagine the horrors of dev team whose product gets delayed one year and now imagine their faces after Broadcom provided the solution.<p>Also, their requests to plug in &quot;logic analyzer&quot; on the PCI-E bus between host CPU and their chipset   in finished product where everything was using BGA soldered parts - yeah...<p>I believe the only reason everything they share with you is under NDA so you don&#x27;t go and publicly tell how bad they really are. They are like Boeing to me, but I yet have to see their MAX-like mistake.')
