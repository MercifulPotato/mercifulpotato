I&#x27;d have assumed the distinguishing factor between a flight cancellation vs. rescheduling isn&#x27;t the flight number (a flight number seems like an immaterial bookkeeping abstraction?), but rather, whether a replacement flight <i>offers seats to all of the passengers of the first flight</i>. It seems they did this, as they say in their text message. As far as semantics is concerned, this is where it ends for me.<p>Looking at it from a practical standpoint, the company still incurred the same costs of the original flight just at a later time, and they had reserved seats for all the passengers, so it doesn&#x27;t make sense for them to compensate as if the replacement flight had never taken place at all. [1] Had the author contacted them to let them know he wouldn&#x27;t be showing up, they could&#x27;ve had a chance to agree and even to give his seat to someone else... but he just decided not to just not show up. At that point it doesn&#x27;t make sense to get compensated as if the company had just let the seat disappear into thin air (no pun intended). [1]<p>[1] It seems people are misreading my comment to mean I think he shouldn&#x27;t be compensated at all. I&#x27;m <i>not</i> saying he shouldn&#x27;t be compensated. (&quot;As if&quot; is the key phrase here.) I&#x27;m saying any compensation he receives should be for the flight being <i>delayed</i>, not <i>canceled</i>â€”whatever amount might be appropriate for each.')
