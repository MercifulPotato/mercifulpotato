Itâ€™s likely that some officers who participated in the decades of state sanction slaughter will face the same grisly, unceremonious end that they inflicted on others.<p>I&#x27;m not sure about this one, but maybe someone more knowledgeable can chime in.<p>I would have thought the same thing, but my wife is from Slovakia and I was surprised to learn that no such thing happened. It seems that everyone was involved in government somehow, and everybody was just doing their thing to live a decent life.<p>The real violence came from grabbing the new opened up market, and so trying to grab as much of the newly opened market and money as possible. Not so much revenge of what happened because of the government.<p>I definitely want to know if this was the case in other countries too.')
