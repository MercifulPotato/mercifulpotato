As opposed to the US where often a company&#x27;s rise comes at the cost of a wealth of underpaid and mistreated workers (Amazon, Uber, we could go on).<p>To use an intentionally extreme analogy, your argument feels like sitting around watching the US build lovely tall pyramids with slave labour, saying that Europe&#x27;s regulations get in the way of it building such tall pyramids. Well, yes, of course, the US is better, if all you&#x27;re measuring is the height of the pyramids. (nevermind that the US is the easily the biggest user of slave (penal) labour outside of China)<p>It seems like US workers and the US public lose out on almost every other measurement.')
