A kitchen with a display flashing crap does not fit into that.<p>I&#x27;m sure some percentage of fridges will have displays flashing shitty adverts all day long, but there will be a large number of fridges that are just decent looking boxes with stainless, black, or white doors.<p>With TVs I&#x27;m afraid we&#x27;re screwed though. Adding a brain and wifi to a TV is super cheap now and manufacturers have already figured out how to monetize having a smart TV in your house even without advertising.')
