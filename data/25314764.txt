There isn&#x27;t a point in comparing to some Hobbesian wilderness as the blank canvas on which society is drawn, because there never has been such a situation.  So long as there have been humans, there has been human society, because that is what makes us human.  Therefore, pretending that rights start from a perspective of a single human adrift in the wilderness is an poor starting point.')
