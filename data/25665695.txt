This iteration explores my question that while navigation history is a tree, what do people want on the screen at the same time? Personally, I find myself usually wanting 2-3 units of information on the screen (most often, a caller and callee). That&#x27;s why panes are draggable from one column to another.

Closing a pane will recursively close children. Also references are tied to the pane (point 4)<p>5. yes!
