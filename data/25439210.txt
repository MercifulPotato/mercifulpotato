I didn&#x27;t donate my money to non profits and instead I just gave out money to people I know who are not as fortunate as me. For example, someone I know got into a car accident last week and now couldn&#x27;t drive to go to job interviews so I gave him 5k to help him out.<p>I have a few people that I&#x27;m giving 2.5k &#x2F; month to help them take care of their families and so they don&#x27;t have to spend every waking hour door-dashing for people like me.<p>I don&#x27;t understand how society became so unfair and cruel and I didn&#x27;t see the point in having savings when so many people around me have so little savings and no job.<p>Hearing MacKenzie giving away 4B of her 60B is not really impressive because you can live pretty nice with even 1B. To put it in perspective, If I made 300k (my yearly salary) &#x2F; month for my entire life, I still won&#x27;t have 1B.')
