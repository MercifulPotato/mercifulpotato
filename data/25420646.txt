The people who are interested in setting up a homelab are also likewise interested in investing (time and money) in it.<p>This differs from things like &#x2F;r&#x2F;learnprogramming where the people posting are not invested in it (the community or the craft).<p>Another difference would be the &quot;who contributes new posts&quot; aspect.  With &#x2F;r&#x2F;homelab new posts come from people of all skill levels.  With &#x2F;r&#x2F;learnprogramming they come from people who are at the very basic skill level.<p>The implications of this is that &#x2F;r&#x2F;homelab has peers helping peers while &#x2F;r&#x2F;learnprogramming needs people who aren&#x27;t posting questions to post comments and provide additional material.')
