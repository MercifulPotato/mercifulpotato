And yes I agree their empires will generate jobs.<p>But they will be increasingly crappy and mindless as people are used to fill in the gaps that Automation and AI cant.<p>You can see that playing out in Amazon warehouses as workers try to keep pace with robots and get injured, or in Zuckerbergs content moderation farms as the mods suffer brain damage from what the AI systems miss.<p>So expect lot of people to say no thanks. And if those people don&#x27;t find any other purpose expect them to start burning things down. In that context, orgs that provide routes to purpose are doing a good thing.')
