Item(by='notatoad', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601854364, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24683018, text='F1 does a great job of telling a story.  the racing itself isn&#x27;t too exciting, but as a casual spectator it&#x27;s much more accessible to somebody like me who doesn&#x27;t really follow it at all but pays attention once in a while.  the rivalries are well publicized and the races are obvious.  I have no clue what&#x27;s going on in a rally race, but if i&#x27;m over at somebody&#x27;s place and they&#x27;ve got F1 on the tv, i can probably find something about it to enjoy.')
