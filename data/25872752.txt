There is still a market for hobbyist and boostrapped businesses who can&#x27;t afford the insane prices offered AWS, Azure, GCP &amp; Co. Storage, Computing and Bandwidth on these platform is inflated for the &quot;enterprise and over-funded-startups&quot; market.<p>Hetzner, Ionos, Scaleway and OVH are still order of magnitude below AWS in terms of prices. And the quality difference is in no way justifying the price difference. (Especially with Hetzer and Scaleway which are almost on par with cloud platforms)')
