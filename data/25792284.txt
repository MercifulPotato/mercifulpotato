Now he seems to cherry pick or manufacture fact-ish soundbites to push a contrarian or click-bait position.  There’s not a lot of daylight between these, but I suspect the difference has to do with the tedious work needed for being a great reporter.<p>Early Greenwald method seemed to be “do the homework”, recent Greenwald method seems more akin to Fox’s opinion hosts the Fox legal team disclaims as nobody reasonably believing are real news.')
