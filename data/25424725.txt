Item(by='ithkuil', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607987827, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25423262, text='CloudABI (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NuxiNL&#x2F;cloudabi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NuxiNL&#x2F;cloudabi</a>) was an interesting attempt at doing just that. However it seems it didn&#x27;t gain enough traction and people involved veered towards wasm&#x2F;wasi which also abstracts over the instruction set (at the expense of performance, unless I&#x27;m missing some development on the AOT front)')
