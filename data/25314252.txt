It’s the worst kind of tech-bro middlebrow dismissal that makes no interesting comment on the content in question beyond some ill-informed shallow analysis, and assumes that years of making half-baked shitty web-apps have somehow gifted you insight into AI ethics that’s enough to decide what research is “real” and what’s not - such that anyone who isn’t aligned with your high-school level of meta-philosophy is best ignored.<p>Your goal here wasn’t to make any useful point about how it was actually a reasonable decision for her to resign&#x2F;be fired from Google. It wasn’t to comment on the process  or difficulty of having these discussions at scale or in public, or even respond to the specific points raised in the article. These would all be valid discussions to have. It was specifically a personal attack based on a paper you haven’t actually read intended to demonstrate how much better you are than everyone else.<p>Absolutely done with this shit.')
