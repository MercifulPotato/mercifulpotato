If you&#x27;re eating vitamins or protein in food or in a pill, what would the difference be? Are smoothies, soups or other processed foods not food?<p>I take a multivitamin and magnesium supplement, although I take them at the same time as my breakfast (as stated on the label). Logically this makes sense to me, as the contents will be absorbed and digested along with other food stuffs rather than just flushed through the body.<p>The only way I could imagine multi-vitamins useless and ineffective is if the the vitamins themselves are structurally different and indigestible?')
