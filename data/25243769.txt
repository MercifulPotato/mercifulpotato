They do take low variable $0.10-0.25 flat fee, then another 0-3% from the purchase depending on the card and merchant.<p>They don&#x27;t take 25% though, that&#x27;s misleading. If the purchase is $100, they take around $2 in fees.<p>If the purchase is very low, they&#x27;ll take 25%. Hence why a lot of stores say they won&#x27;t take Visa or Mastercard on low value sales.<p>The seller also has a choice of not taking credit card and not lose 50% of their potential sales.')
