Although it may seem strange, many of us would use Android just because they&#x27;re forced to use that one or two apps, not because they need the whole system. In my case, I have absolute zero needs for Android, except for opening Whatsapp like 3 times a week for a few minutes. Since Whatsapp web is a joke that would force me to even keep a smartphone around, I&#x27;m currently keeping home an Android tablet just for that app I use a few minutes per week, which is also less than optimal.\nHopefully one day the Pinephone (I&#x27;m seriously considering to purchase one) will allow Android virtualization, so I&#x27;ll be able to move a minimum virtualized Android system dedicated to Whatsapp onto that phone and ditch the poor tablet for good.')
