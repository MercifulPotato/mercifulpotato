Google and Bing together occupy 96% of the search market. Most other search engines, including the popular privacy focused ones, simply get the search results from Google or Bing and reorder them, because developing a search engine is neither easy nor cost effective. Consequently, the few big tech companies control what people see.<p>Right Dao is different. We are a fully independent search engine, and we have the infrastructure and build the technology from the ground up. That enable us to show the search results free from search engine monopoly&#x27;s manipulations.<p>We invite you to have a try, while we are constantly improving the quality and adding more features.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rightdao.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rightdao.com</a><p>FAQ: open source?<p>We think search engine&#x27;s code is a bit sensitive in general.
