Our uses for smartphones haven&#x27;t evolved in over 5 years, yet the hardware has progressed fast.  Unless you&#x27;re into AR&#x2F;VR, competitive 3D gaming, or publishable photography&#x2F;video, there&#x27;s no reason to spend more than $300. Especially since sealed batteries and short OS updates (even on the Apple side) and rapid HW progress make Mobiles a very fungible investment. My PC is 7yo, my phone 3yo... guess which feels old, and will get a replacement budget commensurate to its useful life ?')
