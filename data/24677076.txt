Internally named as Thermal Wall by Intel CTO Patrick Gelsinger. Before Pentium 4 Intel saw the rise of Laptop computer where energy efficiency was the key. And Pentium-M was a side project from (<i>cough</i>) Patrick Gelsinger. Which ultimately saved Intel&#x27;s Pentium 4 fiasco.<p>The market might have unlimited Dollar for performance. But it is still limited by TDP.')
