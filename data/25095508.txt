Delicious, even.<p>Also, freezing and then microwaving is literally indistinguishable from steaming fresh over hot water in a pot.<p>The whole point of freezing is that no flavor or nutrients are lost, only texture because cell walls burst -- but then you lose the crunchy texture because cell walls burst equivalently when steaming anyways, which is why freezing+microwaving works so well. Nothing is lost at all.')
