German army behavior in Eastern front was literally genocidal. Death camps were only one part of project.<p>There was no discipline preventing Wehrmacht&#x27;s or SS war crimes at eastern front - because those were not seen as breach of discipline. There was nothing of that sort that would cause trouble to soldier, per policy, because the place was meant to be living space for germans and germans only in long term.<p>And when you add SS batalions literally composed of basically uncontrolable convicted criminals and literally tasked with removal of civilian population, your thesis becomes even more absurd.')
