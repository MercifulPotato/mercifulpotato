The point of disagreement I have with Stallman is this -- Stallman argues that using the &#x27;wrong&#x27; word to describe Libre software risks corrupting the movement. I argue that using a generally accepted word to describe the movement, and culturally reinforcing the common understanding of that word as a subset of Libre (ie, not just giving up saying &quot;Open Source can mean whatever the Mongo devs want it to&quot;) is valuable enough to override those concerns.<p>Stallman goes on to argue that the Open Source movement doesn&#x27;t care about Libre software, and we should not align with that movement. I argue that a very large contingent of the Open Source community does care about Libre software, and it is worth advocating to the remainder of the community that Open Source software <i>is</i> Libre software and that the real ideals of Open Source beyond just source availability can not exist without the ideals of Libre software.<p>Stallman and I disagree about whether or not we should use the term Open Source to describe Libre software, but we don&#x27;t disagree about what Libre software is. Even Stallman admits that aside from some minor differences, the official OSI definition is mostly in alignment with Libre software. What Stallman is really disagreeing with is with the PR strategy. And the reason I&#x27;m not going to try and separate those terms is because I explicitly disagree with him that his strategy in this specific case is helpful, and because I and many other people in the community want to continue to fight for the idea that Open Source needs to be Libre.<p>Part of the reason we use Open Source to describe Libre software is because we don&#x27;t believe that Mongo or Elasticsearch have the right to decide for us what Open Source means, and we&#x27;re not willing to drop the issue, give up all of the good will and public recognition we&#x27;ve built around the term, and just go use something else that the public doesn&#x27;t recognize. Because if we do, and we have any success at all, then pretty soon proprietary companies will start to co-opt that term too.<p>I don&#x27;t see any indication that confusion over what the OSI meant by the term &#x27;Open Source&#x27; is the reason why Mongo felt emboldened to write a new license that took away user freedoms. Mongo didn&#x27;t argue that Open Source was different from Libre, they attacked the very spirit of both movements by implying that their focus on &#x27;sustainability&#x27; and &#x27;fairness&#x27; was somehow fixing flaws in the OSI&#x2F;GNU definitions and making their software even more free. If we were all using the term Libre instead, nothing about Mongo&#x27;s PR strategy with the SSPL would have changed, they would have still claimed that their license was reinforcing the &#x27;spirit&#x27; of Libre software.')
