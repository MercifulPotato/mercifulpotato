I can guarantee you my politics (libertarian &#x2F; capitalist &#x2F; corporatist &#x2F; anti-collectivism) will do nothing but enrage you and debates in public chats, lunch, etc. will serve nothing of purpose. Isn’t it better if we save the philosophical debates for beers and the ballot box? I don’t want to hear your soap box and you don’t want to hear mine.')
