There is no &quot;set of rules&quot; that just magically works without thought.<p>There is just SOOOO much that can go wrong. But one general rule crystallizes itself pretty quickly:<p>DO NOT EVER MUTATE STATE!<p>I.e. when you write concurrent code that builds on state mutation, you are opening Pandorra&#x27;s box. If you want concurrency that people can understand and maintain, write immutable, functionally pure code (same data in, same result out, no exceptions). That is relatively easy to police and enforce, while still flexible enough to solve most use cases. It may however, not be the most performant.')
