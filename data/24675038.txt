Item(by='brigandish', descendants=None, kids=[24676929], score=None, time=1601762827, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24673164, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t need to hear about how your grandmother&#x27;s favorite chili recipe saved your uncle&#x27;s best friend&#x27;s life when he was trapped in the Siberian wilderness after going on the run from the Malaysian government. Just tell me how to make the damn chili.<p>The template given was nothing like that, at all.<p>Regardless, I firmly believe that this attitude is keeping many people out of the tech business, let alone open source. Society shows that niceties are wanted and work, especially by women, a demographic under-represented in most parts of tech. I also find that not showing niceties is a display of dominance and self-importance, again, something that isn&#x27;t going to bring more people into tech.<p>I can give a pass to Linus Torvalds and those under time pressure. I doubt any of the devs here commenting on HN are able to make either of those claims.')
