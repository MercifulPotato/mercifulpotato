I think that some of the office politics creep in not because of the projects that people are working on, but just because people actually interact on non-work things. This can be a really good thing in many cases (you spend a lot of time with these people, so it&#x27;s good to have a cultural fit and hang out), but it can also be bad, because so much of your personal life can be wrapped up in people from work.<p>This has less personal contact, and therefore the only politics will mostly be focused on work. As long as things are scoped tightly and you are self-motivated, this should work pretty well. But, you have to have your own social life, since you won&#x27;t get it from work.')
