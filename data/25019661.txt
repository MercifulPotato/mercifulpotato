The &quot;anyone but clinton&quot; line is a falsehood. The real reason Trump won is because huge swaths of Americans feel disenfranchised because we no longer control the entire worlds economy like we did for the 30 years after ww2. They&#x27;re entitled brats who feel they deserve more even thought they&#x27;re already the wealthiest group of unskilled workers in the world. And the republicans realize that and are willing to lie and say they can bring that America back.')
