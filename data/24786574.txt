Instead of generating 70 end-to-end encrypted recordings of your meeting, you just generate 70 end-to-end encrypted packets with a shared symmetric key inside that allow you to decrypt the meeting encrypted with that shared key. You only need one version of the recording because there is only one symmetric key, but you transmit that to each client using their public&#x2F;private keypair.')
