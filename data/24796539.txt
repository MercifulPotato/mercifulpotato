Star ratings don&#x27;t really convey any meaning.<p>I&#x27;d definitely adjust my baseline &quot;acceptable percentage&quot; based on what I&#x27;m buying. If I&#x27;m getting a pack of USB cables for $0.05 each, I&#x27;m not going to be too fussy about the rating. I&#x27;ll take a 2% chance per cable of them not working, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m paying for. If I&#x27;m buying a new GPU, I&#x27;m going to be a lot pickier about it.')
