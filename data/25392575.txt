Along with the secondary point that Sundar is now trying to make it sort of look like he understands what went wrong and it apologizing for it.  Except he doesn&#x27;t and he isn&#x27;t, really.<p><i>Gebru wrote an email to a wide audience with a series of unprofessional complaints</i><p>Would you care to enumerate what these were, specifically?')
