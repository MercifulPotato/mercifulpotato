If someone currently enrolled in the class is helping a person cheat, you can use standard anti-cheating techniques like comparing answers.<p>So you are expecting the student to remember 100% of what they heard in the online classes? Or more likely the student would write down these details and handle it to the cheater to use during the take home exam. Or the cheater would &quot;do X&quot;. In most cases the one doing the helping is not a current student, so it doesn&#x27;t help.<p>I&#x27;ve passed college classes not attending any classes. Doing assignments, exams, and mid-terms. So would I be penalized for not attending classes?')
