Overestimating it is as well.<p>I would agree with this but enough time has passed that we have enough numbers to confirm that the vast majority of healthy (with a small theoretical chance of outliers) will shake COVID off even easier than influenza. ICU beds in all countries were filled predominantly by very obese people or end of life patients with serious health conditions. Basically stop being fat or at least don’t make your unhealthy eating habits the problem of healthy people. At this point it’s clear that we are destroying young lives to protect some people who don’t want to deal with the consequences of their own life choices. There is no way we can protect people without harming others with this virus. So if we have to choose who has to suffer then surely it’s more ethical to let people pick up their own bill rather than punishing people who are innocent and not even in danger. We put people in danger who shouldn’t be in danger. It’s disgusting.')
