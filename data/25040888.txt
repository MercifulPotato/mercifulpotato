I genuinely find it baffling.<p>And maybe I find it baffling because, for example, my dad fought in the front lines of two wars and my parents helped multiple relatives escape communist East Germany. And I&#x27;ve lived without a car in the US for more than a decade, which is a hard row to hoe, but it&#x27;s gotten easier over time &quot;with practice&quot; so to speak.<p>I have ordered stuff from Amazon under circumstances where I literally couldn&#x27;t find it elsewhere. But most of what I hear is not that people literally have zero other options. It&#x27;s more like what people are saying in this discussion: It&#x27;s more convenient than driving to the nearest big box store or it&#x27;s got better selection than any one venue.<p>I fail to comprehend how that merits the amount of stress people seem to have over the issue. Rejecting Amazon for most purchases is not on par with, say, trying to escape communist East Germany.<p>If you object to their crappy policies, you do your research and you buy it elsewhere if you can find it elsewhere. And if you literally can find no other options, then you buy it from Amazon and start letting people know &quot;I could really use another supplier for this here widget. I hate Amazon and I buy widgets regularly. I&#x27;m willing to pay extra for ethically sourced widgets. If you hear of something, let me know!&quot;<p>Or, alternately, pressure Amazon to clean up their act. (Or do both.)')
