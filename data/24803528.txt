Practicing it is impossible while eating &quot;normal&quot; food in this country. It&#x27;s mind-boggling to me how it&#x27;s both &quot;known&quot; that yeast causes systemic inflammation via the innate immune system (dectin1&#x2F;beta-glucan and many others) and it&#x27;s not consciously understood by &quot;science&quot; that people are consuming an inflammatory substance in large quantities all the time in many forms. For instance, who knows how to avoid yeast extract, un-distilled alcohol and vinegar, soy sauce, leavening yeast? Yeast is put into vaccines as an adjuvant, yet nobody has put it together that eating it is also another way for it to enter the body.')
