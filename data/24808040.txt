And i dont mean the tracking, i mean the amount of it, it&#x27;s just unacceptable that there need to be so many ads in a page in order for a website to survive. Tracking ... i m not sure why it should bother me, as long as there are legal protections so it doesnt cross lines that are considered unethical (such as pregnancy or sex orientation). GDPR says nothing about it, it just blanket bans it.<p>Google has only gotten mightier and greedier post-GDRP. So whatever defense is mounted on GDPR, the empirical fact is that  it failed in its purpose.<p>It was a missed opportunity. It could truly hurt google if (a) it declared private information as private property that can be sold in exchange for services or if (b) it provisioned a &quot;PI&quot; tax that should be mandatorily paid back to users similar to the link tax required to be paid to newspapers.')
