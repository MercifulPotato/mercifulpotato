There&#x27;s more than just that - the essay is riddled with inaccuracies and confused misunderstandings the author dismisses by just saying &#x27;they don&#x27;t pay attention to politics&#x27;.<p>If I wrote an essay riddled with technical errors staking a position about technology and then dismissed details as &#x27;I don&#x27;t pay attention to maths&#x27; would that be similarly accepted? It&#x27;d be dismissed as stupid. Why is it different for politics? [0]<p>The belief that everyone is equally bad&#x2F;corrupt is wrong and it just makes you a mark. People attempt to signal intelligence or deep wisdom by pretending they&#x27;re above the fray, but it&#x27;s not actually smart or wise. [1]<p>The essay is rambly, over-confident, and in the end even mean spirited.<p>&gt; What is it that makes it utterly impossible for an educated&#x2F;intelligent person to hold the view that US&#x2F;Western politics is so dysfunctional and corrupt across the board that even a crazy-seeming rank outsider like Kanye could be better than the status quo?<p>Clearly it&#x27;s not impossible as evidenced by the essay, but it&#x27;s still wrong.<p>[0]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;identity.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;identity.html</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lesswrong.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;jeyvzALDbjdjjv5RW&#x2F;pretending-to-be-wise" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lesswrong.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;jeyvzALDbjdjjv5RW&#x2F;pretending...</a>')
