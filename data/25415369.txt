The driver will always be safe, but they are operating heavy machinery, so it&#x27;s up to them to keep safety of the more vulnerable road users in mind.<p>That said, around where I live, car &#x2F; cyclist collisions are still pretty frequent; I live in an area with a lot of roundabouts where cyclists have right-of-way, but because of angles, darkness, rain etc, visibility of cyclists is often very low.')
