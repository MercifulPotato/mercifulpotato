It was a just a rambling jumble of disconnected thoughts.<p>So a lion in a cage is equivalent to a human working for a boss?  Yeah, OK.<p>I&#x27;ve been at 5 startups and 3 very large companies.  I&#x27;ve had more freedom at the large companies, granted I was running sub-divisions at the big companies, but I still had more freedom.<p>I&#x27;m currently at a startup and between the CEO, the Chairman, and the other BOD members I feel like I&#x27;m in a cage wearing a tracking device, even though I&#x27;m in a cage.   It&#x27;s Saturday and I&#x27;m taking a break from working to browse through HN, full day today, full day tomorrow, wash, rinse, repeat, same as it&#x27;s been for the last 2 years.<p>I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;m at a startup so that I can work like I&#x27;m meant to work.')
