If CNN settled for a few thousand dollars to make Sandmann go away, did he really win? Either way CNN looses, they either have to pay for lawyers on appeals or settle out of court and end up where we are.<p>Pretty much every lawyer whose chimed in on the subject says that Sandmann is unlikely to have won a significant amount. So he &quot;won&quot; in the sense of some PR points with people who already thought he was in the right. That&#x27;s probably about it.')
