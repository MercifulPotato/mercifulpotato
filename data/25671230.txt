The same is often brought up with regards to automotive safety and really anytime engineering meets public safety, but I digress.<p>Point being is that the social media experiment and the wild west days of the internet writ large has run its course. We’ve had our fun and money has been made and lost and made again and again and again and the writing is on the wall I’m afraid.<p>If history is any evidence the gravy train is about to come to a glaring and disastrous end. Legislation will be passed, examples will be made by the powers at be and society will look back through the lens of history at these past 30-40 years as a cautionary tale.<p>To your point: \nThere is already a huge body of law that exists that would not take much retooling to apply. Held back by the voluminous pedantic arguments entertained ad nauseam. However the blood is there in droves and now the powers at be have had the chaos special delivered on a silver platter. Its one thing for us to comment and argue in the safe confines of our little luxury bubbles the internet provides, its another thing to watch in casual horror when the death toll numbers get so large as to be incomprehensible to many and then continue those same arguments to no effect. But make no mistake reality is what refuses to go away when you choose to stop believing in it and the reality is that for the first time as of yesterday the powers at be have had their bubbles burst as a result of their collective negligence and blood has been delivered as a direct result to their door.<p>As if 350k people dead isn&#x27;t enough, theres a tyrannical despot once again guilty of treason on national tv for all to see that this time has literally instigated a coup with blood on congress floors as a result. Fueled specifically by social media and the internet. Sure things may have seemed ephemeral and hard to legislate before because hey its the internet and its on a cute little screen, but no more.<p>I expect the laws to be written, applied and enforced the same way they always have been. And I expect the piles of anti- trust cases to encounter not much friction now and as for social media... i expect that it will be fine as long as it doesn&#x27;t get too big and crosses that pernicious threshold where it ever again is able to be a real threat to the powers at be.')
