Were they logging their dreams? What was their journey? What they would expect if an app exists for their needs?<p>This was the perfect time to start a connection between the real-life, and the dream. Both for users, and for us!<p>They were using notebooks (basically paper and pen) and it was becoming harder and harder to keep track of their dreams. They were waking up in the morning, lots of the time forgetting to write their dreams, and when there was something interesting they dream about, they were trying to find interpretations from the internet. What a mess.<p>Our first approach was to let them create their dreams very easily. We designed our app for this purpose and also we let our users set a notification reminder close to their wake-up times so that they would not forget to write their dreams. And with our latest feature, we let them interpret their dreams instantly.<p>We are very closely listening to our customers.<p>Your valuable comments and ideas would help us to improve Dreambook.<p>To be continued.<p>IOS app url:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;nl&#x2F;app&#x2F;dreambook-dream-journal&#x2F;id1535038052?l=en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;nl&#x2F;app&#x2F;dreambook-dream-journal&#x2F;id1535...</a><p>Android app url:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.cenkebret.ruyadar" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.cenkebret....</a>')
