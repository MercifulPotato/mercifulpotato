As far as I can tell for Google they embed video in the picture, Samsung has their own format for this.<p>Im on an older version of android and the live photos dont have the snappiness of Apple&#x27;s, but that could be a processor power issue or even stylistic choice. Particularly the length of the live photo is noticeably different.<p>Im not sure how Apple stores the live picture info, but having it crossplatform would be fantastic for services like these.')
