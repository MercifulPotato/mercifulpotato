For a period of 1-2 years, they would scour books ranging from self-help to moral philosophy in order to build a Simplistic System for Living. Maybe it had to do with getting their first engineer salaries, because a central tenet of my friends&#x27; philosophies somehow always ended up being &quot;time and money are interchangeable.&quot;<p>Of course, it is naive to think that just because many things can be bought, <i>all</i> things can be bought, at least reasonably. And as my friends got older and acquired adult responsibilities, families, roles in the local community, they dropped their philosophical regimen and just tuned into typical affluent suburbanites.<p>But it&#x27;s that glimmering realization that still strikes me as kind of fascinating to watch: &quot;I can buy... things!... with money! That means I can buy... anything!&quot;<p>In particular, I&#x27;d love to know what exactly the person in the post I linked to was thinking when writing this sentence:<p><pre><code>  &gt; Spend more to go to events where you will meet exactly the people you want.\n</code></pre>\nEverything that comes to my mind feels either niche or unreliable. An expensive professional conference? You&#x27;re either already part of that professional community, or going to an event like that is kind of a mixed bag. Paid dating services? Maybe I don&#x27;t understand that world. A fancy party where you get to mingle with VCs? That&#x27;s very specific. Are there meetups where the cost of attendance is a significant filter?<p>My experience in this arena has been that you need serendipity, and <i>it&#x27;s hard to buy serendipity.</i><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meteuphoric.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;03&#x2F;25&#x2F;how-to-trade-money-and-time&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meteuphoric.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;03&#x2F;25&#x2F;how-to-trade-money-and-ti...</a>')
