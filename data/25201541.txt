Some of these companies dedicate multiple teams towards an OSS project, which I’ve seen first hand with projects like llvm. So isn’t it possible that the involvement of these companies could actually systemically turn things as most of the people working would be their employees and that the scales could be manipulated easily by these companies(need not be intentional). For example I remember “std::string_view” in c++ being one example which Google pushed and even got into the C++17 standards despite its bad design. Although I might be wrong, but my guess here is that Google had a use for it(which we know it had) and that lot of people on the standards committee being from Google led to a systemic bias. Couldn’t that happen with Rust?')
