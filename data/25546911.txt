When you open the datasheet for a chip, all the cool numbers in nice tables are not just there to be pretty, but because they are useful to design a circuit to put the chip in... And then you have your classic engineering subjects applied to electrical circuit constructs, like filtering, stability of feedback loops, etc.<p>In the end you can design simple&#x2F;medium-complexity digital electronics PCB with some common knowledge on PSUs, digital interfaces (including  layout&#x2F;return-current&#x2F;impedance control) with the right tools, but non-trivial analog I would not even bother, I leave it to people with a real training in this field.')
