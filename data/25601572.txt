It&#x27;s very hard to get good sounding analog FM (e.g. on my modular system) due to the instability of the  oscillators. It&#x27;s mostly used for weird sounds or with short envelopes to accent the attack phase.<p>In that sense, DX7 et al where a huge leap as they brought an extensive sound range to the table (even though deeply in the uncanny valley for some of them)')
