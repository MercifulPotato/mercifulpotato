My sense is that Americans then were more practical, more humble (while still being feisty), and they had a better handle on physical and social reality. We could do so much so quickly then. But now, during late-stage capitalism, information systems dominate physical systems, and that&#x27;s a great way to lose a war. When everyone wants their cut, wants their say, is willing to fight dirty, with tooth and nail in the legal system to get their way, it slows everything down to a crawl, and makes everything more expensive. Want to preview Americans in wartime? Look at any and every city infrastructure project currently deadlocked and billions over-budget. That&#x27;s us. And while our broken justice system grinds through the paperwork, the courthouse gets bombed by the barbarians who were never slowed down by paperwork.<p>This is less an argument against civilization, and more like a wake-up call: America has multiple interlocked badly broken systems that all need massive reform. Forget about justice, I think its necessary for our <i>civilization</i> to survive. It is urgent that we reform our judicial system (where any involvement IS the punishment), our medical system (where getting sick is a prelude to bankrupcy), our social safety net (where getting fired without a personal support net means homelessness), consumer rights (where deregulation and arbitration clauses leave individual consumers to fight alone against huge well-funded interests), the tax system (which is too large and complex for anyone to use properly), and education (where students must take enormous debt to get educated, and so much of that debt funds administrative overhead). Personally, I don&#x27;t even think these things should be about your location on a <i>politcal scale</i> - right or left, these are table stakes for a 21st century democracy. The lack of on-shore manufacturing, particularly for big infrastructure projects, e.g. things like roads, the electrical grid, tall buildings, and factories, is merely a symptom, I think, of all the rest. Yeah, the consumer market is strong, but for the everyday Joe, it is painful to deal with all these broken systems on a day-to-day basis.')
