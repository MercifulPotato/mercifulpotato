You don&#x27;t call it, it calls you. Whatever it&#x27;s doing in between when it calls into the bits and pieces of code that you wrote is a mystery. That, in turn, makes it almost impossible to intuit how things in a Gradle script relate to each other. The relationships aren&#x27;t lexical, and you can&#x27;t figure out how things work by tracing through the code. Instead, its inner workings feel like spooky action at a distance.<p>If Gradle were more of a library, and a Gradle build script were just a Groovy or Kotlin script that calls into that library, everything might be easier to understand.')
