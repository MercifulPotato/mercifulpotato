Now that I&#x27;m setup, I&#x27;m surprised at how cheap solar can be, considering most home setups are in the $15k+ range and don&#x27;t get any storage.<p>My complete solar setup with battery was about $2000 (300W solar, charge controller, inverter, 100AH battery), and can be done today for $1200 (battery prices have dropped).')
