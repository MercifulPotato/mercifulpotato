I have an 8&quot; duct booster fan pushing air into a cardboard box. Between that box and the flow hood I have a HEPA filter sandwiched between them using bolts and wing nuts. The only thing I&#x27;d change is the fan. The booster fan was cheap, but has trouble with the back pressure (lower air flow). I would probably look at using squirrel cage or maybe a radon fan. They should be able to handle the pressure.')
