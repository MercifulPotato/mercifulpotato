Does it simply benefit the current winners of the status quo?</i><p>I suppose it depends on whether the discussion stops at the &quot;Oh Noes&quot; level, or if it continues to discussing how the 10% (or the 1%, for that matter) gets co-opted by the 0.01%, and on to various proposed remedies[0], and then on to more explicitly political activities such as support (in whatever form) for specific policies, organizations, and candidates.<p>[0] Campaign finance reform is probably the ur-remedy that enables most others.')
