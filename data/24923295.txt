Run it on nuclear, solar, etc. and it can work. However, the grid is still awash with coal power! There&#x27;s no way any machine is going to capture more carbon per KW consumed energy than the coal to produce that many KW emitted to start with.<p>So, does it makes sense to deploy this in areas with a ton of green energy available on the grid? Maybe... but those areas have lower PPM carbon in the air, so it&#x27;s not the right place to run the machine anyway.<p>Perhaps instead of all this wasted effort and engineering time, we could just replace the damned coal plants and stop emitting carbon itself.')
