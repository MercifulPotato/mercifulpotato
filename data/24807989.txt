In the following statement what are foo and bar?<p>I don&#x27;t understand your point. What&#x27;s exactly the problem of knowing what are foo and bar? Even if you struggle with C++, any half decent IDE allows you to check the symbol and see what&#x27;s being called with a single mouse click.<p>So what&#x27;s exactly the problem?<p>&gt; As another example consider implicit type conversions:<p>Again, what&#x27;s exactly the problem? If you write down &quot;c+3&quot; it&#x27;s your responsibility to know what you are doing and that &quot;c+3&quot; does make sense. And your example can only start to become a possibility if you explicitly and quite intentionally define your constructors to allow implicit type conversions, which is a direct violation of basic C++ best practices.<p>Adding to that, your convoluted example is no where near the mess that&#x27;s javascript or Python and somehow people manage to not screw that up even without any type checking.<p>So why single out C++ although it does provide all sorts of guardrails and sanity checks?<p>&gt; Many of these craziness<p>You failed to show any semblance of &quot;craziness&quot; in any of the convoluted examples you presented. In fact, you only showed you struggle with a language you barely have any experience with, let alone a grasp on rudimentary best practices such as requiring explicit constructors. Thus, why pin the blame on the language instead of where it really belongs: your lack of knowledge and experience using the language?')
