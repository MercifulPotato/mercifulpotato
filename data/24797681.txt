I was actually citing their cost as a reference for a lower-bound on how much storage can cost nowadays per TB. I wanted to compare that to the Filecoin network. However, your comparison is better anyway. Filecoin is basically operating as a network in the same capacity as B2 (i.e. as a storage service provider) and we should compare prices accordingly.<p>Also, good find on the filecoin deals link. That&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for but never found.')
