Before you observed it, the ball was in a superposition of the two colors. And this collapse instantaneously also collapses the wave-function to the American ball.<p>Now, that is obviously not true for macroscopic objects like balls. Those are not in a superposition of colors until they are observed, but it is true for quantum objects like electrons.')
