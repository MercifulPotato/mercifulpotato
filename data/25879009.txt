You can put much larger telescopes there, though you&#x27;re back to windows of time you can look at a location but you can have good will and dedicate time to scientists. Though they might not want to reveal the resolution even though this can be roughly back tracked through size. There&#x27;s also the weapons incentive even though that&#x27;s illegal. But if you&#x27;re able to cheaply and consistently put people on the moon then you clearly have the resources to cheaply put large rods of tungsten in orbit (good luck responding to), being able to take out enemy satellites (nav, surveillance, missile launch detection, etc), replace&#x2F;upgrade satellites quickly, etc. The Apollo missions were always about how much payload you could put in orbit.<p>It&#x27;s also beneficial if you want to start space mining, really essential for that actually.')
