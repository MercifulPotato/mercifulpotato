[...] So then if actually we think government should intervene in some situations, why not in this one? </i><p>Since the majority of your reply is about justifying more positive government intervention, I&#x27;ve done a poor job explaining what I was talking about.<p>I already <i>agree</i> with government intervention to limit bad effects of advertising.  That&#x27;s not what my comment was about; instead, I was critiquing your rhetoric.<p>E.g. the following type of statement :  <i>&quot;If people are not truly free thinking, how can we have a free market?!?&quot;</i><p>The above statement has a nice poetic symmetry but doesn&#x27;t actually advance the discussion in a productive way.  Let me try more rhetorical examples and hopefully you&#x27;ll see the same pattern:<p>Proposal:  Facebook should open its social graph as API so users can be <i>free</i> to choose their own 3rd-party client and not be locked in a walled garden.  <i>But if users are not so free thinking, how can there be a free choice to choose their own social client?</i><p>Proposal:  People should be able to freely choose which state or house they want to live in.  <i>But if citizens are not aware of hidden influences, and are not perfectly rational agents, and disadvantaged with information asymmetry, can there truly be a free choice to pick a home?</i><p>Proposal:  People should be free to choose their spouse.  <i>But... [same pattern]... because people don&#x27;t know hidden life influences that had predetermined their eventual mate selection, etc.</i><p>What I&#x27;m saying is that yes, we can be <i>flexible</i> with definition of &quot;free&quot; -- but that just means we&#x27;re going down a rabbit hole of philosophical word games.  I contend this isn&#x27;t productive discussion.<p>If we want to recommend <i>more positive government intervention</i>, we can do that without the &quot;free isn&#x27;t truly free&quot; philosophy.')
