It needs to transcend beyond this dimension because we are limited by Speed of Light in the 3d world. <i>trans-dimensional projection and materialization much like what we see with &quot;UFOS&quot; is the only way to cover massive distances</i>. Our science shows the possibility of wormhole travel. The maths show time travel is possible. We need to breakout of the waterfall model of time, space, our existence.<p>Speed of Light is far too slow and inefficient for us to be a multi-planetary and eventually a multi-galaxy species. We also cannot accomplish this through wars or ape-like behaviors.<p>A shift in global consciousness is in order and I think we are slowly heading towards that. We have never seen so much awareness for the well being of the planet which we need to stop treating like a piece of rock that we feel entitled to.<p>Like I mentioned before, there is something pulling us to expand, become better, become one with the universe. The maths show the universe is teeming with life, we have evidence of life on Venus FFS now, we can infer that life isn&#x27;t rare it is our narrow view of life and intelligence that limits our search.')
