When I tried to blog, I felt too much pressure to make something super high-quality and definitive, that will stand the tests of time and never be edited... So I ended up publishing nothing besides the &quot;I&#x27;m starting to blog again!&quot; posts or something small and safe.<p>+ By tweaking over time, the work can unwittingly become bigger, better, or more polished than it&#x27;d have been if I&#x27;d tried to make something so intense from the start.')
