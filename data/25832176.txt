It&#x27;s a way to protect payment validation from being controlled by a single operator by making a &quot;hostile take over&quot; very expensive. IMHO criticizing Bitcoin for its &quot;proof of work&quot; algorithm only converys a serious lack of understanding of how crypto currencies actually work.<p>There is an alternative, namely, the &quot;proof of stake&quot; scheme that Ethereum is going to switch over to but it has other short comings that might or might not outweigh the benefits of energy savings.<p>&gt; - The ever expanding blockchain is wasteful (in storage, computation, network).<p>Well, the blockchain&#x27;s current size is 323.54 GB. That&#x27;s quite a lot but can be stored easily on a $100 SSD. Using $100 worth of storage to maintain an asset market of roughly 600 billion dollars is useful trade off, I would say. Of course, I know the blockchain is being replicated all over the planet but Google&#x27;s cloud storage probably dwarves its storage requirements.<p>&gt; - The throughput is way too slow.<p>Yes, 10 minutes is not very fast. However, compare that to inter bank transactions and this number seems blazingly fast again. However, in my opionion Bitcoin is emerging as an alternative to gold that&#x27;s primarily used for storing value over long times. It&#x27;s primary purpose will not be to maintain payment networks. This role will be taken by Ethereum or other alternatives like Stella Lumens, Loopring or Polkadot.')
