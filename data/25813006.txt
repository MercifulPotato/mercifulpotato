How are consumers being gouged? They are arguably benefitting the most. Just because companies benefit from a law, doesn&#x27;t make it evil.<p>You can argue that after expenses, most Uber drivers make less than minimum wage (depending on the political slant of the researchers), but then if these exploited workers are not stupid (which I hope the author is not arguing), why don&#x27;t they get a minimum wage job?<p>Because A. those jobs don&#x27;t exist and&#x2F;or B. they prefer to work ride-share. The true minimum wage is zero. And virtually ever ride-share I&#x27;ve taken from my local airport over the last three years has been in a Prius, invalidating the cited study. The full-time drivers aren&#x27;t stupid and helpless as the author would have you believe.<p>There are plenty of ills with our economic system and plenty of ways to address wealth inequality. As most people who understand economics better than the author will tell you, the minimum wage is not one of them. Better alternatives to be talking about: UBI, more graduated tax brackets, getting rid of things like CA Proposition 13 (property tax lock-ins), improving zoning, etc.')
