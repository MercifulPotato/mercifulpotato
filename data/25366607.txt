The concept itself might be anti-privacy.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s time to move back to simpler things like OPML. (Which people seem more comfortable sharing freely - not sure if that&#x27;s still a &quot;social graph&quot; tho.)<p>Perhaps specific relationship details shouldn&#x27;t be housed in the social network - just the permission to follow.<p>Perhaps companies who house a &quot;social graph&quot; should be regulated - similar to what is done with medical data. It should be a toxic substance.<p>I just think we&#x27;re a long way from doing this right and there are a lot of untried options - and I lack imagination as well.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;helicraft.ca&#x2F;kxt&#x2F;aud-v-chi-cl1.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;helicraft.ca&#x2F;kxt&#x2F;aud-v-chi-cl1.html</a>\n<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;helicraft.ca&#x2F;kxt&#x2F;aud-v-chi-cl2.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;helicraft.ca&#x2F;kxt&#x2F;aud-v-chi-cl2.html</a>')
