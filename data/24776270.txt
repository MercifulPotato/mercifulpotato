I&#x27;ve always agreed with him that people who switch genders shouldn&#x27;t be treated equally when it comes to contact sports like UFC.  He&#x27;s just been more distasteful about discussing it over time IMO.<p>If I had to sum up how Rogan has changed, he reminds me of many older men who just start to become aholes to everyone and everything, and believe that everything always deserves criticism while rarely deserving to be taken seriously. Though age is a factor, I think his FU money and success has completely gotten to his head.<p>I was a fan for years from about episode 50, but rarely listen&#x2F;watch now. His exclusivity is not a factor keeping me subscribed if I consider leaving Spotify in the future.')
