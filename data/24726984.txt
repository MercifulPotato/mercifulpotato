There&#x27;s little need for doctors to do collective bargaining because there&#x27;s barely anybody who could take their job, so they already have a lot of bargaining power.<p>If doctors didn&#x27;t require a medical license, alleviating the need for 4 years of medical school + residency, suddenly there would be a glut of competition and doctors would surely need to unionize.<p>Conversely, if software development required an arduous, expensive, hyper-restrictive license, there would be no need for software developers to unionize either')
