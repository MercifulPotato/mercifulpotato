It turns out it&#x27;s a great way to get moving without feeling like you&#x27;re putting work into it. For example, I&#x27;ve been using Thrill of the Fight to de-stress after work. It&#x27;s incredibly effective at that because your brain gets tricked into thinking you&#x27;re in an actual fight and  millions of years of fight or flight stress response kicks in. Afterwards three rounds you feel the kind of release from stress that it would take hours of traditional stress management techniques to achieve. All without the head trauma!')
