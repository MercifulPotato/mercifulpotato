I don&#x27;t exactly do personal OKRs, but I&#x27;m definitely working towards goals. To hit some of those goals, I build habits. And to build those habits, I carefully track how well I&#x27;m doing on that.<p>E.g., I had a goal of being more fit. I wanted a habit of daily exercise, so I set a target of 10k steps&#x2F;day. My current streak is 33 days, but I&#x27;d say the habit is still forming. I&#x27;m going to shoot for 2 months and see how strong the habit feels then.<p>I do agree that bad metrics are terrible, though. My sympathies!')
