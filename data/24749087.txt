(Paywalled for me)<p>Unbelievably, we went to a restaurant last weekend where there was absolutely no service so we had to use their WiFi to even see the drinks menu. Once connected, we had to go through a convoluted process to order and before even being able to place an order, I had to sign up for an account with the online service. This was before we could even order tap water. Food orders were done the regular way, with regular people, in person. They refused to take drink orders (including for water) any other way than online.<p>Last night my wife and I went out to dinner and neither of us brought our phones (for the first time in forever). It was great. They had to give us regular menus, like the good old days.')
