If Nintendo wants to DCMA takedown every website distributing their games that were cracked I am perfectly fine with that.<p>The issue I have is that they target people who figure out how to run and copy cracked game from their device, and not those who are actively distributing them. While it makes perfect sense from their side, the images from the tweet feed do not present a compelling argument that the modders are breaking the law and as such they are intimidating law-abiding citizen which is horrifying.')
