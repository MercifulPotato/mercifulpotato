Whether tariffs or whatever. Few companies have the ability to follow every link of the supply chain for corruption. Most small to mid size to just find a distributer and buy what they need, they don&#x27;t have the ability or authority to send in a small army of auditers, that the CCP isn&#x27;t going to allow anyway.')
