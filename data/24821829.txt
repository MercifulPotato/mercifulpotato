Item(by='Smaug123', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603062177, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24821685, text='If you choose to view the universe in one particular coordinate system (e.g. one centred on your eyes), then you&#x27;ll see some things mysteriously happening. For example, you might find that if you release something from your hand, it will mysteriously move towards your feet. Eventually you&#x27;ll realise that a bunch of things can cause things to mysteriously move, and you&#x27;ll start using the word &quot;force&quot; to describe &quot;tendency to mysteriously move&quot;.<p>But some of these forces are <i>not</i> observed by other people who are watching; they arise as by-products of the fact that you are the one doing the measuring. For example, if you&#x27;re falling in a lift, you won&#x27;t observe the force that causes a ball to fall towards your feet; but I, standing on the ground outside the lift, will observe that actually you and the ball and the lift <i>are</i> subject to this force.<p>In fact there&#x27;s an underlying reality which we can&#x27;t directly observe but which we can infer from the paths of objects. That reality is a curved spacetime, not a flat one (as it appears to be). This curvature means that &quot;straight line&quot; is actually not quite what you&#x27;re used to; things follow straight lines, but those straight lines don&#x27;t look straight to us, because of the underlying space&#x27;s curvature: we can&#x27;t see the whole of spacetime, only small segments of it, so we can&#x27;t see enough to get a proper sense of the curvature. But since our limited frames of reference have their own notion of &quot;straight line&quot; which is incompatible with that of the global spacetime, we observe a mysterious tendency of things to deviate from what we think is the straight line they should be following.<p>So gravity &quot;is a force&quot;: it&#x27;s a mysterious tendency of things to move, because we are limited in what we can see and our own observation frames are subtly incompatible with the global structure. But it&#x27;s also &quot;not a force&quot;: if we were somehow able to take a fully global view of the universe, there would be no mysterious movement, only a huge number of things moving at exactly the same speed in perfect straight lines through a curved spacetime. (Assuming General Relativity is 100% accurate.)')
