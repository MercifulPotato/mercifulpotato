We want a tariff free Deal.&quot;<p>Brussels:  &quot;Okay, we&#x27;ll call the 30 euros a Vat Handling Fee instead of a tariff.&quot;<p>London:  &quot;Deal.&quot;<p>It has exactly the same economic effect as a deal with a tariff.  They just changed the name from &quot;tariff&quot; to &quot;Vat Handling Fee&quot;, so they&#x27;d be able to say &quot;Tariff free deal.&quot;<p>Thought experiment:  Some politician promises people if you elect him, people will be able to mail letters without paying for a stamp.<p>Then once he&#x27;s elected, he quickly shouts from the rooftops that, indeed, you can now mail letters without a stamp.<p>But when people actually try to do it, they find out that in order to mail letters without a stamp, you have to go down to their local post office and buy a postmark instead, which costs exactly the same as a stamp and is less convenient.<p>The politician was <i>technically</i> not lying about fulfilling his promise.  But he&#x27;s certainly using specific technical vocabulary of the postal system in a super deceptive way.<p>People thought &quot;no stamps&quot; describes a world where anyone can send letters without payment, but &quot;no stamps&quot; actually describes a world where there&#x27;s still a payment, but the payment&#x27;s now called a &quot;postmark&quot; instead of a &quot;stamp.&quot;<p>Likewise with tariffs, people think &quot;tariff free deal&quot; means a world where anyone can send goods across the border without payment, but &quot;no tariffs&quot; actually describes a world where there&#x27;s still a payment, but the payment&#x27;s now called a &quot;Vat Customs Declaration Handling Fee&quot; instead of a &quot;tariff.&quot;  It&#x27;s using specific technical vocabulary of the international trade system in a super deceptive way.<p>Reviewer:  &quot;This code shouldn&#x27;t be calling function f&quot;<p>Developer:  Renames function from f to g.
