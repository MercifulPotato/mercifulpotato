Concept2&#x27;s do come apart in the middle for storage and they&#x27;re light enough that moving them around isn&#x27;t a big chore.<p>There&#x27;s a reason why Concept2&#x27;s are used by gyms, for training by Olympic rowers, and also for indoor rowing competitions.  They&#x27;re indestructible.  I&#x27;ve had one for about 15 years and all I&#x27;ve done is oil the chain and clean the rail.  Every treadmill I&#x27;ve had gave up the ghost after a year or two of regular use.<p>The quality of workout you get with a rower is fantastic.  It&#x27;s great cardio and works a lot more muscle groups than a treadmill.  Doing HIIT workouts on a rower is highly effective.<p>Two caveats:<p>1. It is possible to hurt yourself if you row with poor form.  Take the time to learn how to row properly.<p>2. When you start, you will get blisters.  Then you will develop calluses.  If you don&#x27;t want calluses on your hands, stick to running.')
