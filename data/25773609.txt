And naturally Apple would prefer to oversee and have this in-built in their OS. Apple also wants to discourage kernel extensions on macOS (they have some good reasons - a poorly designed kernel extension can make the OS unstable; but mostly its about feature control with Apple).<p>So they informed all such firewall app developers that their individual kernel extensions will no longer be allowed, and Apple had instead created an OS API specifically for their use case. (They described the features it would have and invited them to give their feedback). And so all application firewalls were forced to update their apps and use this OS API.<p>But this API had an undisclosed, in-built list of Apple approved applications that no firewall was allowed to block. Someone created that list. Someone added that list in the system, and coded the API to specifically give them special privileges to bypass any application firewalls.<p>Bugs are accidental. Backdoors like these are intentional.<p>(You can however take exception to usage of &quot;Backdoor&quot; here - perhaps from Apple&#x27;s perspective it was a good design decision as many of these services go wacko, and sometimes even freeze your system, when they aren&#x27;t allowed to do what they are coded to, like do some operation over the internet).')
