My statement holds - if an image has size (a, b), but the author wants it to render at size (c, d) but does not send that data, <i>the client has no way of magically determining c and d</i>.<p>Furthermore, even when the actual image size is the same as the width and height attributes, there&#x27;s the obvious problem of you needing to completely transfer the image itself before determining the size, which blocks rendering (or forces you to re-compute layout a second time, which both increases latency and decreases throughput).')
