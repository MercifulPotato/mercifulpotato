Us historical corn yields prior to 1920&#x2F;1930 (major introduction of industrial fertilizer happens pretty shortly thereafter) were identical to current SSA yields. Subsaharan African farms close in on US yields pretty quickly when the same inputs are used.<p>The number of acres to make fertilizer are minimal. It’s very, very small relative to agricultural land under cultivation.<p>In regards to financial incentives, I mention this specifically so you know I could have a bias and am leaving references to the science so you can make your own judgement. I’m not really in this line of work for the money though.')
