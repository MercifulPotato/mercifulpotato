Though the ultimate deciding power <i>may</i> lie in the elected official (for those officials who aren&#x27;t puppets), the smart ones listen to their advisors, so the advisors wield great power in how and what they advise.  This doesn&#x27;t even mention the power of various gatekeepers that can prevent or facilitate access to the official or are delegated power themselves, or are appointed by the elected official.  In all of these ways one can affect change without holding elected office.<p>Even when you can&#x27;t directly influence an elected official you still have power in selecting which official to support.')
