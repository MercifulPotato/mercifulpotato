It seems to cheapen the activity as you start applying different metric than sheer joy as the only goal, and instead look an things through an PNL lens.<p>In fact introducing these metrics is almost always a net negative activity--now in my 30s I&#x27;ve turned almost all of my hobbies, skills and interests into a professional career to the detriment of my pleasure towards it and suffered because I bought into the fake adage of &#x27;never having to work a day&#x27; for most of my Life.<p>Whereas it&#x27;s now become the new normal to view &#x27;feminism&#x27; as a preferential distortion of facts and realities in favour of biased outcomes that don&#x27;t hold up to any scrutiny.<p>I have no problem with sex workers, I&#x27;ve treated them all with the same respect I would with customers in the professional or corporate sectors I&#x27;ve been in and they always remarked how differently I was because of that.<p>But, the truth is I hold almost near disdain for social media &#x27;thots&#x27; (male or female) who exploit mentally weak and vulnerable people into giving them money in exchange of attention&#x2F;sexual exploitation and exploiting Human vulnerability and a need for connection. I think the same applies to these &#x27;feminists&#x27; prostitutes and their false narrative because of the obvious level of hypocrisy behind it and its motives is one of obvious extractive relationships with people based on self-interest, vulgar opportunism and having the social inertia to carry on forcing people to buy into that view.<p>&gt; Exploitation of minors is one thing. Though, I do not see many folks lifting a finger over child political prisoners in rancid cages. So Iâ€™m left wondering if exploitation is the real issue or the sex part given cultural norms.<p>The Catholic Church still exists, start with questioning why that den of pedophilia is institutionalized in modern Society despite the countless amounts of child rape and exempt from taxation before you go any further. Then you&#x27;ll see why things like the Epstein-Maxwell sex trafficking of minors is more common than one would care to think. Which again ties to the what I said above about exploitation of vulnerable people.')
