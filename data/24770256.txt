Item(by='pwdisswordfish4', descendants=None, kids=[24771580], score=None, time=1602622879, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24765658, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s not a good characterization.<p>For the reason just stated:<p>&quot;It&#x27;s a matter of negative rights vs. positive rights.&quot;<p>You&#x27;re say the license prohibits certain things, which isn&#x27;t true.  It&#x27;s copyright law that prohibits, by default, almost everything.  Choosing a public license to make something FOSS is an active choice that selectively enables more use for people who follow the cultural and legal patterns you do like.  That a person while doing so doesn&#x27;t also enable even the uses one doesn&#x27;t like is not what you&#x27;re characterizing it as: an active effort to prohibit those things.  Wide open, MIT-like permissive reuse is not the default.')
