The stock prices go up and (e.g.) gold price goes down. \n-Then some think &quot;ooh gold is so cheap&quot;, and cash out their profits from stocks, and drop that money to gold. Stocks go down, gold goes up. \n-Then some think &quot;ooh stocks are so cheap&quot;, and cash out their profits from gold, and drop that money to stocks. Gold goes down, stocks go up. \n-ad infinitum..\nNow then.. the big players that move the marker, position themselves early on and ride the full wave. The semi-smart catch part of that wave &#x27;up&#x27;. The little fish&#x2F;retail&#x2F;impatient tend to buy the stock&#x2F;gold on its peak, and is paying for the exit-ers profit-cash-out. And then they either cut their losses, or they wait for 1-2-5 years for the next &#x27;peak&#x27; to sell to someone else (I know I am oversimplifying it - apologies).<p>Where stocks, gold please replace with stock[A..Z], bond[A..Z], index[A..Z], commodity[A..Z] and so on..')
