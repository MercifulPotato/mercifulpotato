Item(by='the_only_law', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609256224, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25565879, text='I have a handful of old ISDN videoconferencing terminals that use the H.320 standard. I’m creating a server that will do things like implement things like multipoint conferencing and bridging to modern video conferencing solutions, although right now I’m stuck decoding the mess of a serial interface they use to connect to the network, which appears to be a slightly non standard V.35 right now.<p>The equipment for the project has been growing. Outside the expensive E1 device, I still need to get what I need to really simulate that line, including some DCE to take whatever the serial interface on the phone is to an E1 line. I’ve also bought a few old protocol analyzers which weren’t completely necessary, but fun if not mildly useful.')
