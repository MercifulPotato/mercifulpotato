It&#x27;s not at all clear what they mean, and they make the page ugly (in my opinion) by messing up the composition.<p>As the only circular objects on the page, as numerous as they are, and as intensely saturated blobs on an otherwise calm, white document, they are incredibly loud.  They&#x27;re so loud that they almost make it harder to read the text.  Just get rid of them.')
