There has never ever been a conversation between 2 people where 1 person agrees they are wrong and will change.<p>In fact, trying to give someone advice on a subject will almost certainly make it impossible for that person to ever change.<p>Even more important, you are intentionally giving advice. If someone notices you lost weight and you talk about the new diet you are trying. Even though you never actually say someone should try the diet, they are taking it as if you are trying to give them advice.<p>The best advice someone can give you, never give any advice or tell anyone about anything. Ask other people about things you might learn from them and try it.')
