You don&#x27;t have to have strong feelings about ffmpeg settings, you just <i>go</i>. And with Mux Data, developers realize incredible insights into how their videos perform from platform to platform, place to place, and user to user.<p>I&#x27;m Ed, and I&#x27;m an engineer on the DevEx team here - you might have seen me around HN here and there. ;) This is, and I have to stress that I&#x27;m not kidding because everybody says this sort of thing, <i>for real</i> my favorite job that I&#x27;ve ever had. The team here is mind-blowingly smart, there is a real and concerted focus on not just competence but on the human side of things; one of the company&#x27;s core values is &quot;be human&quot; and I thought it was marketing stuff &#x27;til I joined and learned to my surprise that <i>it is emphatically not</i>. Also? Legit, the best onboarding experience I&#x27;ve ever had. During a pandemic, no less.<p>The tech stack actually manages to balance cool with useful, too. It&#x27;s a multi-cloud environment running Kubernetes on AWS and GCP, with Elixir, Golang, and some NodeJS (some JS, mostly TypeScript), plus React and TypeScript for all the usual bells and whistles.<p>Mux is a good place to be and if video is your bag, or even just sounds interesting, you should check us out.
