So yes people really think decisions are being made by a monopoly to protect their monopoly (and their profits). A chunk of those billions they have is actually money generated by these monopolistic practices.<p>It&#x27;s juvenile to imagine them sitting at board meeting and discussing &quot;How can we protect our monopoly?&quot;, that&#x27;s like saying the NSA is discussing by board meetings &quot;how can we further invade everyones privacy?&quot;. But they most definitely <i>are</i> discussing how they can protect their <i>market share</i> and how to <i>edge out</i> competition.')
