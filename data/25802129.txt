Give each item a permanent, unique id. Make each item remember the id of the next and&#x2F;or previous item in the list. Reordering touches just two or three items, and there is no problem with running out of space or needing to re-index anything, ever. Of course, basic ordered query is murder from an efficiency standpoint, and the approach might be firmly rejected on that basis. But if weâ€™re looking at approaches with a variety of tradeoffs, the linked list is worth mentioning.')
