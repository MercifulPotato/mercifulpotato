My first eng leadership role I was promoted out of the team. Everyone already knew I had what it took (I was one of the core group pushing hard to get the product out the door) so &quot;engineering respect&quot; came naturally. Fast forward to being hired as an EM - I realized I had to earn this all over again AND I couldn&#x27;t do it just be being another peer in the trenches. Being an authentic leader is _hard work_, but it pays off when you see your team succeed.')
