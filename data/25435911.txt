In terms of delivering the game at a certain point, it’s really not about the number of people; it’s not like throwing in – in the last month – 200 or so people would actually help. So, the answer is no; this is not related to the fact that we could have thrown 300 or 500 more people into the fray and things would have happened differently.<p>This is interesting info for someone like me that doesn&#x27;t work in this field. It&#x27;s something that I can understand intuitively, but it&#x27;s nice to see that confirmed.')
