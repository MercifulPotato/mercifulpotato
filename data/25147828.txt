Thats good enough for me. Glad you agree that it would increase the developer revenue split.<p>I never agreed. Please don&#x27;t put words into my mouth. It is soo disingenous. I haven&#x27;t done it to you so don&#x27;t do it to me.<p>As for the rest of the points. You aren&#x27;t accepting the reality of the situation. It will benefit nobody other than EPIC which have a money printer called fortnite. EPIC doesn&#x27;t care about other developers it cares about itself,. Nobody will benefit from this in the long run other than EPIC and the other huge companies. But you keep on talking about the theorectical benefits, it is the same sort of mental masturbation that GPL zealots engage it. It is mostly pointless and doesn&#x27;t address reality.<p>Also your concern trolling for the devs is cute. I imagine the vast number of developers are fine with the current revenue splits on storesm, unless you prove otherwise all you are doing is concern trolling to avoid the real issue.<p>As for future court rulings about &quot;anti-competitive&quot; practices. We will see. You and I don&#x27;t know what will happen.<p>The 70&#x2F;30 split which I was originally replying to is not anti-competitive or unfair. It is a normaly split and I will keep on re-iterating this because people on here because they are ignorant think it is unfair when it is perfectly normal.<p>As for app stores. More app stores won&#x27;t benefit the consumer or the developers in the long run as I don&#x27;t think the vast majority of Apple users will use anything other than the official App Store. You can claim theorectically it will be better but in practice that won&#x27;t be the case. It will be a pyrrhic victory at best.')
