I didn&#x27;t enjoy it that much.<p>The reason was less the second half of the game (which I actually found  refreshing), but more that the whole thing felt continuosly slow, very violent, and surfaced the worst about humanity. I&#x27;m typically not sensitive to games and have played my fair amount of shooters - but this one felt like a bit too much.')
