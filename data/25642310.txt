As in infrequently sampling locations. I guess you could get fancier and adjust this with the speed at which the user is moving. I&#x27;d also imagine that just using low precision GPS would help add ambiguity so a person can&#x27;t be exactly located. Of course, there&#x27;s a relevant xkcd[0]. In the &quot;neighborhood&quot; seems like the most precision you&#x27;d want for something like this (of course you could expose this to the user), but I&#x27;m also not even interested in this feature so there&#x27;s a bias.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;2170&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;2170&#x2F;</a>')
