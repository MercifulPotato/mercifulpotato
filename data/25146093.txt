Item(by='jepler', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605758559, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25145999, text='This is obviously not tax advice, but I think the earlier poster is referring to reductions to AGI that are on &quot;schedule C&quot; titled &quot;profit or loss from business&quot;.  Some tax language seems to refer to these as &quot;deductions&quot;, but they are distinct from the &quot;itemized&quot; or &quot;standard&quot; deduction.  Schedule C goes to Schedule 1 goes to 1040 line 7a.  The standard or itemized deduction is on line 9.  The Qualified Business Income Deduction on line 10 is another AGI-reducing gimme for people who get 1099-income distinct from the standard or itemized deduction.  And don&#x27;t forget, your eligibility for Marketplace plans including subsidies is based on your (Modified)AGI, not your gross income, which can be a costly mistake (Based on what I understand now, in 2020 my household would have been able to get a marketplace plan with subsidy but we didn&#x27;t due to not understanding the income guidelines).<p>(note: I may have mixed referring to 2019 and 2020 tax forms here, particularly wher I cited line numbers)')
