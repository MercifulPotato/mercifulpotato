You&#x27;re going to need some artists.&quot; I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s been true for a couple of decades. Performance issue resolution are now less &quot;The Story of Mel&quot; and more &quot;throw processors, memory and bandwidth at it until it has what we need.&quot;  Security requirements are more likely to be your limiting factor than raw speed. There are certainly some niche areas where you&#x27;re working within tight resource limitations (I work in embedded stuff), but Moore&#x27;s law means we can get MS software to run in an SoC, which means we stopped needing artists a while back.')
