While I haven&#x27;t lived in Japan, I have spent a month there.<p>Obviously there aren&#x27;t nearly the number of parking lots as in America, by far. But you can totally find large garages in some areas (parked in a large 7 or so story garage in Yokohama once), malls with large parking lots out in areas like Gunma, and even &quot;hidden&quot; garages in Tokyo (or other cities like Takasaki, even) where you pull into a little open garage area, and then there&#x27;s an attendant who helps you drive the car onto a lift which is basically in the center of the building, which then &quot;automatically&quot; (or manually by the operator) stashes cars in a multi-level car park hidden inside the building.<p>Plus tons of teeny 2-car or whatever lots do exist, they&#x27;re just scattered.<p>I realize in terms of scale that&#x27;s still quite less than in America, which makes sense. But there are definitely parking lots and garages in Japan. :)')
