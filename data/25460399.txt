If the food you are eating has enough nutrients, you should not feel hungry. Nutrition-derived satiety is not the same thing as fullness, which should probably be considered a negative consequence of overeating.<p>Unfortunately many people are so used to eating nutritionally bankrupt food that the connection between satiety and nutrition is broken, and many people exist in such a constant state of hunger that only fullness can temporarily stop them from eating more. The people I&#x27;ve met who overeat fiber to keep themselves from overeating caloric food have typically not been very healthy.<p>This &quot;psychology of a full stomach&quot; is not a requirement to live. In moderation, fiber is fine, but so is lard. You don&#x27;t have to eat until you are full, you can simply stop eating when you have consumed enough nutrients. The body can give  good feedback if one chooses to listen. Unfortunately this innate animalian skill is easy to forget in a world of soda and cheetos.<p>If you want a more thorough exposition of this idea, consider the book &quot;Why Diets Make us Fat&quot; by Sandra Aamodt, especially if you are interested in the psychology of eating. Please stop hating on pork belly. It is fine in moderation.')
