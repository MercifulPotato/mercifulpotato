User growth has flattened and that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re seeing a pivot to random experiments in layout and UI and no meaningful new features. Video conference is barely usable, but somehow adding user icons and a command pop-up (that doesn&#x27;t support all their commands) all made it out to production.<p>The most meaningful thing they&#x27;ve had recently is the cross-org shared channel thing, which is awesome when it works but still onerous to manage. That was two years ago. And it doesn&#x27;t open up that many new users, it just keeps people in slack longer (good for stickiness, bad for growth).')
