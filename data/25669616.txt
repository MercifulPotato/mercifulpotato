I have LG UltraFine 4K USB-C and 5K display port (not the LG one) monitors. M1 can support 5K only through USB-C. This leaves me with HDMI to USB-C so that LG too can be connected. It seems LG speaks display port under USB-C, so there might be a way. Adapters would be some 60-100$ just to test this, though.<p>Other than that Iâ€™m all set for M1. My 2018 MacBook Pro needs power 2-3 times a day no matter how much I try to weed apps. Something remotely strenuous happens fans take off.')
