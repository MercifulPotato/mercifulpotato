Elastic noted that, in their experience, some unspecified number of Amazon customers believed the Amazon product was somehow associated with Elastic. Elastic implied this was a result of Amazon&#x27;s use of their trademark but all of this is hard to verify or quantify.<p>RedisLabs fought a similar battle with Amazon, they also ended up making changes to their license. I really do think the issue here is the scale of AWS and the very large pool of customers tied to Amazon&#x27;s offering: there are so many existing and potential customer using AWS that companies like Elastic or RedisLabs feel they can&#x27;t write those potential customers off. It seems to me that if Amazon was interested in the well being of those customers, they would figure out a way to continue to receive improvements from these projects instead of forking their own versions.')
