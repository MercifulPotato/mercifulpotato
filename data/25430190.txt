It is a &quot;cell&quot; phone. The very nature of cell phones means the basestations have to decide where you are and which cell takes your connections. With precise clocks and multi-lateration the position of your handset is known to about 50m. All US telco keep this location data (which is constantly updated) for 2 to 5 years. And they sell it too.<p>No, there is no privacy oriented, no anti-tracking, cell phone. None of them are capable of this. And no amount of &quot;privacy&quot; functions in the user computer will make up for the intrinsic nature of cell phones. Because cell phones are so incredibly useful people bend over backwards mentally to try to ignore this. They get angry when it&#x27;s pointed out because it&#x27;s &quot;irrelevant&quot;. But it isn&#x27;t. This is <i>real</i> tracking of <i>you</i>. Far worse than any &quot;internet&quot; tracking.')
