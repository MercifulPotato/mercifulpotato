Why is congress punting the &quot;lawmaking&quot; bureaucracy to the executive instead of it being under its own branch.<p>There are 2 possible reasons I see.<p>1) having to change the political leadership of it every 2 years (instead of 4) means it possibly wont be as effective.<p>2) as there is both a &quot;lawmaking&quot; and &quot;enforcement&quot; aspect to it, it makes sense for it to be under &quot;one roof&quot; so to speak, and it would probably be more problematic for the executive to cede that to congress than vice versa.<p>perhaps there are other reasons?  and one can counter the above reasons?')
