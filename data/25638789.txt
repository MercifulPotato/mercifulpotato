Candidates for more senior roles have a similar problem regarding systems design.  They can find and parrot little statements they&#x27;ve seen on forums, but when you ask them to explain, their understanding turns out to be shallow.<p>I don&#x27;t use programming exercises as a sufficient measure, but they are a necessary one.<p>Now I feel obligated to add that footer: We&#x27;re hiring! ;-)')
