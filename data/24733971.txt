This area of the brain, particularly the lateral frontal pole, is responsible for long term planning and decisionmaking, it&#x27;s also one of the latest developing parts of the brain that&#x27;s involved in decisionmaking.<p>What I&#x27;m getting at is that it&#x27;s ridiculous to try to argue that a 17-18 year old&#x27;s abilities to plan and make decisions around the future are on par with the abilities of a 25+ year old. The average age of enlistment is 20-21 with a lower bounds of 17.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing that the military doesn&#x27;t provide _lots_ of opportunities to people or that people only enlist for the benefits (the best I could find was a RAND Corp survey predicting likelihood of choosing enlisting of working or going to college), I&#x27;m arguing that it&#x27;s shameful that we aren&#x27;t able to provide similar opportunities without putting young people, who are at a disadvantage when calculating the risk involved, in shitty situations.')
