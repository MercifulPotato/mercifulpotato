Marissa Mayer is holding a pillow that says &quot;Be Nice Or Leave&quot;. Ironic given all the stories that came out of her time at Yahoo. The one that really stands out given current circumstances was when she forced everyone to work at the office, then built a nursery at work (presumably with company money) so she could have her baby next to her all day.<p>&quot;we value diversity in the classic sense as well as a diversity of opinions, values, and ideas.&quot;<p>&quot;Above all, everyone on our team is smart, loves to learn, and is NICE. Because life is too short to spend time working with people who arenâ€™t nice.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s possible that the reports coming out of Yahoo were made up, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s much of a stretch to say her reputation makes it tough to hire good employees. I can&#x27;t find it now, but I recall a NY Times story about how miserable it was to work for her.<p>Edit: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;01&#x2F;11&#x2F;technology&#x2F;yahoos-brain-drain-shows-a-loss-of-faith-inside-the-company.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;01&#x2F;11&#x2F;technology&#x2F;yahoos-brain-d...</a><p>&quot;...the common criticism that she was tightfisted with praise and sometimes displayed a harshness that could be demoralizing.&quot;<p>&quot;Last March, Ms. Mayer told the staff at an all-hands meeting that the bloodletting was finally over. Shortly thereafter, she changed her mind and demanded more cuts. All told, about 1,100 people lost their jobs in the layoffs.&quot;')
