Some other notes:<p>- Nim and rust have macros.<p>- D has very high-quality metaprogramming (probably better than any other language without macros).<p>- (Afaik swift and zig have fairly normal templates.  I don&#x27;t know as much about those.)<p>- D and zig have compile-time function execution (think c++ constexpr on steroids on steroids).<p>- Swift is likely to be the slowest of the bunch; like go, though it&#x27;s technically compiled to native code, its performance profile is closer to that of a managed language.  The others should be generally on par with each other and with c.')
