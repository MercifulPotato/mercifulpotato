Lower maintenance and all that. As <i>simpler</i> devices, building them should be something competitors are able to do.<p>Battery technology is also, of course, critical to get the right balance of price, range, charging speed, production numbers, etc.<p>So given global regulations putting pressure on industry conversion from ICE to electric powertrains, there is zero doubt that investments will be made by big players <i>and</i> they will have to stop playing games and putting out weird-looking vehicles they do not really intend to sell. This will have an impact on Tesla&#x27;s presumed dominance of electric cars, but how much of an impact is hotly contested!')
