Like we can only legitimately support a small amount of workers in any field; if we have more it drops earning potential to  near nothing, like in most creative or labor fields.<p>We also simply are too efficient to have multiple of a field any more too. We end up having one department store chain instead of four or five in an area; every market seems to solidify into 2 or 3 companies. Many jobs are virtualized to where those companies hire a fraction of humanity and have weak supply chains.<p>I think what will happen is just over time we will have less people. People will stop reproducing in sort of an equilibrium until we reach a point where we balance out to the economy&#x27;s needs. I don&#x27;t think it will be top down, but people simply cannot afford to have kids in a part time gig economy.')
