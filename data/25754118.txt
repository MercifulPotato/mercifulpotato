Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=[25754287], score=None, time=1610487306, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25752444, text='&gt;  See Trope 9: &quot;This speech may be protected for now, but the law is always changing.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that <i>no</i> legally forbidden censorship has been happening with regards to the recent insurrection against congress.<p>&gt; TLDR: yeah, the law can change, but it&#x27;s highly unlikely because &quot;the United States Supreme Court has been more consistently protective of free speech than of any other right, especially in the face of media sensibilities about &quot;harmful&quot; words&quot;<p>But that&#x27;s not a fixed fact of nature, it&#x27;s a reaction to a particular social and technological context.<p>For instance, if someone discovers an idea instantly turns 10% those who hear it into murderous zealots (sort of like the poem in &quot;The Tyranny of Heaven&quot; by Stephen Baxter), that idea is going to censored <i>hard</i> and the Supreme Court will be like &quot;yup, ban it.&quot;<p>Likewise, if some social change or technology renders the legal regime that the Supreme Court has created a cause of serious dysfunction, then Supreme Court is going to have to change that regime to accommodate.  Idealism&#x27;s great, but not when it doesn&#x27;t work.')
