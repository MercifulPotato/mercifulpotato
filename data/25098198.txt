When you have hundreds or thousands of something in the wild, you can&#x27;t rely on always having a logic analyzer connected when something anomolous happens.<p>Often times, a UART is just one of many sinks for console-like data. You might direct messages to nonvolatile memory for logging purposes, over a network link for remote diagnostics, or a display if you have one.<p>If you&#x27;re running Linux, then you get that for free more or less. If you&#x27;re running bare metal, then you usually have to build it yourself. It&#x27;s always worth it.')
