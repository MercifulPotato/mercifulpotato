I don&#x27;t think there is anybody asserting that the RIAA is the author of youtube-dl and thereby eligible to make a claim under that section.<p>I would also be curious to see you cite a case that says that refusing a takedown notice in one case costs anyone the Section 512 safe harbor in all other cases where they continue to execute takedown notices, since that would be oppressive and ridiculous.')
