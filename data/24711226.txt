If penalty kicks become to successful though, FIFA might decide to make it more difficult for the kicker instead of going back to the previous chaos. Examples are:<p>1. if the goalkeeper reflects the ball, nobody can approach it and try again.<p>2. the goalkeeper could be allowed to leave the goal line and meet the ball.<p>3. the goals could be made narrower.')
