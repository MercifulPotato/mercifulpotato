Though there are some differences in fiscal policy like for instance Vat tax (Spain 21% for service industry, Germany 19%).<p>I believe the main reason why the USA have such a high salary in comparison is because of a few factors:\nMost importantly a huge zone speaking one single language that by now is spoken throughout the world, leading to a much bigger initial market, thus making it easier to create start ups and selling your goods. So you can easily invest in R&amp;D.<p>Additionally, silicon valley is home to huge monopolies&#x2F;duopolies like Google, Apple, Intel etc. And while these might hurt competition and the market as a whole, they also increase the demand for labour in the US.<p>Another contributing factor, though I don&#x27;t have any numbers to back it up is that higher education is a privilege in the US whereas in Germany it is a commodity.')
