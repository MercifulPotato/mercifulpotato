All the food science in the world can&#x27;t seem to solve this problem (I&#x27;ve tried it homemade, by several skilled professionals, I&#x27;ve tried what was rated as some of the best vegan pizza in my city, mutiple times of the years, and the list goes on).<p>Until it tastes like the pizza I have fundamentally come to expect pizza to taste like, it just isn&#x27;t worth switching for me.<p>If you can solve this problem, nobody is going to care if its vegan or not, because it just taste good.<p>I wish PETA and the like would focus their time and money on this, since it would actually yield the net benefit results they&#x27;re looking for without the air of hositility some of their followers have.<p>Yes, you can debate whether its right or wrong to even think this way. The truth is, people in large already do, why not meet them where they are at?')
