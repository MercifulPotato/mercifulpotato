This has worked for me in some instances in Excel whereby I have to escape certain things inside a string, but I would not be surprised if Excel still messes this up. For example, giving the triangle exclamation mark box and then helpfully suggest to convert to number.<p>If you want to go further, you can do something like write a routine that alters the CSV, such as entry1,hospitalString(0123456789),entry2. Sure, there are problems with this too, but Excel can break a lot of things and the above examples I do use in practise (the first example I put the double quotes to escape single quotes in foreign language unicode).<p>Another thing Excel can do is break your dates, by switching months (usually only for dates &lt; 13th of the month, but often a partial conversion in your data for &lt; 13th and &gt;= 13th) or convert dates to integers.')
