They would help people isolate... so you’re still talking about locking people down to protect them.<p>Free N95 masks would help to the extent it increases the number of people wearing them. But that’s hardly aggressive. Aggressive would be mandating that old&#x2F;vulnerable people wear masks (which is another form of lockdown).<p>Free healthcare would help with the financial situation of those that get the virus and survive, which isn’t exactly the goal.<p>Priority vaccination... well, there is no safe and effective vaccine. Maybe that will be a good path six months from now. But if we had one, the goal would be to vaccinate everyone. Priority would be nice, but would ultimately only shorten the months-long window for infection (vs those without priority) by a matter of weeks. So that would be helpful, but not a game changer.')
