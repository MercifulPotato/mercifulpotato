I have installed temporary containers (that is a Firefox only feature sadly), 15 minutes after I close the last tab in that group all those cookies are automatically deleted.<p>Each tab group then has its own cookie container, so I can have multiple groups open and they don&#x27;t share anything - I can login to different google (or any other service) accounts in different contains and it works like I want it to.<p>For the sites that I want to use logged in, I either create a special container for that site only, or I just use a password manager to log me in each time I need to visit it.<p>The added privacy is great, the peace of mind in just clicking I agree is great.')
