Dogs are still allowed.<p>How would they verify claims? Ask for a prescription or a note from a doctor or psychiatrist?<p>EDIT: I&#x27;m wrong, only service dogs are allowed, so they need to be trained to do a specific task to help a person with a disability.<p>But also, I&#x27;m pretty sure verication was already technically required.
