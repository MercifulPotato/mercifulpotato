There&#x27;s significant amount of objectionable and even illegal content on Twitter. The central moderation is a figleaf over it.<p><i>&gt;w.r.t. your #5: how does &#x27;participation in some groups is subject to moderation, but participation is optional&#x27; fit with the platform&#x2F;publisher dichotomy?</i><p>To re-emphasize: <i>&gt;&gt;Certain groups were centrally moderated through middlemen; (participation in those was optional), and content was explicitly submitted to moderation</i>.<p>Easily the key distinction is that the moderators weren&#x27;t part of the platform. It was not the platform doing the moderating. It was pre-arranged users that were designated by the community to have a say who selects the best posts to then forward. It wasn&#x27;t &quot;this post breaks our ever-shifting rules&quot;; it was &quot;this post is good enough for me to  to forward it to the list&quot;. The proverbial <i>firewall</i> separating the platform from the users doing the selection is the key distinction.<p>The closest modern analogy of how the moderated Usenet groups were is &quot;a public-read, private-commit Git repo, with project heads accepting pull requests at their discretion&quot;.')
