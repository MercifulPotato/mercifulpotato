The much larger battery was also a factor.<p>My use case also involves a fair amount of tripod work, and I even picked up a gimbal just recently.<p>So I&#x27;m glad that Sigma is making lenses which are cheaper &#x2F; better for the price by leaving out OSS, because there are ways to not need it. If you figure OSS would cost another $200 per lens, which seems a little low but is in the ballpark, then with the Sigma &#x27;trio&#x27; of 1.4 primes, the difference between the a6100 and a6600 is just about a wash.')
