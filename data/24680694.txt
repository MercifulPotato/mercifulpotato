Papers can&#x27;t just be &quot;clear&quot; for a benign reader: they need to be bulletproof against capricious people who are ready to reject things for random reasons.</i><p>Considering how many papers I read that <i>still</i> are easily misunderstood even by smart readers... I think &quot;defensive writing&quot; is better understood as &quot;good writing&quot;.<p>Of course papers are expected to be &quot;bulletproof.&quot; It&#x27;s called a standard of excellence. Peer review is supposed to be meaningful, not a rubber stamp. But the sneaky secret is, <i>the bar isn&#x27;t even that high</i>. I read so many papers where I wonder why an obvious alternative interpretation isn&#x27;t even mentioned, or an opposing viewpoint isn&#x27;t cited, or where the author subtly misrepresents another author.<p>(&quot;Capricious people&quot; are a separate subject, but they certainly exist just as much in industry as in academia...)<p>The rest of the post aside, this particular bit of the &quot;rant&quot; just feels like a defense of lazy writing. An academic paper isn&#x27;t just a blog post, and it shouldn&#x27;t be.')
