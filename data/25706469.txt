It definitely is not a workhorse of productivity as we used to but I did not buy pinephone to be one. I wanted a phone I can use for making calls and sending texts, and maybe taking photos. And the one that does not spy on me. I have plans to run podman on it and use it for things like firefox or thunderbird but that&#x27;s not critical. I am happy to have a phone that does not constantly draw my attention :)<p>And on a side note Arch community is soooo briliant, they even helped me on New Year&#x27;s Eve when I had spare time to play with the phone. It&#x27;s kind of response that brings back some nice memories :)')
