The hardware of the iPad Pro is actually even better than the Macbook Air, considering the built-in cellular modem, additional camera, touch screen &#x2F;w pencil support, motion sensors, two more speakers, micro-location, GPS, etc.<p>The processing power should be behind the Macbook (whether that&#x27;s significant, I don&#x27;t know), but the next iteration could close the gap. If it wasn&#x27;t for iPadOS artificially limiting the use cases, I&#x27;d see an iPad Pro with detachable keyboard as superior to a Macbook for the aforementioned reasons.')
