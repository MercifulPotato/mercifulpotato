What you are describing is a situation where I lend money to my friend, and <i>for the purpose of your analysis</i>, you assume that I will always have lent out a similar amount of money forever starting now.<p>That&#x27;s fine if that&#x27;s what you want to analyse. But that isn&#x27;t the situation I described.')
