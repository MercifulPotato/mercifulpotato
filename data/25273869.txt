I&#x27;d love to see something that looks and feels like a forum than IM&#x2F;chat. Systems like Slack are great for quick collaboration, but not ideal for persisting and disseminating information across diverse&#x2F;large teams and organizations. I want to go to my messaging platform and see the topics that have been started and the discussions within them. This reduces all of the banter and chatter that endlessly goes one each day that just adds to the noise. I can go on and on, but maybe someday I&#x27;ll get to see what I&#x27;m envisioning come to life.')
