The waits that some folks had to endure in the primaries were a huge problem. Georgia absolutely has history of voter suppression like many post-confederate states, and some seriously shady stuff has gone down in the past.<p>However, the really long lines yesterday were more attributable to incredible turnout on the first day of early voting, which also happened to be a federal holiday so many people had the spare time to come out and vote. There are new voting systems, new volunteers for whom that was their first day running the polls, and a very motivated electorate.<p>For comparison, today, two days later, I know of at least two people who were in and out in 15 minutes in some of the same areas that had incredible lines on Monday.<p>There are legit voter suppression stories of great concern in GA, but I don&#x27;t think the lines of Oct 12 qualify. I&#x27;m totally open to being corrected on this opinion though.')
