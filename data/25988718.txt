There hasn&#x27;t been a GPU &quot;shortage&quot; for multiple years. But there are certainly shortages at different times in the past few years.<p>Nvidia had to manipulate their Financial Numbers to cover up for excessive stock sitting in Channel due to Bitcoin crash. It took them 3 quarters ( and more ) to clear those inventory out. AMD had similar situation but their impact were much smaller due to less percentage using it for mining.<p>This teach GPU vendor an important lesson. ( Edit: Imagine the worst case scenerio AMD has a new product launch and has ample of stocks while you have three quarter worth of old products not moving. )<p>Since then they are much more conservative with respect to forecast and planning. It is FAR better to have enough demand waiting for GPU than it is for GPU sitting in channel quite literally <i>begging</i> for their Distributors to sell them.<p>This conservativeness has a knock-on effect on TSMC planning. At the start of pandemic everyone thought the economy could take a tank, which means forecast and estimation were even lower. But reality is all of a sudden PC sales and GPU sales are hitting new height due to more Stay at home and Gaming. Bitcoin is pushing into new height so casual miners are back.<p>You are taking <i>two</i> conservative supply decision ( Previous over Supply and Pandemic ) and <i>two</i> Demand reality ( PC &#x2F; Gaming and Bitcoin ). That is Four level of differences. Catching up takes time, and it doesn&#x27;t help when the <i>whole</i> industry, not just GPU, but everything from WiFi, 5G Modem, SoC, CPU, Amazon Server GPU, NPU are all in demand. <i>Both</i> Intel and AMD grew 10% despite Intel having lower ASP ( i.e Higher Unit Sales ) and were selling as many as they could. The Silicon demand are far greater than even the most optimistic analysis has predicted.')
