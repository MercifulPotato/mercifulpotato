So we compromise and accept the <i>right</i> amount of laws.<p>I think it&#x27;s the same thing with OSS ... we could all public domain our code but most people don&#x27;t because putting your code under a license has value.  It&#x27;s LESS free than public domain but more free because you&#x27;re giving a license to the user but they can&#x27;t sue you because they&#x27;re no implied warranty.<p>If we had an a source code license that forced someone like Amazon to license the code we wouldn&#x27;t be in this position.')
