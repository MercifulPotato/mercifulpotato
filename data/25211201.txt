U.S. backed authoritarian capitalist regime ...&quot; and &quot;... Washington&#x27;s Anticommunist Crusade and the Mass Murder Program ...&quot;.<p>This isn&#x27;t a critique piece against today&#x27;s MSM. It&#x27;s a piece that makes the point that the US is the evil force in the world today. You can feel that way and have arguments about that. That&#x27;s fine and fair. But it&#x27;s certainly not an example for critique against the MSM in the context of today and this discussion.')
