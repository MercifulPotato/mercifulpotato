Item(by='kortilla', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610937814, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25815047, text='&gt;Are there really that many local newspapers using SPAs though? I feel like advertisers delivering boatloads of JS with their ads sometimes gets conflated in this discussion.<p>Yes, I encounter it frequently. Some slow fucking main page loads for 5 seconds with no article in sight (presumably chewing on all of the trackers, assets, whatever, but no story nonetheless). Then a spinner starts to load the article and something stutters in after another 5 seconds and I get false hope that I can start reading. Another two seconds and gdpr cookie notice pops over, then a subscribe widget, then maybe a local weather widget. Close all this shit and now read the article on half of my screen because the top half is occupied by a banner with a breaking news ticker.<p>&gt; Another point, it&#x27;s true Reddit doesn&#x27;t need a SPA. However, while I hate their new design, at the scale of Reddit an SPA can have real effects on server costs as well as user engagement. And, if you look at their growth numbers it seems to be working out for them<p>I’m sure their developers smoke some pot too, but we don’t attribute that to their growth. Why would you think an SPA helps when it’s one of the most widely hated features of the site? Has it occurred to you that the growth might be happening for a different reason?<p>&gt; Third, the ecosystem of well-built components means that even if you don&#x27;t really need a SPA, using React could save you money in launching your MVP, which is a big consideration for startups.<p>The ecosystem of server side stuff is far deeper and more mature. I don’t buy this argument.<p>&gt; believe this is a loosing battle, not because of hype, but because of the business reasons for using frameworks that are capable of delivering richer widgets. We can have our cake and eat it too, instead of fighting the shift in technology.<p>Unlikely. Once the hype dies down people will realize SPAs are like mobile apps. You don’t need them for the vast majority of use cases and their instability and general shit performance will result in punishment by the search engines to the point where people with html5+css sites will rank higher and suffocate the bloated turds.')
