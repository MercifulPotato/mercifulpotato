Item(by='josteink', descendants=None, kids=[25671667], score=None, time=1610027702, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25670346, text='&gt; Is Matrix a good alternative to Signal?<p>To a certain degree I&#x27;d say this is apples vs oranges.<p>Before you shoot me down, let me explain. The reason I say that is because of the core focus of the different platforms.<p>Signal&#x27;s priority-one use-case is clearly person-to-person IM and communication. The UI, setup-process and entire architecture is optimized for this one use-case, with all other use-cases being shoehorned in to fit whatever was built for that.<p>I&#x27;d say Matrix (for the moment disregarding a key feature, bridging) has as its primary use-case to be a discord&#x2F;slack&#x2F;IRC alternative, to handle &quot;channels&quot;, long term group chats and basically persistent online collaboration workspaces.<p>Sure. Technically speaking, Matrix has a full support for E2E encrypted person-to-person IM and communications (even phone-calls and audio!), and you can use it for that. But this was clearly not the <i>primary</i> use-case Matrix was designed to solve.<p>Therefore IMO Matrix person-to-person chat has this slightly shoehorned-in feeling, so you may have a somewhat lesser user-experience when using Matrix to do these things than other platforms which had this as their primary goal.<p>Disclaimer: Happy Matrix-user, running own server, bridging both FB, WhatsApp and Signal into the matrix-verse.')
