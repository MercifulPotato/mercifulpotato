Publication bias means only positive results get published, even if it&#x27;s only the occasional lucky studies (or ones with overt cheating or innocent bad statistics) which come out positive. Researchers know about it and grumble privately, because they wasted months or years of effort before figuring out it&#x27;s largely false.
