I may have antropomorphosized it too much, but my goal was to follow a sort of temporal&#x2F;casual trail that we find interesting.<p>The way I imagine my idea is that, if you pick a species and its interesting descendants, and order on a timeline like such:<p><pre><code>  A --&gt; B --&gt; C --&gt; D\n</code></pre>\nWhat really happens is more like:<p><pre><code>  [bunch of other spinoffs]\n    ^\n    |\n  A --&gt; B --&gt; ...\n</code></pre>\nAnd that some of those spinoff could be viruses. Imagine a mutation to A causes a bunch of functionality in the organism to shut down (and in subsequent generations disappear), while leaving a viable organism. For a sufficiently uncomplicated A, the result of such mutation could be a bundle of genes wrapped in a shell with an injection mechanism. That&#x27;s a virus.')
