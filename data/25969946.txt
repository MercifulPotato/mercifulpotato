I pretty much gave up on using it. On Android in most apps you can double tap, hold the second tap, then swipe up and down to zoom. It&#x27;s a lot more natural than it sounds and it gives you precise control over both the zoom location and zoom amount.<p>On iOS you can try the gesture in Maps, and then wonder why they never added it to Safari.')
