Item(by='jlokier', descendants=None, kids=[24674871], score=None, time=1601757682, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24674095, text='&gt; It&#x27;s supposed to contain a list of known defects or it isn&#x27;t.<p>If it were just a list of defects, this discussion wouldn&#x27;t have started.<p>By &quot;informational&quot; I mean reporting that a bug exists.  &quot;When I do X, Y happens and Z should happen instead.  You might like to know.  Best wishes.&quot;.<p>By the other kind, I mean asking for a solution.  &quot;When I do X, Y happens, please make Z happen instead.  Await your prompt reply, Kthx&quot;.<p>Often there&#x27;s no way to tell which one is intended.  A tick box to differentiate between &quot;I&#x27;m just reporting this, I don&#x27;t need the change&quot; versus &quot;I would find a solution useful&quot; or even &quot;can someone specifically help me find a solution&quot; seems like it would be helpful.<p>These are different kinds of bug report, and they <i>all</i> land in a typical GitHub-style or Bugzilla-style public issue tracker.<p>The second kind are not defect reports, and we haven&#x27;t even mentioned feature requests, which aren&#x27;t defects at all.  They land in the issue tracker as well.<p>&gt; You&#x27;re strawmanning<p>Hmm, maybe I should rephrase to clarify where the emphasis was intended: &quot;If I submit a bug report and the maintainer replies thinking I wanted something from them, it would be silly for me to become infuriated because my effort seems wasted&quot;.  That addresses the scenario in the comment I replied to, so not a straw man.<p>&gt; where people have responded in genuinely obnoxious<p><i>Obnoxious is not in the comment I replied to.</i>  You&#x27;ve projected that.  The maintainer in that scenario may have replied politely.  The only issue under discussion was the submitter&#x27;s reaction to a maintainer thinking the submitter wanted something.<p>Are you sure you&#x27;re not strawmanning and counterfactualising?<p>&gt; This is nuts. This can only be true if there are much, much bigger problems afoot.<p>Well, it&#x27;s true.  Yes there are problems.  That&#x27;s why this discussion is taking place.  Do you have solutions?<p>&gt; Most of this was figured out years ago and opened up to the public under Netscape. Folks abandoning or ignoring those lessons [...]<p>And these lessons are?  If you think it&#x27;s nuts, it would be nice if you were to offer useful solutions.<p>I was around when Netscape opened up.  No solutions leap out to me arising from that, then or now.  Netscape&#x27;s own lessons appear to be about corporate management and control of projects.<p>The vast majority of open source projects, especially those where people report feeling burdened, are run by unpaid people in their spare time (or when they should be sleeping), as one-person projects.  Netscape&#x27;s corporate strategy doesn&#x27;t seem relevant here.  (And ESR&#x27;s &quot;Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;, which was related to Netscape&#x27;s changes, doesn&#x27;t provide a solution either.)')
