Out in the middle of nowhere for an organised event, and the organisers said we had to use the backup route. I had it downloaded to my phone, but Garmin Connect won&#x27;t work at all without an internet connection.<p>Ended up just using my phone for navigation, and even though I was recording GPS and heart rate the whole time, I&#x27;d only used 50% battery after 14 hours riding. Nice.<p>There was another guy at the campsite who was looking for someone who had downloaded the route. I AirDropped it to him, and he transferred it to his Wahoo bike computer with no trouble.<p>For shorter rides&#x2F;runs, I use the WorkOutdoors app on the Apple Watch. It&#x27;s only battery life that&#x27;s an issue when the activity is longer than 6 hours. Just this morning I had the opportunity to go for a run a bit out of my normal zones, so within a minute I had sketched out a route on the phone and transferred it over to the watch. (That some of the paths I&#x27;d used didn&#x27;t actually exist anymore was a separate issue, but I&#x27;ve already updated OpenStreetMap to fix that.)')
