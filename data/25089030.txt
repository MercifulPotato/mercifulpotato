Item(by='imgabe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605312377, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25083032, text='&gt; Facebook isn&#x27;t a public utility that is somehow obligated to relay and promote all speech equally<p>I understand what Facebook is and isn&#x27;t obligated to do. I&#x27;m not saying they are <i>obligated</i> to be neutral. They are not obligated to play the role of speech police either. I am saying it would be <i>better</i> for society as a whole if they leave adults to make up their own minds about speech. Speech should not be controlled by corporations.<p>Yes, they <i>can</i> impose whatever limits they want. That doesn&#x27;t meant that it&#x27;s <i>good</i> or that we should be happy about it or that we are not allowed to question whatever limits they impose.<p>And sure you can argue &quot;just don&#x27;t use Facebook&quot;. That is fine, for now. Facebook is a large, but not completely necessary part of society. What happens when it becomes larger and more necessary (or another company does) and we&#x27;ve already imbued them with the power to decide what people are and are not allowed to say? Do you think then they&#x27;ll just give that power up?<p>Have you seen that episode of Black Mirror where you can literally ghost people? I forget exactly, but there was some way to punish people by making them physically invisible and inaudible, so they had could barely interact with the world. I guess they could still eat, but they couldn&#x27;t talk to or be acknowledged by anyone.<p>Obviously, getting banned from Facebook is not that, but it&#x27;s maybe Version 0.01 of that, and I get the distinct impression that people here would be perfectly fine with that as long as it happens to people they don&#x27;t like.')
