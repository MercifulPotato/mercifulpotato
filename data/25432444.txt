Imagine a population of [1, 100, 100, 100] or a population of [1,1,1,1,999999]. Two examples where the population that is below average exceeds half the population and is below half the population.<p>But this is just semantics. If the population follows a bell curve and at high resolution standard deviations, what you said is generally true.')
