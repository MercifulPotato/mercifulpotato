You can often write many words without looking at the paper. Embrace the messy and ugly writing. Legibility only matters in that you can still read it.<p>I still want to learn cursive but my handwriting style uses plenty of flourishes that mimic cursive. Or writing words that are nearly illegible but easy to know in context.')
