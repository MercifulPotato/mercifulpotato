There are towns crossing the English-Welsh border and English-Scottish border which has been an issue with the increasing fragmentation of the UK in the last year. Particularly in lockdowns people officially can&#x27;t go to their local shops as it&#x27;s &quot;over the border&quot;. Pretty ridiculous but it reinforces the idea that UK is looking more and more like separate  areas -- an idea that the present government appears to want to support?<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just the lack of respect for the Good Friday Agreement (I wonder if Raab has read it yet) the unity of the UK as a whole is looking quite strained to me.<p>[<i>Just my private opinion.</i>]')
