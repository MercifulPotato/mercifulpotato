Item(by='ynniv', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608181227, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25452546, text='A Suburban is a &quot;full size SUV&quot;, which weighs, drives, and has the fuel economy of a truck. Minivans are closer in size, weight, fuel economy, and cost to the car derived &quot;mid size SUVs&quot;, but they have much more cargo space. Still, the Odyssey claims roughly the same amount of &quot;maximum interior cargo volume&quot; as the Suburban, and almost twice that of the &quot;most popular SUV&quot;, the midsize Ford Explorer. It&#x27;s highly optimized for providing interior space: where the spare tire should be is a deep tub for cargo or to hold the folded down rear seats. The actual spare tire is located in the second row footwell, though you could never tell.')
