I think that yes, everyone should feel that they can offer their pronouns, unsolicited, and I believe that we should encourage that this is an acceptable behaviour, since then eventually, it&#x27;ll be something we don&#x27;t even have to discuss. But inferring hatred strikes me as a very acute form of assuming bad-faith.<p>I treat strangers with the assumption that they are respectful until they earn an opinion to the contrary.')
