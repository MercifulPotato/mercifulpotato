When my daughters were around 4 and 6 I introduced them to Shproti, a small canned fish, as a desert. I would only let them eat it on special occasions, and only if they were well behaved. For probably five years they would reject ice cream in favour of these canned fish if given the chance.<p>I do not know who broke to them the secret, but now the little one does not like them anymore. The older still eats the fish with me, but of course no longer as a desert.')
