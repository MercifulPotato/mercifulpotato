But another part is that the Wild West internet also had its own major issues -- roving bandits, to carry the analogy -- and these big companies did solve real problems that were only growing with time.<p>Gmail&#x27;s spam filtering. Recaptcha&#x27;s bot rejection. Facebook&#x27;s identity verification. Paypal&#x27;s secure credit card processing. Google de-ranking link farms. Youtube&#x27;s hosting costs. All of these very effectively solved real problems with the old web, and those problems were growing as bad actors became more sophisticated.<p>I like the old web too, but I do appreciate that an attempt to return to it would still require very effective tools to solve at least some of these problems, and they&#x27;d require constant improvement to keep the roving bandits at bay.')
