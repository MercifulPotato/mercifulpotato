Autopilot (including the so called &quot;full self driving&quot;) is level 2, meaning that the driver has to pay attention at all times.<p>From a driver responsibility point of view, it is a fancy cruise control, there is no question about autonomous certification because the car isn&#x27;t autonomous.<p>If one day, Tesla thinks it is OK for drivers not to pay attention and wants to make it legal, that&#x27;s when the question about what kind of tech is reasonable will be asked. But for now, it looks like we are far from it. There is a huge gap between &quot;works well most of the time&quot; and full autonomy.')
