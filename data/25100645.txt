Because that is _mostly_ true but not always (because you can have bugs reported to you that are upstream ones).<p>Do you mean that developers are responsible for fixing them? That is simply false, even in commercial software you have no moral imperative to fix bugs, and very often with good business strategy you ignore a lot of inconsequential bugs.<p>Just about any serious FOSS developer I know has commercial software development experience, so I don&#x27;t think your opinion is as unique as you might imagine.')
