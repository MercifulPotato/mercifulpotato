I&#x27;m from India, currently living in Europe. I&#x27;m an Engineering Manager in a remote team. I started this because in most of the teams I have worked, there was a lack of female in tech. And wanted to contribute towards changing this.<p>In an ideal world, opportunity will be equal - but unfortunately that is not the case right now. Not everyone have access to the equal opportunity.<p>And we are technically not a company yet, we are just a small community. What we try to do is coach people who apply, identify their skill gaps and help them get a job in remote teams. These skills mostly are not technical skills - but cultural and communication gaps.<p>I hope that helps.')
