Many scholors have researched this very topic quite a bit. It helps to illustrate the point when you look into historical tensions between the black and Asian communities, especially in California.<p>Asian communities face less discrimination from the white community as there hasn&#x27;t been a lot of reinforcement of negative stereotypes relating to any of the Asian communities. Compare that with the history and treatment of the black community and you can trace a direct line from slavery to where many communities are today. A lot of propaganda regarding black people had been fed to whites for hundreds of years in order to justify their enslavement.<p>The black community has seen Asians as a &quot;preferred minority&quot; who has benefited from their civil rights work and at the same time given opportunities they didn&#x27;t have without giving back to black communities.<p>There is a lot of nuance in there, but that&#x27;s the super short version.')
