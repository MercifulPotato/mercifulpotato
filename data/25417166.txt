Don&#x27;t they have the right to privacy?&quot;.<p>For example if you&#x27;re gay you might not want everyone to find out. Or if you&#x27;re into some weird kinky stuff. Or even better if you live with a hidden identity because you&#x27;ve witnessed against organized crime.<p>It&#x27;s fine to give away your personal privacy, but it&#x27;s harder to throw other people under the buss (if you&#x27;re capable of empathy as most of us are).')
