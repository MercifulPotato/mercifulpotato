Your statement that &quot;scientific worldview, which is diametrically opposed to religious culture&quot; is itself a dogma, which is one of the features of religion you claim to have surpassed as a scientific person.<p>It is true that modern society contains pretty fundamentally opposed religious vs scientific factions. My point isn&#x27;t to take sides but to point out that what you are calling religion is some kind of oppositional faction defined by rejecting scientific fact. It wasn&#x27;t always the case. But you should judge the nature of religious culture objectively and scientifically, not by it&#x27;s worst modern manifestations.<p>Religious reality was originally and for thousands of years the only reality, and it&#x27;s proponents would have argued as strongly against any alternating philosophy, just at you proclaim that scientific realism is reality and reject any other.<p>My argument is that scientific culture resemblance to religious culture isn&#x27;t coincidence, it&#x27;s the nature of belief in social systems. Meanwhile science culture could learn worlds from religious culture which in my view was very much a science of authority and social unification. That&#x27;s to say that religious cultural realism was more effective at generating belief and that&#x27;s because it was a science of generating belief.')
