Item(by='jamiesonbecker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610746742, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25796812, text='&gt; There is a value to just human responses, answering someone&#x27;s questions can help you look inwards to your service&#x2F;product as well.<p>We do respond to every single email, and hopefully fairly intelligently most of the time ;), even if the customer is a hobbyist or free tier user, especially with regards to security questions. (Although internal stats are slightly meaningless, and survey responses are relatively uncommon for the volume of emails we receive, we do have &gt;99% customer support satisfaction based on our internal tracking.)<p>&gt; Is it possible you could have caught that when replying to a simple set questionnaire like the one in the link but focused on HIPAA?<p>Ha, looks like we mispelled it in one place and spelled it correctly in another! Are you asking if we&#x27;d have caught a misspelling or other oversight on our website on the basis of an emailed questionnaire? Good question, but, to be honest, doubtful (but thank you for bringing it to my attention -- fixed!)<p>We&#x27;ve had wall-of-questions requests like that before, and we either respond with our other certs&#x2F;attestations, or negotiate a BAA, once we get down to more specific questions. For HIPAA, we&#x27;re providing on-premise security software, and not working with PHI in any way (we&#x27;re deployed in some hospital systems in the US), so generally customers are just looking to understand our general security stance and how we can help them meet the Security Rule with login accounts.')
