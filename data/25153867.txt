I know that I&#x27;d contribute to such a worthy effort, but only if the rest of the players would pledge to fund current operations.<p>The biggest GoFundMe campaign according to Wikipedia only raised $25 million in 2020 dollars (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;GoFundMe#Notable_projects" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;GoFundMe#Notable_projects</a>, Bannon&#x27;s et al&#x27;s fraudulent <i>We Build the Wall</i> project).  Arecibo cost $9.3 million to build in 1963 dollars (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ethw.org&#x2F;Milestones:NAIC&#x2F;Arecibo_Radiotelescope,_1963" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ethw.org&#x2F;Milestones:NAIC&#x2F;Arecibo_Radiotelescope,_196...</a>), which is about $80 million in 2020 dollars.  Even after one-time construction costs, millions in ongoing operating costs and maintenance would be required as well.<p>So, no, a GoFundMe campaign to rebuild it is not a possibility.  Even hot-button political issues can&#x27;t get close to the needed funds, and this is not ever going to be a hot-button issue.')
