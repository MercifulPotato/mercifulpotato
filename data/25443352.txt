We have operated for more than 3 years already. I can&#x27;t say that we earn huge money, but it&#x27;s enough for a comfortable life and we can do what we like to do (research, deep learning&#x2F;computer vision&#x2F;NLP).<p>I started the business after defending my PhD. The main reason for this was the lack of interesting job opportunities and I didn&#x27;t consider relocation. That is why the only way to work on interesting projects was remote work in startups.<p>Anyway, I think it makes sense to experiment with different business models to check the market&#x2F;diversify the risks.\nFor e.g. we have started the development of a SaaS platform (video analytics) and plan to launch it in the next year. Don&#x27;t be afraid to experiment.')
