Threatening a cyber attack in response to a downvote probably isn&#x27;t the right way to talk to the moderators either.<p>If someone has a problem with the moderation on this site, email the moderators. I&#x27;ve done so many times and they have been very honest and responsive. If you&#x27;ve reached out to them and you don&#x27;t feel they&#x27;re being honest and responsive, no one is forcing you to use this site. Sometimes I get fed up with the people and&#x2F;or mods too (I don&#x27;t always 100% agree with their actions including actions taken against me) and I take a break for a while, go visit other sites and engage in other communities.<p>What I don&#x27;t do is threaten a cyber attack on an open-registration Internet forum because someone clicked a button next to my comment.')
