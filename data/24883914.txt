Where are you?  Who&#x27;s the president?  It took me a while to realize that these questions were a quick way to evaluate your mental health.  I shudder to think how many times I got them wrong.  I was so proud when I realized that my room had a whiteboard where they wrote the date every day, and all I had to do to was look to know what day it was.  I told the nurse, feeling like I was cheating, but they didn&#x27;t care - I guess if I had the mental capacity to figure that out it was good enough for them.')
