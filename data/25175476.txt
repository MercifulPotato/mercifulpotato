I&#x27;m fine with learning shitty technology. The real issue is the money. Look at the salaries for COBOL jobs. They suck shit.<p>If banks need to update their software, hire people and train them. It will take time, and time is money. That money could be invested into something else (there is an opportunity cost). If that something else is a higher priority to you, then maintaining the integrity of your critical software is not actually as important to you as you say it is.<p>I will not take a pay cut to work on COBOL for a bank.')
