And not because &quot;it&#x27;s bad design&quot;. But because that is the requirement.\nSoon you get pure functions with tons of parameters or parameters that are complicated classes&#x2F;structs themselves because the work that needs to be performed is very complicated.<p>Then you get to the issue of &quot;this function gets the entire class as the input param but it only access a small amount of members in that class&quot;.<p>&quot;Yo bro just split the class into multiple smaller ones&quot;.\nSorry bro can&#x27;t do, those separate classes will need to be acccessed as a whole sooner or later in another part.<p>People act as if there will ever be a thing such as a &quot;perfect programming design&quot;. There won&#x27;t because things will always evolve &amp; change. Real life programs are simply too complex.')
