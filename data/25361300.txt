My assumption at this point is that virtually every single large tech company and ISP have been given NSLs that allow unfiltered and unlimited access to the entirety of these tech company&#x27;s data. It is my assumption that this access is used to permanently store the entirety of everyone&#x27;s web history and activity. I also assume that this collection can be searched with very little accountability by government agents.<p>If you sign up with an email that can be traced to you, or if you ever mention your email in a PM, or post it in a comment, or access an anonymous account in a browser that has been fingerprinted and tied to another account in your real name - my assumption is that this can all be tied back to you. I think anonymous activity on the web is completely dead unless you&#x27;re using Tor or a VPN with a browser that can&#x27;t be fingerprinted (nonviable for nearly everyone), and even then there is speculation.')
