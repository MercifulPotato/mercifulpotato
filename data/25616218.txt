This primarily excludes data which is pay-walled (regardless of how easy that paywall is to bypass) and data which cannot be easily obtained but can be obtained, e.g. through a torrent or on the dark web.<p>This should disqualify books3, but they use it to justify books3.<p>They need to extent that definition transitively. Maybe that’s my frustration. If I collect data from torrents and make it more freely and readily available, then it meets their definition of public data, which is basically what books3 is. If they included it themselves, it wouldn’t meet their definition but because someone else redistributed it first, it’s more okay for them to redistribute?')
