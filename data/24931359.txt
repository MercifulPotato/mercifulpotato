I wound up in my current, quite unique, position, by putting in for a position writing firmware.  I wasn&#x27;t <i>deeply</i> qualified for firmware, but I thought it would be interesting work and I was confident in my ability to learn how to it professionally.  They ended up hiring another person for that job, but they also hired me.  Now they&#x27;re trying to hire more of me and finding it impossible.  Eventually they&#x27;ll cave and let me train somebody.<p>Disclaimer: my skillset includes a lot of non-software engineering, and I work for a company that does a lot more than software.')
