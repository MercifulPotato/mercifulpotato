Which supposedly will have something like 2.5x the transistor density then Intels current production mechanism.<p>Even without much other improvements from AMD this can hurt quite a bit.<p>The only think currently beneficial for Intel is that they don&#x27;t relay on TSMC and in turn are not affected by shortages of nearly everyone else competing for TSMC production capacities. Also they will be less affected if the situation between China and Taiwan escalates.<p>(Through I would argue they didn&#x27;t lost phones, as they never had any relevant footing in the phone marked at all.)')
