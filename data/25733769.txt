However, it may also be equally valid they colluded via private channels to make this happen. BOTH ARE EQUALLY POSSIBLE.<p>Discovery in this kind of lawsuit may lead to the answers. If they did collude, that is a strong argument for anti-trust. Just because they&#x27;re 4 different companies doesn&#x27;t negate the fact they control over 80% to 90% of the American market for hosting, non-SMS text communication and mobile access.<p>It honestly doesn&#x27;t matter what you believe about Parler&#x27;s user contributions. That&#x27;s the entire point of Section 230. From what I&#x27;ve seen they do make a good faith attempt to delete all illegal posts with direct calls to violence.

We are not on a slippery slope. We are in a god damn free fall. If you don&#x27;t see it, they will come for you next and no one will be there to speak for you.')
