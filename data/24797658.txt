Item(by='mlaux', descendants=None, kids=[24797916, 24797701], score=None, time=1602824609, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24797312, text='&gt; There is only one exception to the rule of identical treatment of files on different devices: no link may exist between one file system hierarchy and another. This restriction is enforced so as to avoid the elaborate bookkeeping which would otherwise be required to assure removal of the links when the removable volume is finally dismounted. In particular, in the root directories of all file systems, removable or not, the name .. refers to the directory itself instead of to its parent.<p>Is this saying that if I had a removable disk mounted at &#x2F;mnt&#x2F;foo and issued “cd ..” in that directory, I’d remain in &#x2F;mnt&#x2F;foo instead of moving up to &#x2F;mnt? When did this change to the current behavior?')
