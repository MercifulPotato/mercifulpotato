Sure! But you should know what you&#x27;re getting, and your code review &#x2F; mentoring process should get them straight.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I really understand how this is Ruby&#x27;s or Rails&#x27; fault, unless your premise is &quot;ORMs considered harmful&quot; - in which case, ActiveRecord is far from alone here, and that&#x27;s a different sort of conversation.')
