But testing APIs does not tell you if your latest CSS change broke pointer events on your “add to cart” button, so you can no longer receive orders, etc.<p>If you are wholesale redesigning&#x2F;rebuilding a whole site and all the workflows yes of course you need new tests. But also your users would get pretty impatient if entire ways of working are changing all the time in a way that makes testing a giant moving target.<p>The purpose of a UI test in my mind is to make sure that the core business things a user is supposed to be able to do, are doable. In the context of your blog posts, I think those things <i>should</i> be calcified.<p>Like, I want a test to fail if I remove a workflow that used to be there. I want a test to fail if a form field suddenly has no label. There should be those alerts when functionality that was previously understood to be correct has been changed. Lightweight UI tests with some easily re-approved screenshot diffs goes a long way.')
