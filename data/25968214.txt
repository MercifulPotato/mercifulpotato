On that scale, someone confident, respectable and reasonable saying something earnestly is pretty good evidence. Especially good evidence considering the ease and difficulty of collecting and verifying more serious forms evidence.<p>But this is also why it is so important to have an almost cruel level of cynicism towards politics. The politician figured this out long ago, and will always make sure to look confident, respectable and reasonable when making stuff up and lying. But most people are not cynics and the ugly soup of politics continues to simmer.')
