The horizontal scalability endgame.<p>Amazon designed a system that is perfectly horizontally scalable. The only issue is that they now need 33,000 machines to achieve the throughput of TimescaleDB running on a single node.<p>I would call the results this new school of software development produces horrifying, but I already get lynched every time I tell a startup that their horrifyingly complex horizontally &#x27;scalable&#x27; AWS setup that costs them $10k a month could be replaced by a handful of ducktape running on a rPI.<p>The best part is how the scaling never really works and just adding a load balancer and a second rPI would&#x27;ve worked better.<p>&quot;We didn&#x27;t think we&#x27;d get <i>that</i> many users.

My rPI is serving 2 million monthly visitors right now and I&#x27;m still waiting for CPU usage to dip into the double digits.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not saying people <i>should</i> design their stuff to handle millions of users on underpowered hardware, but I am suggesting they not lose their sense of perspective while building their whatever.<p>Because if you do, you may end up thinking you did well when your DB maxes out at 500 inserts&#x2F;second - Another DB running on a Nintendo DS might just outperform it.')
