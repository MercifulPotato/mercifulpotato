The more optimistic hope is that the great filter is behind us - things like abiogenesis or multicellular life being extremely unlikely to happen. &quot;Great filter&quot; is just the name for &quot;a barrier that stops life from becoming a spacefaring civilization&quot;.<p>This explanation is also the reason why finding basic life (say, bacteria) in the Solar System would be a cause for worry - if life evolved independently <i>twice</i> in the same star system, it would imply abiogenesis isn&#x27;t that unlikely - thus strongly suggesting the great filter is still ahead of us.')
