I have thought about real-life, but interest in the topics I care about is ... not so wide-spread.<p>Online? I have heard about such things but have no idea what it would look like. I guess there would be a lot of technology involved, and I do not get along well with tech. :)<p>&gt; I have utterly, most thoroughly enjoyed everything you have produced. Imperative, functional, low-level, high-level it is all excellent.<p>Thank you! This is good to hear!<p>&gt; would you consider taking requests for books?<p>I am afraid not. You may make suggestions, though, and if they coincide with my plans, they might tip the scales.')
