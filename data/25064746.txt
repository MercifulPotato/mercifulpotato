For example, only with them you can see the true color (pun intended) of the STMPT color bars on TVs - the iconic staircase waveform [0] and its corresponding curve on the vectorscope [1]. They are how the color bars were intended to be viewed.<p>During my recent hunt for test equipment, I was still able to find a lot of waveform monitors and vectorscopes in usable conditions. Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t find any reason to buy one - it will be a complete waste of money and room space since these instruments have became totally useless with zero utility. You don&#x27;t even have a signal to probe anymore, unlike a vintage computer or an oscilloscope which can still be used and even serve a practical need... To think about it, they&#x27;ll continue to be stored in an abandoned warehouse collecting dust and rust indefinitely until someone sends them to a metal scrapyard.<p>It&#x27;s really sad.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.stack.imgur.com&#x2F;cIQVf.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.stack.imgur.com&#x2F;cIQVf.png</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.danalee.ca&#x2F;ttt&#x2F;images&#x2F;7&#x2F;vectorscope_bars_big.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.danalee.ca&#x2F;ttt&#x2F;images&#x2F;7&#x2F;vectorscope_bars_big.jpg</a>')
