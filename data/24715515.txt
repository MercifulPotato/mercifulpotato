My wife was in the exact same situation, like almost everyone in her home country she had just one given name. When we moved here to the states she found it highly annoying and even limited some opportunities.<p>Recently she decided to legally change her name to something that fits in better here. Although it has been an emotional decision for her, she felt she had to as it&#x27;s very hard to live in the US without a first and last name.<p>Edit: &quot;Annoying&quot; doesn&#x27;t even begin to cover her experience. Everything from getting a bank account, to buying a car, to getting a marriage license was a whole process of explaining until we were blue in the face, escalating to a manager, being told basically to get lost, etc. etc.. It left her in tears more than once.')
