NC State + Northeastern, for instance, on a resume doesn&#x27;t engender respect even if they&#x27;re both fine institutions on their own. NC State + MIT for instance does, but according to the several MIT profs I&#x27;ve talked to my resume straight up does not and will not cut it, so I&#x27;m sort of unimpressive for life as it seems.')
