In meatspace, your attacker must be physically present and is generally obvious and thus vulnerable. This difference has dramatic implications on the ability of the enforcement model to reduce incidence of attacks.<p>The jurisdiction part is the key here, IMHO.<p>Sure, the likelyhood of reliably tracing a single attack to a crew is very low, but a prolific crew has dozens or even hundreds of attacks going on in parallel, so tracing just one of them <i>should</i> be enough to take them down.<p>However, most crews live in &quot;bullet proof&quot; jurisdictions, where we cannot reach them.<p>If this practice of ransomware attacks continue, we really need a better solution for that. This could go as far as cutting off the &quot;bullet proof&quot; countries from the Internet, if it weren&#x27;t for China and Russia, that simply from an economic and political perspective, we cannot disconnect.<p>I guess diplomatic solutions are needed, as well as investing more in IT security, secure OSS etc.')
