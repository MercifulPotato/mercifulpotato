The basic idea of stream seems like a decent one as such. Some may not like it, but that&#x27;s okay. In my opinion, the problematic part is that the EOL date of CentOS 8, released last year, suddenly shifted from 2029 to 2021.<p>For years CentOS promised long-term stability and &quot;boringness&quot;, which was its main selling point. A very long support cycle was its main selling point. It&#x27;s why people installed CentOS, and now, suddenly, that&#x27;s gone.<p>I don&#x27;t think it matters that it&#x27;s free in this case; they made a commitment&#x2F;promise and suddenly went back on that. I wonder what all the sponsors[1] think of this; I&#x27;d be pretty darn peeved if I would sponsor something like CentOS, and it suddenly shifted direction like this.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.centos.org&#x2F;sponsors&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.centos.org&#x2F;sponsors&#x2F;</a>')
