A delighter is also that it pulls in my Calendar events. This might replace Apple Notes for me.<p>My favorite productivity tool is unfortunately not reciprocated by my work colleagues, and that&#x27;s using a reliable pair of headphones and a mic during Zoom calls. I can&#x27;t believe how many people are just fine with using their Macbook speaker and microphone, which is about on par with a 1980s speakerphone.')
