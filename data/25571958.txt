Item(by='valarauko', descendants=None, kids=[25573338], score=None, time=1609261754, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25566531, text='&gt;I think that a good person can do 5x more than an ok person, maybe even more<p>This is really surprising to me, and I&#x27;m not sure how this can be the case. I would imagine that this would be true of a high level position at the top of their game, able to define their own schedules &amp; goals. For a typical worker with clearly defined short &amp; long term objectives defined by the organization, how does one become 5X more productive? Clearly my heuristics about the tech industry are way out of step with reality.<p>However, I could see something like this happening in my own field: academia. As a bioinformatics postdoc, the bread &amp; butter work most of my colleagues do is routine, so they can hit their goals fairly predictably. My project, in comparison, is mostly ad-hoc, struggling to parse a novel dataset right on the edge of what is technically possible. My productivity is in the toilet, and I can imagine a different researcher in my position being 5-10x more productive. This is not how I imagined the tech industry working, though.')
