Free speech underpins our (speaking for the US) nation. Even violent speech helped create our nation in the first place.<p>Completely obliterating these platforms is throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Yes - and this is my caveat - we should be keeping a tight rein on hate speech, on inciting violence, and on death threats. But, and this is key to me, these kinds of things are the minority of discussion occurring, and should be treated as the outliers they are.<p>For better or worse, these platforms <i>are</i> the public squares of the internet; if people can&#x27;t speak freely there, they can&#x27;t speak freely on the internet. Private company or not, they have a monopoly on what speech appears on the internet, and an individual&#x27;s right to free speech should be regulated accordingly.')
