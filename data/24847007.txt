I knew he died in the 1950s, but I wasn&#x27;t sure when.... but the audience was mostly Black, so that pushed it forward for me into the 1960s... without those clues, I would have been more wildly guessing.<p>I tried really hard to ignore the monochrome&#x2F;color aspect... it would be really nice to know how far off I was on each after the fact.')
