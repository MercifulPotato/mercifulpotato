Logistically, it also decouples fuel generation from electricity generation -- if you tried to burn the needles directly you have to figure out how to continually feed them to a burner and deal with the ash. By gasifying, you can create a reserve of fuel.<p>Gasification has other benefits. It can be rigged to produce biochar, which is believed to be a beneficial soil amendment. The char could also be sequestered to effectively remove carbon from the atmosphere.')
