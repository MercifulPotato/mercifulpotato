A CLI interface uses the basic terminal functionality of writing and perhaps reading lines, or even simply accepting flags and running non-interactively. A TUI uses the terminal&#x27;s advanced features, using the terminal as the basis for a kind of GUI, generally occupying the full area of the terminal.<p><i>Vim</i>, <i>Midnight Commander</i>, and <i>htop</i> have TUIs. They rely heavily on the terminal&#x27;s &#x27;control character&#x27; features to accomplish this. <i>apt-get</i> has a CLI, as its interactive IO is handled with printing lines and having the user submit lines (even if it&#x27;s just the letter <i>y</i>).<p>Somewhere in the middle are interfaces like <i>bash</i> and <i>zsh</i> which make light use of the terminal&#x27;s advanced features for things like auto-complete, but which don&#x27;t take over the whole terminal area.<p>I&#x27;d count non-interactive applications like <i>gcc</i> and <i>sort</i> as command-line applications, although strictly speaking you could just as well use a graphical interface to configure their flags and run commands.<p>See also <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Text-based_user_interface" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Text-based_user_interface</a>')
