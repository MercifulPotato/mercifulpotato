Each rule determine the evolution of the hypergraph which is space itself, much like a cellular automata. It seems that some rules have the property that as &quot;times goes by&quot; the hypergraph converges to a manifold with dimension d. One can estimate the dimension of such hypergraph using, for example, the growth of the volume of balls[0].<p>It also seems that this concept is very generic, and many properties of the model do not depend on the dimensionality neither on the manifold or the rule itself.<p>Because this concept is so generic, one hopes that there is a rule that the hypergraph converges to d=3 as in our world. This would also raise questions on why in the very early universe there was a &quot;inflationary&quot; phase.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolframphysics.org&#x2F;technical-introduction&#x2F;limiting-behavior-and-emergent-geometry&#x2F;the-notion-of-dimension&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolframphysics.org&#x2F;technical-introduction&#x2F;limiti...</a>')
