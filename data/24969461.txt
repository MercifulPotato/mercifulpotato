It absolutely has it&#x27;s place.<p>It&#x27;s just that all the technology that big companies use become trendy and then end up used at small companies too. Small companies don&#x27;t realise that the tools aren&#x27;t solving the problems they have, and they don&#x27;t understand the vendor lock ins and dependencies that they&#x27;ve introduced into their platform for no real gain.<p>This happens in all kinds of ways, not just devops. Your example of developers using the microservice pattern is exactly that. When I see a developer recommend microservices my mind flashes forward to all of the extra complexity that entails and how we&#x27;ve just turned a small monolith on one server into 6 pieces of software across distributed servers. Great for big companies, too much complexity for small companies.')
