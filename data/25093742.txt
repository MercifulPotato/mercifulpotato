I&#x27;m part time vegan (probably 90% of my meals), but I still rarely have meat, dairy, everything. I dislike the idea that if you aren&#x27;t always vegan&#x2F;vegetarian you&#x27;ve &quot;failed&quot;. Like it&#x27;s some religion that if you ever strayed you have some mark against you. It&#x27;s so much easier to go 90% than 100, and I bet many more people would be willing to go 90% than 100%. We&#x27;ll make major strids to improving the environment, improving our populations health, and improving the well being of animals if a majority of people have a goal of 90% rather than full removal.')
