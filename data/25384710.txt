A poorly behaved, entitled kid who&#x27;ll use that Lambo to rub it in the faces of his peers, who accomplishes little doesn&#x27;t deserve it.<p>Of course not everyone &#x27;get good grades&#x27;, it&#x27;s entirely possible a kid is deserving in some way, by grades are at least some crude measure of applying oneself.<p>Frankly, however much money I had I wouldn&#x27;t even give my kid a Lambo, it&#x27;s way too much attention and ostentatious luxury, children are not good at handling that. It&#x27;s excessive and materialist.<p>&#x27;Access to capital&#x27; is an entirely different story as investing for the prospect of value creation is difficult than conspicuous consumption of luxury items.')
