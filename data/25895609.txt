(called &#x27;duovox&#x27; - not released to public).  It created recordings and other metadata&#x2F;attachments and simply zipped them up with a password and custom file extension and sent via email.<p>The app was naturally registered with the custom file extension, so that clicking the email attachment in the Mail app would simply open the app and the message it contained.<p>Very simple. Very effective. And using an existing and  secure (one would hope!) transport: email.')
