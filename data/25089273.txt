And yet, it was precisely at that time where civic society flourished, and it’s decline coincided precisely with the introduction of Great Society programs and Civil Rights.<p>Of course, reduction of poverty and civil rights were huge wins and unquestionable positives, but I believe it’s actually us making the society more prosperous and more just, that was what made us more individualistic and less civically engaged — <i>because we don’t need each other as much anymore</i>.')
