I ended up switching to MSP430 after the first run through.<p>Features of the 6502 ISA like register width being half of pointer width with no way to link a pair of registers together to a full address, relying on you to have to bounce back and forth through memory to construct a full pointer really obfuscated a lot of the concepts I wanted to teach.  Yes, &quot;zero page is the real registers&quot;, bla bla, but those extra hoops don&#x27;t do any favors to someone who&#x27;s just learning computer architecture.<p>68k looks clean, but I&#x27;ve never had to use it in my career so I shy away from it for probably that reason only.')
