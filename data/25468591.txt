I don&#x27;t know of any other company that can do that (besides Intel, but you know...).<p>Additionally, there is a huge hole open right now for ARM on everything else that is not an Apple product. Apple normalized ARM on consumer&#x27;s desktops&#x2F;laptops: they brought down the &quot;subjective&quot; barrier against ARM, which is much harder to break sometimes than the technological one.<p>But ARM CPUs for everything else that is not an Apple product is up for grabs. The M1 is extremely competitive but it will never leave Apple&#x27;s realm (unless Apple wants to start competing on the CPU business, but I see that going very strongly against Apple&#x27;s consumer focus).<p>It is incredible, looking at it in retrospective, but Apple opened up  (or normalized, if you will) a whole new market for ARM products.')
