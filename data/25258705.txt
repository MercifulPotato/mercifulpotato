I tried a similar approach based on the original attempt at this challenge (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spinellis.gr&#x2F;blog&#x2F;20090805&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spinellis.gr&#x2F;blog&#x2F;20090805&#x2F;</a>), but gave up after running it for a few hours.<p>Very cool that you were able to achieve this. I&#x27;d thought it was impossible while using the original method given how many more tweets there are now then in 2009.')
