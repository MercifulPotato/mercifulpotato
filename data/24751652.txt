I’ve been in remote parts of Lapland and summer cottages and streamed f1 over 4g. Your mileage may vary but pretty much everywhere I get minimum 3G. Cellular is ubiquitous so unless you’re living in a bunker coverage will be excellent. I believe 100mbit is even a human right here?<p>If you live in a city there’s probably fibre laid down. Anywhere outside unless your neighbourhood pay for the fibre to each home you’re going to have to get a cellular modem :)')
