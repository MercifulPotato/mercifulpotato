This project mentions it uses rollup so maybe that’s where it’s coming from.<p>Using npx to run executables also does this IIRC.<p>And I never want it, especially if I have to opt-out. I want there to be friction to adding dependencies, it should be a carefully considered process.<p>Otherwise, would be curious to see how this stacks up against a moderately sized application build using webpack or vanilla rollup too. To see that, we will just need adoption over time, will keep an eye on the project!<p>Update:\nIt’s not rollup that auto-installs packages, I was confusing it with parcel.')
