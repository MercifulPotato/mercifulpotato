I do listen to some of his interviews, because he gets guests that rarely give long interviews like Chris Lattner, Donald Knuth and the like. He doesn&#x27;t seem to do any deep prep for any of any of the guests and ends up providing his opinion on things like &quot;the Russian soul&quot; or whether someone is &quot;in Love&quot; with a programming language. It often derails the interesting conversations that he could have had with his illustrious guests. I would listen to more of his podcasts if he would follow his guests lead more and not force them into the (same) mold that he has for every show.')
