This is not a usual occurrence in India, which is why I ask -- I&#x27;m extremely happy to hear that things like this even happen as outliers, btw.<p>The fact that it was a graduate-level course in algebraic topology seems to imply that the university in question is not a run-of-the-mill university, which makes me all the more happy.')
