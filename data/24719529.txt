With unions, you ain&#x27;t gonna get that.   As much as I like unions for somethings, I&#x27;m not a fan.  I&#x27;m in Detroit area.   I have heard horror stories of many people who work in the car industry and do crazy things and can&#x27;t easily get fired because of unions.   Once I was downtown a few years ago, and they were shooting a movie and they needed to reshoot a scene, but a semi truck was parked on the street, they had to hold off the scene till the next day because they couldn&#x27;t just move the truck.  There was a specific job role that could drive the truck according to the union rules and the drivers were done working for the day.<p>Imagine union pegging a developer to only working on backend code, or middleware or frontend or only on a specific language.')
