And if they are, I haven&#x27;t found any.<p>Can you give us an example (like a YouTube link) of a modern guitarist (from the past 15 or so years) that approaches Eddie Van Halen&#x27;s level of talent or innovation?  An uplifting thought is that, like Cornell, although we have lost him, we still have his music.<p>Another &quot;hacker&#x27;s guitarist&quot; is Tom Sholz of Boston.  If the younger generation has never heard of him, his story is amazing too (an MIT trained engineer; rock star; built his own gear; wrote, played, recorded and produced his own work):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tom_Scholz" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tom_Scholz</a><p>While his style is a little different than EVH, he has a similar innovative spirit.')
