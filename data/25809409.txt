I was replying to a comment that implied that you were asking permission of the device manufacturer&#x2F;OS maker, which is typically the relevant gatekeeper when talking about sideloading apps.<p>But here, it&#x27;s not about that. It&#x27;s about having paid for an iOS app and thinking that you now have the right to run it on a completely different type of device, and also presumably on many more devices (given how Apple allows installs for any device hooked to a given Apple ID).<p>Honestly, I&#x27;m shocked that so many people on HN are downvoting my comment that emphasizes the rights of software developers to not have their proprietary software used on device types that they were never meant to run on.')
