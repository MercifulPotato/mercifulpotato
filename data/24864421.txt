And then the indicted &#x2F;convicted have to make deals for something that is terribly unfair. Just imagine negotiating with a person like Kamala.<p>When I see light weight no benefit deals like this, I think that it looks like both prosecutor and defendant got away with murder with little effort.<p>Further, let&#x27;s stop the rhetoric that severe punishments will stop bad crimes. Not true. Even the lightest of punishments can stop crimes simply with shame. If more people get caught and are able to reconcile for their crimes, that would be sufficient to prevent 95 percent of future crimes.')
