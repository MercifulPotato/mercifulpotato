The 1:1 is for the employee while skip levels are all about the senior manager. We already have enough opportunities for them to set the agenda and drive the conversation. A real 1:1 is a frank conversation about early-stage (potentially bad) things and based on mutual trust and vulnerability; this is impossible with the power dynamic in a skip level.<p>&gt;&gt; when it comes to individual contributors, who are a two level skip for me, ... I do a skip level group meeting with three to six people.<p>and this isn&#x27;t even a 1:1. I can&#x27;t imagine you get any sort of honest or actionable feedback in this sort of forum.
