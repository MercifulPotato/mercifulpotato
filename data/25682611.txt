Typically the tax code reduces your income by money for which you don&#x27;t actually have constructive use.<p>There are certainly other things like &#x27;in-kind&#x27; donations which may reduce tax obligations without necessarily providing a commensurate value, but putting money into bona fide charitable works are not among them.')
