Is there anything even bigoted in the original post? Would it be racist if an Indian person asked &quot;Why do Americans love guns so much?&quot; to the point of requiring a response chastising the questioner?<p>Different cultures manifest themselves in different behaviors among the individuals of the given culture. If it didn&#x27;t, the concept of culture wouldn&#x27;t exist. So what exactly is bigoted if one asks why culture X seems to be prone to telling a certain type of story? Is it also racist to say a lot of magical realism comes out of Colombian culture, and wonder why that is the case?')
