With a finger you can follow the code as it runs and know exactly what is going on and when exactly.<p>I would suggest functions like atexit and pthread_cleanup_push as well established counterexamples. Granted this is not a perfect comparison because these are implementable without extending the c language; however, I think they have the same general idea of &quot;defering&quot; cleanup. I think the proposed defer functionality is actually more readable because the defer command will be written much closer to where it will be exited. Compare this to atexit() which may be put anywhere.')
