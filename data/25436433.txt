Themis [1] has been doing this “hard to misuse” thing for quite a few years. It has major focus on interoperability: supports a dozen of languages, with Rust among them, across all major desktop, mobile, and web platforms.<p>It tries really hard to hide all the crypto mumbo-jumbo from the users so that they don’t have to be experts in algorithm choice and protocol design in order to safely use a library instead of shooting themselves in a foot.<p>Themis is also a wrapper over OpenSSL&#x2F;BoringSSL, relying on proven crypto implementations instead of trading a simpler build system for god knows how many sleeper primitive implementation bugs. However, binary packages exist for major distros, so if you don&#x27;t want to build from source you can avoid that easily.<p>Also, docs for humans do exist [2], packages exist, etc.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cossacklabs&#x2F;themis&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cossacklabs&#x2F;themis&#x2F;</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.cossacklabs.com&#x2F;themis&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.cossacklabs.com&#x2F;themis&#x2F;</a>')
