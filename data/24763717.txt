Corporations suppress true creativity and only allow it to exist within a very narrow spectrum. Also, the people they hire are not creative. You cannot be creative without being a contrarian and corporations don&#x27;t hire contrarians.<p>Free thinkers are contrarians for most of their lives because they are not swayed by the undulating rhetoric of the times. When society is sane, free thinkers appear sane, then society is insane, free thinkers appear insane (when in a group of insane people, those who are sane will be labeled as insane).<p>Free thinkers are always sane with reference to the reality of the world around them but they can become unhinged from social and cultural norms when these norms start to diverge from observable reality.')
