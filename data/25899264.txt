In 1905, a very wet winter, a very heavy snow melt in the Rockies vastly increased the flow of water down the Colorado. This is pre-dam, mind you. The result of this heavy flow is that levees along the river as it flows to the Gulf of California were quickly eroded and finally breeched. Water flowed out this breech for 18 months before the they could be repaired and the flow stopped. Think about that for a second. The full flow of the Colorado running through the levee for 18 months. The result, of course, was the Salton Sea.')
