And at least that I know of there is nothing illegal about that and no recourse for you.  It is crappy (maybe immoral to some) but from what I understand&#x2F;know not illegal.<p>Assuming this is a real stock grant with equity that can be made liquid, and not a startup, then you would want to find a way to manage around this date issue.  Also make sure they have no clause for clawback if you leave within X period of your first year anniversary (saw that once).  If we are talking about a startup that isn&#x27;t public and has no immediate liquidity route for the  equity just go.')
