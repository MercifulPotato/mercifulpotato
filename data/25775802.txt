There is an idea that M1 has RAM that is vastly higher bandwidth than intel&#x2F;amd machines.  In reality it is the same laptop ddr ram that other machines have, though at a very high clock rate. Not higher than the best intel laptops though. So the bandwidth is not any more amazing than a top end Intel laptop, and latency is no different.<p>2. But in this case I believe they are talking about the CPU and GPU both being able to freely access the same ram, as compared to a setup where you have a discrete GPU with it&#x27;s own ram, where data must first be copied to the GPU ram for the GPU to do something with it.  In some workloads this can be an inferior approach, in others it can be superior, as the GPU&#x27;s ram is faster. The M1 model again isn&#x27;t unique, as its similar to how game consoles work, I believe.')
