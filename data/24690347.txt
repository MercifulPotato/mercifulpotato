Even if they can show it was a false flag, that is time and money others wouldn&#x27;t have to spend.  Potentially time and money of someone who was in a life altering crash.<p>Second, it would not be surprised that the court ends up being biased towards the manufacture and would give undue weight to them because they have the fancy algorithms and all the well payed lawyers.')
