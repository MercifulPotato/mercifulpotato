Don’t have a link.<p>Another good source of info is the article over at anandtech. Apple is doing a lot of stuff they Intel can’t because of x86. And also a bunch of stuff that neither Intel nor AMD want to do.<p>Also don’t forget that Apple is on TSMC 5nm while Intel is for the most part on Intel 14nm which is more or less equivalent to TSMC 10nm.')
