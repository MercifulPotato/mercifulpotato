And now with my office closed, I&#x27;m somehow supposed to find a dedicated space in my tiny-ass apartment where I can:<p>a) Setup the same configuration of laptop, multiple monitors, a desk phone, and an Ethernet jack into my router.<p>b) Sufficiently insulate the background noise on the hours of Zoom meetings I&#x27;m expected to join every day from my girlfriend working in the dining room, and the cacophony of screaming children in the apartment above me.<p>This solution reeks of tone-deaf executives who would think, &quot;What? You mean <i>all</i> of our employees don&#x27;t have freestanding houses with a spare bedroom or basement that they can easily convert to a home-office?&quot;')
