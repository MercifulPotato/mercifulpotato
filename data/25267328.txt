Yes, it is bureacratic, and it can be a pain for regular, non-money-laundering customers. With crypto, you can instantly create an account offline and trade around the globe.<p>As far as programmable banking, I meant it in the sense that people can create &quot;bank apps&quot;, aka contracts. It goes way beyond simple routing of funds, since it&#x27;s turing complete.<p>Financial censorship is a feature, since the finance industry does exclude people and countries. For example, in the US you need to have a $1M net worth or something to be an &quot;accredited investor&quot; which grants you certain privileges. Ethereum doesn&#x27;t make such distinctions - you can interact with and create any financial product&#x2F;contract (depending on its rules). Brokerages also regularly halt trading, and make you answer a bunch of questions before trading certain financial products. There are 2 sides to the financial censorship coin so I&#x27;m not going to pretend this is always a great feature.<p>I&#x27;m focusing on finance because so far it is the main use case for ethereum. There are a lot of decentralized financial products and derivates now, that even trade in a &quot;USD&quot;-backed crypto (USDC, DAI). Honestly, it all works pretty well, but its not without its downsides and pitfalls.<p>One of my favorite things about the whole thing is that it gets rid of ACCOUNT CREATION. It&#x27;s so nice to visit a website&#x2F;app and just approve it with your wallet. It&#x27;s the ultimate SSO - there is no email verification crap, its all so instant and frictionless to play with financial products that would otherwise be a bureacratic maze. It&#x27;s even easier than logging into hacker news.')
