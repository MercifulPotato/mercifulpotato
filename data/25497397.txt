I&#x27;ve been a part of three startups.  One took nothing more than seed money and has been chugging along for over 15 years.  It&#x27;s a lifestyle business for the owner, so it also hasn&#x27;t grown at all in over 10 years.  The other two startups were both acquired.  I was even a VP at one with over 1% equity in the company.  Net value of my options was $0 after investors, credit holders, and founders got paid.<p>Yes, some folks are going to make millions from IPOs, but the opportunity cost is far too high (IMHO).  As a VP at the startup, my total compensation with 15 years of experience wasn&#x27;t a whole lot more (and less, in many cases) than what a new college grad makes nowadays.<p>Now that I&#x27;ve got a family, college to pay for at some point in the near future, and a retirement to fund, I&#x27;ll gladly take the sure thing vs. the gamble.  I&#x27;ve bid goodbye to startups and have quadrupled my income in doing so.')
