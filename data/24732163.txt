I&#x27;m not trying to be xenophobic or racist.  I&#x27;m being literal, I keep running into people who have been let into the country and don&#x27;t have any knowledge or skills to offer anyone and they are working in technology.  The bar for actually getting into the country used to be much higher and I&#x27;m struggling to find out when this happened.')
