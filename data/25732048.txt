Nope. Not at all. At least not in the what conservatism means.<p>&gt; violence-endorsing non-American<p>When did I endorse violence? Are you out of your mind? I literally said that I would want to see the insurrectionists thrown behind bars for what they did. Point to the part where you found me endorsing violence or take back your words.<p>My take on the insurrection and what should be done to those who desecrated the US Capitol: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25729582" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25729582</a><p>&gt; I should worry about BLM and the Democrats “purging” people with my beliefs is surreal<p>I never once mentioned BLM or Democrats purging conservatives. I accused the leftist lobby in Big Tech doing the purge because of how tied they are to their ideology. Whether BLM&#x2F;Democrats had a role in it I don&#x27;t know. So I won&#x27;t even drag them into this. You want to extrapolate to include BLM and Democrats that is your headache not mine.<p>&gt; If Bush is a liberal to you guys then I guess I’m as liberal as can be.<p>Bush was an opportunist. An establishment war hawk. A Conservative only by name but a Statist in every sense of the word. Bush was anything but for limited Government. These are the people you resonate with? People who bombed other countries ruthlessly based on a hunch that there are &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot; (ex: Iraq and Afghanistan)? And you have the gumption to say I endorse violence? Look into a mirror and you&#x27;ll see the person who endorses violence stare back at you.<p>And since you mentioned &quot;Cato Institute&quot; in one of the posts above, let me link an article that succinctly explains why Bush is not a conservative: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cato.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;bush-was-not-conservative" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cato.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;bush-was-not-conservative</a>')
