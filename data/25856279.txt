Hard to see how west can match without adopting similar (anti)values. Didn&#x27;t take long, this only validates Chinese filtering model and plays in China&#x27;s favour. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s going to be much rationalization and wank over differences between private and government control. But IMO it&#x27;s perfunctory and doesn&#x27;t change the underlying effect of political censorship, in the end that&#x27;s the only validation China needs.')
