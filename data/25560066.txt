It&#x27;s a big white sheet of virtual paper, and you can write your paragraphs without any clicking. Pressing enter opens a new paragraph, you can make it a heading by starting with (part of) &quot;&#x2F;heading&quot; and pressing enter once more. It&#x27;s easy to add more complicated blocks, but you don&#x27;t have to.')
