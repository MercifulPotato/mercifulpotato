I&#x27;m the author of a tool that utilises an opus encoder and decoder in the browser to emulate something like modern live streaming. I followed similar ideas to yours but ultimately found that the icecast route was a little bit limited. If you&#x27;re interested, the code is here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gaxge" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gaxge</a> and is in the process of being refactored&#x2F; updated. You can play around with the original prototype here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;low.show&#x2F;noisecrypt&#x2F;app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;low.show&#x2F;noisecrypt&#x2F;app</a>. I use the streaming tools mainly for doing stuff with jamming in combination with randomness but they can be repurposed for normal linear real-time streaming.<p>I&#x27;m also based in Germany, and you&#x27;re welcome to reach out if you want to talk about this kind of stuff further.')
