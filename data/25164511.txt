Similarly, this reads like you&#x27;re suggesting Christians are uniquely bad at shunning&#x2F;expelling their &quot;bad apples&quot; or perhaps that they are unique in that they are actively voting them into some office, and perhaps even suggesting that this discrepancy justifies their mistreatment:<p>&gt; But like any other community with rotten apples, you need to work on shunning and expelling these people... not voting for them.<p>I&#x27;m sure you didn&#x27;t mean any of those things, but it might be good to clarify.')
