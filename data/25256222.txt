Your characterization omits the most salient point: That it had to be done <i>fast</i>. I don&#x27;t see how the tradeoffs in emergency distribution of funds are in any way indicative of whether you can trust welfare states to be administered properly or not. The comment was precisely <i>about</i> &quot;lack of administrative rigor&quot; being warranted in favor of preventing greater harm.<p>&gt; Does Sweden send welfare checks to Americans who aren&#x27;t Swedish citizens? If not, perhaps that partly explains why the Swedes are more comfortable with an expansive welfare state than Americans.<p>I don&#x27;t understand how this point relates to the general value of welfare systems that you are discussing. Are you saying an American welfare system has to be inherently less reliable? Or that there are more Americans than Swedes so statistically Sweden will receive more accidental checks from America than the reverse? Could you elaborate?')
