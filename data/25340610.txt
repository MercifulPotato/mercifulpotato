The Mission was a bloodbath for Native Americans one or two centuries ago, yes, but how does that support your initial claim that it currently isn&#x27;t a nice town? Is that supporting claim really affecting the residents of the mission so greatly right now?<p>I think San Francisco is a nice town. I hated it before the pandemic because I only stuck to the Mission and SoMA. I started taking walks in Russian Hill, North Beach&#x2F;Telegraph Hill, the Marina, Ocean Beach, etc. Those are awesome neighborhoods with great people and many things to do. Just like any city in the USA, you get out of it what you put into it.')
