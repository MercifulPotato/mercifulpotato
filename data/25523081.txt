I was clearly referring to Facebook primarily as an implementation, not as a brand.<p>&gt; Client side a-b testing is impossible to be decent<p>OK, so Netflix, Facebook, Instagram, AirBnB - all web app <i>implementations</i> - cannot decently A&#x2F;B test, but you can. Gotcha.<p>&gt; Your react app is 30% slower that anything decent<p>How would you know, anyway? The web apps I&#x27;ve worked on (not app, in singular) are faster than just about anything &quot;decent&quot;, faster than many SSR industry peers or competitors, and objectively so under many industry-standard performance tests.<p>You further resort to a personal attack by questioning my implementation or engineering chops without any evidence of them - just my evidence-based opinion that SPAs are not inherently slow <i>at all</i> (they really aren&#x27;t).<p>I&#x27;ve got nothing against SSR, it&#x27;s got its use cases and I&#x27;ve personally used it too, but you on the other hand seem to be an SSR jihadist - surely <i>that</i> could be a telltale sign of a really poor engineer?')
