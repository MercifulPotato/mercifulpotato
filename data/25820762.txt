But if they had spun up twice as fast, we wouldn&#x27;t be doing 70,000 doses a day, we&#x27;d be out of vaccine.<p>The most recent shipments have been ~120,000 vaccines&#x2F;week for 2 weeks and then none for a third week. So if the tempo of Federal allotments is 120,000 a week, the 35,000 a day is not a bottleneck. They should of course be building capacity anyway, with the idea that deliveries will increase (and making a plan for what to do if&#x2F;when the adenovirus vaccines are approved in the US; fortunately it looks like that can be &quot;send it everywhere&quot;).<p>Anyway, wasting vaccines is obviously stupid, I&#x27;m not trying to argue about that.')
