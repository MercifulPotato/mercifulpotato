But it <i>exacerbates</i> Jeremy Howard&#x27;s complaint - which is not so much about CoCs per se as about the group of people who enforced them and the way in which they did so. I don&#x27;t think getting rid of CoCs will really solve that problem.<p>One option is to have a closed or invitation-only group - but that&#x27;s at odds with the goals of many communities. (And it doesn&#x27;t reliably solve the problem, it just makes it less likely you&#x27;d run into it.)')
