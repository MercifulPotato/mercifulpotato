Your link don&#x27;t say anything about how much fertilizer usage is reduced. Nor does it mention how much formerly crop fields are now being used for ranch land.<p>The concept of self-sustaining farming and ranching is as old as dirt itself, with various implementations including crop rotation or fallow fields, but it typically means that the are of land dedicated to a staple crop (such as oats or wheat for the exemplar GM) drops dramatically, as would the profits.<p>Nothing in the linked literature disagrees with this notion or comments on the different costs (other than the grants for a farm that&#x27;s trying it).')
