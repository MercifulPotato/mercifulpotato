I suspect candy vendors have specifically conditioned the candy market in much the same way as the film industry has conditioned audiences into go to see mass-market films-- endless re-hashes of the same stuff, endless sequels, formulaic plots, god forbid an edgy wildly different film gets out every once in a while.<p>Things are different in most European and Asian countries where you can easily find a mind-blowing variety of candies that are truly distinct from each other.<p>That reminds me, there&#x27;s a fun book of essays, Candy Freak (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Candyfreak-Journey-through-Chocolate-Underbelly&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0156032937" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Candyfreak-Journey-through-Chocolate-...</a>) which is all about the vanishing fringe candy makers in the USA.')
