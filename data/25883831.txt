That&#x27;s the unfortunate reality of today&#x27;s America. It&#x27;s also the reason that these techniques will be employed in a ubiquitous fashion in tomorrow&#x27;s America.<p>If we wanted to stop this, the time to complain was years ago when the practice was started in the drug war. Or even recently, when the practice was employed during the BLM riots. Any attempt to stop it now brings howls of racism.
