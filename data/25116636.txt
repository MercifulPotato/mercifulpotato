Rushing is stupid, all RTS seemly suffer from allowing it even when devs attempt to curb that down, I remember in AOE for example people training on how to build towers on the enemy base in 2 minutes or how to win with villager rush. (also knew a guy that relentlessly tested ways to rise to the second age faster)<p>I have to politely refute this. &quot;Rushing&quot; is the word inexperienced players use for &quot;playing in a more optimal way that prepares you to attack sooner.&quot; If you call it &quot;rushing,&quot; what you&#x27;re really saying is that you need other players to deliberately play worse to give you extra time to prepare. All of these strategies have counterplay and usually lead into long games. Using a vil rush or tower rush is not a way to end the game, it&#x27;s a way to begin it.<p>&gt; 3. Multiplayer is a matter of how fast you click and how good you are with pattern matching and some other training-related things, intelligence for example isn&#x27;t that important, rote learning, time to practice, etc... that is.<p>Again, you could only say this if you had not made it to a competitive level. Intelligence <i>is</i> pattern-matching. And of course playing anything at a competitive level involves &quot;training-related things,&quot; that&#x27;s a kind of meaningless statement if I&#x27;m being honest. And I can&#x27;t speak for StarCraft, but in AoE2 APM is not essential. To prove the point, the top-rated player has beaten other top 200 players without using his keyboard. It&#x27;s about decision-making. Even at my level, I can beat other players rated a couple hundred points beneath me without using keyboard shortcuts just because my decision-making is better.')
