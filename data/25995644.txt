I have a tab hoarding tendency; it took me a decade to notice the problem, and years of fighting it, but I&#x27;ve recently managed to make by brain accept that the burden of lingering tabs is greater than any value I can expect to get from them - so every couple days, I have a &quot;screw this, let&#x27;s clean the slate&quot; moment, where I just close the browser window and reopen it fresh.<p>I&#x27;ve also stopped saving links to stuff I found on-line, because I never revisit them anyway.
