Average house price is AUD$1M. Standard deposit is 20%.<p>Government has just allowed first home buyers to get a mortgage on a 5% deposit. While that sounds great, it&#x27;s obviously just encouraging more debt to flood the market and drive up prices.<p>And of course the government doesn&#x27;t give a shit about housing affordability. The standard practice here is to get at least two mortgages: one for the house you want to live in, and one for an investment property that you&#x27;ll eventually sell to pay off your other mortgage.<p>Sounds stupid right? Well, not when the government gives massive tax benefit handouts to property investors:<p>1. 50% capital gains tax discount.<p>2. Negative gearing: basically the losses on your investment property can be claimed as a tax offset against your other income.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Capital_gains_tax_in_Australia" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Capital_gains_tax_in_Australia</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Negative_gearing_in_Australia" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Negative_gearing_in_Australia</a>')
