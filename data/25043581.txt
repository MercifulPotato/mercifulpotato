Families are often opposed to war because they know some of their kids won&#x27;t make it back; that&#x27;s a powerful deterrent and is the reason why after a while showing soldiers coffins was forbidden to US TV networks during the last Gulf War: they recalled the protests during Vietnam after it became clear that soldiers weren&#x27;t taking a walk in the park down there.<p>Now if we make it certain for one side to never lose any soldier because every action is being performed from safe distance by a drone pilot, war suddenly becomes a videogame in which one side cannot lose anymore, but more importantly that same side won&#x27;t have any negative feelings associated to the war because it doesn&#x27;t bring any suffering.\nThis is the recipe for creating a state of eternal war, and I&#x27;m strongly opposed to that. I want all sides - including mine - to experience deaths and mutilation, grieving families, babies who will never know their parents, etc. If we take those away, we take away all reasons to not want wars.')
