Last time I was here in 2016 it was actually a lot worse than it is now (then, <i>any</i> Cloudflare site would trigger it, so I’d be hitting dozens of challenges per day), but I still get the occasional hCaptcha here (e.g. the Audacity wiki), and they’re awful. I normally take two or three attempts (quite apart from the regular times when you finish the challenge and press submit, and it just does nothing), guessing things like whether they want to count this particular dark smudge as a motorcycle or not, or whether this fragment of a motorcycle should count or not.<p>I wish people would just face up to the reality that challenge-based CAPTHCA techniques have failed, and stop using them.')
