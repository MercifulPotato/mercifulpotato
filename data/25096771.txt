The residents of those jurisdictions that end up without much tax income and the externalities of the lax regulations so they would suffer and pressure their government to increase the tax and make the regulations stricter. Eventually, it should reach an equilibrium where those things are &quot;fair&quot; as determined by all the participants in the market. Jurisdictions would also have the ability to tax or ban imports from places they don&#x27;t like. Maybe this is too much of a libertarian view? It seems to be the default state of the world though. What are the alternatives besides something oppressive like using military power to prevent other countries from taxing their citizens too little?<p>Did Washington residents really prefer not to have Boeing at all rather than the tax-incentivized Boing they got? Wasn&#x27;t it up to them in how they voted? Sometimes they do reject it, like how New York rejected Amazon.')
