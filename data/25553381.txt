Think of the most unnecessarily difficult people to work with in a given tech workplace - they make up about 75% of the users here. The other 25% are broken into aspiring entrepreneurs, reasonable ICs and Reddit migrants who are still trying to find their feet.<p>&gt;Do away with most management? And then what? 30,000 employees all steer the ship in the right direction by sheer &quot;individual accountability and focus on results&quot;? Well that gave me a good laugh.<p>Same crowd will balk at any suggestion around deriving accountability quantitatively. These rugged individualist coder wolves just need to be unleashed to let their genius flow, man.<p>&gt;Culture is overrated? That&#x27;s literally the only thing that prevents work from becoming a sterile factory.<p>See above. Why would the most unnecessarily difficult people to work with want a workplace that promotes working with others?')
