What comes first: a polarized populace or free news?<p>People who polarize are seen and heard a lot: they use free news articles on social media to spread their perspective to as many as possible, triggering a counter reaction on the other direction, also influencing the journalists  because they get clicks.<p>How wonderful it would be if none of that was free so people had to pay to read whatever has been spread. The blast radius would be limited.<p>My gut feeling is that 80% of the world are not interested in using news instrumentally to force political views on others. They may get caught up into it, but wouldn&#x27;t if they weren&#x27;t continously confronted with it.<p>It&#x27;s the age old rule that 95% on internet communities lurk, and 5% post content. The 5% are more insane than average. :-)<p>Today in 2021 people are USED to seeing free news on social media. But that&#x27;s just the current status quo. Imagine a society where people did not see or share stuff like that, as seldom as people share music or tv-shows or other kinds of content? There is nothing special with &quot;news&quot;. It just happened to be the thing that&#x27;s free and constructed to make people emotional and angry.<p>If there were only subscription services not competing with free, I think people would buy something that&#x27;s as neutral and unbiased as possible.')
