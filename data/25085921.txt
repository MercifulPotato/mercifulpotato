Item(by='Snitch-Thursday', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605293433, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25071555, text='I still use way too many DVDs and CDs for my write-once cold storage anti-ransomware needs. Good quality brands have sold their names out (TDK, Phillips, Taiyo Yuden AKA CMC), but MediaPro still seems to carry a few good brands left for now. Verbatim seems to be among the last brands standing that have a line of good-quality DVDs, if you go for their AZO or medical archive DVDs and HTL Blu-Rays.<p>If I could print text or images (or Paperbak[1] backups?) to hardback books, I would do that instead. There are machines that can take PDFs or postscript data and print a book, softback or hardback in small quantities, which I&#x27;d love to do for small files backup via Paperbak (scan that image, reconstruct the file in your computer), as well as my personal journalling (workflow: dictate to wireless headset, phone stores audio recording, syncthing syncs that folder to a folder watched by Dragon Folder Watcher Transcribe Agent, transcribed file is written to a directory which is either batch printed to a hardback book or incrementally written to a single page in an existing blank book, turning pages as needed).<p>While paper may not be amazing at storing large quantities of data in tiny physical space like microfiche or microSD cards, it has a staying power that the latter lacks for both physical-medium, analog-vs-digital-degredation, and binary format obsolescence reasons.<p>So either I grow rich enough to spend the $$$$$ to get a Book Printer[2], or I keep settling for &#x27;good enough&#x27; solutions like M-DISC DVDs, Verbatim Blu-Rays, and the online,offline dance of several different personally owned devices that sync up via syncthing, providing eventually consistent redundant copies.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ollydbg.de&#x2F;Paperbak&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ollydbg.de&#x2F;Paperbak&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Espresso_Book_Machine" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Espresso_Book_Machine</a>')
