Let&#x27;s take as a potentially erroneous given that early voting worked perfectly OK.  Then, in 2020, it&#x27;s run <i>exactly the same</i>, but demand is larger than in previous years [0].  That might result in exactly what&#x27;s being reported here.<p>So yes, Apple made a mistake with a novel experience.  Looks like various supervisors of elections are maybe also making a mistake with a novel experience.  But I the latter doesn&#x27;t get the same slack as Apple?<p>And, to be fair, at least my local supervisor of elections sent extra mailings this year making it abundantly clear that mail-in voting was an option and how to register for it.  So they <i>did</i> make obvious the availability of the preordering equivalent.<p>[0] I won&#x27;t say larger than anticipated, because the likelihood is that no one bothered to anticipate at all.
