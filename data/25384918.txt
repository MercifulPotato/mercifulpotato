Item(by='ojnabieoot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607689016, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25384771, text='Maybe not “most” depending on how that is defined, but a lot of blues&#x2F;jazz&#x2F;R&amp;B from those days can be found on YouTube if it isn’t on Spotify or Apple Music - there are many channels that upload recordings of old EPs&#x2F;LPs. I listen mostly to 50s-70s jazz and YouTube has proven the most reliable.<p>That said, Apple Music has a decent catalog of jazz, including many smaller artists - it’s actually the bigger names (whose estates have meaningful control over their body of work) that are sometimes patchier. Apple Music is also very good for finding new artists, and they put good work into their jazz playlists (even if the choices are maybe a bit anodyne).<p>Spotify used to be horrible for jazz - apparently it’s gotten better, but I remember signing up for a free month and being extremely disappointed.')
