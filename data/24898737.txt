I&#x27;ve had nothing but trouble with Hyper-V and VirtualBox lately.<p>It&#x27;s sad because VirtualBox used to work okay but the legacy AMD NIC and SoundBlaster drivers have been bitrotting in the last few years and Hyper-V&#x27;s predecessor Virtual PC used to be great with older OSes too.<p>If you prefer free software KVM&#x2F;virt-manager works just fine as well there&#x27;s just a bit more fiddling with options to make things happy.')
