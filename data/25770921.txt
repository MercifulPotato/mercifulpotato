Fight for ethical behaviour in your company and team and we can, en masse, delay the need for that.<p>And as for regulation, if it were up to me I’d make EULAs mostly unenforceable. Which would give leave for the people and companies affected by security breaches like this to sue anyone and everyone responsible. Which, by the way, is how the law is designed and how it works in every other facet of life. Sell a faulty ladder that kills someone? Get sued for negligence.')
