What&#x27;s on it depends on the task but usually, I write down all the things that need to get done and the status of where I&#x27;m at.<p>The notes I write aren&#x27;t that specific to code though. Like, I&#x27;m not gonna write &quot;I was looking at x file at code line y&quot; but I&#x27;ll write &quot;Finishing serializer up&quot; and any other notes that might help.')
