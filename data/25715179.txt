That&#x27;s a report from a single hospital.<p>&gt; <i>[...] the ICU is at capacity, patient beds line the hallways of the emergency department, and the morgue is overflowing. [...] has a capacity of about 300 people at any given time</i><p>They then talk about converting elective space and hallways into bed space. Which was pretty normal everywhere.<p>And critically, NYC, as with all major metros, operates as a <i>system</i> of hospitals. So the data to support your assertion would be total NYC bed &amp; ICU bed capacity &amp; utilization.<p>&quot;Overwhelmed&quot; means unable to provide care. Not busy. Not lacking in specific equipment. Not being diverted to another hospital. It means ambulances showing up with patients and being told &quot;No, we can provide no treatment.&quot;<p>The situation on the Comfort in NYC (swapped my coasts, oops!) was... complicated. The Navy was essentially commanded to &quot;Send a big ship to NYC so it can be seen.&quot; Everyone I&#x27;ve talked to in Navy medicine thought it was idiotic, for reasons too numerous to list.<p>However, given the order from on high, the least &amp;@$_ed way of fulfilling it was to use the Comfort to offload non-Covid patients from local hospitals, thereby freeing capacity, thereby creating more Covid bed space. (Just to be clear, swamping an enclosed ship with large numbers of patients infected with a highly communicable virus is a terrible idea. Land-based facilities, if existent, are infinitely superior for isolation in this scenario)<p>Only... nobody had thought about how that transfer was supposed to work. Or the legal ramifications of transferring patients from hospitals to US military care. Or any of the other minutiae.<p>Consequently, the Comfort essentially sat there waiting for hospitals to transfer patients and... they didn&#x27;t.<p>Essentially the same story with Javits (staffed by military medical). What Javits <i>did</i> get tended to be folks the hospitals thought would be unable to pay, and&#x2F;or Medicaid (ie capped reimbursement rates).<p>The general feeling on the military medical side is that hospitals didn&#x27;t want to lose the revenue patients represented, and so were retaining as many as possible, even as their doctors, nurses, and staff (rightly so) told the media they&#x27;d been working non-stop for weeks.<p>Source: doctors in NYC, people who served at Javits and had colleagues on the Comfort<p>Please see guidelines for HN commenting.
