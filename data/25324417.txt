It can also run in fanless mode like in MBA m1.<p>A more modern comparison with mobility GPU would be GTX 1050 Ti mobility, which is around 10-20% faster than 760: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gpu.userbenchmark.com&#x2F;Compare&#x2F;Nvidia-GTX-760-vs-Nvidia-GTX-1050-Ti-Mobile&#x2F;2159vsm223242" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gpu.userbenchmark.com&#x2F;Compare&#x2F;Nvidia-GTX-760-vs-Nvid...</a><p>Even still, 1050 ti uses up around 75w of power (2016) and 760 has a TDP of 170W (2013) while M1 GPU is much less than 10W (at full load, it peaks at 16w in Mac mini for the entire SoC, not just GPU).<p>It would be interesting to see what Apple does when it scales it up to 75w or more for their own custom desktop GPUs which is rumored in development. However, separate desktop GPU does lose the benefits of UMA that makes M1 fast.')
