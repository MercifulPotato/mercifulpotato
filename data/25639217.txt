Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609799589, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25629202, text='&gt; Another problem common to both democracy and employment is the restricted set of options which create an illusion of free choice and consent to what follows - &quot;I chose this politician&quot; or &quot;I chose this employer&quot;.<p>This is what I take issue with. The restriction of options in democracy is a part of the design of the system and ultimately related to democracy&#x27;s purpose as a decision-forcing mechanism. The losing side of the polity is deprived <i>by design.</i> In a market the number of options available is (subject to physical limits) a function of the number of people who choose to provide options. There is not a corresponding artificial limit on choice, rather there are as many choices as society and the planet can support.<p>&gt; Unlike choosing a politician, you need to choose an employer.<p>Unlike choosing an employer, if you do not choose a politician, one will be chosen for you.<p>&gt; This makes the stakes higher<p>The stakes are higher in politics because of their sanctioned ability to use force to modify the behavior of others.<p>&gt; Choosing is not enough, the employer also needs to choose you.<p>This is a good thing as it ensures that the relationship is mutually satisfactory rather than a unilateral relationship like slavery.<p>&gt; And despite that, most people believe in a just-world fallacy in which your job record and position in life is made out of your choices, and you deserve what you get.<p>To the extent that there is a free market in employment, that is true. to the extent that the markets are controlled by politics, that is a fallacy.<p>&gt; Everyone gets what the class of capital-owners has chosen.<p>Wrong. We just established that these relationships are mutual.<p>&gt; Quid pro quo is the going rate only in the most farcical sense for a large portion of the population where the quid is your finite time and energy, and the quo is being housed and clothed.<p>Its not a farce to suggest that they are being paid what their labor is worth. Also lets please be accurate, they aren&#x27;t &quot;fed and clothed&quot; but given exchange media which they then choose to exchange for those things if they need and want to.<p>&gt; I certainly can&#x27;t choose no employer.<p>Quite the contrary, you <i>most certainly can</i>. You may not like the consequences of this choice but that&#x27;s a matter of preference.')
