From another comment here they enable you to declare things like &quot;this field could contain a string or an integer&quot;.<p>Would it make more sense to make the field be always integer or always string?  Then you would have two separate data-types and you could use the one you need when you need to?<p>You can always convert an integer to string if needed, and vice versa.<p>I can understand it gives you more flexibility  that you can specify something MAY be either X or Y. But that makes the data-type specification more complicated. If you can do with X only why not just stick to it? Define the API to accept only integers and require a caller who has a string to first convert it to integer.')
