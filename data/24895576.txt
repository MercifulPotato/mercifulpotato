At its worst NextDoor is a social network for a clone army of Nosy Nancy. &quot;Saw teenager walking on sidewalk. Suspicious. Noted, shall call police.&quot; Nosy Nancy lives a block away from a school and watched a student walking home after school.<p>Iterate ad nauseam for Goodwill donation trucks, VTA Lite Rail stations, recycling centers, whatever fits that neighborhood&#x27;s definition of &quot;undesirables&quot; and what &quot;attracts them&quot;.<p>Yes, there are good things regarding NextDoor and I have experienced some of them. However, in my experience the ratio skews poorly and towards suspicion and towards hate.<p>It&#x27;s been a few years since I&#x27;ve been there and I have no regrets. On a nice day, it was a silly place.')
