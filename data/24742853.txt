It should tell you what octane number gas you should get, plus a lot more. For example, in the manual for mine (a 2006 Honda CR-V) it says this:<p>===========<p>Your vehicle is designed to operate on unleaded gasoline with a pump octane number of 87 or higher. Use of a lower octane gasoline can cause a persistent, heavy metallic rapping noise that can lead to engine damage.<p>We recommend using gasoline containing detergent additives that help prevent fuel system and engine deposits.<p>In addition, in order to maintain good performance, fuel economy, and emissions control, we strongly recommend, in areas where it is available, the use of gasoline that does NOT contain manganese-based fuel additives such as MMT.<p>Use of gasoline with these additives may adversely affect performance, and cause the malfunction indicator lamp on your instrument panel to come on. If this happens, contact\nyour authorized dealer for service.<p>Some gasoline today is blended with oxygenates such as ethanol or MTBE. Your vehicle is designed to operate on oxygenated gasoline containing up to 10 percent ethanol by volume and up to 15 percent MTBE by volume. Do not use gasoline containing methanol.<p>===========<p>Dealing with the octane number is easy. Just don&#x27;t use gas with a lower octane than your manual calls for. You can use a higher octane if you want, but it won&#x27;t really do anything other than cost more. You&#x27;ll get the same performance, wear, pollution, and mileage as you would with the octane number given in your manual.')
