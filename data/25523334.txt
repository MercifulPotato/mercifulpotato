Do the same things in an Objective-C codebase and you&#x27;ll be surprised about how snappy and non-buggy everything is.<p>I maintain today you could&#x27;ve gotten %80-%90 of the benefits of swift with a syntax refresh and add a few new cheap to compile features to Objective-C itself, like stronger nullbables and the ADT enums.<p>I think the &#x27;good enough software&#x27; stuff will stop happening when physical limits start limiting improvements in compute, because the only way to have a competitive advantage then is through better software.<p>I hope that day is far away although, because it means that something like 8k consumer VR is something that will never happen, where the software is written properly to take proper advantage of the hardware.')
