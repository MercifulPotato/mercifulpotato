It is just too bad that the later are only rasterized PDFs whereas if you enable a sync service from the OS like Dropbox, the notes are uploaded as vector PDFs.<p>One thing I am not happy about is the constant phoning home to Chinese servers (multiple domains incl. alibaba) This can be disabled via NetGuard but then you also lose the ability to automatically upload the handwritten vectorized notes to Dropbox.')
