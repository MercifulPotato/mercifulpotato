Item(by='amadeuspagel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608120816, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25441662, text='I made thinktype to replace all the apps I used to write down diffferent kinds of thoughts - a scratchpad, a todo app, a note-taking app, a diary.<p>It doesn&#x27;t replace all these apps by combining all their features, it uses a different approach: When you open the app your cursor is in a search field which you can also write and save longer notes from. Making the search so easily accessible lets you use text to organize your thoughts anyway you want. For example you can use it as a todo list by using the &quot;TODO&quot; and &quot;DONE&quot; keywords in notes. This lets you either search for all your todos, or all your notes and todos related to a project - the latter is something you couldn&#x27;t do if your todos were in another app.<p>I submitted this yesterday with the title &quot;write your thoughts down immidiately&quot;, but it didn&#x27;t get any attention. I hope this title is better and it&#x27;s OK to submit it again.[1]<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9772114" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9772114</a>')
