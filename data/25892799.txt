From left to right:<p>Vertical oriented 1080p: chat windows, sometimes replaced by multiple command line windows.<p>Horizontal 4K: Emacs, Visual Studio Code, Browser with repositories&#x2F;jira, command line windows.<p>Horizontal 4K: Browser with documentation, secondary VS Code windows, Outlook, Teams.<p>Macbook Pro screen: Finder, calculator, more command line windows.<p>Most of my &quot;main&quot; work takes place in the 2 horizontal 4K screens. The other 2 screens are &quot;secondary&quot; information. Having that much screen real estate allows me to more easily collect and arrange the information I need to do my job.<p>If I could change anything, it would be getting a 24 inch 4K screen to replace the vertical one, and having a higher refresh rate than 60Hz on all my screens.<p>I hope that one day 8K screens become affordable, because I&#x27;d love even sharper text. Reading on the vertical 1080p screen seems fuzzy compared to the 4K screens. (Which is definitely a &quot;first world problem&quot;!!)')
