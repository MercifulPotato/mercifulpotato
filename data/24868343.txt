If class A shares have all the votes (while most shares are class B shares), what prevents the market from valuing the class A shares at an extremely high value and the class B shares not at all?  When the company finally gets big and stops growing, the source of its value to shareholders will be the dividends that it pays and it will be the voting class A shareholders that decide how dividends are allocated.')
