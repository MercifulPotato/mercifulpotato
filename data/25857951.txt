You do not need a complex type system to get a very expressive language. For instance, the typing rules of dependent type theory are fairly simple compared to the amount of trickery needed to make TypeScript work.<p>At constant expressivity, a simple type system is always preferable to a complex one. So I am not amazed by the fact that TS needs advanced PLT debauchery to kind of work. It doesn&#x27;t even give you strong guarantees. There is a reason why Hindley-Milner type systems are called the sweet spot of static typing.')
