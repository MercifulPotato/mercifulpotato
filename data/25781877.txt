I don&#x27;t care that you have 18 strength and it&#x27;s technically something you can <i>lift</i>, it makes no sense to be able to <i>run</i> with all of that, let alone expecting to keep up with unencumbered opponent.<p>But this is one of the great things of this hobby:<p>1. There are thousands of systems to select from.<p>2. No one forces you to play it RAW.<p>3. If you do want RAW, you can probably find a system that works for you.<p>The most important parts are: what&#x27;s fun and conveys the sense you want for the game; agreeing on the rules (either RAW or house) with some consistency (What do you mean I can&#x27;t jump down 10&#x27;? You let him jump off a 50&#x27; cliff without getting hurt just last week!).')
