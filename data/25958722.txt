To stop this, you&#x27;d have to do the equivalent of DRMing books and revoking the first sale doctrine. Which I imagine would turn shorting into a much more complex market mechanic than it is today.<p>(Disclaimer: the extent of my expertise on stock markets is me knowing how to spell &quot;stonks&quot;.)')
