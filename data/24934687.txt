It seems like the US has begun to splinter such that there are two different sets of &quot;facts&quot; on many issues, but of course that is not how facts work. Nevertheless, when doing research and investigation is it often hard for me to pin down the truth behind any of the &quot;facts&quot; that are thrown at me, whether that&#x27;s by the partisans, by the media, or just by random people on HN etc.<p>Does anyone else feel this way?')
