When it’s an access to healthcare issue though you can’t really exclude 2% of users.&lt;&lt;&lt;<p>That thinking is exactly the reason why this system turned out to be problematic. Even if it wasn&#x27;t for healthcare purposes, bottom line is - you have to know who your &#x27;actual users&#x27; are. Elderly people (60s and above) are still heavy IE users and so are quite a few government offices. If these 2% of overall browser users are the majority of your users or your early users, then not supporting them becomes a problem.')
