Having flexible but well understood roles is key for good team management. This seems to be lacking in many orgs.<p>Product Manager: responsible for technical and commercial product-market fit. Getting Voice of Customer. Understanding market size. Setting pricing.<p>Electrical&#x2F;hardware&#x2F;software Engineer: technical producer of the code&#x2F;hardware&#x2F;etc.... unit that is used in the product.<p>Systems Engineer: responsible for ensuring requirements of the project and product are met, tested, and giving confidence to the business that they have tested product, that will meet the user needs, will work in the environment where the product is used, and is ready for production.<p>Product Owner: Ultimate decider for product features in real-time. Ensures during development that the right product is being built, everyone knows what should be known.<p>Core team lead&#x2F; Project Manager: the person enabling the project to proceed. Manages business, timeline, requesting headcount, enabling critical path to move forward, etc...<p>Engineering Manager: responsible for hiring and training engineers, ensuring engineers have appropriate workloads, ensuring engineers have desired career development.<p>Depending on the size of the team and project, people may wear more than one hat. In many software shops they usually just split out Product Manager, People Manager, and Software Engineer. Thus the &quot;glue&quot; pieces are those roles missing above.')
