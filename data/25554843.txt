If someone feels disconnected from history, it&#x27;s incumbent upon them to engage and connect with it.<p>I&#x27;d point out that for pretty much all of recorded history, it&#x27;s only been those with power and wealth that have had the leisure or need to become <i>literate</i>, let alone to study history.<p>That&#x27;s changed to a certain extent but most folks, even in modern times, give little thought to history, and have little interest in it.<p>As for &quot;Western&quot; culture, there&#x27;s a great deal that&#x27;s known and a <i>huge</i> amount of scholarship has and continues to be done around it and its history.  If you put even a tiny bit of effort[0][1][2], you can gain great deal of knowledge about history.<p>Should you wish to expend more effort, there are literally <i>thousands</i> of books, academic papers and treatises which provide enormous insight into our history.<p>And if you&#x27;re <i>really</i> interested, you can make a whole <i>career</i> out of the study and exposition of history.<p>As such, I&#x27;d say that any &quot;disconnect&quot; from history is rooted in a lack of interest or even a modicum of energy expended in &quot;connecting&quot; with it.<p>Our <i>current</i> culture and educational systems seem to deprecate and devalue history, even <i>recent</i> (the last 50 years or so) history.  That&#x27;s a shame IMHO.<p>Please don&#x27;t take my comment as a personal attack, it&#x27;s not.  The sentiment you express isn&#x27;t unusual or surprising.<p>The solution to such a &quot;disconnect&quot; is to access historical information and cultural narratives.  Such access is, I&#x27;d argue, <i>more</i> available to the lay person than ever before.<p>I&#x27;d also note that the &quot;disconnect&quot; you mention, while seemingly related to mass communications and its focus on trivia and current events, isn&#x27;t anything new or profound.  Rather, it&#x27;s related to a lack of <i>interest</i> among most people.<p>Whether that lack of interest is based on a lack of leisure time, a discouragement of such endeavors by our media and educational systems and&#x2F;or other factors, it&#x27;s that lack of <i>interest</i> that causes such a disconnect -- and that&#x27;s easily remedied.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;playlist?list=PL1U_8A7q8La1VfEa-HJifnO3r1JgOdSVP" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;playlist?list=PL1U_8A7q8La1VfEa-HJif...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edx.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;western-civilization" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edx.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;western-civilization</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_decline_of_the_West" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_decline_of_the_West</a><p>Edit: Improved clarity.')
