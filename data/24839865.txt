Both have improved for sure, but they still have a long way to goâ€¦ GNOME actually came closest but its customizability level is even lower than that of macOS, even factoring in extensions.<p>Both suffer from a laundry list of minor annoyances that snowball into something that&#x27;s hard to ignore, and in KDE&#x27;s case the UX design they employ just doesn&#x27;t jive with me at all.<p>It&#x27;s all enough that I end up coming back to macOS because despite its problems, it fits me in ways that nothing else even comes close to touching. Sometimes it feels like there will never be a macOS alternative that has what it takes for me to switch without feeling a major sense of loss.')
