Software wise, that&#x27;s about as user-hackable as you can get.  It&#x27;s true that the Oculus Quest is not as open.<p>I don&#x27;t expect or even really want to swap hardware on these devices: if that was a priority for me I would get a PC, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc. I get the desire to tinker and customize, but from where I&#x27;m sitting I have plenty of opportunity to do that.<p>I also don&#x27;t expect the device manufacturers to do the work to make Ubuntu or FreeBSD run.  They didn&#x27;t do that for PCs, the community did.')
