I know what I saw both locally and on TV. You can give me as many bubble-filtered thoughts as you like, but you&#x27;re trying to convince me that I saw and experienced something that I didn&#x27;t see and experience.<p>Let me know when I can&#x27;t get my wife&#x27;s medication again because right wing &quot;&quot;terrorists&quot;&quot; smashed up my pharmacy, or when parts of my city are completely off limits for violence, or when one the teachers in my school district gets arrested for assaulting somebody filming them burning a car. I&#x27;m not losing sleep over congress getting delayed for a couple of hours. I&#x27;ll keep my perspective that all political violence is bad, and that I want little to do with politics in general, but one side of extremists in particular has caused more problems for me than another.')
