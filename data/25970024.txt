He made reference to how he was keeping some component simple (the memory interface, I believe), which would compromise performance, but he wasn&#x27;t worried about it because the 68000 he was using in it was so fast.<p>My first thought was &quot;yeah, that makes sense&quot; but my second was &quot;what could it possibly mean when we talk about a 68000 being &#x27;fast&#x27; in 2021?!&quot;<p>It really made me think about how an attribute like &quot;fastness&quot; can get endowed and then still stick 40 years later, almost as though it were describing some spiritual attribute that transcends the fact that a modern $0.25 microcontroller is many times more performant.')
