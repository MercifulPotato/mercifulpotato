So I believe they have written a JVM bytecode interpreter and Truffle makes the JIT.<p>I&#x27;m super impressed by how the Truffle&#x2F;GraalVM team has been able to turn this theoretical concept into a system that yields production grade compilers (although this Java on Java is not there yet).<p>&quot;A very important detail of this implementation is that itâ€™s implemented in Java.
