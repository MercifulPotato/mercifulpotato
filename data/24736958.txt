New user acquisitions. <i>Increased engagement.</i> It doesn’t matter that the engagement is not generating money because it still lets them say “well, we lost a billion dollars this quarter, but user engagement is up 80% YOY so things are looking good for the future! (Please keep buying our stock&#x2F;fund our next round!)”<p>Second, engineers working at a social networking company can’t directly influence what advertisers spend, but they <i>can</i> influence the behaviour of users, and leverage that for <i>personal</i> gain. “Look at how valuable I am, I developed this enhanced rage generating machine that increased engagement by 20% in A&#x2F;B testing! Give me the big bonus now!” It’s a much harder sell to say “hey, Boss, I deleted a feature which was causing immeasurable subjective harm to society! It probably caused 100,000 users to delete their accounts and move to Gab! Give me the big bonus now!”')
