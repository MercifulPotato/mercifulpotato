It was terrible. I spent untold hours futzing with 3rd party ink, using alarming looking syringes and squirt bottles, getting it all over my hands, desks and equipment, and then spent more time debugging the poor print quality and clogged nozzles.  One day in a fit of rage I swept the contents of my desk into the garbage and never looked back.  :)  I feel that in retrospect, it was a useful exercise at least to help me realize what exactly it is I am paying for when I pay for OEM refills.  Also, to be fair  having nozzles included in the cartridges was a technological leap that really solves a lot of the issues with or without using 3rd party materials.')
