That&#x27;s the same amount than an Apple watch serie 4&#x2F;5.<p>&gt; It has a battery the size of a dime, it should be doing very little with processor or memory.<p>Wear OS is far from perfect but that&#x27;s more on the Snapdragon 3100. Samsung and Apple CPU are far better but they don&#x27;t sell them.<p>It&#x27;s very much a chicken and egg situation. Qualcomm doesn&#x27;t invest because there is not market and there is no market because poor CPUs lead to products which are not competitive. Google could have unlocked the situation but I guess they were wainting for the Fitbit acquisition to go through before going back to wearables.')
