Item(by='lapcatsoftware', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609988970, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25662092, text='&gt; All goes back to Reagan&#x27;s repeal of the Fairness Doctrine<p>Reagan himself was an FBI informant and was involved with blacklisting so-called Communists way back when he was President of the Screen Actors Guild, during the McCarthy era. So any story that says &quot;It all started on such and such a date&quot; is completely arbitrary.<p>You can talk about Barry Goldwater. The National Review. Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson. There was already a strong conservative movement growing that got Reagan elected in the first place. Not to mention the October surprise conspiracy theory of his 1980 election.<p>The 1960s, the Vietnam War, the civil rights era, these had a huge impact socially, started political realignments, and caused much internal turmoil in the United States.<p>The Gingrich &quot;Republican Revolution&quot; occurred in 1994. Hillary Clinton claimed there was a vast right-wing conspiracy in 1995. Government shutdowns. Impeachment. Oklahoma City bombing. All of this occurred before Fox News even went on the air.<p>Will anyone acknowledge that Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were radicalized before Fox News existed, not to mention before Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube?')
