Commuted 2hrs a day, crashed at home completely exhausted and got eaten alive by the seasonal depression. Cried on the drive home about twice a week because I was miserable.\nThis year: covid hits, I go wfh full time. Decide to move to a new team. They&#x27;re really great to work with and work is fun again. I have hours back in my day for all kinds of fun activities.\nLockdowns were actually a blessing in disguise.')
