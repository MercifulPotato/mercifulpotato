It&#x27;s complex to tell people not to hoard things so we lied and told the public masks weren&#x27;t recommended until June.<p>Now the gloves thing is a mystery to me.  Do people not have control over their hands?  The virus doesn&#x27;t enter the hands, it enters the face-holes, but the hands have to be close to the face-holes to enter, where they bind to receptors in the airways.  The virus-facehole transit route exists even if you wear gloves.<p>A few months back I saw someone sitting outside, on a park bench, mask on chin while they ate a sandwich -- with their gloves.<p>Yeah, it can be the case that people are dumb-dumbs AND our institutions are awful at messaging strategy.')
