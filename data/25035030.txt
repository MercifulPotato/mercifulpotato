Item(by='nrmitchi', descendants=None, kids=[25035747], score=None, time=1604931648, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25034304, text='&gt; The fact that his apartment is &#x27;charred&#x27; suggests he was doing stuff in it.<p>Or, it suggests that there was a fire, which is not really up for debate.<p>&gt; Could be he took the materials with him as he was trying to escape out the back window<p>You are making up a hypothesis to make someone sound guilty with no evidence.<p>&gt; I think it&#x27;s useful that this was reported on, because it could make people more wary of shelling out money to a guy who was recklessly endangering others even if there were no nefarious motives.<p>This is a poor opinion. First, he has not been found guilty of &quot;reckless endangement&quot;, and you are just assuming he&#x27;s guilty. Do you also expect to see reporting every time someone recklessly endangers others by driving at high speeds through a school zone, or accidently runs through a stop sign?<p>Publishing accusations of someone (especially a very easily google-able person) being a terrorist is not something that should be done lightly without proof.<p>Hell, right now I&#x27;m pretty sure I have both bleach and ammonia in my apartment as regular cleaning supplies. When combined, these ingredients are dangerous, but that sure as shit doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m endangering others just by possessing them.')
