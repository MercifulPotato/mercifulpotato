I was diagnosed with AS almost 15 years ago. Not sure what country or health system you are under but I&#x27;m in Austria, and treated with a medication called Simponi. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.simponi.com&#x2F;ankylosing-spondylitis" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.simponi.com&#x2F;ankylosing-spondylitis</a>. It&#x27;s a TNF-Alpha blocker and as far as I understand it damps down the immune response in certain cells that cause the inflammatory response. It&#x27;s pretty good stuff. It&#x27;s not 100% effective and I&#x27;m not cured and I have my bad days. I had to go through a few hoops to get on the stuff but the health system in Austria is pretty good.<p>I&#x27;m also very active and do most stuff I want to including surfing, snowboarding, dancing, and hiking decent mountains. There was a time when I stopped and thought it was all over but in the end I said fuck it. I&#x27;m going snowboarding and I&#x27;m going to make sure I&#x27;m healthy enough to do it. Most mornings I wake a little stiff. Two days surfing in 8 degrees C water will do that ;). But doing some stretching and relaxing before hitting the keyboard and coding can loosen me up for a days work.<p>I wish you the best of luck and health managing your situation.<p>Regards')
