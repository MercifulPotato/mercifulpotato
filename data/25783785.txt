I don&#x27;t make them simply because I don&#x27;t want to deal with leftover egg yolks<p>Flips are explicitly whole egg cocktails. If you&#x27;re not using the yolk, you&#x27;re not making a flip.<p>If you try to use aquafaba to replace the egg in a flip recipe, you&#x27;ll end up with a different drink because you won&#x27;t have the flavour of the yolk.')
