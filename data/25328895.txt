In the end, the manager was fired after the SMS messages were made public because PR.) The ODM FAA contractors are also under pressure not to affect schedules at Boeing or they also have been fired in the past.<p>The similarities I read between the Grenfell Tower and 737 MAX disasters were that employees knew there was a safety problem (fire vs. loss of control), and the certification paperwork was misleading (fire rating vs. MCAS pitch-down rate and frequency.)<p>I wouldn&#x27;t describe the 737 MAX issue as directly a profit-motivated defect. Yes, larger engines required MCAS, and delays reduce profits, but a correct MCAS design and certification paperwork would have cost the same initially as what was delivered - that didn&#x27;t work.')
