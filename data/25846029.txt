Does that not directly say that Parler was the &quot;preferred&quot; app for the planning of right-wing election violence?  I won&#x27;t spend all morning detailing the rest of them (there are too many), but arguing that mainstream media is not saying that planning occurred on Parler is about as ridiculous as Kamala Harris&#x27; argument that the US Supreme Court has no jurisdiction over California jails - an argument she made when she was trying to keep nonviolent prisoners in custody in direct violation of a Supreme Court order [2].<p>The larger point, though, is the hypocrisy surrounding the continued operation of Facebook while Parler was shutdown.  The first paragraph of this [3] pretty much says it all:<p><i>&quot;Parler all but vanished from the internet this week. Major tech platforms, including Apple and Amazon, booted the social network popular with the far-right for what the companies said was a failure to moderate incitement and violent rhetoric on its service that contributed to last week&#x27;s deadly Capitol riots.&quot;</i><p>Does the report we are discussing in this thread not clearly underscore the fact that Facebook also failed to <i>&quot;to moderate incitement and violent rhetoric on its service that contributed to last week&#x27;s deadly Capitol riots&quot;</i>?  If that is the standard by which all social networks are judged, then should Facebook not meet the same fate?  It&#x27;s hypocritical that they are still online today.<p>Are you arguing that Facebook is not guilty of the exact same crime for which Parler was executed?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.msnbc.com&#x2F;ali-velshi&#x2F;watch&#x2F;far-right-extremists-are-now-recalibrating-planning-on-an-app-favored-by-isis-99573829778" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.msnbc.com&#x2F;ali-velshi&#x2F;watch&#x2F;far-right-extremists-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;prospect.org&#x2F;justice&#x2F;how-kamala-harris-fought-to-keep-nonviolent-prisoners-locked-up&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;prospect.org&#x2F;justice&#x2F;how-kamala-harris-fought-to-kee...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;12&#x2F;tech&#x2F;parler-online-violence&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;12&#x2F;tech&#x2F;parler-online-violence&#x2F;i...</a>')
