Pushing complexity up into libraries does nothing to ameliorate. In fact it makes it worse, as have to work with libraries with different idioms makes the language a hodgepodge of slightly incompatible conventions.<p>In Python the complex machinery is in the language and the stdlib. All additional libraries that work with the language generally use stdlib constructs for data interchange, or at least base their work on it. That makes for an extremely pleasant programming experience.<p>Learning a different macro per dependency is going to lead to catastrophe. I know it&#x27;s in an exaggeration, but I see this in macro-based languages all the time.')
