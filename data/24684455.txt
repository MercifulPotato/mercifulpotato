And linux is pretty good at configurability -- any driver, and even many &quot;core&quot; kernel features, can be disabled and then they is no longer even compiled.<p>Interestingly enough, this was common even in 1987 -- the original post also talks about configuring kernel to reduce binary size:<p>&gt;  Sun kernel code was about 390 kbytes, even properly configured (as distributed it was 490k).<p>I suppose someone could take kernel source tree and strip out unselected drivers, but I cannot imagine a good reason to do so.')
