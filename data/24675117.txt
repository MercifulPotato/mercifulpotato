TD continues to own 40% of TD Ameritrade. After Charles Schwab closes their majority acquisition of TD Ameritrade, TD will continue to own about 13% of the company. But TD has never been a majority shareholder of anything with the word Ameritrade in its name.<p>TD continues to be a major institution in its own right in both Canada and the US, and has engaged in plenty of other consolidation outside the scope of what&#x27;s currently TD Ameritrade. Not disagreeing with the general point.')
