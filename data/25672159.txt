We cannot have performance and compressed at the same time. There are other things about the C extension that make it extremely bad for emulators too.<p>The good news is that we can ignore rv64gc completely and just build everything rv64g, if you control everything yourself. Personally for my RISC-V use I actully do control everything and because of this I can pretend the C-extension doesn&#x27;t exist.')
