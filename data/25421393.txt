Defer is still manual and local, just less noisy and burdensome.<p>Just like every C feature: if you know how it&#x27;s implemented (and optimized), you will know what is going to happen. All big C compilers already support stack frames and unwinding, so it&#x27;s not even entirely novel functionality.<p>While you may object it&#x27;s not entirely obvious how unwinding is going to be implemented, OTOH in functions with complex control flow it can be easier to understand which `defer`s are going to be run, as opposed to following nested `else` statements, or reasoning about the program state from all `goto cleanup` locations.')
