I&#x27;ve made a few OSS rich text editors work (mostly) with Fluid [0, 1] and the design of the text editor <i>really</i> changes how easily collaboration can be added. Luckily the text editor accepts remote changes, integrating an OT or CRDT solution is approximately the same.<p>They also did a great job explaining the problem. My experience has been that people don&#x27;t intuitively understand why real time collaboration is a tricky problem. I didn&#x27;t. First of all, for a bunch of use cases websockets + redis + a last write wins conflict resolution (or some similar solution) is totally enough. Second, it&#x27;s not immediately obvious why rich text editing requires more complex conflict resolution. Third, it&#x27;s not obvious why solving the RTE problem doesn&#x27;t immediately lend itself to other problems [2].<p>Because we started building in mid-late 2017, right as CRDTs really started to get competitive with OT, we chose a CRDT approach, but the collab problem space in general is much deeper I realized before getting into it.<p>Anyway, I always appreciate seeing people explain their journey. Especially when it has to do with collaboration.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fluidframework.com&#x2F;playground&#x2F;?path=&#x2F;docs&#x2F;react-demos-draft-js--demo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fluidframework.com&#x2F;playground&#x2F;?path=&#x2F;docs&#x2F;react-demo...</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;FluidFramework&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;examples&#x2F;data-objects&#x2F;prosemirror" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;FluidFramework&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;exampl...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=x7drE24geUw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=x7drE24geUw</a>')
