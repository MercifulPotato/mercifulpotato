I don&#x27;t have a blog post on how I got started, but you gave me the idea that perhaps I should write one.<p>In terms of hardware, I&#x27;m using an iCEBreaker dev board [1] which has worked really well (A nice bonus is that the board has a 16MB flash chip, which can be used for storage -- this is what the Minecraft clone uses to load the map and textures from on startup).<p>On the software side, I&#x27;m using the open source yosys&#x2F;nextpnr&#x2F;icestorm toolchain which is a lot faster than the vendor supplied tools. I mostly figured things out by just trying stuff, so a high iteration speed definitely helped here!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;1bitsquared.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;icebreaker" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;1bitsquared.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;icebreaker</a>')
