That’s just the nature of law as a construct. What the federal courts in America have done is set themselves up as a tribunal of elites for deciding moral issues that other countries decide democratically.<p>This unsurprisingly causes a lot of friction. Same sex marriage actually wasn’t one of those areas—US opinion and that in other developed countries wasn’t far off, and it was legalized after it hit majority support. And <i>Obergefell</i> has a much stronger basis in law than other Supreme Court social decisions. There is a long line of precedent recognizing that marriage is a “fundamental right” protected by the constitution.<p>But abortion and religion in schools are examples of where the court is significantly out of step with both the letter of the law and public opinion. Public opinion in America supports abortion in the first trimester and or after that. That’s the same moral balance as reflected in the laws of say Denmark, France, Spain, Germany, and Italy (where abortion is generally illegal after 10-14 weeks). But under <i>Roe</i> abortion cannot be banned until the end of the second trimester. So our elite tribunal has imposed an abortion regime in the US that’s inconsistent with what more liberal Europeans have.<p>Same thing for religion in schools. 2&#x2F;3 of Americans oppose the ban on school prayer. By contrast, instruction in public schools is a legal right in much of Europe, including the UK and Germany.<p>Being out of step with the public can be justified if that’s what the letter of the law requires. What’s most perplexing about <i>Roe</i> in particular is that it’s out of step with public opinion (broader than what the public wants) and also has no basis in the constitutional text. What’s the source of the court’s authority in that context?')
