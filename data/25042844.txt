The biggest victims of war are the civilians. In ww2, vietnam, iraq wars, etc, the civilians accounted for the vast majority of the casualties, not the soldiers.<p>&gt; how do you slow the war machine?<p>You can&#x27;t. The elites who control the war machine control the propaganda in every country. Once they want war, the entire propaganda apparatus beats the war drums and anyone in their way gets steamrolled. Ask the dixie chicks, phil donahue, etc. Remember freedom fries? Go look at how quickly germany turned from being the heart of european civilization to nazi germany.<p>&gt; I think the morals of the soldiers would severely limit this.<p>Has nothing to do with morals. Is it moral to go to another country and kill people? If you are labelled &quot;enemy of the state&quot; ( a great movie btw ), then you are fair game.<p>&gt; Everyone knows this is the future, and saw it coming, but wow, I naively thought it would take longer.<p>It&#x27;s not the robots that are worrisome. It&#x27;s the concentration of money and power.')
