I was merely recalling a childhood memory of &quot;mealworms&quot;.  Maybe someone thought I was suggesting some kind of remedy to a potential invasive species problem?  Nothing of the sort.  I am all too familiar with real world invasive species problems and the historical remedial failures associated therewith.  Totally different subject.')
