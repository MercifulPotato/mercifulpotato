Item(by='darth_avocado', descendants=None, kids=[25734005], score=None, time=1610386857, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25732262, text='You are right in the sense that if you look at average SWE salaries and data engineering salaries, the average salary is higher for data engineers. Because the starting salaries for data engineers tend to be higher because of all the skills that are needed and there&#x27;s plenty of SWE positions that require more than just a degree in CS. But if you start comparing salaries at maybe a senior level (4-5 yoe+), the salaries for SWEs start becoming a lot more than DEs. And again, I&#x27;ve worked in different companies, big and small, this holds true for all companies that have &quot;Data Engineer&quot; titles.  There&#x27;s of course companies like Netflix where you are a data engineer but still get a SWE title and get paid the same.')
