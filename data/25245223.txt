To assume that your perspective is so superior, that it gives you a right to ignore civil protocol, is incredibly arrogant.<p>&gt;&gt;I mean, systemic&#x2F;institutional racism doesn&#x27;t exist and&#x2F;or isn&#x27;t a problem in the US, what?<p>You&#x27;re not providing a counter-argument. Your incredulity at my statement of fact doesn&#x27;t give your absurd allegation of systemic racism any more credibility.<p>&gt;you find affirmative action to be so significant that it however substantiate systemic racism in favour of black Americans?<p>Affirmative action is a form of systemic racism, in that it&#x27;s racism that institutionized, meaning part of the formal structure of organizations, and accepted by the social contract.<p>&gt;So that systemic&#x2F;institutional racism does not include implicit bias?<p>The formal structure of institutions, as defined by their formal usually written rules, is the best description of their systemic&#x2F;institutional properties.
