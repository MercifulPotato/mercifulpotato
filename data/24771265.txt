This is a product they sell for a profit. They are selling something, unlimited storage, and getting mad when people use it as unlimited storage. If they can&#x27;t make a profit doing that, which they obviously can&#x27;t, then they shouldnt advertise it as such. Why am I supposed to take pity on the plight of Googles marketing department?')
