The rules are broadly similar for the other film industry unions as well, with similar effects (and other roles have &quot;industry-famous&quot; if not &quot;mom and dad famous&quot; talent).<p>I suspect you&#x27;d get similar dynamics if, for example, a large cohort of the staff&#x2F;principle engineers plus a bunch of senior engineers in the valley joined the SWE Local 16384.  It&#x27;s probably not necessary that your mom and dad have heard of them.')
