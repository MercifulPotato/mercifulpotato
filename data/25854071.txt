They can be buried in an advanced menu somewhere.<p>I have a password manager. My Google password is a long, unique string of random characters that I don&#x27;t use on any other service. If someone <i>does</i> break into my Google account, it will be because they broke into my password manager and&#x2F;or successfully phished me (or hit me on the head with a $5 wrench). Number of retries will have nothing to do with it, unless they have a computer from the future.<p>I am much more concerned about Google locking me out of my account some day in an attempt to stop someone from breaking in, then I am about someone else actually breaking in.')
