It&#x27;s been my daily driver for ~10 years now. But there&#x27;s quite a bit too learn. If I were to try and switch from Windows or Mac today I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d succeed before giving up.<p>But I&#x27;m grateful every day to have a machine that I have some semblance of control over. I use a rolling release distro. I&#x27;m running a recent kernel and haven&#x27;t done a major re-install in 5 years. During that entire time my computing experience has been incredibly stable. No huge UI changes. No forced system updates. Just a reliable tool I can use to get stuff done.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to communicate is, Linux desktop is usable, and it&#x27;s worth pushing over the hump.')
