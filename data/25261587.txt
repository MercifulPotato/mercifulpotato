I.e., every second the gas might produce a megawatt second of energy, but only have the heat capacity to store 1 kilowatt hour. Numbers may not be to scale but you get the idea. I&#x27;m also not sure how this stays stable. I guess that if the gas gets hotter the process breaks down? Maybe the volume expands within the confinement and the reaction rate goes down as a result?')
