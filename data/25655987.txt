For example, Germany does not actually have a single-payer system, but instead a &quot;system&quot; of public and private health insurance companies. As an employee you`re usually in the public system, which can be more expensive for higher-earners because the fees are based on your income (although the health taxes are regressive, capped above like 65K income per year). Self-employed people are often in the private system, and higher income earners can also opt into the private system.<p>The problem is you can´t easily opt back into the public system once you´re out (especially once you´re old), so there are tens of thousands (if not hundreds), that get stuck in the private system without being able to pay the fees because they´ve become poor (possibly because of health reasons), and then they get denied coverage and thus access to medical services.<p>Immigrants can fall through the cracks in the over-complicated system as well.<p>The problem is not as insane as in the US, happens &quot;at the fringes&quot;, but it still affects thousands and is mostly outside of the perception of society, since everybody just assumes they got the best system in the world.')
