Do you have any numbers&#x2F;images on actual burnin in OLED screens. Would be interesting to know how long an OLED screen remains useable when used as a PC monitor.<p>Or to put it another way: Burn in does not seem to be enough of a concern to prevent Samsung&#x2F;etc from puttin OLED screens into phones.<p>&gt; Also the amount of bright colors used in computer interfaces would cause some significant discomfort.<p>The entire point of Apple&#x27;s solution here is that UI&#x27;s max brightness is not the display&#x27;s true max brightness.')
