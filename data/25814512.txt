I think roughly $1-3&#x2F;screen for that size is good.<p>That&#x27;s just unrealistic. Similar LCD screen is also $20: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adafruit.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;358" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adafruit.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;358</a><p>If you negotiate directly with manufacturers, or order direct from china, I&#x27;m certain both of these would be much cheaper, but I&#x27;m talking about US retail prices and how LCD and E-Ink are very similarly priced at this level.<p>&gt; but thatâ€™s not where I would source parts for a project unless they had something truly unique<p>I can link you to other retailers who charge very similar prices. Direct from china is different, and similarly, you can find these e-ink displays for cheaper on aliexpress and similar. That&#x27;s irrelevant to the discussion.<p>$20 is fine for this. We&#x27;re not (as far as I&#x27;m aware) talking about someone making a product to sell in bulk on kickstarter. We&#x27;re talking about buying one to use at home.')
