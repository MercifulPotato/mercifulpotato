It&#x27;s not an antagonistic relationship. It&#x27;s only antagonistic when they decide that &quot;Unlimited&quot; needs some asterisks behind it.<p>The business of selling truly unlimited might not be feasible or viable, but this is more a transparency issue than anything. If you&#x27;re not willing to actually provide unlimited, don&#x27;t say that you are. It&#x27;s that simple.<p>It&#x27;s hard for me to feel sympathetic to Google&#x2F;Amazon for having to store someones 1.8 Petabyte porn collection because that&#x27;s what they sold them. Clearly they&#x27;ve decided that selling unlimited doesn&#x27;t make business sense, and that&#x27;s okay. They&#x27;re probably right!<p>But if you offer a product, you should be delivering that product. Anything less is gross.')
