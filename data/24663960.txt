I made it worse by opening my phone&#x27;s stopwatch and starting a timer. The time was in the format 00:00.00, and I could see the milliseconds creeping by, slowing more and more, until the numbers stopped moving entirely and that&#x27;s the point when I was like &quot;Welp, I made a big mistake here tonight.&quot;<p>Got pretty traumatized from that. You assume linear progression of time to be a given truth of the universe, and when you loop in time or it stops, it&#x27;s as if gravity had been reversed and you can float now. Cracks the fundamental assumptions you had about everything and you are left trying to put the pieces back together afterwards.<p>If drugs always wear off in a finite amount of time -- but the drug has subjectively halted YOUR movement of time, you can now logically be in this state for an eternity&#x2F;infinity. And that&#x27;s when you get chills down your spine and start to panic haha.')
