Before any product is a popular one that prints money it&#x27;s a small one looking for early adopters.<p>When those first adopters are deciding whether or not use the new product, part of that equation is what happens if this doesn&#x27;t catch on?  Should I trust them to jump on board now, wait, or go with someone else?<p>For instance if someone was choosing betwen two similar and new products from Microsoft and Google one factor weighing in Microsoft&#x27;s favor is they will care about support, and an exit plan even if the product doesn&#x27;t take off.')
