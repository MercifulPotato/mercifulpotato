Are they substantially different from your normal grocery store&#x27;s suppliers? For that matter, is your normal grocery store itself different from Costco in some structural way that is meaningful to you? Perhaps you were previously shopping at a coop like San Francisco&#x27;s Rainbow Groceries or New York&#x27;s Park Slope Food Coop?')
