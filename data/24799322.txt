That this need for wide audience social acceptance is so ingrained in humans that no matter the nurturing environment that the kids grow up in, they will still heavily latch onto this as anything worth aspiring for.<p>Obviously they will not all (or even any) attempt to go this route when they grow up, yet I can&#x27;t help wonder if this is closing off some part of their minds to all the other paths in life which wont get them direct public audience appreciation.')
