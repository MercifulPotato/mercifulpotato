Item(by='BoorishBears', descendants=None, kids=[24704629], score=None, time=1601996051, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24695169, text='&gt; That&#x27;s a shame but I&#x27;m not going to worry all that much about it killing people if it&#x27;s still safer than a basic car.<p>This doesn&#x27;t make sense unless you just like senesless death.<p>It can be safer than a basic car and not kill people.<p>Or it can be safer than a basic car and kill people for the sake of marketing.<p>Since like I said, AP should not leave you feeling rested, full attentiveness is required, more than usual. If you&#x27;re operating under the assumption you can relax a little with it active like a co-pilot or watcher, you&#x27;re following for it&#x27;s most dangerous trap.<p>-<p>Also you realize basic cars have been picking up the safety features for a while now right?<p>The Toyota Corolla, the baseline of basic cars, has had LKA for 3 or 4 years now? And will warn a drowsy driver in case of excessive interventions.<p>It&#x27;s sad again, because if anything Tesla is poisoning the well on these features since they&#x27;re lulling people who don&#x27;t even have the cars into a false sense of security.<p>AP marketing makes it seem like it can make a drive more relaxing (with Tesla salespeople using that exact phrasing on a test drive mind you) when the moment it does that, it&#x27;s making you less safe than if it wouldn&#x27;t pretend to be capable of that.<p>Now when other manufacturers intentionally omit continuous lane centering, it seems like an omission of a convenience, not an omission of a dangerously misleading liability to the safety of its users.')
