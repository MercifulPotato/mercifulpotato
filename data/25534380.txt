Lots of people seem to jack up their monitors on a stack of O&#x27;Reilly books or whatever,</i><p>This was based on some (completely bogus) &quot;ergonomics&quot; advice which somehow worked its way into European office furniture standards and various official seeming guides. It is (wrong) conventional wisdom that the middle of the display should be at eye level.<p>If you track down stuff written by anatomy and vision experts, you&#x27;ll find that among static positions it is best (causes least neck and&#x2F;or eye strain) to keep the top edge at approximately eye level, push the display as far away from the head as possible given the desk and general context (it is much easier to focus on something 1 meter away for an extended time than something 20 cm away), and tilt the display so that the bottom is closer than the top, so that a perpendicular ray from the middle of the display is roughly aimed at the face. But keep the head upright and supported directly above the spinal column with the back straight (not tilting the head forward&#x2F;back or resting it on a fixed external support for extended periods of time).<p>This physical arrangement works because human eyes are set up physiologically to easily swivel down and to focus closer and converge with less strain in the bottom part of the field of view than the top part. (Presumably because when we evolved looking down typically involved closer objects than looking straight ahead.) Eyes are great at looking alternately straight ahead or substantially downward without moving or tilting the head.<p>(Personally I appreciate having a second physical display next to the first, though how useful it is depends on the task and software.)')
