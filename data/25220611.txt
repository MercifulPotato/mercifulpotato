I have a few defects that I need to work on that are in the same files. Ideally, one should make a different branch for each defect. However, I’ll have to deal with merge conflicts when I merge to master next week. So, I put multiple defects in the same branch and put tracking information in commit message for example<p>Use break word in result table<p>Since we allow first names to be up to a hundred characters in length, the table should stay within the constraints in its container even with a hundred no space characters\nFor #4007<p>—<p>As you can imagine this isn’t ideal on multiple levels.<p>First, a merge request should only address one concern. That being said, the problem pretty much lies somewhere else.<p>The second follows the first. Assuming the first, we should be able to squash all commits in the feature branch without losing information.<p>I’m sure this is a common problem but I’ve not heard of a good solution to it so far. I’d love to hear what I should do differently.')
