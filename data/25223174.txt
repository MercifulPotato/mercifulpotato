Latency compared to that option is likely the most noteworthy performance gain.<p>My understanding of distributed computing history is that the last time network&gt;local storage happened was in the 80’s, and most of the rest of the history of computing, moving the data physically closer to the point of usage has always been faster.<p>Just as then, we’ve taken a pronounced software architecture detour. This one has lasted much longer, but it can’t really last forever. With this new generation of storage, we’ll probably see a lot of people trotting out 90’s era system designs as if they are new ideas rather than just regression to the mean.<p>Same as it ever was.')
