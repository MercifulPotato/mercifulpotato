We occasionally face DoS attacks. And sometimes, they can get past our various security measures to prevent them.<p>By everyone else having quotas on how often I can call their systems, they protect every other client they have. They protect customers who are using anything <i>other</i> than my website. Otherwise, someone could take down all of AWS by spamming just one system. I want them to throttle me, quota me, because I want to protect other customers if I get compromised.<p>And even if it&#x27;s one internal system calling another, it&#x27;s better to have protection at every layer than to try to only have it on the outer layer.<p>This can burn us, of course. We&#x27;re always growing, and quotas need to be managed (automatically or manually). It all has to be done carefully.<p>Edit: as always, I speak for myself and not for AWS in any official capacity.
