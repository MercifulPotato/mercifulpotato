Irradiated food doesn&#x27;t become radioactive!)<p>Frankly, if labeling was available I would actively seek out irradiated food (specifically bread and fruits). This would be great to reduce food waste due to spoilage and pathogen risks (either from spoilage or otherwise present in the food).<p>I suspect most(if not all) of the &quot;unprocessed&quot; food I eat has not been irradiated.')
