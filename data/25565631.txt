Much better defined than a similar set for software engineers. So for plumbers &quot;execution&quot; is paramount, not - mostly not - the creative side of designing. While software is bigger, more vague and with less clear-cut recipes area.<p>This is less and less true lately - last couple of decades in particular - as more and more software engineers are actual plumbers in this sense. Those don&#x27;t make drainage systems - or, write program - in their spare time - they take photos, sing or enjoy woodworking. Even though their employers seek people who&#x27;d program in spare time.<p>Those who do - there are plenty of those who enjoy programming more than just to make it a profession - can be attributed to first or second group. I think the third group actually has plenty of them as well. They don&#x27;t need to think of technology to be all, end all of one&#x27;s existence - they just enjoy programming, and doing little, or pretty big (this is harder, so has a lesser chance) work pieces for people. But they don&#x27;t necessarily not programming on weekends.')
