We should work on fixing the system so talking to the police is a good thing.<p>Exactly.  Addressing your example, as it&#x27;s a good one: To be blunt, me risking the legal standing or overall safety of my family just to bring your family some closure is not a trade-off I&#x27;m willing to make.  I&#x27;m genuinely sorry because I would absolutely like to help, but the downside risk is too great.<p>I am in an incredibly privileged position in our society, and I&#x27;ve gotten grief at the hands of the police while I was being a &quot;good citizen&quot; and offering information.  Never again.  If they want to know something we will be doing it in full view of the public out on the street or with my lawyer present.')
