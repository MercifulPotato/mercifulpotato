There were far more serious situations all over the world and much more recently. People were serfs, people died in genocide, people were living under totalitarian regimes, people were sent to all kind of &quot;camps&quot;. All this happened in the 20th century and some of it happens even these days yet all we hear about is blacks in the US and their slavery, as if this is the most important issue in the last 200 years. Give me a break, I don&#x27;t want to hear this whinging anymore, slavery ended long time ago and the black in the US live in a far better situation than 80% of the world.')
