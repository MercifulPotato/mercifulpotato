Just look at the guy&#x27;s twitter lately. He was hyping up some &quot;huge&quot; potential SAAS company and stringing people along. You could tell because in the comments you could see people speculating about which SPAC that information was associated with. It caused about 5 SPACs he is associated with to rocket up and then when he finally releases the information it is a smart lock company (latch) and not associated with any of his SPACs...which later sold off.<p>I was on reddit watching this speculation frenzy unfold. These idiots follow this guy&#x27;s words and then spin rumors off of them....then those rumors circulate in this echo chamber until everyone is saying the same thing.<p>Then you have stuff like GME and AMC.
