It&#x27;s because our society was and still is obsessed with it.  It&#x27;d be nice if we could ignore these vague and mostly subjective categories that don&#x27;t even mean much genetically, but we&#x27;d be burying our heads in the sand to think they don&#x27;t matter.  Black Americans have been discriminated against more than white Americans, so those numbers help flag emerging problems.  They&#x27;re also the only way to know how much we&#x27;re reducing racial disparities.')
