Two takeaways:<p>Solar averages ~10W&#x2F;m^2 long term (days&#x2F;weeks) with wild fluctuations. Getting easy reliable output retirees a lot of surface &amp; batteries.<p>When those storage batteries deplete, it’s a hard stop. Recharging takes considerable time, competing for scheduled direct use. Plan on at least doubling panel surface just to recover from outages, and plan on more storage than you expect because long uncooperative weather happens more often, with more consequences, than you expect.<p>Unless you are willing to shut down completely at times, or spend enormous sums, you must have a reliable on-grid source ... which then may as well be your primary.')
