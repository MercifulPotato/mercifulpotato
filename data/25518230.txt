There are tons of these...for example, you cant use your 600mhz A block license within a certain distance of a medical facility that uses any WMTS device. C band already has a ridiculous amount of special conditions, and this is actually the first time I&#x27;ve heard of this one in particular, which is pretty insane considering the risks relative to other special conditions IMO.<p>I do have some capacity to advise stakeholders on upcoming auctions, and my advice so far has been to stay away from C Band, but it&#x27;s pretty ridiculous how little importance they place on technical aspects of certain bands...they just see spectrum and they want it. Hey, don&#x27;t listen to me, I&#x27;m just the guy who is saving you from 8 digit noncompliance fines. :::rant over::')
