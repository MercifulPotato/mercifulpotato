I likely wouldn&#x27;t have done it for the database.<p>The reason I&#x27;ve done this is disk space. Some software is bad at getting rid of things that they&#x27;ve cached (eg Chrome). Theyend up taking more and more and more and more disk space. I don&#x27;t understand why my browser needs to take up 10-20 GB of disk space, if it can&#x27;t even retain 7 months of history.')
