If your typing speed is your bottleneck, you&#x27;re doing something wrong â€” either don&#x27;t use your abstractions the right way and write too much code, or don&#x27;t know your editor macro engine well enough. Probably both.<p>But for writing prose? Yes. Being able to type faster gives you more freedom to test more ideas, get more rough material and then edit it out.')
