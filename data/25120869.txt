It&#x27;s pivotal that a team has some choice in who they are teaming up with in order to align motivations and incentives to achieve. A simplistic incentive is an autonomy based award. If a team completes a project ahead of schedule then they can spend the remainder of the allotted time to work on whatever they please. Sort of make your own 20% time. You can see how hard this is to get right though because if you let the product managers set schedules then they&#x27;ll make the deadlines too short. If only the engineering team sets the schedule and is incentivized to come under schedule then they&#x27;ll consistently over-estimate. Requires trust and balance between the team and the stakeholders.<p>All that said, when you talk to really high-performing teams many of them will say that they value just continuing to get to work with that same set of individuals. It&#x27;s a reward onto itself to get to work with people whom you really enjoy working with.')
