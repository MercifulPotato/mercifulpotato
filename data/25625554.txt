Low and slow heat appears to work. I&#x27;m still trying to find reports of anyone who takes end user styrofoam and turns it back into desired styrofoam shapes with carbon dioxide as a foaming agent, entraining it into the closed cells. I&#x27;ve yet to hear of people who reduce styrofoam into polystyrene being able to turn it back into styrofoam again, but can&#x27;t tell if that is an outcome of the chemistry&#x2F;thermochemistry (very difficult to address), or lack of foaming equipment (addressable with enough expertise, space and capital).<p>Ideally, I&#x27;d like to figure out a way to take all styrofoam entering say a neighborhood as end user packing gets continuously turned into standardized insulation interlocking blocks that is continuously, incrementally installed into buildings that are pre-built with say, 2-4 meter thick wall cavities for incrementally build up the insulation over time. The styrofoam that enters our lives as packing material for a brief period and becomes unwanted detritus ends up in multi-decade and hopefully multi-century building insulation.<p>I want to do the same with the polyethylene used for most bags, though for those I&#x27;d want to turn them into sheets and use them for endlessly making Kaizen foam to organize, protect and store my tooling.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;davehakkens.nl&#x2F;community&#x2F;forums&#x2F;topic&#x2F;has-anyone-tried-polystyrene-d-limonene&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;davehakkens.nl&#x2F;community&#x2F;forums&#x2F;topic&#x2F;has-anyone-tri...</a>')
