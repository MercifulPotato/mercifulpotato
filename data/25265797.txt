I know of two B2B companies that deviate a lot:<p>* Company A has a product that practically sells itself - it has been joked that sellers are &quot;just accepting orders&quot; from prospective clients. At that company the commision rate is just 4% (used to be 8%). Most sellers are fine with that because it&#x27;s easy money.<p>* Company B is not having such an easy time selling their product - at that company the commision rate is a whopping 30%.<p>While it&#x27;s great to have some ballpark figures, you also need to realize that you may need to (or be able to) pay your sellers al lot more&#x2F;less, depending on your specific situation.')
