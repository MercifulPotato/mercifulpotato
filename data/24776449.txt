Once I was reflexively appalled. Now I&#x27;m reflexively sympathetic to the accused until there is evidence. If that makes me a designated racist it&#x27;s a label I&#x27;m much less horrified by than I once was. Almost as an acknowledgement of that dilution a new label has been popularized: white supremacist. So now the same is happening to that label. I wonder what&#x27;s next.')
