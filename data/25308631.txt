Seems like a very obvious fact but somehow doesn&#x27;t really come up.<p>Secondly, in the same vein, the kind of (aspiring) billionaires YC meets are, by definition, builders, because they&#x27;re self-sorted fledging entrepreneurs. Paul somehow uses this as an argument when he should notice that this means he has a bias.<p>Nobody called Zuckerberg or Bezos exploitative when they were coding in dorm rooms and folding boxes on Ikea tables, and that&#x27;s the kind of people Paul thinks off when he thinks of billionaires in his job. But that&#x27;s a different story from the conglomerates they run 20 year later when the majority of their employees are warehouse workers and content moderators with mental issues<p>Reason for not recognizing this is obviously that PG mistakes Silicon valley startup culture for the entire world, which I wouldn&#x27;t have blamed him for 20 years ago, but what is odd is that it seems to have gotten worse even though he moved away from it.')
