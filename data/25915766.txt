It was just interesting to watch for me, out of the corner of my eyes, while doing other stuff on other systems and screens. I did that somewhere between 2005 and 2008, whenever I felt like it :-) With a focus on Germany in general, and my town especially. So I had it mostly zoomed just so that Germany was in view, with small parts of neighbouring countries visible.\nWe didn&#x27;t have that much solar and wind at the times. But sometimes one could see the direction of flow switch. From&#x2F;to France for instance, or Denmark. And I think I&#x27;ve seen that to&#x2F;from Poland and Czech also.<p>Anyway, you could get a feeling for how things were depending on time of year&#x2F;day, weather, and so on. Intuitevely, because presented spatially and realtime.<p>And you don&#x27;t get that spatial intuitiveness from the substitutes with (often delayed) charts &amp; graphs.<p>Which makes it impossible to counter bullshit by politicians or other parties with vested interests when they are saying this and that, and you could have said: <i>Ahem, that is not entirely correct, because there and then it was like so, and not what you say!</i><p>And the loss of that ability is making me angry!<p>edit: Regarding the &#x27;intuitiveness&#x27; of spatial vs. bars &amp; charts. Even when the possibility to filter for im&#x2F;export between countries exists, it does not show over which lines it went. Which could be useful in discussions about extending&#x2F;upgrading lines, or building new ones. It&#x27;s just not there.')
