My viewpoint is similar to yours, and I  have some anecdotal info to support this devil&#x27;s advocate.<p>My wife was able to setup a WordPress site that sold fundraiser raffle tickets for her Rotary Club.  The event was on local TV and handled a spike in traffic – thousands of ticket sales in a few hours –  with no problem.  This whole thing cost her less than $300, which would only get a few hours if she had to hire a dev.<p>I kept on telling her I was on standby and could help out, but she didn&#x27;t need it once.  She built the entire thing with WYSIWYG and WordPress plugins.<p>No-one is saying you build your tech startup with no-code WYSIWYG. But imagine if my wife&#x27;s no-code skills (in her place, WordPress) became as common place as knowing Microsoft Office.')
