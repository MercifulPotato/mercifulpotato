Provenance of monies can be a big question, and an important one, when dealing with people who spend their time in financial crime. If financial institutions could use a technology that is similar to PGP that maintains an identity without needing to reveal <i>who</i> you are, to me this is <i>privacy</i>. There&#x27;s obvious exceptions to that, but generally I think it&#x27;s a good idea given that one of the major ways merchandisers collect data on you is via transactions.')
