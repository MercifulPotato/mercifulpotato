At all.<p>Try to use breakpoints for a bit and it quickly gets so tangled you have to close everything and start over to untangle it. Tangled how? Disabling a breakpoint and refreshing restores the breakpoint. Often there are ghost breakpoints remaining that you can&#x27;t disable at all. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever gotten DOM breakpoints to work in FF, never had issues in Chrome. I can&#x27;t even dream about using logpoints or similar.<p>Just today I was helping a coworker debug an issue using DevTools. We enabled break on exception and refreshed. Nothing happens. The console still shows the exception on every refresh. We click around and realize the Sources tab doesn&#x27;t load anything. Again closing everything and reopening fixes the issue, but I hate to always have to suspect the DevTools first when debugging.<p>Another thing, which obviously isn&#x27;t Firefox&#x27;s fault, is that websites are optimized and built for Chrome, so you often get a degraded experience, if they work at all.<p>Regardless, I don&#x27;t see myself ever going back to Chrome.')
