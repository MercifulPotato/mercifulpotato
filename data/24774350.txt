At the end of summer I measured at 26mcg&#x2F;l, which is  barely above the &quot;deficient&quot; threshold of 20mcg&#x2F;l and still well below the often recommended target of 50mcg&#x2F;l. So I doubt that &quot;face and hands alone&quot; will give you &quot;sufficient vitamin D for the whole year&quot;. Note that I was also taking 2000 IU per day in winter&#x2F;spring, which I stopped taking in summer. Now after the bloodtest I&#x27;ve resumed the supplement for fall and upped it to 4000 IU + added Vitamin K2.')
