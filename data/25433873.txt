Item(by='gecko', descendants=None, kids=[25436078], score=None, time=1608059799, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25433196, text='The SNES, unlike e.g. the Genesis, had a <i>really</i> heavy history of using add-on chips on carts.  In fact, its entire architecture was very specifically designed to permit and encourage this, which is why e.g. the Genesis 32X had to intercept the video out port on the Genesis, but Super Nintendo carts could just bolt-on a SuperFX&#x2F;Cx3&#x2F;SA-1&#x2F;what-have-you and go about their merry way.  (Even the the unreleased Nintendo PlayStation would have been able to directly interface with the existing hardware, not do the 32X route of video interception.)<p>Where you may be making a valid point is that I don&#x27;t know how many people outside the dev scene know how common cart-based extra CPUs were. But doing this feels entirely in the spirit of how development on the SNES actually worked, even at the time--and as someone who&#x27;s done some SNES development work, I knew from the headline alone roughly how it would necessarily be implemented.  The closest analog I can think of would be like seeing a blog post, &quot;calling native Win32 from pure JavaScript,&quot; and then being disappointed that ffi was involved. That&#x27;s literally the only way it could possibly work in the first place, so <i>of course</i> that&#x27;s what it is going to have to be about.')
