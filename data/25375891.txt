I have done it and benefited from it myself multiple times. Some existing residents might complain about jobs going missing, others might invoke the benefits of diversity to the economy. Neither argument is right nor wrong, and all are based around personal perceptions of economics and national interest, with which economics correlate. National interest has multiple facets. One is the real ability of a country to exact influence over others, another is the wishes of its citizens and government.<p>I am not sure whether you are claiming that this exists, but having visited and lived in multiple places in the EU (including outside of the UK), I never felt that people had a sense of an EU-wide brotherhood. People are generally quite worried about that sort of thing for obvious reasons, and culture varies sufficiently over the EU to make such a thing difficult. When discussing the influence of people&#x27;s morals over their arguments over national interests, you also have to consider the context of people&#x27;s morals: which agents impose them (either explicitly or implicitly) and the motives behind their imposition. I don&#x27;t mean to use the word &quot;agent&quot; in a necessarily negative tone. An agent could just be your mum. However, when you look at more powerful agents than your mum, such as the education system, Instafacetwit, newspapers and the law, people&#x27;s morals start to gain a greener hue (in dollars).<p>Also I fully agree that a subset of players in the environment might all come out in the money.')
