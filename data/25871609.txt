Perhaps you can add a version of the image with a big red circle around each artifact, or arrows. (Keep the original image, because when someone has seen the problem it&#x27;s nice to see the original photo.)<p>I hope that someone that is an expert can give a better answer, but my guess is that the sensor of the camera is slightly broken and you will have to buy a new phone soon.')
