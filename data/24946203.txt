So much of the sniping around codes of conduct is so filled with enmity and nobody seems to ever want to back down, even when they seem to have been clearly in the wrong or overreacting.<p>Personally I have no interest in this whole conference circuit. The knives are out; people who leverage these situations are just nasty, nasty, nasty, and often totally shameless. I don’t need that in my life, and whatever meager recognition would come from giving talks at conferences is unbelievably not worth it. Not even close.')
