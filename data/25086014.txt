If we remove all the moral components of mass starvation due to idealistic utopianism, the central tenet of communism is materialism and consequently that all human ingenuity reduces to computation.  This means that we should in theory be able to replace human capitalists with a giant computer.<p>But, if materialism is wrong, and humans have a trans-computational reasoning ability, then this means even at a theoretical level communism is fatally flawed, because the economy is intrinsically reliant upon human ingenuity and thus must be capitalistic, because the economy rides upon the locus of the individual human mind which can never, not even in theory, be replaced by a computer.<p>In a certain sense, the amoral repudiation of communism is even more powerful, because even the cold blooded bureaucratic bean counters behind the revolution can no longer even appeal to clear minded rationalism to justify their political philosophy.<p>It is not a coincidence that Marx envisioned a mechanical singularity as the apex of the inevitable communist revolution.  Also may explain the strong communist and materialist leanings in the elite of the tech sector, along with the collaboration between the tech elite and the CCP.')
