The hypothetical example being a fence in the middle of nowhere - seemingly useless, but you should really make sure before pulling it up as it may be serving a vital function to somebody else (or the system at large).<p>The point being, we&#x27;re stumbling into an scenario where we&#x27;ve killed off the majority of animals in a major ecological category, which is likely to destabilise the environment in both known and unknown ways.
