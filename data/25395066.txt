That should be an axiomatic fact, yet nobody seems to understand it.<p>Oh everyone understands it, but there&#x27;s a trade-off you&#x27;re not acknowledging:<p>1. Letting these people stay on twitter, YouTube, or reddit gives them an audience to <i>recruit</i>.  The people in these toxic groups then may be less radical on average, <i>but there will be more of them overall</i>.<p>There also will still be highly radicalized members, and the sympathy of the less radical gives them support that could allow them to do more damage.<p>2. Quarantining them to Gab or Parler or whatever denies them the recruiting opportunities.  The dead-enders who migrate will become more radicalized, but their numbers will be smaller, and perhaps decline over time, due the the lack of new blood.')
