In both of those all method calls are messages, which are even more abstract than virtual functions but a lot more useful.<p>Java simplified things for performance but ended up with a much weaker and less expressive system, and probably didn&#x27;t go hard enough for static performance either. Still, it&#x27;s less of a performance issue than the lack of value types.')
