I hear what you&#x27;ve said. I agree that Go was built with limited capability in order to make it easy for junior developer. And I agree it can slow down more senior developers at times. Although not nearly as much as I expected when I first started using it.<p>I don&#x27;t know Pandoc so I&#x27;ll take your word for it. I&#x27;ll also agree that there are entire of classes that Go isn&#x27;t sell suited for, but we&#x27;ll have to disagree as to whether it&#x27;s limiting for the types of applications it was created for. I must not be building the same class of application as you are.')
