It is possible that Apple has decided that 640 KB is enough for everyone â€” that performance level of a tablet is what most common people need from a computer.</i><p>Perhaps you haven&#x27;t been paying attention but this is Apple&#x27;s third processor transition: 68K to PowerPC to Intel to ARM. Each time was to push the envelope of performance and to have a roadmap that wouldn&#x27;t limit them in the future.<p>When the first PowerPC-based Macs shipped, they were so fast compared to what was available at the time, they couldn&#x27;t be exported to North Korea, China or Iran; they were classified as a type of weapon [1].<p>The fact the PowerMac G4 was <i>too fast</i> to export at the time was even part of Apple&#x27;s advertising in the 90s [2].<p>It&#x27;s always been part of Apple&#x27;s DNA to stay on the leading edge, especially with performance.<p>Apple&#x27;s strategy has never been to settle for <i>good enough</i>. If that were the case, they wouldn&#x27;t have spent the last 10+ years designing their own processors and ASICs. Dell, HP, Acer, etc. just put commodity parts in a case and ship lowest-commodity hardware. It shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise that the M1 MacBook Air blows these guys out of the water.<p>Anyone paying attention saw this coming a mile away.<p>I have a quad-core 3.4 GHz Intel iMac and it&#x27;s pretty clear the MacBook Pro with the M1 is going to be noticeably faster for some, if not all, of the common things I do as a web developer.<p>We know the M2 and the M3 are in development; I suspect 2021 will really be the year of shock and awe when the desktops start shipping.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2002&#x2F;01&#x2F;thats-a-whole-lot-of-power-mac&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2002&#x2F;01&#x2F;thats-a-whole-lot-of-power-mac...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=lb7EhYy-2RE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=lb7EhYy-2RE</a>')
