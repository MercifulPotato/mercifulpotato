Never mind that the speculative construction market has been churning out tiny condo equivalents.<p>I lived in _much_ denser cities with their own speculative real estate market, but the developers haven&#x27;t resorted to &quot;optimizing&quot; units as aggressively as the micro-condos I&#x27;ve seen in Toronto. The one bedrooms &#x2F; studios are about as large as apartments in Beijing &#x2F; Shanghai. But 2-3 bedrooms new constructions feel dramatically smaller. Being Canada, these units will negatively impact generations.')
