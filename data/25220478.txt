It&#x27;s a hard sell given you are only allowed to use App Store apps. So much software I want to use (e.g. most free software apps, the Steam back-catalogue, many older Windows apps) is not available on iOS and never will be. Also, of course, you aren&#x27;t allowed to do software development on an iOS device.<p>Maybe the new generation that&#x27;s only known life inside the walled garden will be able to live within its constraints, even if they&#x27;ll be impoverished in some ways. I think that&#x27;s what Apple&#x27;s counting on. I hope they don&#x27;t succeed.')
