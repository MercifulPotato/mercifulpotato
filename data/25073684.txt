Second job (moved country) startup in the field I like, where I had (disproportionate) impact, but the arcane work culture and CTOs lack of technical understanding and direction, general sense of not learning anything made me quit. Third company, promising start up, good coworkers, learn new things daily but unachievable goal setting and high stress, \nuncooperative company culture,  long hours and emotionally too invested.<p>I don&#x27;t know what makes a job satisfactory but having good coworkers, being useful, &quot;learning&quot; at work, flexibility, seems to not be enough.')
