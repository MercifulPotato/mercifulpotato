Item(by='Aachen', descendants=None, kids=[24875993], score=None, time=1603497881, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24875133, text='&gt; making half of European continent uninhabitable<p>In what remotely plausible scenario would that have happened? Feel free to involve the USSR, reactor safety of the time, etc.<p>Because from what I know, the fallout was definitely not making anything nearly that large &quot;uninhabitable&quot;. Deaths would go up, but so did they from the coal plants that were subsequently built (we&#x27;re at 3 million deaths a year, if memory serves; that&#x27;s the number you have to beat to make nuclear less attractive than coal from a more sciency perspective than &quot;what maybe could have happened but didn&#x27;t, ha-haa!&quot;).')
