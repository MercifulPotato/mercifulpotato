If it takes them 3 years to scale up, does it now mean all the vendors are locked in for that period. If a vendor starts failing quality checks will they still take 3 years to disintegrate them? If not then why would violation of their own labor standards take 3 years to remove them?<p>FWIW, except forced labor, I am against child labor standards since it usurps the wisdom of the parents without providing for that child. No parent no matter how poor wants their child to work unless they cannot afford to feed them. The alternative to working in a apple supplier factory might be working in a more hazardous factory or construction site.')
