This maintains my awareness of the fact that I&#x27;m a terrible judge of veracity of arguments. Since I want to know what happens in the world, I must be exposed to arguments, so I think it&#x27;s very important to be viscerally aware that I&#x27;m an idiot and should use a lot of care.<p>As for why I want to know what happens in the world and particularly where I live (i.e. North America), it is because those events affect me. If I were on an information diet, then I would probably miss, for example, the recent passing of S.386 [0] by the US Senate, which is intimately relevant to me as my long-term goal is to immigrate to the US.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.congress.gov&#x2F;bill&#x2F;116th-congress&#x2F;senate-bill&#x2F;386&#x2F;all-info" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.congress.gov&#x2F;bill&#x2F;116th-congress&#x2F;senate-bill&#x2F;386...</a>')
