Ask any Amazon engineer and they&#x27;ll tell you the same thing: do not ever work with Fragomen.<p>I personally had to talk to my manager and hire my own lawyer instead of working with Fragomen after countless delays and mistakes. They don&#x27;t care about you or your case at all and the paralegals are outright incompetent. You don&#x27;t really get to talk to the lawyer a lot anyway.<p>I&#x27;d go with a local smaller firm if I were you. If you&#x27;re in Seattle area, I can recommend &quot;MacDonald Hoague &amp; Bayless&quot;. I personally worked with &quot;Lola Zakharova&quot; and she was amazing.')
