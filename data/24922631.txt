The toolkit and Android Studio run horribly slow - like really slow. And the output is basically this generation&#x27;s flash. Some of the samples I tried on their gallery are mediocre. Very slight, but noticeable sluggishness. Some are just terrible; the 2d transformations moves at like 7fps. Plus there are so many other small things like issues with scrollbars, things that take time to sort out that native and web have had time to figure out. Also dart is a real PITA coming from typescripts which is basically c#.<p>Actually, the issue with dart is it&#x27;s own whole thing. It was meant to be an alternative to js, but not ts has taken over with much greater success. I am not talking about aot or stuff like that - just the dev experience for app dev. Now it&#x27;s in this really weird spot.<p>I just don&#x27;t know. I would honestly have thought that flutter is dead in the water - every personal experience I&#x27;ve had with it has been bad, there are objective facts about it that are bad, and yet so many people love it.')
