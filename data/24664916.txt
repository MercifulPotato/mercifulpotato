Expanding that list to the top 10 companies, P&amp;G and Visa are kind of representative of the economy, but they are highly consumer focused.<p>Leaving Berkshire Hathaway as the sole stock in the top 10 that is representative of the American economy as a whole by virtue of doing business in such a diverse collection of markets and owning many small, private businesses.<p>Another problem with the S&amp;P500 is that it is capitalization-weighted.  So even if it contains a diverse set of companies, technology stocks are over-represented because of how well they scale.  Walmart has to do a hell of a lot more work per dollar of profits than Apple does.')
