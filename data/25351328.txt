Jones says the agents pointed a gun at her and at her children.<p>It&#x27;s hard to convince me that we&#x27;re the &quot;good guys&quot; when we&#x27;re pointing guns at children because their mother spoke out against the official government position.<p>I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll get off without a conviction after draining her life&#x27;s savings to defend herself.  Hopefully it launches her career, if there&#x27;s still a democracy left.  At least they didn&#x27;t execute her.')
