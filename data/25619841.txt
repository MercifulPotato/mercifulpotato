For an article that purports to describe the year of the virus, this is a huge gap.<p>I think the biggest mistake of this whole pandemic was none of the things listed, it was banning all vaccines for almost a full year. The FDA was granted far reaching powers by congress multiple times to ensure they can approve vaccines quickly in a pandemic. The FDA instead forced. So as badly as Trump handled the pandemic (and he did handle it badly), at least he wanted a fast vaccine. You might blame the first 100k deaths on the disease, but everything after that is due to the ban on the vaccine.<p>Now, as the vaccines are distributed they are requiring them to go through an ineffective CDC, who is holding back 50% of the vaccines, to the states who aren&#x27;t able to distribute more than 30% of what they get yet.<p>The FDA, CDC, and states  need to just stop banning people from getting a vaccine. Let private industry help.<p>Should Trump have proposed legislation to fix this? Yes, but so should Democrats and Republicans. Our beaucracies failed, both parties failed. Even Biden is coming in with goals like &quot;vaccinate 100M in the first 100 days.&quot; What a low bar, since we have already bought 200M doses for delivery by the end of Q1 (70ish days into his term). So Biden&#x27;s goal seems to be &quot;not approve any more vaccines and try not to lose most of the vaccines we have.&quot; His goal should be vaccines for everyone that wants it within 60 days. That is achievable with existing supply+ Astrazeneca and if J&amp;J looks good too then that makes it a slam dunk, unless the government gets in the way again.')
