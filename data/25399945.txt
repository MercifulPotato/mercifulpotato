The term is often meant negatively; in this case it might be a positive feature. Reminding people that they&#x27;re on HN, where I think most expect a higher standard than on Twitter or reddit, might make them try to be better. I&#x27;m not saying we <i>are</i> composed of some elite, just observing that it&#x27;s often perceived that way and that we can actually try to use that notion in a good way, to improve the conversation.')
