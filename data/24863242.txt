Do your own research or simply skip the part of my comment if you think its wrong.<p>And to all the people commenting below. It doesn&#x27;t even matter if EVs are better. Even if they have half the emission to a normal car. Reusing a existing car is almost certainly still better. Also no one really know what the lifespan of any modern car is. If you assume cars follow the trend of anything else then EVs will probably be obsolete after 5 years by the time we have 50% EVs on the road. Building a car EV or not that last 10, 15 even 20 years outperforms in emission. Also my main point was that humanity should reduce cars that aren&#x27;t moving that would reduce pointless emission.')
