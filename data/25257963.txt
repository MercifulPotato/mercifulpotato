Item(by='Diederich', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606765117, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25257807, text='Thanks for these, I was aware after researching (for years!) places where we&#x27;d want our &#x27;forever home&#x27;.<p>Above, I specifically called out something you can&#x27;t generally build for, which is flooding.  Flooding comes either from water running down hill or from below, due to rising bodies of water.  Our house is at the top of a very shallow rise&#x2F;&#x27;hill&#x27;, so we don&#x27;t have to worry about the former.  That we&#x27;re more than 100 feet above any relevant body of water protects us from the latter.<p>The other items are generally about high winds, and this house is pretty much proof against that.  It was <i>massively</i> over-built.<p>The only thing it could not withstand is a direct hit from a powerful tornado.')
