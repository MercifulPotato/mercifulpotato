COVID-like events definitely are.<p>2009 Swine Flu, predicted to be hugely deadly, WHO changed the definition of pandemic so they could declare it one. Ended up being a non-event (nb: numbers are not comparable as there was no mass testing programme like today).<p>In many countries excess deaths are no different to previous years. For instance in Switzerland cumulative death in 2020 is by now the same as long term expectation. Fewer people died at the start of the year than average, then it went above average during COVID, then it came back to the long term average slowly over the summer. COVID is nothing more than a seasonal flu, here. In Germany it&#x27;s not even that. Excess death for 2020 is smooth and flat, compared to 2018 where it saw bigger spikes. Also Swine-Flu like.<p>Even in the UK, which has largely shut down its health care system and imposed draconian lockdowns, excess deaths matched 1999&#x2F;2000 which were not notable years. Nobody noticed any unusual levels of death back then.<p>This is why there have been so many people criticising lockdowns so strongly, for such a long time, and now people are paying attention because SCIENTISTS! but you could look at the government sourced data in perspective back in April or May, to understand that the reaction was not proportionate to the threat.')
