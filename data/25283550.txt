You however are the son of a plumber, and have no choice but to be a plumber.<p>Many people end up doing something similar to their parents.  Maybe you won&#x27;t be a plumber if your dads is one, but it&#x27;s far more likely you&#x27;d be a blue-collar tradesman than a doctor.  It&#x27;s also far more likely that a doctor&#x27;s one will become a doctor or a lawyer than an electrician.<p>Also, IMHO, this idea that the path to satisfaction by pursuing some kind of dream profession is a fairy tale.')
