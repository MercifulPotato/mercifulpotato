I myself am a happy user of Google services, except for one incident [1] a few years ago when I was locked out of my account for 20 days. I was able to recover it because I finally remembered my linked yahoo email&#x27;s password; I had forgotten that, and never bothered to save it in password manager, because I hadn&#x27;t used it for many years.<p>For the record, I was also blocked out of GitLab for 7 days [2] for no apparent reason. This was resolved after a few days of follow-up with their support folks. Upon account recovery, the reason given was that my account was accidentally caught by their spam filters.<p>Back on topic: Changing the title from &quot;Google&quot; to &quot;Third Party Auth&quot; significantly softens the impact and urgency I want the reader to feel upon reading the title, and the short article that follows.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;mail&#x2F;forum&#x2F;AAAAK7un8RUAzmxJAkP8gU&#x2F;?hl=en&amp;gpf=%23!topic%2Fgmail%2FAzmxJAkP8gU%3Bcontext-place%3Dtopicsearchin%2Fgmail%2Fgurjeet" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;mail&#x2F;forum&#x2F;AAAAK7un8RUAzmxJAkP8gU...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.gitlab.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;gitlab-com-account-blocked-need-help&#x2F;38789" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.gitlab.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;gitlab-com-account-blocked-need-h...</a><p>- OP')
