That is a process that goes on in DC and ultimately just a few (perhaps one) civilians control the database, who is in it, and their &quot;disposition&quot;.<p>There were a few claims that as a court they could not rule on and dismissed (like whether he was a proper target on the battlefield), but a few big questions remain. Is there due process around the kill&#x2F;capture database, and does it violate free speech and press if someone can land in it for interviewing enemy soldiers?<p>These questions (which might not even have difficult answers) remain open because the government wouldn&#x27;t turn over evidence.<p>Even with the parts about &quot;targeting decisions in a warzone&quot; and the like settled, the open issues here are pretty important.')
