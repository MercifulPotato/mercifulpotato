Abortion has no impact on other beings with rights (as we do not assigned rights to a fetus). If you decided to irradiate yourself like the firefighters in Chernobyl and then in the few days you had remaining to live try to be around people you disliked, it would be totally reasonable to force you to be confined to a medical space where you couldn&#x27;t kill others. However, a communicable disease is even worse. I would be fine with people who understood the risks of radiation making the choice to be around you because they would be basically only choosing to take that radiation&#x2F;cancer risk on themselves (their body, their choice). But with a communicable disease, they can catch the disease and spread it to others who don&#x27;t consent. That is where the &quot;my body, my choice&quot; is no longer valid.')
