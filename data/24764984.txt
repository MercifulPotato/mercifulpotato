But you could always use a reputable CDN site, use a checksum for security, and if there is downtime issues, quickly revert and fix the issues on your end. CDN&#x27;s are nice because it reduces the time to develop. I build a lot of startup apps and resort to CDN&#x27;s, but if I were building a secure enterprise app this story would be different<p>On another note of using CDN&#x27;s, Deno is of interest. It&#x27;s gaining popularity because it&#x27;s using CDN&#x27;s as part of it&#x27;s pipeline dependency process. You don&#x27;t have to waste a huge amount of time installing dependencies and node packages that you don&#x27;t care for, just import and your done')
