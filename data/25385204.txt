When their monopoly is complete there&#x27;d be no way to tell if speech truly is or isn&#x27;t free.<p>And of course there&#x27;s no way to tell if your posts are unpopular because of some well intentioned algorithm, or a more malicious algorithm. At the very least Facebook&#x27;s incentives don&#x27;t align with the rest of society.')
