And for those people the standard stimulants used to treat ADHD also help with their other symptoms.<p>I have ADHD, but never any depression.  (But I have friends with those combinations.)<p>Your reaction to Ritalin matches mine to caffeine or dexamphetamine: the dose I get jittery at is lower than the dose were I see positive effects.  Luckily, Ritalin&#x2F;methylphenidate works fairly well for me with rather manageable side-effects.<p>By the way, I bet you have other options!:<p>Caffeine is universally available.  But has a bad side effect profile.<p>You can get adrafinil over-the-counter, which is a chemical precursor to modafinil.  See eg <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gwern.net&#x2F;Modafinil" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gwern.net&#x2F;Modafinil</a><p>Nicotine is a wonder drug, too.  Nicotine patches are available over-the-counter.  See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gwern.net&#x2F;Nicotine" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gwern.net&#x2F;Nicotine</a>  (Please don&#x27;t confuse nicotine with smoking.  Smoking is still bad for you.)<p>I am taking methylphenidate, but for long term effects, I am actually seriously considering switching to nicotine patches:<p>Nicotine protects your brain against parkinson&#x27;s, which runs in my family.<p>But in any case, from what you describe, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily sound like your depression is linked to something that stimulants can help with in the first place?')
