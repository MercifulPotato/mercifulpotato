Item(by='VBprogrammer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601979914, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24695679, text='&gt; Same reason why a lot of stealth IT gets implemented.<p>Honestly, I miss the days of writing VBA macros which save hours of work a week and being sneered at by the &#x27;official IT&#x27;.<p>I worked in a team in a large commercial bank handling reconciliations with various funds. Some of which had to be contacted by phone to confirm the current holdings. We had a system which would import our current positions and take imports in various formats from funds. Somewhere around 40% of the differences where due to trades which had been executed over the reconciliation date. I wrote a VBA script which pulled in all of the differences and identified trades which where open over the period and automatically closed the discrepancy with a reference to the trade IDs.<p>Another time I wrote a VBA script which would take a case ID and look it up in a diary system (at the time the only way I found to do this was to use the Win32 APIs and manually parse the fields in the HTML from the system), it would then enter this at the top of a spreadsheet which had to be completed. People liked it so much I had to rewrite it so that it would work on a list of case IDs and automatically print out the checklist.<p>Much more fun than figuring out why Kubernetes is doing something weird for the 3rd time this week.')
