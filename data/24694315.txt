What is the structure? Do all Model 3s qualify or are they too expensive? How are other existing models impacted - are new entrants responsible for the growth? How would the Model 3 have sold if Q2 were not impacted by Fremont shut down?<p>There&#x27;s a genuinely interesting article that could be written about it. I didn&#x27;t expect much when I scrolled down to their Electrek&#x27;s take section but what&#x27;s there is poor even by their standards. It&#x27;s because of Gigafactory Berlin? Really?<p>The sad truth is that there are three stories that are easy to write and generate the vast majority of clicks in the EV space. &quot;Tesla&#x27;s record sales&quot;, &quot;Tesla fucks up xyz&quot; and &quot;Future Tesla plans&quot;. Why write about anything in depth when you can knock out one of those in an hour or two.<p>Even on HN, the entire ID.3 launch got about as much attention as this story has here. When personally I believe it&#x27;ll go down in history as having comparable significance to the Model 3.<p>Finding decent in depth BEV news stories is so hard I almost want to bite the bullet and start doing it myself. It&#x27;s one of the most interesting technical transitions in our lifetime, like living through the Mainframe -&gt; Desktop era. I&#x27;ve been glued to the news since the Roadster.<p>Yet almost everything written about it is braindead spam written by unashamed Tesla supporters with their thumbs on the scale and bizarre Tesla haters who seem to genuinely believe they&#x27;ve found the next Theranos.')
