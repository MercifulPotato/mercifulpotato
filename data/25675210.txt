He&#x27;s not some random lawyer. He&#x27;s got a distinguished career and has earned my respect.<p>&gt; Also, by the way, from the actual call, it appears that Trump is committing a crime on the call, by attempting to get a government official to break the law<p>I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ve listened to the full call. It&#x27;s an hour long and I have. If you had, you would have noted Georgia officials said there was no issue with ballots of dead people cast (they said this was legal) and the context of the 4 minute clip is totally wrong.')
