Bing gives me a knowledge box that says &quot;Average Mortgage Rates Today&quot; and lists a table with 30-year fixed, 15-year fixed, 5&#x2F;1 ARM and an average rate for each.<p>That would be a good result but despite the title the rates are from 2018.<p>Google gives me bankrate.com in the #1 paid and the #1 organic position. This seems like a superior result.<p>In general I think it is hard to judge search quality from a query like this which is incredibly lucrative for search engines. There&#x27;s an adversarial process between quality, SEO, and advertisers.')
