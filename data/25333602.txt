But as I commented elsewhere, the building blocks we have now would boggle the mind of a developer in 1990.<p>We have complete game engines, with scripting languages included, physics, advanced graphics and a myriad of things I don&#x27;t even know, that you can actually use for free now.<p>We have maps that cover the world, with distance estimations, navigation instructions, street views of every street, etc., that a 12 year old can integrate on their website.<p>A developer in 1990 would be very productive today, yes. But that&#x27;s because of everything that has been build in these 30 years. With the tools he had in 1990, his output would be meager by modern standards.')
