That&#x27;s not history, that&#x27;s religion. It is religion that demands absolute obedience and absolute acceptance.<p>Everything from George Washington to the dropping of nukes to even the native genocides are allowed to be debated and even questioned. Why is the holocaust the sole exception? Especially considering it isn&#x27;t even part of american history and last I checked facebook is an american company.<p>If russia, china, north korea, saudi arabia, etc all said or forced their social media companies to remove content denying, criticizing or disputing X, we&#x27;d call that censorship. And yet, here we are, the top comment is praising this censorship.')
