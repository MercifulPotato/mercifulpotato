In the end they turned out to be no different than the wildtype, and greate distribution was simply because those strains were present in populations that caused more spreading.<p>There is not enough data right now to be sure whether this new strain is more infectious or not, but from what I read there are a few more reasons to be concerned this time compared to the previous times when mutated strains were reported.')
