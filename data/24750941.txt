Maybe. But what&#x27;s the alternative? Usually killing the people in power results in power vaccum which destabilises the country and makes the beast go nuclear where there is always more potential for harm, an example of this is Libya.<p>Invading country isn&#x27;t seen as good thing to do and installing your favourable party in power is also not seen favourably.<p>Are there other options? I&#x27;d like to know as well.')
