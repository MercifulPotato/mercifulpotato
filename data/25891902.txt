Comparing a crap office to remote (where it&#x27;s largely as good or as bad as your decide) isn&#x27;t really fair. I&#x27;ve previously always worked in lovely offices, with lots of light and quiet spaces, at places where adhoc working from home was common and acceptable (even if we were still office first). Compared to that remote working sucks for me, particularly for the reasons the OP shared.')
