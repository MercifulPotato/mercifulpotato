Item(by='ttcbj', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606317399, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25207126, text='I haven&#x27;t paid much attention to GPT-3, and this is an interesting point (that is picks up the tone of forums).<p>Although the original article is interesting, I think it would be more interesting to try to systematically vary the original prompt, and then see how much the tone and utility of the response depends on the prompt itself.  It is forums, or is it the prompt, or some of both?<p>It did seem to me like the response was flirting with something interesting but not quite getting there.  I thought it would have been interesting if the response had echoed the original book by having the parent eventually grow old and sick, and the child mature and have children of his own who begin asking similar questions, and come to understand the question not as understanding the universe, but as understanding the people in his own life.  In my view, that would have been an interesting nod to Adams with a bit more poignant and actionable outcome.  In the final section, I thought it was going to go there, and when it did not, I was quite disappointed.')
