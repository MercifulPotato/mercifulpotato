Ideology masquerading as entertainment.<p>Sorry I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re trying to say.<p>Are you saying that Americans should lose more in film directed at Americans? It&#x27;s not that it doesn&#x27;t happen. It&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s hard to do. An example that immediately came to mind is the ironically named (for this conversation) show, &quot;The Americans&quot;, where the Russians definitely win more than they lose. From Wikipedia:<p>&quot;The series&#x27;s final season earned Rhys the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, while Weisberg and co-lead writer Joel Fields won Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series; it was also awarded the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series â€“ Drama. Additionally, Margo Martindale won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series twice for her performance in the third and fourth seasons. It also became one of the rare drama shows to receive two Peabody Awards during its run.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s easily my favorite show.<p>Looping back to Queens Gambit, I think the basic idea is that it&#x27;s juuuust unrealistic enough without being too unreasonable to take you out of it. It&#x27;s not unrealistic that Americans can be the best at chess. Hell, an American faced Magnus last world championship for the title and is still world #2. It&#x27;s also not unrealistic that a Woman could get there as well. Hou Yifan is 84th right now.<p>But the combination is just unrealistic enough without taking you out of it, which makes it very entertaining.<p>A documentary about an orphan Russian or Chinese guy who ascends to the top? Might be more realistic, but not a good enough story for a Netflix #1 level of entertainment to a US audience.')
