Yes, agree, but this just depends on your opinion of what is &quot;correct&quot;. Nature selects for survival, not correctness. I think rigid hierarchy is more advantageous for overall survival, but I am not advocating for that. I think there is something significant about the fact that humans almost always tend towards hierarchy (Lord of the Flies illustrates this).<p>2.
