Personally, I&#x27;ve done terrible at stocks and wonderful at crypto, so i disagree due to experiential knowledge.<p>If you are comparing crypto to USD savings, it is quite obvious from a 10 year chart which one is irrational. Even if you completely write off the growth of crypto entirely, it is quite easy to beat negative value growth.')
