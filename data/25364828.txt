I got a digital wristwatch to help with time blindness associated with my ADHD. It beeps every hour, and it has vibration alarms for appointments, timers, alarms, etc... I very purposefully did not get a smartwatch, because a simple watch that I can wear everywhere, that I never forget to charge, that will never develop a glitch or need to be updated, with an interface that is hyper-focused and does exactly what I need without distractions -- that&#x27;s a superior product for me. And the fact that it was only $35 is a bonus, but it would still be a superior product even if it was $200. The cost isn&#x27;t the reason it&#x27;s superior.<p>So I do get what you&#x27;re saying, and you&#x27;re kind of right, but there&#x27;s absurdity here in both directions. A superior product is not necessarily just one that has a bunch of features crammed into it -- it&#x27;s one that solves a lot of problems without introducing new problems. If you stick text notifications into my microwave, or a charging port onto my shoes, you haven&#x27;t actually improved those products.<p>There&#x27;s a little bit of irony in having this discussion about a company like Apple, which was lauded for a long time for building interfaces that were purposeful and simple. It was the Android crew ran around talking about how iPhone was behind the curve because it couldn&#x27;t do multitasking or set up FTP servers, while Apple confidently asserted that building a good, focused device was better than trying to do literally everything everywhere.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is that making a product more powerful or capable is orthogonal to making it superior&#x2F;inferior, and trying to equate the two concepts in either direction can lead you to absurd conclusions. Of course, for many people, the Pebble watch would not be powerful enough; they want&#x2F;need the extra features in the Apple Watch, just like many people wanted&#x2F;needed the extra multitasking features in early Android devices. But for people who don&#x27;t need those features, the Pebble was a superior product because it did its job better and didn&#x27;t introduce distractions or compromises to accommodate unnecessary features.<p>It&#x27;s good that powerful smartwatches exist, but it&#x27;s unfortunate that there&#x27;s now an unsatisfied niche of people who are left wanting a more elegant, purposefully designed device that costs less money. At least (thankfully for me) the Apple Watch didn&#x27;t mean the end of good old-fashioned Casio and Timex watches, because for all of its power, the Apple Watch isn&#x27;t capable of helping me with my ADHD. It&#x27;s too complicated and has too many significant tradeoffs to be even useable as a daily driver the way I want to use it, regardless of how much it costs.')
