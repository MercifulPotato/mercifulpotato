Once the pandemic set in, some Discord groups popped up, associated to branches of math. For example I&#x27;m a member of &quot;The Algebraic Geometry Syndicate&quot; and &quot;Modern Number Theory and Algebraic Geometry&quot;.<p>The activity includes: technical math chat; people giving each other advice (e.g. on the job market or online teaching); advertisements of online conferences; some other stuff.<p>2. I&#x27;ve also been on Discord forums attached to weekend online conferences. These were sort of similar, but short-lived -- and we also encouraged everyone to introduce themselves. We had a &quot;math memes contest&quot; and organized a board games night for all who were interested. Basically, it was an attempt to replicate some of the social aspects of conferences.<p>It seems like Slack is designed for groups of people who all work at the same company. Discord worked well for us -- where participants work&#x2F;study all over, and where it&#x27;s super easy to join.')
