Traditions change, names change, everything changes, software engineers will be called engineers and no one cares if they build bridges or not.\nI can tell you if i connect a xmpp service to some twitter account i also built a bridge. so software engineers do build bridges! And talking about &quot;tradition&quot; in a digital revolution is also weird, because right now everything is changing and nothing will be like before. This wolrd will never be the same as 1960, so why stick to old naming convetions anyway. This article is nothing but time-wasting, sorry if i offend someone with that but it is my honest opinion.')
