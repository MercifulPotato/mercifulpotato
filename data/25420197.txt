We all grew up in the northeastern US, which has cold, snowy winters.<p>My grandfather spoke of needing to go outside, retrieve a bucket of coal, and use it to start heating the house in the morning.<p>My dad speaks of having a pile of blankets on his bed and being able to see his breath in his room in the morning.<p>I grew up wearing footed pajamas to bed and my dad frequently wearing a ski-type hat around the house to regulate temperature.<p>Even today, I wear a hat at my desk in the winter, though I’ve typically lived in older, draftier houses. I wear a flannel shirt unless I’m very active in the house. I now live in a temperate climate, but still: old house. We turn the heat down significantly at night and use wool blankets.<p>I can certainly afford to set the heater higher at all times, but it just seems like a waste when I could so easily throw on a layer, versus spending more money, fossil fuels (even with carbon offsets), and wear and tear on the HVAC system by pushing a button instead.')
