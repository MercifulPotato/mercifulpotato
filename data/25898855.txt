It&#x27;l flatten out to find the break event point.<p>But that&#x27;s a normal market effect and the same as Taxis which traditionally (at least in many places) had quotas to stop people not getting enough jobs to fulfill their wage (Taxi &#x27;Tag&#x27; or &#x27;Plate&#x27; or &#x27;License&#x27;); or similar effects on the number of Uber drivers which obviously are not restricted so you have a sort-of imperfect market effect there where it&#x27;s not worth more drivers joining as they won&#x27;t get paid enough and some will leave.. or part of why supposedly surge pricing will drive drivers to leave to further away areas to take more jobs, etc.<p>Not a market expert but just wanted to note that while, in effect, you are right.. it&#x27;s not really surprising, unexpected or unprecedented and not a pyramid scheme :)')
