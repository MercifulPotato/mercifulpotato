Frequency gets too high (a few Hz or so), turbogenerators&#x2F;turbines blow up. Frequency gets too low, resonances destroy them. Frequency shifts quickly, massive torque and current spikes ensue. Load is dumped, frequency ramps up quickly and voltage rises very quickly. There are a number of control and monitoring systems in a power plant which ought to prevent these from happening, but in the bigger picture this means that grid power needs to be balanced continuously in order to keep nominal frequency. This becomes challenging when an interconnect fails, because this leads to very fast load changes.<p>The reason for 50 Hz +- 0.2 Hz isn&#x27;t so much about consumers; it&#x27;s about being able to run the grid. In Europe there <i>is</i> a long-term control loop that makes it a quite accurate 50 Hz, so synchronous motor clocks work, but that has essentially nothing to do with the normal frequency control.')
