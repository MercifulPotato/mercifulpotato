For example, I&#x27;d disagree with the quoted section you made for a different reason.  I&#x27;d almost always suggest early stage startups to use something like Heroku (if it works for them), which gives them the ability to pay a small premium in order to never have to spend too much time dealing w&#x2F; devops stuff.  Pre product-market-fit, that&#x27;s wasted time&#x2F;effort unless specific devops needs are essential to getting there.')
