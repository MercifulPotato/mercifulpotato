I then saw a few other people go through litigation, and learned more about the legal system.<p>It turned out that when people are trying to cast doubt on you, frame you, or otherwise are in a fight with you, knowledge IS power.<p>There&#x27;s a misconception that you need to do something wrong to be punished:<p>* In a civil suit, a judge determines who is more likely to be right, and that can be based on gut feelings, circumstantial evidence, or fabricated stuff.<p>* Criminal law suits have a higher bar, but at the end of the day, the policeman and prosecutor get evaluated based on whether they threw someone in jail, not whether they threw the right person in jail. To do that, they need to convince a jury.<p>* Even if you&#x27;re not throw in jail, a 2-year criminal investigation which costs you $200k in legal fees and eats up all of your mental cycles can leave you financially and emotionally debilitated. All that takes is some government employee having enough to be convinced there&#x27;s something worth investigating.<p>* Al Capone went to prison for tax evasion. Our legal code is long enough we ALL break laws we don&#x27;t know about. If a prosecutor or policeman believe you deserve to be in prison, they&#x27;ll work really hard to do that.<p>An email where you misphrase yourself, a record of where you were on some date, or otherwise can all come back to haunt you, even when you&#x27;ve done nothing wrong. It&#x27;s better to keep that stuff private.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;ve never personally been through a criminal investigation or prosecution. I&#x27;ve been through a couple civil cases. I was threatened with a criminal prosecution once unless I ceded ground in a business transaction. I didn&#x27;t do what the other party threatened to accuse me of (and they knew it), but:<p>1. Evidence was enough messy evidence that I think they could have gotten a criminal investigation going.<p>2. Threatening criminal prosecution as leverage is extortion. I didn&#x27;t know how far the other party would go. Would they fabricate evidence?<p>I spoke to a very good lawyer. Their opinion was that this would never make it to court -- even with if the other party faked evidence -- but that the time and cost of handling a criminal investigation would far outweigh any upsides. They advised me to fold. I folded. In retrospect, I&#x27;m glad I did.')
