At the end of the work day you&#x27;d sync the files to floppy, take the floppy home, and sync it to your home machine.<p>Remember at the time many people did not have laptops. They often didn&#x27;t have home internet either. Maybe they had AOL, or maybe nothing. They also didn&#x27;t have a work VPN or any way to access files on their work computer.')
