I mean I&#x27;m no designer and I just want to copy paste some hex codes to make the apps I built support dark mode.<p>Dark mode sounds easy (just make the background black!), but I&#x27;m pretty sure there are more science to that, because many dark mode apps I&#x27;ve tried make me uncomfortable and I reverted to normal mode because it&#x27;s _easier_ for my eyes.')
