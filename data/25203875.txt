I visited the website and saw a bunch of people crammed into an open office like chickens in a breeding factory. That is not attractive to me. Competitions like this just seem to me like a cheap way to outsource problem solving without having to pay anyone. Like bringing someone in for an interview, letting them solve your problem, and then telling them they are not a good fit while profiting of their work. Same idea, different package.')
