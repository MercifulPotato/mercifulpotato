I get none of the claustrophobia or breathing restrictions some people talk about and find masks perfectly comfortable, and it actually lets me go to the shops or walk through town without freaking out.<p>More importantly though it sets a precedent for the future. We now know how easy it is for an airborne virus to decimate us, so even when this virus is over it&#x27;ll be acceptable for people with immune issues to keep wearing masks &quot;just in case&quot; (similar to Japan&#x2F;etc, although I know some of that is about stopping other people from getting sick).')
