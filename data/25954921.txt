You just spill some general theory.<p>You also write &quot;The problem the author complains about is an inevitable artifact cause by discretization of underlying continuous variables into discrete categories&quot; - but this is mistaken. There are underlying variables that in any practical interpretation are discrete - you can have flu or not - there is no spectrum. And the problem the author complains about is that we don&#x27;t know which underlying variables are like having flu and which are like height.')
