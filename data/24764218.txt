Officially in Germany&#x2F;Europe these are not valid varieties for consumption, but only &quot;ornamental plants&quot;, as these are not registered varieties (and one is only allowed to distribute registered varieties for human consumption).<p>As it is quite expensive to register a variety nearly no traditional farmer (or seed producer) does so, but sells under the label of &quot;ornamental plant&quot;.<p>We just grow, we don&#x27;t sell. But we share with our neighbors and friends. Our small local community likes the fact that our small garden is full of edible and historic plants from tomatoes, eggplant, peppers, cucumber, maize or pumpkin to pear- and apple-trees producing way more than two people can consume. We just like to grow.<p>We also have Open Source varieties, but also a lot of others tasting real good.')
