They have furniture like bookcases, beds, couches, tables, much of which they offered to me. But I live in a 2 bedroom apartment that is less than 1&#x2F;3 of the size of their house, so it just doesn&#x27;t fit. As an example, their dining room table is wider than my living room! I can&#x27;t take any of that furniture from our family home into my current home whether I want to or not, and even as a dual income household, with one working in tech, we can&#x27;t afford to buy a house that would fit even half of their furniture.')
