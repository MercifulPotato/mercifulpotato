My motivation was I was tired of creating new and interesting things in industry only to have them be killed by politics.  So, my idea never saw the light of day san a few dozen people.  My thought was that if i have a phd, I am rewarded in my career for publishing these thoughts.  If they are published, maybe some organization smarter than mine would use the ideas.  I am a true scientist at heart in that i want to know where my ideas break and a good way to know that is to have a lot of public scrutiny over them.')
