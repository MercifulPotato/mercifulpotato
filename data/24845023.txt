There are a lot of similarities to mine. Thanks for the other feedback. Yes, I&#x27;ve also been using leaflet. I&#x27;ve been thinking about adding other layers for say satellite view .. etc. I know how to do that and it&#x27;s pretty easy. I was also thinking it might be nice to allow people to actually zoom in to the street level view so that they can actually &#x27;virtually drive by&#x27; a location they visited on their holiday. Of course that will only be any good if there is street view available for that location (e.g. driving by a hotel you stayed at). I&#x27;ve not had too many issues with the EXIF data (at least for GPS and date info). The main one was just making sure the orientation was right but even that wasn&#x27;t very difficult. Perhaps my site doesn&#x27;t work for some types of EXIF and I don&#x27;t know it yet. If you come across any please let me know.<p>I&#x27;m not a good UI designer by any stretch of the imagination. There is also an additional complication with the fact that it&#x27;s not just a photo sharing site but it also allows CSV data to be shown on maps as well. I do have some layout options available for the CSV data (e.g. make the map full screen) but they are also clunky. I&#x27;ll have to continue to think about other layout options and display toggles.<p>In terms of the ipedia name it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s more like wikipedia in that lots of people can add content and share it with others and display that content on maps. It&#x27;s actually designed to be a &#x27;pedia&#x27; for geospatial data sets. It&#x27;s different to wikipedia in many ways also (e.g. no one else can edit your pages). I just added the photo mapping as another feature but it&#x27;s really a subset of what the site can do. For example there&#x27;s a page there for life expectancy: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapipedia.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;u&#x2F;drdave&#x2F;average_life_expectancy_by_country_since_1800.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapipedia.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;u&#x2F;drdave&#x2F;average_life_expectancy_by_...</a>')
