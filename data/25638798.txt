He job hunted for about 3 months, then took a job at a company he thought he would enjoy for about 6-8 business days (1.5 weeks) and then got a job offer with another company that came through from his earlier job search.<p>He felt really bad leaving so early but he wasn&#x27;t particularly happy with the environment after the first week and took the next opportunity that came his way and paid significantly more.<p>Of course he said that the second job hasn&#x27;t been much better to his happiness, but his logic was that if you are going to do something you hate, you might as well get paid more to do it. The second job is also more convenient for his commute.<p>He told me that he doesn&#x27;t plan on putting the one week job on his resume going forward.')
