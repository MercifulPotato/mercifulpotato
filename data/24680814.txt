Around the same time, the Seattle Weekly published an April fools article[1] which mentioned a free operating system called Linux. I thought it was part of the joke, but on further research, I discovered it was real. Fascinated, I bought a CD with the RedHat 5.0 installer and put it on my 486. I quickly decided the 486 was too slow, and the excitement of learning more about Linux prompted me to build myself a much better machine.<p>Then I discovered there were many free operating systems available, such as FreeBSD. I installed it on my machine and started going to the local BSD users group meetings. I met a guy there who hosted weekly programming classes at his house. One of the people that went to his classes worked for a small web hosting company and helped me to get an interview. I landed the job, and that is how I got my foot in the door as a professional.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seattleweekly.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;microsofts-new-brain-project&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seattleweekly.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;microsofts-new-brain-proj...</a>')
