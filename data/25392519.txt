But we&#x27;ve bounded the risk to be much, much less than COVID in almost all populations.  (This may not end up being true of adolescents, but there&#x27;s substantial reasons for adolescents to get vaccinated even if we cannot yet prove that the risk is lower than COVID.<p>&gt; I think that this vaccine is a choice, and once it&#x27;s readily available it is still a choice. If you choose not to get it, you are accepting the possibility that you might get COVID and die.<p>Generally, a whole lot of the reasons why we take vaccines is to provide collective protection.  E.g. it&#x27;s not critical that I be vaccinated for pertussis because of my own risk of whooping cough.')
