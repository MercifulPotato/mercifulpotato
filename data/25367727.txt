Item(by='antognini', descendants=None, kids=[25367808], score=None, time=1607560044, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25367016, text='I won&#x27;t claim my method is any good, but what I do is keep track of every book I come across in Goodreads if I have the slightest inclination to read it.  As you might imagine, this ends up being a lot of books (more than 5000 at the moment I think).<p>When it comes time to choose a new book to read, I&#x27;ll select a category (e.g., history, fiction, etc.), sometimes just by picking one, other times by randomly choosing.  Then I randomly select 20 books from that category and decide which of the 20 books I am most interested in reading.  I also roll a die and 1&#x2F;3 of the time I will use the same method to pick a book that I&#x27;ve already read to reread.  I feel like it gives me a nice diversity in the books I read, but gives me enough choice where I am really interested in the books that I&#x27;m reading.<p>I will follow threads, too.  If I liked a book by an author I may continue reading a few more books by the same author.  Or if I liked the subject I may read a few more related books on the same subject.')
