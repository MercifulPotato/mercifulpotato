Item(by='v64', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611251224, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25857258, text='&gt; I thought the Novikov conjecture postulated that time-travel would change nothing at all<p>Not exactly, from the wiki article:<p>&gt; The simplest way to impose the principle of self-consistency in quantum mechanics (in a classical space-time) is by a sum-over-histories formulation in which one includes all those, and only those, histories that are self-consistent.<p>So it is possible to change the past, but only in ways that are self-consistent and don&#x27;t give rise to paradoxes.<p>Regarding the ramifications for free will:<p>&gt; Novikov supports this point of view with another argument: physics already restricts your free will every day. You may will yourself to fly or to walk through a concrete wall, but gravity and condensed-matter physics dictate that you cannot. Why, Novikov asks, is the consistency restriction placed on a time traveler any different?')
