It is hard to talk too much about the game as it is heavily spoilable.<p>However I have to add that while I feel it is very similar in its spirit (learn the logical rules of the world by doing, apply and combine them to solve new situations), it adds a layer of dexterity into the equation (flying a space ship and jumping around) and moves at a faster pace, time being a relevant factor in its exploration and puzzles.<p>Also of course if you have not played it already: Braid, the first game made by Jonathan Blow.')
