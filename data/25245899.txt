Use your own config but be ready to switch quickly to a more &quot;common&quot; config and know how to use it (whatever common means in your context, just adapt to your team).<p>For example I use i3, and I switch ctrl and caps lock. During my first pair programming experience my colleague was struggling with all that and I was feeling quite guilty (&quot;maybe this need to fine-tune everything is just immature after all&quot;). After this I made sure to be able to switch quickly to a &quot;vanilla&quot; Gnome setup.<p>Although coming back to Gnome after using i3 is quite easy since the Gnome paradigm is quite universal, there are some alternative &quot;configs&quot; that I am afraid to adopt, such as exotic keyboard layouts (&quot;bepo&quot; in french instead of &quot;azerty&quot;). Losing the ability to type on this de facto standard layout would be quite problematic.')
