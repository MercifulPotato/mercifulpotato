It is often a better monetary wager to &quot;persist&quot; despite obvious misery. But it&#x27;s a terrible choice in the psychological cost. And... you only live once.<p>The financial devastation of divorce in a period of economic uncertainty makes marriage a very poor long-term value proposition. You can&#x27;t really protect yourself from a predatory divorce in any way that will withstand a legal challenge.<p>Younger adults seeking independence should be very wary of &quot;marriage&quot;. Love and relationship can exist in a healthier way outside of the sunken-cost fallacy.<p>An economic union only makes sense if the terms of rupture are clear and fair. A romantic union only makes sense if there is love. To confuse these two types of union is a huge mistake.')
