I don&#x27;t know what FSI is, perhaps some department that Bhattarcharya is part of. I agree, if it was being pushed by official Stanford news sources (a search for Bhattarcharya on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.stanford.edu&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.stanford.edu&#x2F;</a> reveals nothing, although plenty of other COVID-related research), that that might be problematic. I agree it&#x27;s not a good look for Stanford, but but if people conflate researchers from a university with a university, then that&#x27;s on them.')
