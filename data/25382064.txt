Item(by='tombert', descendants=None, kids=[25382961], score=None, time=1607658593, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25380648, text='&gt; in practice everyone expects you to use poorly-maintained clojure-ish libraries to paper over the java&#x2F;javascript bits<p>I cannot speak for anyone else, but as someone who writes a lot of Clojure (not much ClojureScript), I actually tend-towards the most-maintained libraries, and that usually just means Java. Personally, I think Clojure is a &quot;better Java than Java&quot;, and I&#x27;ve never had a huge problem calling into the Java versions of libraries.<p>For example, I&#x27;ve had fewer headaches using the regular Java Kafka bindings or JeroMQ than by using the &quot;Clojure-ified&quot; versions of these libraries.  I absolutely hate Java as a language, but personally as an engineer it&#x27;s hard to dispute that Java libraries tend to get a lot of money spent on them, and it feels silly to completely ignore that in some pursuit of &quot;purity&quot;.<p>This actually seems to be more-or-less the ethos of the Clojure engineers where I work, but maybe my situation an outlier.')
