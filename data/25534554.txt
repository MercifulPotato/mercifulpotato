I have statuscake set up, but their emails will not wake me up in the night (DND on).\nI&#x27;d pay for an app that pings my server every 5 min to detect errors. If my app is down, it would check that google is up (to rule out network problem on the device). It would immediately generate a notification. After 3 checks have failed, it would trigger an alarm, even if &quot;do not disturb&quot; is on.\nI think it would be easy to monetize, just sell the app. Not as a service, just as an app. \nI&#x27;ve been searching for something like that but couldn&#x27;t find anything, only comments on other apps that expressed the same need.\nIf anyone knows an app that would do this or wants to program it, please let me know :) my Java skills are not up to date so I can&#x27;t realistically program it myself.')
