Item(by='tralarpa', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606228708, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25197791, text='&gt; The world no longer provides much in the way of those intrinsic demarcations.<p>I have the same feeling about many other things nowadays. Daily life just a few years ago was more structured. In my country, shops were always closed on holidays (often of Christian origin) and on Sundays. The availability of things was restricted: If you needed something on Saturday evening you had to wait until Monday. If you wanted to rewatch your favorite TV series, you had to wait until a TV channel decided to rerun it. News programs were only broadcasted three times per day etc.<p>And now with COVID and working at home, even the difference between work time and free time is blurred.<p>I know that these restrictions were mostly artificial and I am happy that I have now more freedom to do things when <i>I</i> want to do them. But it also meant that there was a rhythm of life shared with your neighbors. You knew when your friends were at home and you knew when the kids at school or the colleagues at work would discuss the latest episode of some TV series (because it was always broadcasted on a specific day of the week).<p>As you said, we are now responsible for giving structure to our lives. Which is of course also a sign of maturity.')
