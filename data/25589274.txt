For example, as I already said, there is no support of unrecoverable ECC errors handling in the FreeBSD memory management subsystem for any CPU, including Intel. On Linux, the kernel has first-class ECC support via the Error Detection And Correction subsystem (EDAC). EDAC can decide to kill a process, to trigger a kernel panic, or even to isolate the faulty memory based on the location of the memory error. On FreeBSD, the only thing that handles unrecoverable ECC errors is the userspace utility sysutils&#x2F;mcelog [0], the best thing it could do after an unrecoverable error is sending you an email, at which point data corruption may have already occurred [1]. Usually correctable errors occur before unrecoverable ones, so data corruption could be prevented if it&#x27;s fixed soon enough, but if you get &quot;lucky&quot;...<p>And unlike writing device drivers, I don&#x27;t think most people (including myself) is qualified to mess with the memory management code in the kernel. But I have a plan to do something about it, for example, there&#x27;s nothing stops me from writing a simple script to decode the MCE log and kill the kernel from the userspace. And given how rare unrecoverable ECC errors are, even without graceful handling (like killing userspace process or runtime memory offlining), it should solve my concern of data integrity on FreeBSD.<p>[0] But corrections are welcomed. I suspect FreeBSD will also halt the kernel on Intel platforms after a fatal MCE due to ECC error, but I didn&#x27;t find any information and came to a negative conclusion.<p>[1] I guess it&#x27;s not really a problem for &quot;real&quot; FreeBSD users, on &quot;real&quot; servers, BIOS can kill the system after an unrecoverable ECC, which probably explains the lack of any unrecoverable error handling in FreeBSD.')
