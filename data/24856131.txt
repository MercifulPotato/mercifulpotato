All trains in Switzerland are pretty slow, but it&#x27;s a small country so it rarely matters.<p>Also, Swiss trains are pretty expensive. You don&#x27;t notice because wages are high, but really, everything in this country is very expensive compared to neighbouring countries.  In most countries inter-city rail is used by commuters so governments impose price caps, if there is any political pressure to lower prices here I&#x27;ve never seen it.')
