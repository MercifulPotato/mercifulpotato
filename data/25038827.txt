It requires a skillset.</i><p>If it <i>didn&#x27;t</i> require a skillset, then my idiot brother-in-law stands just as much a chance at success as I do. If it didn&#x27;t require a skillset, then the smart entrepreneur will hire a bunch of folks with no skills who will consequentially work for cheap, and make <i>them</i> do the drop-shipping. But as another comment on this page said, the real money is selling courses to people that think the road to riches is paved by button clicks of unskilled people.')
