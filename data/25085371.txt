As someone who sucks at them myself, I often wonder where are the modern Bruce Tognazzini&#x27;s. I&#x27;m still reminded of a point on UI design he made that the corners of the desktop in a WIMP are special because they are infinitely large targets - you just fling the mouse pointer there and hit them. This point was of particular interest to me as an early Linux desktop (FVWM) user with virtual desktops (3x3) that you could configure to flip between when the mouse got near the edge, so it broke the infinite corners convention.<p>I&#x27;d like to find people who are thinking about UI&#x27;s as deeply as the AskTog articles used to.')
