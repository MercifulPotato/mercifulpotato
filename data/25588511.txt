(Reference in my previous post.) How is that in any way ignorable? Why bring up anything else? Why defend them when they&#x27;re saying one thing and doing another?<p>Apple fans never condemn their company. They always hurdle accusations at everyone and anything else they can to protect their fruit god. Just like you&#x27;re doing now.<p>Say it: &quot;Apple uses and has benefitted from slave labor. I believe this is wrong and should change.&quot;<p>If you can&#x27;t say that, I have more than proven my point.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter what other companies are doing. They&#x27;re all bad. But Apple has the least excuse of them all, because they&#x27;re the richest and most powerful.<p>Not that you care, but I cut consumption out of my life. My phone is old and I save and invest most of my income.<p>If my media company gets off the ground, I&#x27;d love to make a movie about Tiananmen.<p>I love the Chinese people (I studied Mandarin in college), but I refuse to support their regime. Businesses that kowtow should not be supported. Businesses that benefit from slave labor and Chinese market access have a lot to answer for.')
