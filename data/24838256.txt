Instructions, rather than explicitly parallel bundles, are dynamically scheduled and executed. Dependencies are resolved by flushing bad results and replaying instructions; no more global stalls. There is even a minimal degree of out-of-order execution â€“ a profound repudiation of some of the underlying assumptions behind Itanium.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realworldtech.com&#x2F;poulson&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realworldtech.com&#x2F;poulson&#x2F;</a><p>Given the large amount of security problems OoO has caused, there is a chance that we may revisit the experiment in the future with a less rigid attitude and greater success.')
