I&#x27;m curious about the real-world experience you&#x27;re referring to. My real-world experience has been pretty positive, insofar as it has related to my personal goals.<p>&gt; this piece is deliberately ignoring the fact that FAANG companies like Google have an overabundance of profits and engineers, leading to some of the most lax demands on individuals.<p>I do like the way you phrased this point a lot, but I did explicitly call this out. Perhaps it needs more emphasis, though? I said...:<p>&gt; FAANGs pay absurdly well, and working at a large company is much, much slower paced than working at a startup, meaning you donâ€™t need to work nearly as hard.<p>&gt; if you at least gave a more honest take on the benefits of working for FAANG<p>What did I miss?
