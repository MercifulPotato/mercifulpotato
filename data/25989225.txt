That&#x27;s what WeBull CEO said happened to them. Maybe that&#x27;s just a PR move by the WeBull CEO, or maybe it is true. If true, how is that not the DTCC abusing it&#x27;s monopoly?<p>Finally, is the DTCC not having the long side cover the risk on the short side? It seems to me, the vast majority of the risk is on the shorts. The short side seems to be made up of mostly large hedge funds, so if one goes down, it&#x27;ll be extremely difficult for the DTCC to front the cash on all of their trades, and of course shorting has infinite risk. The long side is finite, is distributed among multiple brokers and then even more distributed among retail investors. It seems like the risk is low there.<p>I think an investigation needs to be done into the DTCC&#x27;s decisions here and their handling of this, and maybe something needs to be done about their monopoly.')
