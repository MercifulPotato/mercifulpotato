I would love to the know the backstory how Ireland attracted American tech companies in the 80s. Henry Ford setup a factory in Cork because his father came from the county.<p>It reminds me of Delorean  (Back to the Future car) setting up a factory in Northern Ireland because the British government gave them a lot of money to do so. Though that didn’t last as long.<p>EDIT: Looks like they got a 10 year tax holiday (zero tax). They were the last to take advantage of it because the EU wanted it stopped. After 10 years they found a way to work around EU rules otherwise they would have moved to Singapore.')
