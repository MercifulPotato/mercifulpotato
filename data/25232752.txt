Item(by='cosmie', descendants=None, kids=[25235544], score=None, time=1606512660, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25232001, text='If you&#x27;re using a sweetener to cut the bitterness (rather than to <i>add</i> sweetness), then you may enjoy cold-brewed coffee. Cold water is far less effective than hot water at extracting tannins from coffee grounds, which are the primary source of the bitterness in coffee. So cold-brewed coffee tends to be naturally less bitter, as a result.<p>Bonus points in that it&#x27;s less acidic, as well. And in case anyone else is as oblivious as I originally was, &quot;cold-brewed&quot; doesn&#x27;t actually have to equate to cold coffee. You end up with a coffee concentrate, which you dilute with water to preference (taste, caffeine content, etc). You can dilute a cup with boiling water to get a hot cup of (non-bitter) coffee just as easily as you can dilute it with ice water for a cold, ice coffee.')
