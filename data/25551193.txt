Regular old sails as well as kites can be used at various angles to the wind. See e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Point_of_sail" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Point_of_sail</a><p>[edit] P.S. from my understanding of the mechanism, I&#x27;m not so sure these Flettner rotors are useful in a headwind. They work by creating a pressure difference, but in a headwind, you could only create a pressure difference between the port and starbord sides, not the front and back. Unless there&#x27;s some mechanism I&#x27;m missing?')
