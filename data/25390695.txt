We should use the pressurized water reactors we actually know how to build. France generates over 70% of its electricity from them, and the US already generates 20% from PWRs. For every existing PWR we need to build 4, and that&#x27;s enough to fulfill 100% of our electricity demand. Larger reactors are actually more efficient, too. The price per watt is 2-2.5x that of fossil fuels but they remain the only way to produce carbon-free energy around the clock besides geographically dependent solutions like geothermal and hydroelectric power.<p>MSRs may be useful eventually for remote power generation, but as far as bulk power generation the decades of experience building and operating PWRs is too compelling an advantage.')
