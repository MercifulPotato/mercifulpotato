I don&#x27;t think I could have handled that. Continental gave bonus miles which is the only reason I had 500k, but I think I made it to 150k actual miles.<p>The bonuses were self propagating, I would get a bonus miles because I was upgraded for free to first class because I had so many miles.<p>That is probably why they were devalued so hard when United bought them.')
