It’s worth distinguishing between charging money on Stripe (for which you incur payments pricing) and using Stripe Billing (which is a separately-paid product).<p>Stripe Billing has had this pricing for a few years. For some longtime users of Subscriptions, we originally didn’t change their pricing but are doing so now. We think charging a separate fee for our Billing product is fair, given comparable products in the market (say, Recurly or Chargebee) charge something similar. (Generally more!)<p>We’ve been investing a ton in making Stripe Billing better. For example, from talking to users we learned people needed it be <i>significantly</i> easier to get up and running with subscriptions. So in the last year we built the Customer Portal[0]. (We’ve also listened to you and improved the analytics[1].) Payments is a low-margin business and our customers are (quite reasonably) very price sensitive. So to be able to make Billing a great product, we realized it was going to have to charge a fee commensurate with the product scope.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;billing&#x2F;subscriptions&#x2F;customer-portal" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;billing&#x2F;subscriptions&#x2F;customer-porta...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.stripe.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;billing-analytics-dashboard" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.stripe.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;billing-analytics-dashb...</a>')
