Taking a conservative approach to something you don&#x27;t yet understand is the best approach on a mass scale. There isn&#x27;t any significant data for the one dose approach. These vaccines are only authorized on an EUA on a specific way to apply the dosage and it would be foolhardly to experiment now with different approaches on health care workers who are high risk on the front line.<p>Definitely need more data on the single dose approach and if that proves safe enough then providers can go that route. Playing with people&#x27;s health because we want to go cowboy and extract many doses as possible is irresponsible.<p>What happens if the single dose approach doesn&#x27;t work as well as hoped? I wouldn&#x27;t want to be that guinea pig who thought &quot;I&#x27;m protected&quot;. How long will it be that all hospitals get the information to go back to the two dose approach. Consistent messaging is key during this pandemic. That alone has been hard enough.')
