It is awesome :)<p>Also, these days the storage of the data doesn&#x27;t have to be at the same machine that processes the data. A lot of datacenter setups have basically zero transfer cost (or, alternatively, all the within-DC transfer cost is in the CAPEX required to build the DC in the first place), ultra low latency, and essentially unlimited bandwidth for any within-datacenter communication. This doesn&#x27;t hold for dc1-&gt;dc2 communication, in particular it is very very far from the truth in long distance lines.<p>One way to think about the above is that datacenters have become the new supercomputers of the IBM era - it&#x27;s free and really fast to exchange data within a single DC.<p>Also2, this is completely independent of consistency guarantees. At best it relates to durability guarantees, but that I want from all storage solutions. And yes, properly done reed solomon has the same durability guarantees as plain old replicated setup.<p>Also to the above also2, single-DC solutions are never really durable as the DC can simply burn down or meet some other tragic end, you need geographic replication if your data cannot be accidentally lost without serious consequences (a lot of data actually can be lost, in particular if it is some kind of intermediate data that can be regenerated from the &quot;source&quot; with some engineering effort). This is not just a theoretical concern, I&#x27;ve seen &quot;acts of God&quot; destroy single-DC setups data, ay least partially. It is pretty rare, though.')
