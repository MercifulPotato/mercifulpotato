Even then, I appreciate that we are raising this issue.<p>It should be clear to anyone here that the moment to act on this is before your contacts get copied, not trying to get them un-copied later. Think of it as a betrayal of your contacts, that you sell them out (then ponder the likelihood that none of yours have done the same, it&#x27;s probably infinitesimal.)')
