TV mounts generally aren&#x27;t designed to fit  anything behind them, and many devices aren&#x27;t designed to be mounted. I suspect this leads to many people saying &quot;why bother with mounting if I&#x27;m going to need a cabinet to sit all my devices on, I&#x27;ll just sit my TV on there too.&quot;')
