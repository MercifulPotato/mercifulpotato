We used to run a program matching students looking for internships with companies (main desire: resume experience + letters of rec), and some of these resulted in real long-term, paying jobs. We have a lot of students who still want this kind of service (which we won&#x27;t charge them for), but to make it easier on companies, we&#x27;ve made it more a-la-carte, like Fiverr. Would love to hear ways we can improve this for companies.')
