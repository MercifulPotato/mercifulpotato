Limited liability has its place, as a deal by which something gets done that neither the government (because of resources) or the private sector (because of risk) can do alone. The classic example is shipping canals. But those corporations were given <i>time limited</i> charters for <i>specific purposes</i>, and didn&#x27;t have many of the rights since granted to corporations. You&#x27;re playing an excluded middle when you assume that contempt for corporations <i>as they exist today</i> implies contempt for corporations in any form whatsoever. I for one would be fine with corporations in their original form, without the later extensions.<p>&gt; When you can lose all your possessions if an investment you made fails<p>This is not about an investment failure in the sense of not getting the expected returns. It&#x27;s about <i>incurred liability</i>. Why should individuals not <i>in general</i> be liable for the choices they make? Ever hear of moral hazard? Any exemptions, as with corporations in their original form, should be very limited and balanced by some public good.<p>&gt; Thereâ€™d be no mortgages, no college loans, no car loans, and zero growth.<p>That is simply not true. It&#x27;s your claim, so you provide some evidence. Then I&#x27;ll show what&#x27;s wrong with it. Even without limited liability, those with assets will assume risks if the potential returns are commensurate. Always have, always will.')
