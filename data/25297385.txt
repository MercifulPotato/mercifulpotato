Screaming racism&#x2F;sexism&#x2F;marginalisation every time someone disagrees with you is annoying and tiring. I am a second degree immigrant in Norway and I always see this behaviour in people who blame society when they don&#x27;t get their way when in reality people rarely get their way all the time.
