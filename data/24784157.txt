Most of the time what people refer to is activism (our company should support X, because I think X is the correct political action) when talking about neutral environments, at least from what anecdotal observations of the many times this argument has come up on HN.  \nAs well, I wouldn&#x27;t consider long arguments during work about opinions on {current political topic} to be relevant or even useful.
