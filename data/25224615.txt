I was going to take out the wash to put it on the line to dry but the lid was locked and because it is a solenoid switch, I wasn&#x27;t able to open the washer (it requires power to open). This kind of device isn&#x27;t even &quot;smart&quot; in the sense of internet connectivity, but it did really surprise me that it was not configured to release if not powered.')
