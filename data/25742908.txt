Item(by='f430', descendants=None, kids=[25742942], score=None, time=1610431175, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25742882, text='yeah so if your options are ITM then your stock doesn&#x27;t need to move that much to profit but the downside is its very expensive.<p>OTM is cheaper but much more riskier because your stock has to travel further.<p>No you would leverage more with OTM because you can buy a lot more OTM with the money you spend on ITM.<p>This is a gross generalization, when I say &quot;riskier&quot; it is purely from an academic point of view. In reality there are so many other factors at play, fundamentals, theta, delta, vega, etc. I can&#x27;t really explain it because I don&#x27;t understand their exact relationships but in general when you have an option position the clock is against you and so many other factors that has to go right.<p>It&#x27;s like in Casino Royale when that Marilyn Mason look-alike invests African warlords money on an airline company on far OTM near expiry options and then launching an attack in the airport.<p>The SEC has a safeguard against these things. If you have large far OTM options near expiry and the stock dips the next day, expect a visit from the SEC or FBI.')
