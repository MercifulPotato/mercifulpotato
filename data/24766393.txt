Not just &quot;will keep running and finish soon after the universe expires&quot;, but actually impossible to compute (in the general case, which was their case, if they restricted the inputs it was feasible). Apparently they had no mathematicians evaluating the requirements. The guy who brought the problem to me had been working on it off and on for months. So I saved him from having to think about it for the rest of his time maintaining that system.')
