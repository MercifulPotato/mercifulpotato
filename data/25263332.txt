As a developer I don&#x27;t need to save a mail the user used for registration, I can ask the ID service in question when I need it. Of course you could implement a permission request for the user to allow such access, but that is neither innovative, nor very practical for most services.<p>&gt; Apple’s work with camera providers is also unique – providing actual on-device analysis of footage captured by third-party partners<p>Privacy...<p>&gt; That’s going above and beyond simply protecting your data<p>This is either satire, the wording suggest as much, or just bad lying. The author did work for Apple PR. Allegedly that is not currently the case anymore but the article is from 2019. Or maybe the &quot;training&quot; is forever.')
