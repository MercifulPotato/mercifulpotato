Links in comments don&#x27;t work, nor do older links-in-bio persist with their original post.<p>Facebook Groups is cannibalizing a dearly beloved two-decade-old backcountry ski forum ( turns-all-year.com ) because the user-onboarding is effortless, familiar, and integrates with other familiar walled-garden features. With the FB interface, the discussions are shorter-lived and the archiving of trip-reporting information is no longer effectively searchable. I don&#x27;t know how an open-web forum with limited resources can compete against FB effectively -- suggestions are very welcome.<p>Strategies like these are designed to gently carve users away from the open web and gather them within the garden. While not impossible to combat, they are a stout challenge for sites in the modern era.')
