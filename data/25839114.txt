As an easy example, consider the &quot;state machine&quot; for a rubik&#x27;s cube.  All told, this isn&#x27;t insurmountable, but you are almost certainly not going to write down all of the allowed states with all of the possible transitions.<p>Which is not to say you can&#x27;t make a program to reason about what the allowed states are.  I started a probably bad attempt at that a while back at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taeric.github.io&#x2F;cube-permutations-1.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taeric.github.io&#x2F;cube-permutations-1.html</a>.  (And, I just noticed the mathjax included on that page isn&#x27;t loading.  Almost certainly my fault... :( )')
