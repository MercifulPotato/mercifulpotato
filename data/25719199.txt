One generation tries to solve them, violently, the next generation abhors revolution enough to not do that.<p>However, eventually you get an actual success at fixing the underlying problems (often related to elites accumulating too big a percentage of the resources), then the &quot;fathers-and-sons&quot; cycles stop because there&#x27;s not a big well of repressed anger for counter-elites (Robespierre, Cromwell, Lenin, etc.) to draw on.<p>So, for each country, it will not always be a two-generation cycle because it depends on whether you have the intra-elite competition, fueled by an ever-increasing concentration of power at the very top, which causes the disaffected masses to have a counter-elite to follow down the path of upheaval.')
