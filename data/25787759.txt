We outsiders love to do that. Many of us know American criminal law better than our own, just because of television shows and lack of experience with criminal law in our real lives.<p>And incidentally, the FAQ don&#x27;t mention the United States, either.<p>But what&#x27;s really obvious on this site is that many Americans cannot discuss other choices.<p>I theorize it is because America is so big and powerful and there isn&#x27;t a visible friendly society with different cultural views in the neighborhood that matters. Large societies that matter are far away, and rivals at best, enemies at worst.<p>There is a strong sense of &quot;the American way is obviously the best, and everybody who disagrees or has been socialized on different norms is an idiot and must be destroyed&quot;.<p>Every &quot;by the way, in X we don&#x27;t have Y, we do Z&quot; on this site is a recipe for confrontation.<p>It&#x27;s a minority of posters, I&#x27;m sure, but they downvote and flag just about everything that isn&#x27;t &quot;America&#x27;s way or the highway&quot;.<p>Nobody asks them to declare the Finnish, German or Japanese way to be better. But they simply cannot accept that other societies might be happy with other choices.<p>And those threads are really garbage.')
