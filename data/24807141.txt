It helps you feel good about yourself and others, and so long as you&#x27;re doing so with trustworthy people with similar goals - It&#x27;s basically the same thing. My roommate&#x27;s boyfriend did MDMA while I was in the house, and they were convinced that they knew me and had a deep personal connection with me from that point forward.<p>It was not true at all, and ended very badly (he drugged me, and that&#x27;s all that I know for sure).')
