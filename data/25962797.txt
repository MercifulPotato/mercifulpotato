Right out of the gate, they&#x27;re disingenuously framing a &quot;fight for honest and open debate.&quot;. But the latest spate of deplatforming had nothing to do with silencing debate. Rather it was an inevitable response to the Big Lie of &quot;Stop the Steal&quot;, a bad-faith rallying cry that resulted in real-world violence - hence even AWS getting involved as S230 only covers <i>civil</i> liability. Meanwhile it seems like the biggest threat to <i>actual conservatives</i> (ie those not trying to destroy our institutions) is coming from the Republican party itself.')
