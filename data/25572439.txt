This conversation is not about whether genocide and forced labor is bad (which I hope we can all agree that it is), it is about The ethics of Apples business practices. The company in question (Apple) is already based in a country which performs its own version of state mandated forced labor along with a myriad of other human rights abuses. How is this not relevant? Knowing this, why should we expect Apple (or other US companies) to treat business in China any differently? What makes one okay and the other not?<p>Ignoring this connection diverts attention away from other, systemic issues in our global market system which incentivize companies to operate in this way.')
