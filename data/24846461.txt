They design things so that they&#x27;ll (probably) be performant the first time around because they&#x27;ve had problems in the past in that area.<p>Mid-level developers haven&#x27;t had a lot of those problems yet, but they <i>have</i> read articles about them, and those articles usually do silly things to try to prove a point in a simplistic situation.<p>We had a developer that was obsessed with getting rid of jQuery for performance reasons, but repeatedly failed to recognize that the raw JS functions he wanted to use didn&#x27;t work on IE and&#x2F;or Safari, IIRC.  Beyond that, we also supported Android 4.4&#x27;s webview, and he didn&#x27;t even have a way to test that.  He ended up leaving the company for other reasons, but it was a constant battle to keep him in check with that stuff.<p>(It required compiling the Cordova app, and so long as you kept doing things the same way as the rest of the codebase, it almost always just worked.  So we didn&#x27;t require junior&#x2F;mid-level devs to test it on every change.  It did get tested eventually before the app got a new version, though.)')
