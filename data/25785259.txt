That’s not a total solution, of course: if “hold X” and “hold A” have very different behaviors, developers still have to code those states to be exclusive...unless they shouldn’t be.  Ain’t easy, that’s for sure.<p>A robust solution should probably use state machines coupled with generative testing, so that all of those unexpected combinations can be generated and handled before the testers try button-mashing, without relying on developers to think of and write all the individual test cases.')
