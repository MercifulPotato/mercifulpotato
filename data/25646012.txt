For example, office software is already far into the flat region of its innovation curve. IMHO it would suffice to throw away MS and adopt e.g. LibreOffice in all educational and government institutions throughout EU (and there are precedents already). GitHub shall be even easier to replace (complexity is far below office and open source alternatives do exist). Now with AWS, it is really a tough question. Hetzner is doing a very good (albeit slow) progress towards AWS functionality. Their prices are competitive and customer service is much better that what I ever got from AWS (not affiliated, just a happy customer). The level of integration in AWS however is still out of the reach of Hetzner (Cloudfront, S3, SES etc).<p>It would be really interesting to know your opinion on what functionality in AWS is indispensable and what you can sacrifice in case Hetzner&#x2F;OVH price for the rest is the same as AWS or lower.')
