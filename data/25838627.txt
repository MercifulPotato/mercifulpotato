Even pinging the username results in a ban. This single account has been responsible for almost 70% of what you read on r&#x2F;worldnews and its not far fetched to suggest that a small group of people actively dictate the world landscape.<p>Majority of people on reddit do not read beyond the headlines much like other social networks. People simply do not care to objectively ask for truth and are punished for doing so on Reddit.<p>Viral content is recycled over and over for hoarding karma points. Some users were caught fabricating heart wrenching stories for virtual internet points. I believe that these are farmers, creating thousands of accounts to be sold to people with commercial interest.<p>Very different than what HN does and it is the right way to maintain meaningful discussions. Too much of Reddit is just trolls and maladjusted individuals creating their own pseudo-realities like r&#x2F;aznidentity or other Red-Pill subreddits.')
