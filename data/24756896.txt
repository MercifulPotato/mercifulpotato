I&#x27;d be grateful if someone could give me a reality check on this:<p>Some years back, one criticism I heard against Microsoft was that they threatened to assert patent infringement against Linux, but refused to tell the alleged offenders which particular patents Microsoft considered to be violated. And the end result was Microsoft (imho) legally extorting some Linux vendors for licensing fees.<p><i>If</i> that story is true, then is Microsoft still engaging in that behavior or similar?')
