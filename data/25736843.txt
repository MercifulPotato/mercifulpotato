Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610398822, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25734076, text='&gt; but its not laughable on the level of most of the Trump election lawsuits.<p>I don&#x27;t know, they do have some of the greatest hits from those lawsuits:<p>* Let&#x27;s ask the court to prevent things that have already happened (it wants to restrain AWS from cutting off service to Parler, but it filed the suit <i>after</i> that happened).<p>* File exhibits that are atrociously unusable (the PDF of the service agreement clearly cuts out several lines of text, although I think this was unintentional).<p>* Provide a single paragraph of argument to address the single claim that actually gives your claim federal jurisdiction at all.<p>* Clearly incapable of reading contract plain text (in this case). The contract claims are likely to fail since AWS has a right to terminate it unilaterally (which they don&#x27;t address in their filing all), but it&#x27;s moot anyways because binding arbitration clause means the court has no right to hear it.<p>* Evidence for their claim boils down to &quot;there&#x27;s no other possible reason anyone would want to shut us down than CONSPIRACY!&quot;<p>* Urgency is requested, but there&#x27;s no motions to actually grant urgent relief (e.g., an emergency filing or motion for expedited relief).<p>* Plaintiff fails to spell its own name correctly in a few cases (admittedly, only one here).')
