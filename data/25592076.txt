On the other hand, if we take the strongest random source in the universe, say X, and xor X with itself we get:<p>X xor X = 0<p>The result is just  a sequence of zeros, which is not &quot;as strong as the strongest source&quot;.  In practice, people may take lots of different &quot;random&quot; sources as input to their random generators to make them &quot;more&quot; random.  But if you don&#x27;t take care to check if they are independent, you may have a problem.')
