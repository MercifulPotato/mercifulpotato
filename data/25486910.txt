Maybe extremist groups like the proud boys, but I’ve literally never heard this objection. People tend to worry more about socialization and the harmful psychological effects porn can have on people.<p>&gt; “ Others may feel camgirls are collecting undeserved money, they don&#x27;t do actual noble valuable work, just cash in based on their genetics and immorality.”<p>Again, thats an extremist misogynistic viewpoint. The real objections I’ve heard concern the exploitation of the industry and the lack of protections for workers.<p>All the worldviews you describe are hyper-conservative, and don’t at all describe society as a whole.')
