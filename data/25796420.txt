And, amusingly, it points to Dropbox&#x27;s application as example of how to apply. When in reality it was due to traction on HN that Dropbox got into YC, Drew Houston was a solo founder so likely would&#x27;ve been rejected again on the basis of being a non-great founder since he hadn&#x27;t even convinced anyone to join him.<p>Of course, one can always claim that &quot;great founders have traction&quot; but that&#x27;s an obvious cop out.<p>This isn&#x27;t malicious or bad. It&#x27;s just an example of the common problem where people&#x27;s view of themselves is different from their actual behavior. Something all founders should learn. It applies to users just as much as investors.')
