The analogies I&#x27;ve used in the past come from music and martial arts. In music, when you are first trying to learn an instrument, you aren&#x27;t also being tested on music theory or creating brand new musical scores. You are focusing solely on being able to smoothly transition between keystrokes.<p>Similarly, martial arts often see a high attrition rate. This has a number a reasons, but one that can be addressed is forcing novices to spar with more advanced students way too early. I know the Gracie Jiu-Jitsu schools shifted away from letting new students spar until they&#x27;ve trained for at least 6 months specifically because they didn&#x27;t want students to show up, get destroyed, and quit out of frustration.<p>Sort of my point is that the jargon and notation shouldn&#x27;t simply be introduced and expected to be assimilated without explicit practice that is not confounded with additional problem-solving skills. Those can still be another practice activity, but students should be given the opportunity to just practice the skill without it.')
