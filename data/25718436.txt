Item(by='nicoburns', descendants=None, kids=[25718741, 25718811], score=None, time=1610306166, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25718085, text='&gt; There are huge disparities in wealth and income within America, right? America&#x27;s poorest state has a median income of 45K (Mississippi) and it&#x27;s richest state has a median income of 80K (Maryland). Why doesn&#x27;t everyone just move to Maryland? Or better yet just move to San Francisco (median 112K). Obviously there&#x27;s factors other than economics keeping people in place.<p>That&#x27;s still a relatively small difference compared to places where incomes can be $100&#x2F;year or much less. I definitely think there&#x27;s room for more experimentation in this area, but it&#x27;s probably not as simple as &quot;just open the borders&quot;.')
