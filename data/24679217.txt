Where I&#x27;ve landed (for now at least) is to ask, &quot;What does this game give me? Will I be happier&#x2F;better when I&#x27;m done? Is there nothing I&#x27;d like to do instead?&quot;<p>If I have good answers, I&#x27;ll let myself play the game. &quot;I&#x27;ve been programming all day and my brain needs a break,&quot; is fine. But if it comes out that I&#x27;m playing because I just want to fill time or am procrastinating taking the next step on a project, I put it down and do something else. Doesn&#x27;t have to be the thing I was procrastinating, just something that won&#x27;t automatically expand to fill all available time.')
