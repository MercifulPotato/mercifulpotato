I think every dev knows exactly what I&#x27;m talking about. And if you aren&#x27;t a dev, Apple treats us like replaceable Dogs.<p>Apple has killed any good will among nerdy developers by treating them like shit for 20 years. Sure there are still corporate developers that are forced to make iOS apps, but it&#x27;s not like a hobbyist is going to buy an Apple computer for embedded, web dev, gaming, PC applications, etc...<p>Until Apple treats us(and maybe their non dev customers) better, I don&#x27;t see any reason outside iOS Apps to ever buy a macbook for dev.')
