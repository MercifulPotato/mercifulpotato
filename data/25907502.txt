This video reflects my experience - if you&#x27;re close enough to your destination cycling is stupid easy when they plow the roads &#x2F; trails, no fatbikes required. In anything short of -35C I&#x27;m probably warmer and more comfortable than people who drive. I walk more frequently than cycle, though, since the single biggest problem I&#x27;ve found with winter cycling is the hazard from fogged glasses in cold weather.')
