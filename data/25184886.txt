(Though there can be an aesthetic downside to having a cable around when you&#x27;re not using it.)<p>My favorite means of mounting a brick is to use a large pair of Velcro.  For undersides on some IKEA tables, I once had to augment the Velcro pad adhesive with Gorilla Glue.  Sometimes I use zip ties instead of Velcro.<p>When buying extra bricks, in addition to the presumed-good one that came with the laptop, I advise going to some effort and guesswork to try to get genuine, non-counterfeit ones.  I&#x27;ve seen some corner-cutting in circuitry in other power adapters and chargers, and that seems like a fire hazard.<p>For people who don&#x27;t like the idea of bricks plugged into the AC when not in use, Leviton and others make little switches that plug into the AC outlet.')
