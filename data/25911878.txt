Put frankly, Millennials are tired of getting fucked by the man. When you’re underemployed with $100,000 in student loan debt, your financial situation feels overwhelming. You really don’t want to take the advice of your parents or CNBC talking heads [5] to invest 10% of your salary for a 4% annual return. At that point, what’s another $5,000? Might as well buy some short-dated GME calls.<p>Well put. I was explaining to a friend of mine a few weeks ago why cynicism is so prevalent in our generation: we graduated in 2008 where banks, not our parents, got the bailouts; we got stuck with thousands in student debt; the dream of marrying a pretty wife and having a few kids, working for a company for 40 years, and retiring in Cabo is a relic of the 1950s; we lived with our parents until our 30s, and in spite of being so &quot;connected,&quot; we are more lonely, have less friends, and are having less sex than previous generations; unless, I guess, you count the COVID shutdowns screwing young people yet again.<p>It&#x27;s a never-ending shit-show. At least <i>some of us</i> are getting rich in &#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets.')
