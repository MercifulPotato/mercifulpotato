We paid an astounding $700 for a tree and the stupid incandescent bulbs burned out and within a couple years the lights didn&#x27;t work anymore (replacing bulbs did nothing).  I was furious that Pottery Barn did not use LED lights in 2016 on a tree that expensive.<p>I ended up buying light strands and wiring them myself and I gotta say the final product, while eye bleeding expensive, is amazing.  Unlike built in lights mine run all the way through the whole tree, into the middle.  There are also a lot more lights now than there were before, and they have different plugs for colored lights verse white, so I can use smart plugs to toggle remotely for example.  All in all a great end result, but it was probably $1,300 and 8 hours of labor to get there.')
