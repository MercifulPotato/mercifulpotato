X86 still treats the wider memory system as a kind of &quot;peripheral&quot; with mind of its own.<p>The intricacies how X86 memory access evolved to keep accommodating decades old drivers, and hardware apparently made a grand mess of what you can, and what you cannot memory map, or cache, and many things deeper in the chip.<p>One of may casualties of that design decision is the X86 cache miss penalty, and an overall expensive memory operations.')
