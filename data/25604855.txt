I was wondering how that works with optional arguments or rest arguments. At first glance I didn&#x27;t see anything about that in the tutorial. It seems to me as a layman that auto-currying can only work with fixed arity functions, but I&#x27;m curious if that&#x27;s indeed the case.<p>Edit: I scanned the docs too quickly. It&#x27;s answered there:<p>&gt; Unlike many Lisps, TL functions always expect a fixed number of arguments. For example, the + function shown above expects to receive 2 arguments and if it receives too many then and error occurs:')
