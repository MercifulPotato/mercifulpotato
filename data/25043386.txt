The middle east is a jenga tower held up by coalition troops with no good governments able to fend against internal threats due to the rampant local corruption. The U.S. pulled out of iraq and isis promptly took over half the country. I think pulling out from the middle east entirely would do far more harm than good considering all the backing these various extremist militias have from foreign nations, inching to pounce and seize power and enact their fucked up agenda on the populace. Imo, we should replace drone strikes with sniper rifles or highly trained SEAL teams to verify and take out targets. Way too much taking people out and not nearly enough verifying is the problem, not that the troops are there at all.')
