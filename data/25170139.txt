I wonder if part of the challenge is that so many companies have decided to ditch &quot;systems&quot; people for developers, assuming that software developers have the same knowledge, interests, experiences, and perspectives as systems folks, and that systems folks are no longer needed.<p>The question isn&#x27;t &quot;optimize my code&quot; or &quot;add more servers&quot;, it&#x27;s both, and determining when it&#x27;s appropriate to do one or the other at a given point in time based on current load and expected future trends.  But generally, &quot;optimize my code&quot; can be pretty low hanging fruit in complex systems, because if you lack systems people, you end up with everyone focused only on their specific component and nothing else.')
