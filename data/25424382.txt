The reason is, that until you&#x27;re ready to make the third one, you not only don&#x27;t know if it will ever really be needed, but you also don&#x27;t really know which parts of the thing really need to be different&#x2F;customizable.  If you abstract it before then, even if you do end up needing another someday, you will find that the way you abstracted it is the wrong way, and you will need to rewrite all the associated code anyway.<p>Until you&#x27;re making your third one (of whatever), don&#x27;t make an abstraction for it.')
