It can happen either when someone with a similar email address mistypes it, or when someone is trying to gain unauthorized access to your account. I have a friend with a very common name and he regularly receives other people&#x27;s email because they give out his email address without realizing it. They say, &quot;Oh yeah, my email is JohnSmith@gmail.com&quot; when actually my friend has that address and theirs is JohnWSmith@gmail.com, or whatever.')
