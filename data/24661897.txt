Are you saying that the result of a calculation can be racist?<p>It can be produced with a racist intent, or it can be interpreted as such. You can talk of the result of the calculation in a racist way, or derive racist conclusions from it. But per se, it cannot be racist. And you cannot decide to ignore the result of a calculation because you don&#x27;t agree with the discussion or the questions it generates.<p>EDIT (rate limited): as for your other answer &quot;By saying &quot;Aboriginal people just commit more crime&quot; you are declaring that race is a relevant factor...&quot; you are confusing correlation with causation. Or you are assuming that I might be confusing them.')
