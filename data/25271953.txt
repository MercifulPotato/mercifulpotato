In fact I spent months working on a system to workaround all the problems it caused for Hadoop: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hadoop.apache.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;current&#x2F;hadoop-aws&#x2F;tools&#x2F;hadoop-aws&#x2F;s3guard.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hadoop.apache.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;current&#x2F;hadoop-aws&#x2F;tools&#x2F;hado...</a>. We had a lot of automated tests that would fail because of missing (or more recently, out of date) files a significant portion (maybe 20-30%) of the time. We believed that S3 inconsistency was to blame but I always felt like that was the typical &quot;blame flaky infra&quot; cop-out. As soon as S3Guard was in place all those tests were constantly green. It really was S3 inconsistency, routinely.<p>To be fair to S3, Hadoop pretending S3 is a hierarchical filesystem is a bit of a hack. But I had cases where new objects wouldn&#x27;t be listed for hours. There&#x27;s only so much you can do to design an application around that, especially when Azure and Google Storage don&#x27;t have that problem.')
