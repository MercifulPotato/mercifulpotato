It accumulated over billions of years.<p>According to wikipedia [1], the atmosphere has 34e18 mol of oxygen, and photosynthesis produces 8800e12 mol&#x2F;yr of oxygen, meaning the atmosphere turns over in a little under four thousand years. There&#x27;s a separate estimate of atmospheric oxygen&#x27;s &quot;residence time&quot; in the text, of 4500 years.<p>So although oxygen levels have been high for billions of years, there is a sense in which the oxygen in the atmosphere right now has only been there for thousands.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Oxygen_cycle" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Oxygen_cycle</a>')
