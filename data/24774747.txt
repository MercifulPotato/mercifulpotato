That’s why the simulation has been used.<p>If the “base” universe&#x2F;Earth that we live in just appeared a few dozens years ago “as is” out of nowhere then the only way to make it “real” is to actually simulate the past.<p>Mandela effect and predictive programming are actually anomalies in favour of multiple iterations on the simulated past.<p>Now the question is who benefits from this and why?\nThe technologies from the future (which are not distinguished from magic) and antagonist - Devil&#x2F;Lucifer that is not interested that we see God as the creator or maybe even furthermore to undermine God’s role or maybe even trap him in this reality.<p>This actually also answers the question why we don’t have a proof that God exists because someone put real huge effort to disprove it i.e. here’s a given reality, now how we came here but without God?<p>Apparently all efforts on this failed otherwise we would never even heard about concept of God or simulation. And it also proves that we’re indeed in “base” reality.<p>And because God does exist in this reality the future is not predetermined despite whatever means antagonist is using to prove otherwise.')
