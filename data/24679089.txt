I&#x27;ve lived for a short time in a dense urban environment and I hated it.  I&#x27;ve seen pictures of European cities and they seen way too cramped for my taste as well.  Like it or not, you will have to deal with the fact that most people don&#x27;t want to live cramped up.<p>Also, do you think the people will just abandon their land if no one else buys it?  &quot;Nature&quot; won&#x27;t pay for it.  They bought it from someone else and will therefore expect to be paid before relinquishing it.')
