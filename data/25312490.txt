One that I apply to society and public policy and another one for myself.<p>I want society to take care of the weakest. I don&#x27;t want anyone to ever end up without a basic roof over their head and food on their plate, regardless how bag their decisions are. I want children to have the opportunity to advice greatness, even if they come from poverty, or worse, their parents suck.<p>At the same time, fort myself, I don&#x27;t want to ever have to use any services offered to people in need. I want to give know to society than I give.<p>I think it&#x27;s necessary for us to have this split view for a healthy society.<p>Further, personal push for success relies on grit and smarts. Also luck, but it only makes sense to think about that to the extent you can influence it.<p>Public policy on three other hand is about statistics and we cannot ask for better people.')
