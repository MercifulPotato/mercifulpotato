Work yourself into a fit over it if you want, but the next time it happens, you shouldn&#x27;t be <i>surprised</i>.<p>My point was meant to be that sharks do shark things, and companies that are Amazon&#x27;s size do things that companies at Amazon&#x27;s size would do. Both happenings should not illicit much surprise.<p>&gt; AWS is a company made up of human beings, with the capacity to choose to do good. If they do things that we would consider to be immoral, we can absolutely blame and judge them for that, regardless of whether it&#x27;s &quot;what they do&quot;.<p>This is great in theory, but there are such things as shareholders, fiduciary duty, and binding financial covenants. Companies have a capacity to choose to do good, but they have a stronger duty to <i>produce profit for stakeholders</i>.
