AIX is not like their mainframe business (and even there, they have surrendered to Linux).<p>&gt; These people will then be less likely to develop software for Apple.<p>They still have a pretty good UX for developers and entry-level machines. I&#x27;ll probably replace my aging Mac Mini with an ARM-based one next year or so. What will really upset me is if MacPorts is no longer supported on ARM. I hope Apple is sponsoring someone ensuring key parts of the 3rd party ecosystem are there or Macs will become second-class developer machines.')
