Even here on HN. I personally empathize with it because I&#x27;m a programmer and I&#x27;m quite certain much of the work I do provides less value than a decent teacher would _in the long term_.<p>Societies benefit from paying teachers more as:<p>- they deserve more<p>- higher salaries attract better teachers and actual domain experts who have little economic incentive to teach when they can make more elsewhere.<p>- a better educated workforce will pay for itself in the long run, although I think FUD over deficit spending isn&#x27;t necessary here and would be fine if it eventually creates increased output&#x2F;asset creation.<p>I am not claiming that these ideas are proven, just that I personally empathize with them. If you or anyone has research to counter or back up these claims that would be very helpful.')
