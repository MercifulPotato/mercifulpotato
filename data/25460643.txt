I&#x27;ll also remind you that the tax burden on every marginal dollar is the same for everyone. That is, that CEO pays the same amount of tax on their first taxable dollar as I do irrespective of what our total income is.<p>With that said, there is no reason that the top marginal tax rate shouldn&#x27;t be 90%, and that should apply to incomes in 10&#x27;s of millions. And the marginal tax rate should progress up from the current 37%@$622+k income to 90% at say $25MM. The CEO in your example&#x27;s marginal tax rate should be coming in probably in the 45-50% range. That&#x27;s marginal, not effective.<p>Capital gains tax should be eliminated and cap gains should be counted as income.')
