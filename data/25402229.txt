Extremely deadly forms kill their hosts, ending the ability to reproduce via transmission, and the more transmittable strains reproduce effectively. This type of optimization leads to things like the common cold and flu. The scary thing about COVID19 is that it has a very long lead time between infection and symptoms, if they develop at all, meaning it can circumvent some of those &quot;normal&quot; optimization peaks; it can be both very deadly, and very transmittable, because of the latency in the signal.')
