The CPU speed increases every year or two went from orders of magnitude to maybe a hundred percent if you are lucky.<p>The biggest increase recently has been in cores.  But still most games for example are heavily dependent on fast individual cores.<p>We are definitely seeing more emphasis on new techniques in AI and graphics and general computing that are more parallel.  But also we have not come close to optimizing what can be done with the existing speed.<p>Of course, the computers have been getting faster steadily, just not as rapidly as the previous era.<p>We have not come close to what is possible with the new abundance of cores or the new AI-specifix hardware.<p>And 3D circuits have barely gotten started.')
