So much waste is tolerated simply due to the fact that the majority of the expense is borne by your employer before the number they put on your paycheck.<p>I can live on a part time salary without issue, but health insurance, which is already $200&#x2F;wk for my family with my employer chipping in, would jump to more like $600&#x2F;wk, which is just completely untenable. There is no sane reason why health insurance should be my single largest expense each month.')
