Even getting robot probes to Mars is very very hard. Only about half of Mars missions have been successful. In fact, since the fall of the Soviet Union only one organisation has succeeded in putting working probes on the Martian surface: NASA&#x2F;JPL.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s impossible that SpaceX will get there, but certainly not soon and not for &quot;a few billion&quot;. If they succeed at all, it will require drawing on years on investment and expertise by NASA.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mars.nasa.gov&#x2F;mars-exploration&#x2F;missions&#x2F;historical-log&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mars.nasa.gov&#x2F;mars-exploration&#x2F;missions&#x2F;historical-l...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;science-environment-53589767" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;science-environment-53589767</a>')
