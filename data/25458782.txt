I did a quick look through your site and have a few issues:<p>1. What MFA methods do you support? TOTP? App based auth? U2F? FIDO2? (FIDO2 USB? BLE? Platform authenticators?) Smart cards (especially for enterprise)? Backup OTP&#x27;s? New device detection?<p>2. Your docs mention not playing nice with password manager autofill by default. Are there plans to address this?<p>3. Password reset emails come from @supertokens.io, which specifically raises phishing red flags when you get a password reset email from a domain that is not the one you&#x27;re logging into. How would an integrator go about addressing this?')
