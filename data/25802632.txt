The entire mindset of &quot;friendly simplifications&quot; that work 80% of the time, and if they give pretend that you don&#x27;t notice, look, there&#x27;s pretty code over there!<p>Even kotlin suffers from some of that (you can override a val x:Int with a val x:Int get() unless it&#x27;s tied down otherwise, talk about principle of maximum surprise) but the genes from the other parent avoid the worst.')
