I only have my human intuition to go on, but I bet the Riemann hypothesis would not be like the four-color problem. Graph-type problems just seem to lend themselves to exhaustively checking a zillion cases in a boring way, whereas in fields like number theory or analysis that sort of proof hardly ever seems to exist.<p>I hope we do get some famous theorems proved by computers so that we can see whether it&#x27;s enlightening to humans. I am quite curious whether my intuition is correct and it is a shame to think I might never know....')
