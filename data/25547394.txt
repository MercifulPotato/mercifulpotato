There is some ffmpeg-related refactoring that we need to do before we can do this though, and it&#x27;s not a quick &amp; easy task, so we have been deferring it since it&#x27;s not that high priority, and there are simpler solutions to this particular problem (i.e. improved CDN caching).<p>Other static files such as css, js, txt make sense to remain bundled with the app image, which is stateless and a prime candidate for horizontal scaling. Also, CDN caching makes small static files that change infrequently a non issue, regardless of their origin.<p>The managed Postgres service from Linode&#x27;s 2021 roadmap is definitely something that we are looking forward to, but the simplest thing might be to provision Postgres with local volumes instead. We are already using a replicated Postgres via the Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator, so I&#x27;m looking forward to trying this approach out first.<p>CockroachDB is on my list of cool tech to experiment with, but that will use an innovation token, and we only have a few left for 2021, so I don&#x27;t want to spend them all at once.')
