From the example you gave:<p><pre><code>    function reticulateSplines(){\n      if( featureIsEnabled(&quot;use-new-SR-algorithm&quot;) ){\n        return enhancedSplineReticulation();\n      }else{\n        return oldFashionedSplineReticulation();\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAll well and good as long as the enhancedSplineReticulation returns the exact same structure that the old one did. If it doesn&#x27;t, then a bunch of code that handles the new reticulated splines also needs to be behind a flag (because the structure changed). And that could mean a chunk of UI needs to be duplicated behind a flag because it changed, and so on.<p>How do you use feature flags when the features aren&#x27;t just trivial changes to methodology, but affect multiple parts of the system?')
