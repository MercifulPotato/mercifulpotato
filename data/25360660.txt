I just want a webapp up and running, with a database and cache server, and I have again and again launched Elastic Beanstalk + Elasticache + RDS (or the GCP version) in half a day following basic tutorials, and this system runs very well (and scales very well) with zero need to &quot;dive into documentation&quot; for various things. I can then focus on my app instead of infra. It&#x27;s still not clear why such simple architectures need kubernetes.')
