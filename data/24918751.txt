The criminals stole data and blackmailed people. Bitcoin didn&#x27;t do that. If Bitcoin didn&#x27;t exist, criminals would still steal data and blackmail people. Blackmail existed long before Bitcoin. Perhaps it&#x27;s marginally easier because of Bitcoin, although accepting your payment for crimes via a system where all transactions are public record doesn&#x27;t seem that smart to me, but whatever.<p>Banning things doesn&#x27;t stop criminals from using them. It doesn&#x27;t even stop many otherwise law-abiding people. Many of the people who support banning guns are able to recognize that banning drugs doesn&#x27;t stop people from using drugs and banning abortions doesn&#x27;t stop people from getting abortions, so why should banning guns stop shootings?<p>If you want to stop people from doing something, you need to figure out <i>why</i> they&#x27;re doing it and remove the reason that causes them to do it. The existence of guns doesn&#x27;t <i>cause</i> people to shoot up schools. Likewise the existence of Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t <i>cause</i> people to blackmail. If it&#x27;s not the cause, then removing it can&#x27;t remove the effect.')
