I am already taking care of my mental health doing therapy and taking prescripted meds for depression.<p>A few weeks ago, I had a depressive crisis where I couldn&#x27;t do anything related to study&#x2F;work and kept reflecting about life for a few days.<p>With help from my psychiatrist, I noticed I had set up impossibly high expectations for my life and because of that, everything I accomplished always felt like it was nothing or it felt like it was something already expected for me to accomplish. Because of that, much of what I do feels empty and does not give me pleasure.<p>I&#x27;m 26 and I&#x27;m finishing my Master&#x27;s Degree, researching NLP, but it feels like there are not many jobs which I could work as a researcher where I live. I also don&#x27;t feel prepared to move to another country to join a big company (I want to work at MS someday lol).<p>All of that makes me feel like what I am doing is for nothing and that it has no meaning. I also feel locked into a path which I don&#x27;t enjoy much anymore. While I want to work as a researcher, to learn more and make use of all I&#x27;ve learned until now, I want to try other things related to computers.<p>It looks like I&#x27;ve been rambling for a while. I am not really sure what I wanted to accomplish writing this, but I think the main points are:\n* How to fix my expectations to make accomplishments matter?\n* While NLP is an interesting topic, it feels like there are not many opportunities where I live;\n* I want to try new things besides Machine Learning, but I feel locked in this path already.\nMaybe it&#x27;s already implied, but I am not from the US.')
