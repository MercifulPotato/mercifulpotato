As others have noted, pizza usually does. And Asian stir fry type dishes are mostly pretty decent. Basic fried chicken (or rotisserie chicken) are fine too actually. They&#x27;re not totally top drawer fried chicken like you get at a good restaurant that specializes in it but it&#x27;s pretty good heated up in the oven. Soups. Etc.<p>And then there are a lot of foods that just aren&#x27;t going to be good. Basically, if it&#x27;s something that either cold or that you would normally consider reheating in the oven or microwave it&#x27;s probably OK. Otherwise, not.<p>And, as others have noted, take-out you have more control over. There are some sandwiches I&#x27;ll order from a local place and pickup given that I know I&#x27;ll be home in less than 10 minutes. I&#x27;d be less tempted if I knew it might be sitting in a delivery car for an hour.')
