Having a small office\nat a WeWork has been awesome.<p>I need a lot of dedicated focus when I&#x27;m writing code, which I&#x27;ve spent much more time doing lately.\nHaving a dedicated space for this really helps. I still miss travelling and having as much time for\nmyself as I did then, but I also really like being able to spend more time with my wife.<p>(I also like having the office because I need a commute; being in our apartment all day was a huge\nletdown in the past, even with walks and such.)')
