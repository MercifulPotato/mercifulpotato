Observing the overworked state one is in, but throwing a “no but I’m still good eh, don’t get me wrong” after to back pedal it a bit. Almost as if everyone was guilty, or if they had to show they are also as strong as the next guy working 60hs.<p>I work at a place where people feel like they will be fired if they work less than 50h&#x2F;week when they are exempt even if they could finish the work in 36hs.<p>I notice this is embedded in the American work culture.  Feeling sorry for not working more than the amount of time they are being paid for.<p>Working from home and going back to the computer after hours because idk.<p>I’m not sure if it’s not having anything else to do and getting anxious, hating the life at home, wanting to show they are “so exhausted”, pride, or what, but we need to start thinking differently if we want to be healthier together.')
