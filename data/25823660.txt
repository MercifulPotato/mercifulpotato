Item(by='shiftingleft', descendants=None, kids=[25823751], score=None, time=1610988746, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25823038, text='Thanks a lot for the detailed answer!<p>I&#x27;m familiar with some subset of coding and number theory, so you can assume at least some more knowledge (Galois Fields, or basics of RS codes for example).<p>Small nitpick: The Vandermonde matrix actually isn&#x27;t square. It&#x27;s a (k × n) matrix, (where typically k ≠ n). Therefore, it can&#x27;t be invertible.<p>I see that many codes contain a parity bit (for example the extended Golay code), however I don&#x27;t see how the operation of recovering &quot;the missing number&quot; could be implemented in terms of a code and its encoding&#x2F;decoding algorithms.<p>I&#x27;ve found this on stackoverflow: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;3492967&#x2F;3868157" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;3492967&#x2F;3868157</a><p>It describes a way to recover the missing number by constructing a Vandermonde matrix using the given numbers. This would correspond to constructing a generator matrix of a specific RS code [1].\nHowever, after this I&#x27;m not so sure about the relation between encoding&#x2F;decoding and recovering the missing number.<p>In the end they also factor a polynomial (that could be something analogous to the error locator polynomial?).<p>[1]: although I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s strictly an RS code')
