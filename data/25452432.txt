This slow speed is usually perceived as the primary difficulty with using HF.<p>That&#x27;s certainly enough to pretty much hose a TCP&#x2F;IP for practical use because of protocol overhead and the latency the link speed enforces. I did some unwise experiments with <i>really long</i> serial links that topped out in that neighborhood; several layers less complicated than anything real world useable.<p>However, we still have the whole layer of protocols that evolved for quite similar conditions; which include serial terminal &#x2F; command line &#x2F; file transfer protocols from the modem days. While they&#x27;re not suited for broadcast, the lessons and designs knowledge they embody largely apply.')
