Let&#x27;s say Microsoft open source Windows&#x27; kernel (now that would be interesting!), and a new company comes with their own custom OS built on top of it, I would definitely support them, even though the technology is the same.<p>Would it be better if there would be a different, new system, based on new technology? Perhaps, from a technology point of view at least, but that&#x27;s a completely different topic.')
