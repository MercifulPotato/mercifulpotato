Tons of repetition, tons of boilerplate by other names.<p>It&#x27;s like the simplicity gets in the way of itself.<p>-<p>My take is, use Go for a bit, take the &quot;less is more&quot; mentality with you to a language more suited for real work.<p>ps: I&#x27;m not saying you can&#x27;t use Go for real work before someone flies at me. I&#x27;m just saying that Go&#x27;s strength is the mentality people have when using it, as a language it&#x27;s not particularly enabling, and that&#x27;s by design if anything...')
