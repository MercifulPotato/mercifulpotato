A load might take any number of cycles depending on whether the line is in L1, L2 or L3 cache, with static compile time VLIW then the compiler has to guess, if it&#x27;s optimistic the whole CPU stalls, if it&#x27;s pessimistic then you&#x27;re much slower than you would otherwise be.<p>I believe this is the real thing that make superscalar OoO (ie. JIT to VLIW in silicon) win.')
