In terms of licensing - the code is already BSD-2.<p>Re: the another note - yes, indeed. I too realized this, because mis-detected notes are <i>usually</i> off by a full octave.<p>As a side note, after going reading through various papers on the subject, it would seem that an ultimate note detector should really be based on a Const-Q spectrum analyzer feeding into an NN. Training the net, even from scratch, can be as simple as sitting in front of a piano and then repeatedly playing each note in all possible ways. Then, throw this detector in a group with waveform-based detectors, get a weighted consensus and that should, in theory, be pretty damn accurate.')
