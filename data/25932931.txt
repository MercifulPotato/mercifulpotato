(E.g. if it&#x27;s a bash script, $1 will be &quot;bash&quot;, which on my system matches lots of things.)<p>Also, a 2s sleep will slow things down if you want to use it for a whole lot of jobs.<p>Also, this won&#x27;t run your second command if the first command you wait for has already exited!<p>Also, shouldn&#x27;t $* be `shift; &quot;$@&quot;` or do you only ever queue jobs of the same command?')
