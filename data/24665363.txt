My 2015 50&quot; (50PN5300) 1080p plasma screen is only rivaled by new OLEDs, doubles as a space heater in winter time :) This one still has their old Netcast OS.<p>The newer webOs models with magic remote that you can use as a pointer are super nice too, but admittedly my 43UJ701V sometimes does reboot it self, the old Netcast plasma is rock solid.<p>I landed on LG because my requirements were &quot;no Android&quot; and &quot;I hate Samsung&quot;, LG are the only ones left pretty much.')
