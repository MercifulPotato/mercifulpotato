Item(by='kaizoku111', descendants=None, kids=[25552985], score=None, time=1609088489, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25550280, text='Was expecting something like DESCRIBE but for less technical audience.<p>As a heavy SQL user, I don&#x27;t see much benefit in this as of yet. It is very misleading in saying it is the &quot;most human readable&quot; format, when the example shows the &quot;format&quot; to be identical to the original. Just by upper-casing keywords doesn&#x27;t make it any more readable to be honest.<p>Anyways a good attempt, hope you&#x27;re not offended by critical feedbacks and hope they are useful for some ideas to improve the tool.')
