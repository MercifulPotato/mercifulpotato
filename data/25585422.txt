You can supply a move or swap expression to Pottery to swap non-bitwise-movable types, you can supply array access expressions to sort non-contiguous arrays, and it has the heapsort fallback to guarantee O(nlogn) performance.<p>I don&#x27;t have a Timsort yet though. For that, swenson&#x27;s implementation is surely the best.')
