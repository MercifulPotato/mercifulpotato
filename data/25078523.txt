Item(by='arminiusreturns', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605238434, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25077809, text='This view frustrates me because it ignores what the founders based the constitution on, namely, the history of governments across the world and philosophical underpinnings of the enlightenment and renaissance that enabled them. Madison in particular studied such a wide array of topics in his forumaltion of proposed systems that hardly anyone I know of even today could even come close in understanding the big picture view he did due to that study. Ask any modern politician about what philsopher was the main originator of the checks and balances system and I bet almost none of them would even know Montesquieu&#x27;s name, much less have read him. The same for the people who then talk about the contitution as being some outdated document of rich slave owners that should be completely rewritten. It&#x27;s just become a trope narrative to me that gets tiring to hear from those who love to pontificate on the subject without being more informed.<p>As for non-Americans, I think those foundational principles, if not the constitution itself, should be valued just as much elsewhere as they are in America (in theory at least). Perhaps I have a too naively positive a view of the extent of liberal education in Europe and elsewhere.<p>As Christopher Hitchens said: &quot;The American Revolution, the one that says, build your public on individual rights, not group rights, have a bill of rights that inscribes these and makes theme legible to everybody, separate the church from the state, separate the executive from the judicial, and the political branch. Do all these things; It doesn&#x27;t sound like much but it&#x27;s really a very revolutionary idea. There is hardly a country in the world that wouldn&#x27;t benefit from adopting those principles. I think that gives the United States a really good claim to be a revolutionary country as well as of course, paradoxically a very conservative one.&quot;')
