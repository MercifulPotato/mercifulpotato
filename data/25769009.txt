I haven&#x27;t used it in my own projects, but based on all the discussion I&#x27;ve seen, it looks like a solid choice.<p>Meanwhile, we in the Redux team recently published an alpha library that we&#x27;ve dubbed &quot;RTK Query&quot; [0].  It takes inspiration from data fetching libraries like React Query, SWR, Apollo, and Urql, and provides similar sophisticated data fetching and caching capabilities.  But, it&#x27;s built on top of Redux Toolkit, which enables integration with the rest of the Redux addon ecosystem and the Redux DevTools.  Once we&#x27;ve finalized the design of the new APIs, we&#x27;re going to merge them back into Redux Toolkit itself, so that they&#x27;ll just be additional exports from Redux Toolkit.  I&#x27;m really excited about how this will let Redux users simplify their code, and wrote a comment over on Reddit today about how RTK Query changes things for Redux users [1].<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rtk-query-docs.netlify.app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rtk-query-docs.netlify.app</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;reactjs&#x2F;comments&#x2F;kw9cr3&#x2F;recently_picked_up_react_js_with_hooks_and_just&#x2F;gj4gan4&#x2F;?context=3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;reactjs&#x2F;comments&#x2F;kw9cr3&#x2F;recently_pi...</a>')
