And I mean this much more generally, I have worked quite a long time for quite a lot of companies. The amount of PTO that is given up, which I was privy to, was staggering.<p>The interesting thing is I used to try to force people who worked for me to take more time off and they would complain. I think in many ways it was the example I set, which was bad, of always working. It&#x27;s a regret I honestly have. I&#x27;m also happy now that I am just an individual contributor. I don&#x27;t have to try to change that culture anymore. I only need to change me.')
