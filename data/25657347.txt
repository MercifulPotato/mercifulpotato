Currently doing it with Sperry Labs (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sperrylabs.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sperrylabs.com</a>). I have found that when an idea takes off into a successful product, the entire studio ends up going that direction until exit, then you just start over with a new studio. But I have seen successful exits with Brightcove, oobgolf, and AirCare Labs. And successful products with Dynasign, ServiceCapture, Callbot, and Play Impossible Gameball.')
