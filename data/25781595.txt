Indoor farming will have its place. I would say land is NOT in demand though, population trends clearly shows people&#x2F;society migrating towards high density cities as opposed to spreading out where there is land (central US). You can literally drive around the Midwest and see <i>tens of millions of acres</i> that have no other purposes than....to just sit there, chilling.<p>The &#x27;buy land, they don&#x27;t make more of it&#x27; is almost a meme at this point. We have plenty of land.<p>ETA: I had the spice and niche crops comment in my first comment, so yes we agree. Most of farming is to produce starch,oil, or protein at scale. Spices are a very very very (very) small slice')
