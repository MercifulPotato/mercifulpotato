I watched the videos and the police could easily stop them by using deadly force. They decided not to and the protestors took advantage of it. There was only one woman who got shot from my understanding. I think the police should get a lot of credit here. That&#x27;s the police we want to see - officers who use common sense and don&#x27;t apply deadly force unless someone is in serious danger (I didn&#x27;t see the xx รง video of the shooting yet). Unfortunately a lot of people including many celbreties decided to ignore that and instead focus on white privilege and if those were black people the result was different. Some people don&#x27;t want peace, just wars.<p>With that being said, you cannot take it lightly. The FBI should take it very seriously. We all remember Timothy Mcveigh. I really hope the next few weeks will pass quietly.')
