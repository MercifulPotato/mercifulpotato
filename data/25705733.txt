Without function overloading, those patterns can become harder.<p>Secondly, Rust macro system is crazily powerful especially procedural macros. That power disincentivizes developing other approaches to meta programming. In C++ macros are clunky and dangerous, and that has incentivized developing more type based meta programming techniques to get away from C macros.')
