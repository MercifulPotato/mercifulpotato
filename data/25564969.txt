R&#x2F;E has been appreciating at over 6% per year.<p>You&#x27;re going to make almost 10x as much money doing nothing as you would renting the building - even if the rent was 100% profit (it&#x27;s not). In this case, the landlord would need to do a ton of repairs and probably wouldn&#x27;t even cash-flow for 2 years.<p>For 10% more profit? That sounds like unnecessary &#x2F; excessive risk to me.')
