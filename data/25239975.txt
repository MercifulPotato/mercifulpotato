The shell (probably csh) had created the file &quot;out&quot; <i>before</i> it expanded the *, so my grep command was forever finding &quot;string&quot; in it&#x27;s own output. It filled the disk before I realized what was happening. I just did a quick test and bash seems to create the output file after doing the globbing, and under tcsh, grep gave a warning that the output file was also an input file and it did not search it.')
