I&#x27;ve used AWS Cognito which is probably one of the cheapest along with Auth0 and Okta.<p>I&#x27;ve even migrated from my (our) own to another provider and back, including provider to provider without an issue. I was initially concerned with vendor lock-in, but it hasn&#x27;t been a major problem so far. With most of them it is fairly easy to migrate without any interruption to your users (including MFA!).')
