We don&#x27;t compare in absolute means, but relative to people around us. If you&#x27;re a middle class and you pay the same taxes as everyone else around you, you might grumble a bit, but in the end you&#x27;ll except it as a part of life, because, well, everybody does it. If you make a lot more money than others and thus have to pay a lot more taxes, you&#x27;ll perceive it as an injustice, being punished by mediocrity for your success. And you&#x27;ll have a much less of morale dilemma should you try avoid paying it.')
