Smalltalk is undoubtedly impressive. However, many heroic sagas are rather marketing hypes than based on true facts.<p>&gt; <i>The Smalltalk galaxy was at the origin of the Graphical User Interface (GUI)</i><p>Well, the operating system of the Alto and the first groundbreaking WYSIWYG desktop applications were written in BCPL. Sure, Smalltalk did also run on the Alto, but the responsibles apparently have not considered it suitable for practical use. See e.g. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;xeroxalto.computerhistory.org&#x2F;xerox_alto_file_system_archive.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;xeroxalto.computerhistory.org&#x2F;xerox_alto_file_system_...</a>.<p>&gt; <i>And since Java was strongly influenced by Objective-C, Smalltalkâ€™s legacy amplified even more.</i><p>A bold claim. Actually Java was the implementation of the Simula 67 object model with a C syntax. Smalltalk was not involved here (neither Obj-C). Gosling is quite clear in this respect. The HotSpot JIT eventually was implemented by the folks who were already involved with the Self JIT, but it would be far-fetched to attribute these achievements to Smalltalk.<p>Even more points, but I&#x27;m running out of time.')
