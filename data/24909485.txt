If you have a library of content locally that you have NOT submitted to the cloud storage, then it won&#x27;t show up on the update.<p>I went and used time machine to get an old version of the app and removed the upgrade.yml from the contents of the app package as well, so it won&#x27;t auto upgrade.<p>This was a really bad handling of the upgrade. It is unrealistic to expect that someone with a large enough library of content locally to also put this all in the cloud for storage. I have a curated library of content so I can work offline.')
