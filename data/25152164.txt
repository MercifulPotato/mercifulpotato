I find that exhausting, because most jobs will have you working on things you don&#x27;t particularly care about because you&#x27;re not a user of the product, or there&#x27;s no societal impact stemming from the work you do.<p>So I job where I could put in 8h a day doing whatever tasks are handed to me, and nothing else, sounds perfect.')
