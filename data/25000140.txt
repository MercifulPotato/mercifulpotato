If you say x=2, type(x) will say “int”.<p>It does suffer from an excessive overloading of operators (“a” times 6 shouldn’t work). But that’s neither here nor there.<p>If Python wasn’t strongly typed, it wouldn’t be conceptually possible to move it towards <i>explicit</i> typing as the current push is.<p>Now, it’s not <i>statically</i> typed. You don’t get to assign values and interpretations to memory addresses. This is what “performant” people usually defend. But _that_ has nothing to do with typing assuming semantic roles in codebases.')
