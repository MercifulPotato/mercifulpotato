C evades this problem by letting you &quot;escape&quot; the type system. Many people criticize this without being aware that the language would be useless without this feature.<p>I don&#x27;t think that an expressive type system rejects more programs though. You don&#x27;t have to escape the type system that often in C++ (compared to C).<p>Nonetheless I probably should look up some design patterns you can do in lisp, to get a feel for what I&#x27;m missing')
