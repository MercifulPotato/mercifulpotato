Like for example if you look at &#x2F;r&#x2F;Bitcoin, there&#x27;s a sidebar with &quot;Submit text&#x2F;link NOT about price&quot;, yet virtually every post is about price, even if just indirectly (Paypal joins the cryptocurrency bandwagon and the top comments are that this is good for the price). Searching for Bitcoin on YouTube is likewise not a good idea unless you want to listen to dudes rambling about the price for hours. Back when I bought my first Bitcoin, I couldn&#x27;t care less about the price. I spent it almost immediately for servers and other digital services. I don&#x27;t regret that I didn&#x27;t &quot;HODL&quot; it. What really counts is whether it is sound money and all the speculation doesn&#x27;t help in that regard. If anything, the usefulness of e.g. Bitcoin declines due to rising transaction costs and constant price swings.')
