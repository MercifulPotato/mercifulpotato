Item(by='patrec', descendants=None, kids=[25403406], score=None, time=1607814636, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25402003, text='Yeah, it&#x27;s annoying that unix filenames and shell quoting are both fundamentally broken and that (as above) people would generally (knowingly) write a a broken-for-spaces-in-filenames version by default because it&#x27;s easier (and the author no doubt knew he&#x27;d not encounter spaces in his repo). Having said that, it&#x27;s not very hard to fix, I&#x27;d probably write something like:<p><pre><code>    git status -s | awk -vORS=&quot;\\0&quot; &#x27;gsub(&#x2F;^ D &#x2F;,&quot;&quot;)&#x27; | xargs -0 git checkout --\n</code></pre>\nWhich is about the same length. This will still break for malicious input (newlines in filename), but for the original use case that&#x27;s not a concern.')
