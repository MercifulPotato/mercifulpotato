Shor here speaks about how Democrats get oversampled as both in 2016, and 2020 due to different levels of engagement and trust over the election:<p>&gt;&gt; It used to be that once you control for age and race and gender and education, that people who trusted their neighbors basically voted the same as people who didn’t trust their neighbors. But then, starting in 2016, suddenly that shifted. If you look at white people without college education, high-trust non-college whites tended toward [Democrats], and low-trust non-college whites heavily turned against us. In 2016, we were polling this high-trust electorate, so we overestimated Clinton. These low-trust people still vote, even if they’re not answering these phone surveys.<p>Is this shift partially because Trump and then QAnon have shifted Trump-voters trust in institutions - thus the voters that don&#x27;t respond to pollsters are shifting as the Republican party becomes more radicalized?')
