Eg:<p><pre><code>    (proves a b)\n</code></pre>\n<i>So far saying “the sequence with the Gödel Number a proves the formula with Gödel Number b”</i><p>In my experience, most mathematicians would have instead written &quot;So far saying &#x27;a proves b&#x27;&quot;. Repeating the type of the parameters consistently made it significantly easier for me to follow along. I hope this becomes more common.')
