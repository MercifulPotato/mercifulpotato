It&#x27;s simple.<p>It is, but it&#x27;s really REALLY not. I&#x27;d bet that most everyone knows what they should be eating and doing to lose weight &#x2F; be healthy. It&#x27;s probably obvious to most adults. Some people just have conditions where they can NOT lose weight. And then there&#x27;s the rest of us. We know it&#x27;s that simple. We know we should not eat a bag of Doritos for dinner. We know a pint of ice cream is not a snack. But it&#x27;s what our bodies crave, and fighting that takes energy and focus. And today we had a bad day at work. Today when we got home we had to fight with the kids to do homework. This weekend there&#x27;s a big party and we&#x27;re not ready. Next week there&#x27;s a huge project due at work. Are we going fight the urge to eat a bag of cheese balls before bed? Nope, we just don&#x27;t have the energy. We&#x27;ll start next week, when there&#x27;s not so much going on.<p>As simple as it seems to you, it&#x27;s not at all simple for many MANY people. They need help, and they need support. And that&#x27;s why Weight Watchers exists. Losing weight is somehow simultaneously very easy and nearly impossibly hard for most of us.')
