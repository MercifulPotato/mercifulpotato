Such people must exist somewhere and thus I should not exclude them from existence. For the rest of people I strongly believe they either use a search engine, a virtual assistant, or go directly to Wikipedia. The search engine scrape Wikipedia, the virtual assistant use the search engine to find answers and Wikipedia is Wikipedia. In either case it is highly likely that one is using Wikipedia directly or indirectly.')
