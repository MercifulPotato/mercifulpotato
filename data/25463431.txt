I purchased&#x2F;accessed this from you, I promise I won&#x27;t copy or you can sue me in a private court).\nSure, it&#x27;s not the same level of protection but copyright is proportionally useful to how useful &#x2F; how much money you can make.<p>By doing this, you&#x27;re giving freedom to experiment to everyone, remove legal friction in society and successful products (which are more likely to attract clones and piracy) will have a bit less revenue. Not a bad deal in my book.')
