We’ve been working on client projects (mobile apps, web apps and websites) for the last few years and want to transition into making our own products, be them apps, SAAS, content, courses etc. We’re open minded to what we want to make but know that we want to move away from client work. This will involve a shift in mentality from simply “doing” to explicitly “not doing” and instead planning and researching first.<p>What tips, blog posts, books, communities etc. would you recommend to help shift into the more entrepreneurial mindset?')
