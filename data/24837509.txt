The partnership is that Intel still owns part of the IP, but actual manufacturing with guarantee capacity is still done by Micron. And judging from previous Micron Investor notes, Intel hasn&#x27;t been keeping up with their Optane Sales and buying agreement. So that means Intel will no longer be doing any NAND &#x2F; Optane manufacturing by themselves.<p>Few other point worth noting,<p>Intel has one of the best Enterprise &#x2F; DC SSD range on the market. And they are extremely popular in wholesales channel as well as with System vendors. Intel has been using these SSD as weapons &#x2F; incentives by giving away SSD with enough Xeon CPU volume. One of the few reasons why AMD EPYC hasn&#x27;t been gaining much ground at all in Enterprise segment.<p>The NAND Plant is in China. Wroth pointing out in the current geopolitical climate.<p>NAND is a commodity market. It doesn&#x27;t swing up and down like DRAM in the old days mostly due to less players in the market and HyperScaler&#x27;s volume creating enough buffer. But generally speaking Intel doesn&#x27;t like commodity business. May be not commodity market per se, but Intel doesn&#x27;t like margin fluctuation.<p>Overall I think it is a good move. Most of the time I am very cynical of CFO running companies. But I give Bob Swan some credit because so far things seems to be moving in the right direction. While the pace might not be fast enough. ( Mostly due to inertia ) But at least it is better than BK&#x27;s era.')
