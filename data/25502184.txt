It turns out that the voltage required to keep the write head writing is often less than the voltage required to keep RAM from corrupting.  At least for a time, XFS journaling correctness relied on the kernel being able to prevent garbage writes on loss of power.<p>There used to be big caveats to using XFS on non-SGI hardware.  Though, I think those caveats were roughly &quot;XFS guarantees aren&#x27;t much better than ext3&#x2F;ext4 guarantees on power loss, on non-SGI hardware&quot;.')
