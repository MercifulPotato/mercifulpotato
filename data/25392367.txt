Often, without realizing it, they create problems they are eager to solve to get their dose. Solving problems can be quantified, too. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s hard to quantify the number of problems avoided by manifesting! Often this goes against the first goal I mentioned. For example, solving one problem 10 times gives you closing 10 tickets, making 10 PRs, and contributing a lot more LOCs in a short amount of time. But creating one PR and one ticket, which not only prevents those 10 but 100s and 1,000s more in the future, is quantified as &quot;less work.&quot; I&#x27;ve had this at one job recently where every time I suggested fixing a repeated issue was answered with: &quot;We have a bigger fish to fry.&quot; Yet, we kept wasting time frying tadpoles.')
