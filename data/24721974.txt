I have worked in both F# and Clojure profressionally. I love them both for different reasons.<p>As a fun thought experiment, I have often tried to force myself to choose between them, even though one doesn&#x27;t really have to make a choice. Turns out that it&#x27;s a tough choice to give one up over the other.<p>I tend to lean slightly towards Clojure at present, but then I&#x27;m using it a great deal at work.<p>However, if you&#x27;re looking for a modern strongly typed, immutable functional language with type inference, then F# is really excellent.<p>I haven&#x27;t used Haskell professionally and have only played with it but my feeling is that I prefer F# to Haskell because it has some &quot;escape hatches&quot; built in, in order to interop with C# and other .NET languages; So no IO Monad is required. It feels like more of a supporting structure and less of a straightjacket to me.')
