It&#x27;s basically WhatsApp, owned by non-profit so that it can&#x27;t be sold to a for-profit. They&#x27;ve been subpoenaed and the only data they could provide for a user was the phone number that was registered, the first day that number registered and the most recent day the phone number contacted their servers.<p>I would suggest reading through their blog posts if you&#x27;re curious about all the work they&#x27;re putting into ensuring that they collect as little data about their users as possible. they truly are innovating in a field where nobody else seems to care about ensuring privacy first.<p>This does come at a cost to how quickly user-facing features arrive compared to their competitors, but this is because they think through where you may leak data and engineer a way around it before allowing a feature to go through. That said, at this point it&#x27;s pretty much at feature parity with WhatsApp, so moving over to it would be a great time to do so.')
