I almost never run into memory issues with it - ran the full complement of browser tabs, Microsoft Office, pixelmator, Photos, VPN Client, bit of Jupyter-labs, etc...<p>I do most of my data engineering in the cloud, or on a 32 GB Linux system - so I don&#x27;t need a lot of memory for data <i>sets</i> - just something that will run the applications.  I would never recommend that the average user buy more than 8GB of memory with a Mac Laptop.<p>Meanwhile - my 16 GB Linux Laptop (Ubuntu 20.04 Dell XPS 15 7590)  <i>routinely</i> comes to a crashing halt if I try and do something crazy like open up 40 Browser Tabs and then start zoom.  It&#x27;s horrible.  I&#x27;ve spent hours trying to see what&#x27;s going on with top to no avail.  If only it was a graceful degradation - but open a single browser tab on the wrong site once you are close to the edge- game over.  Usually faster to just restart the system than wait for whatever swapping is happening to conclude.<p>I&#x27;ve rarely had this happen to me on the MacBook Air.<p>Different operating systems&#x2F;hardware really seem to make a difference using pretty much the same workload, speaking from personal experience of someone who splits their time 50&#x2F;50 on Linux and macOS.')
