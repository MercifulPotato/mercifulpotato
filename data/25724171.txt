These were $65. I also bought $15 barbell clamps.<p>Unfortunately, the dip bar attachments were too narrow for the power racks I was using. So I decided to return everything at once.<p>I was able to return the dip bars but when I tried to return the clamps, Amazon told me to keep the item despite refunding my money.<p>It was so weird.')
