It puts an awful lot of power in the government.<p>When the government says lots of dishonest things, or things that completely lack evidence, it is the duty of anyone with some influence on spreading messages to counteract that problem. In fact, when the government tries to discredit all competing sources of information, that&#x27;s a very dangerous thing.<p>The people arguing against (government) censorship should be well to do to realize that right now, President Donald Trump is the loudest voice in government, and he&#x27;s trying to drown out all opposing messages, and have you only listen to him. Read about the history of censorship, and figure out what kind of message muting you want to fight!')
