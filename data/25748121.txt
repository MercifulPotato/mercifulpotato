It&#x27;s not like a CSV where the entire thing fits on a single line, and all the lines kind of blur together because they&#x27;re so similar.<p>I commit my ledger file to git weekly, but that&#x27;s more of a backup than anything else.<p>I manually enter all my transactions, so data import isn&#x27;t really a problem I worry about (though I know ledger &#x2F; hledger have ways of doing that).')
