Cloudflare lost customers because 8chan became a forum to recruit and radicalize domestic terrorists, and they couldn’t convince their other customers that was ok. I’m not aware of anyone who has shown that Facebook protects a domestic terrorist recruitment community and protects it against the wishes of their customers.<p>So cloudflare pulled its support of 8chan because they lost money, not because of any moral qualms.')
