Item(by='aketchum', descendants=None, kids=[25073429, 25077633], score=None, time=1605203860, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25072514, text='I don&#x27;t have any write ups but off the top of my head I remember issues with data type casting from ddb -&gt; athena via glue. If a ddb number type was an int in one item and a float in a different Item, glue transformed it to a struct ( something like struct(long:null,double:50.50) and struct(long:20,double:null)).  The suggested fix of a cast function didn&#x27;t work.')
