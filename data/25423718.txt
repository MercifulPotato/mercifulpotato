I&#x27;ve dealt with it on my team by rotating the job of responding so that whoever is on-call for the week deals with it. It means there&#x27;s a lot of interruptions, unfortunately, for whoever is on call, but at least the rest of the team is explicitly given permission to ignore it.<p>As a company we could and should do better at the support system, but that&#x27;s just one aspect of the problem with company expectations.')
