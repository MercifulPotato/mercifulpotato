And this response to the Capitol riot is one symptom of that kind of thinking where the actions of a few hundred people are being used to try to de-platform&#x2F;cancel&#x2F;boycott many tens of millions of people.<p>The whole attitude seems very patronizing and condescending because the reality is almost all Trump supporters are “normal” people that don’t want pointless violence.<p>This also causes a very unfortunate and potentially catastrophic feedback loop where Democrats project the actions of extremists onto all Republicans and convince themselves that all republicans need to be canceled&#x2F;re-educated. This, I would not doubt, becomes a sort of self full-filling prophecy of possibly turning more fringe republicans extremist because they rightfully would feel they are being unjustly persecuted based purely on not even the views that they hold, but based on the views Democrats imagine that they hold.')
