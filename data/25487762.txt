Modem is an essential piece in the infrastructure, without it consumer cannot get the service.<p>The fact that telcos itemize the modem means it&#x27;s supposed to be a kind of elective, just as in older days when one could rent a &quot;fancy&quot; phone directly (with a voice-mail indicator!) from the provider. Those were add-ons, with extra fees.<p>I see no validation for not allowing customers to use own modems. Sure, the techical support fee will be gamed in such case. But at least this will clearly separate the infrastructure from the user equipment.<p>If modem indeed falls into user equipment category, then the rental must be elective. If it&#x27;s infrastructure, then it has been already paid for in the delivery fees.')
