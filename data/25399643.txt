This was an algorithmic mistake not a targeted attacked, Twitch is also a free service the use of which is a privilege not a right. This is just a product of the business environment surrounding copyrighted works and advertising, Twitch would be perfectly happy to continue raking in cash from everything on the platform, but that just isn&#x27;t possible.
