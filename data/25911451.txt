The judges dismissed mainly (totally) on two grounds - laches, and failure to state a legal case.  If you&#x27;re just whining, the court isn&#x27;t going to hear you.  Get out of here with that stuff and stop wasting our time, says the court.  They aren&#x27;t your chance to stand up and rant about stuff.<p>And laches is, you didn&#x27;t like the rules?  Sue before the election; you had plenty of time.  You wait until after?  No, we&#x27;re not going to let you hold the election hostage.  Suing after looks like you didn&#x27;t like the <i>results</i> you got under the rules, but you didn&#x27;t have a problem with the rules going in.  Why should the courts let you throw out everybody&#x27;s vote because you didn&#x27;t like the results?  Why do you not think <i>that</i> is ridiculous?')
