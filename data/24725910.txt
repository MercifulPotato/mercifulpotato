If they comply with the license there&#x27;s nothing unethical about it.<p>Selling open source software is one of the <i>valid</i> ways open source reaches end users.  Users&#x2F;Consumers want to buy polished, maintained, and supported things.  That costs resources to provide.<p>From a user perspective, having a preference for FOSS software shouldn&#x27;t limit your options to unsupported abandonware you couldn&#x27;t pay for if you wanted.<p>Recall the F in FOSS is Free as in Free Speech, not Free Beer.')
