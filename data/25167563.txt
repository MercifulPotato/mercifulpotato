I agree with most of the specific examples you pointed out, and generally agree that big blockbuster films &#x2F; network television shows are trash, for more reasons than just the recent diversity push.  I 100% agree that token black &#x2F; token gay characters are problematic.<p>My idea of representation is:  Let people with interesting stories tell their stories.  Modern audiences don&#x27;t really care if the protagonist looks like them, so let&#x27;s push for interesting stories rather than a specific character archetype.  Invite writers of all backgrounds to the table, and allow their experiences to shape the story.')
