The UI code appears immediate but on each invocation builds a data structure that represents the layout and references to data it depends on. The library consumes this data structure, compares it to its own internal, retained representation and adjusts the latter according to any changes that might have occurred. Input is consumed by the &quot;retained mode&quot; GUI toolkit, which triggers the immediate mode UI to re-render with return values from widgets adjusted according to the &quot;immediate mode&quot; result of the input.<p>The difference from React would be representational. In React you explicitly build this data structure as something resembling a DOM tree and handle input by attaching callbacks to nodes, but I think this representation is just convenient for web development rather than fundamental to the approach.<p>You might still need a way to manage updates to the state the GUI depends on and re-render when it changes for some other reason than an input operation.')
