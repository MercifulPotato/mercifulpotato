The goal is to replicate the output of &quot;xxd -p -c 16 &lt;thefile&gt;&quot;, and perhaps allow a few more options.<p>So yeah, self contained puzzles like AoC, Project Euler, Rosalind, etc is the migration path. It&#x27;s hard to find something reasonably educational and medium level to work on; meanwhile I&#x27;m not exactly free to arbitrarily switch to langX at work.<p>I&#x27;m also a roguelike fan and every year I think about trying out a very simple 7DRL in some language I&#x27;d like to learn, but without libtcod bindings I&#x27;d spend all the time working on i&#x2F;o and display and not any actual game logic. However, something along these lines is probably my best bet for a medium educational &quot;fun&quot; project for language learning so I should figure out how to use libtcod from langX!<p>The puzzle projects do let me get familiar with parsing command line args, reading&#x2F;writing files, splitting input and strings, etc. So that&#x27;s definitely valuable.')
