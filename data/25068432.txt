It&#x27;s only useful for spaghetti code monoliths.\nIf you make your code modular with good tests, you won&#x27;t need type safety because your modules will be simple enough that your tests will easily catch these errors.<p>My view is that TypeScript encourages developers to write overly complex spaghetti code because it encourages devs to pass around active object references instead of simple primitives like strings, numbers or other primitive data types.<p>Alan Kay, one of the founders of OOP himself said that the point of OOP is not objects, &quot;The big idea is messaging&quot;. Passing around complex typed instances goes completely against that. An instance is not a message. Complex instances (which have their own state and methods) are not messages; they should generally not be used for messaging between different components (I.e. as arguments or return values).')
