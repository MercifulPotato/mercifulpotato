Imagine if we could remove <i>all</i> of the military in the world? The savings would be quite large, I&#x27;d think. And the best thing, with no armies around, we would need no army for protection from other armies, so it all works out!<p>It&#x27;s but a pipe dream, of course, but a nice one.<p>Again, the size of the modern military forces is another indicator of how much of population can be removed from doing any sort of productive work without crushing the economy. Throw in the military industrial complex which diverts lots of resources while producing mostly the tools of destruction that, again, are mostly either used up during the training or left unused and scrapped 50 years later.<p>So, back to the original topic. Suspending all those services doesn&#x27;t directly impact the ability of the &quot;production of basic commodities&quot; part of economy to keep providing those necessities, they impact it because of the way the flows of money set up. If all the restaurants in Seattle close, it&#x27;s not like the farmers in Washington suddenly physically can&#x27;t grow as much as potatoes and raise as much cattle as before. They can, so there is no reason for the restaurant workers to starve or go unsheltered, the production capacity hasn&#x27;t decreased, it&#x27;s just the way the distribution of goods is arranged that such deterioration in quality of life may happen.')
