It&#x27;s still going. As is the 2009 Mac Mini I got from eBay in which I just upgraded the RAM and hard drive (to an SSD).<p>It&#x27;s a similar story for me with smartphones. My first was a Droid X2. After about 9 months I switched to an iPhone 4 and used it for the next 5 years. Then upgraded to a 6s which I only retired for an 11 Pro last year because work bought it for me. They all work fine today.<p>I babied every Dell&#x2F;Sony machine and that Droid just like every Apple product I&#x27;ve purchased since; this is just the proof I&#x27;ve found in the pudding after eating both kinds.')
