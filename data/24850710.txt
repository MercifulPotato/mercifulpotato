Item(by='panda888888', descendants=None, kids=[24856434], score=None, time=1603305420, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24846626, text='I&#x27;ve been having a localization issue in Gmail that&#x27;s even more frustrating and unacceptable than this one.<p>I speak English but regularly correspond with people who speak Hebrew. Hebrew is written from right to left, so &quot;john doe&quot; is written &quot;eod nhoj.&quot; This is normal. But when Gmail writes Hebrew names in English, it often transposes the letters only and not the first&#x2F;last fields, so you end up with &quot;Doe John.&quot; The problem is that this happens inconsistently, so you never know if it&#x27;s going to occur.<p>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve mixed up people&#x27;s first and last names, which is embarrassing! Because I don&#x27;t speak Hebrew, I don&#x27;t have a natural sense for which names are first names vs which names are last names, so sometimes it&#x27;s impossible for me to decipher which is which.<p>Very frustrating.')
