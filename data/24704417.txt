Think of all the services that would need to expand -- markets, restaurants, hair salons, etc.<p>Furthermore, immigrants contribute more to the tax base than citizens because they pay the same income taxes without getting all the deductions, they pay sales taxes and other taxes, and do not get the same benefits.<p>It&#x27;s well established that an immigrant with a job is a net contributor to both the economy and the tax base.<p>Do this thought experiment -- so many immigrants come to the US and contribute so much to the tax base that there is enough to pay every US citizen $75,000 a year in UBI and provide universal healthcare for citizens.  Now you can do whatever you want, work or not, it doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s good for citizens.')
