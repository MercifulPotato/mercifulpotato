The problem is I don&#x27;t see anyway companies drop Microsoft. Everyone already has teams or chat for free, are they going to pay for slack now? Assuming slack moves to the same model, buy the salesforce suite and get slack, how much added value is slack really providing? Will companies be willing to pay more now that slack is included even though they already have chat apps? I&#x27;m not super knowledgeable on salesforce, but afaik only sales people have the subscription, so will companies have different chat apps for sales and everyone else? Seems like it would be easier to just put the sales people on teams with everyone else. Is slack a big enough perk that it would stop companies that are considering dropping salesforce? Is that worth 28 billion? That&#x27;s really the only use I see. I agree this is a great move for slack, questioning how salesforce is able to leverage slack here when everyone else gives their chats away for free.')
