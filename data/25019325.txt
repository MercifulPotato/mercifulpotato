In the VC case, the lawyers are not negotiating, just doing paperwork, moreover, when you&#x27;re going to jail for fraud, it&#x27;s not like you are exchanging money with the people prosecuting you.<p>As long as you know that the legal fees for the transaction are part of the valuation ahead of time, and it&#x27;s part of the valuation calculus, then it really doesn&#x27;t matter that much.')
