Item(by='gambiting', descendants=None, kids=[25347715], score=None, time=1607441560, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25346385, text='Because Beats have the same quality that Apple products do - people who buy Beats headphones continue buying them, regardless of any other options.<p>I myself own several headphones from different brands, and yet Beats Studio are still my favourite ones - there&#x27;s just something about that muddy, dirty bass that no other manufacturer can replicate. Even Sony&#x27;s extra bass headphones with bass cranked up to +10 in EQ don&#x27;t get anywhere close. For certain styles of music, they are the best headphones I own. And yeah, the hinges have broken years ago, the headband peeled off just as long ago, but they still work and sound as I like - I&#x27;d happily go and buy another pair.<p>Apple aims to capture the same market - people who buy AirPods Pro don&#x27;t compare them with earphones from Sony or Sennheiser - they buy them because they are made by Apple and they integrate well with other Apple products. That&#x27;s all.')
