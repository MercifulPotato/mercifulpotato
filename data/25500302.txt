Before Facebook, the same thing existed but in a different form. You as a small business owner would have to buy placement in niche TV shows or radio programs or a local niche magazine... but for some small businesses, it could be a no go because they&#x27;d have to consider a much bigger than required marketing budget. Targeting solves this problem, for small businesses and for users who get suggested the things they&#x27;re likely to buy and use. In fact, it&#x27;s not just good for users being targeted, it&#x27;s even better for those who are not being targeted because they don&#x27;t have to be bombarded with products they&#x27;d never be interested in.<p>The reason Apple is deciding the default for the users when it comes to Facebook learning about the user is to deliberately hurt small businesses and give their users fake sense of &quot;privacy&quot;... and to not let other platforms flourish.<p>Apple needs to be legally challanged for monopolistic practices i.e. disallowing users to choose what software they get to run on devices they purchase. Users should be able to download and install Microsoft App Store, Samsung App Store, Epic Games Store... and install any software they want. Why is Apple allowed to restrict what software users can run? Apple is big and too much of a monopoly. Its hardware and software divisions need to be separated and other companies should be allowed to license and sell their hardware with whatever software they want. Users should be able to choose what software comes with their devices.')
