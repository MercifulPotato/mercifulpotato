Except in China, YouTube isn&#x27;t a choice at all (even via a flaky VPN, video streaming is iffy).<p>As another analogy, there have been resemblances made between Trump and Xi as both being authoritarians. However, one was unelected, and one declared himself president for life. Huge difference (and if Trump overturns the election, that difference will be gone, but that&#x27;s a huge &quot;if&quot;).')
