Remember COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus, which is why it&#x27;s spread so much so fast, no one is immune at first. But to suggest that the covid death numbers will be this high year after year after year is unlikely in my opinion, as is shown by the fact that many places with big first waves (north italy, sweden, london) don&#x27;t have a second wave (especially in death numbers).')
