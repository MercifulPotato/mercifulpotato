Were the votes counted wrong, as <i>Barnette v. Lawrence</i> insisted, or were the voting procedures unconstitutional, as claimed in <i>Bognet v. Boockvar</i>, or did Dominion Systems somehow install compromised voting machines? The latter claim is currently the subject of a defamation suit targeting one Rudy Giuliani.<p>The argument that what happened in 2020 is anything like the few objections raised in 2000 and 2004 is dishonest and reeks of disinformation. Nobody stormed the Capitol in 2000. No politicians tried to put pressure on state officials like Brad Raffensperger to manipulate the counting process. Nobody tried to disrupt <i>the counting process itself</i> in 2000, whereas Republicans filed lawsuits to prevent all votes being counted in Pennsylvania. Most importantly, no Democratic politician ever insisted to their constituents that the election <i>would be</i> overturned, whereas Trump <i>did</i>.')
