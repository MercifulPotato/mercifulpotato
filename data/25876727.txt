News sites could aggregate charges and bill you at the end of the month.<p>I think the bigger issues is that if I see an article presented to me as shared on social media or in search results I assume it is free access. I click in, and if they ask for payment, it&#x27;s a turnoff since I thought it was going to be free. Also, I don&#x27;t like how credit card information can be continuously used by the organization.<p>I want to be able to hand an authorization for a single one-time payment to any organization and not an authorization to charge however much they want, whenever they want.<p>That goes for hotels too. I want to be able to say &quot;Here&#x27;s my credit card&quot; [but I don&#x27;t authorize more than $130&#x2F;day].')
