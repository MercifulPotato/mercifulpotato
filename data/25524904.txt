There is no HIPAA here.<p>Any additional data from health-tech, even if indirectly to just target advertisements could be used as an ammunition for further discrimination by parallel construction bypassing anti-discriminatory guidelines&#x2F;laws from the Govt.(like they&#x27;re already doing).<p>Of course insurers can collect health-tech data without direct access to the device through their own app, Say &#x27;We need permission to access health data from X app for 5% discount in premium&#x27; would not invoke resistance from those who don&#x27;t know that they are falling into a greater pit.')
