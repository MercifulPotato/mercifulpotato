I can only speak for Germany, but here the „tax“ also includes health insurance and other social securities. So if unemployment, a kid or sickness happens to that single person, they don’t need as much rainy days funds. Also a lot of things are cheaper in Germany, e.g. Housing, Groceries, etc. but you mention that already.')
