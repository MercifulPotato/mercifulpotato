They&#x27;re often in the 100s with some drives over 1000. The faster drives also use MLC or TLC which has lower latency, better endurance, and higher performance than the more higher capacity QLC.<p>For example the Samsung 1TB 970 PRO (not the 980 PRO) has a 1200TBW rating with a 5 year warranty. That&#x27;s 1.2M gigabytes written or more than 600GB every day, and will usually handle far more.')
