They are hit anyway often enough by Verdi in Germany, and there is no way Amazon can prohibit people from signing up with a union. Not being able to enforce working conditions seems to more of a factor to me. Not that Amazon is harsher on warehouse staff than, say, DHL. It is more the monitoring and so on.
