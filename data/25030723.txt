These seats have approximately the same number of people, but they also vote for an upper-house representative and the smaller states are over-represented in terms of population.<p>This is because otherwise it becomes easy for a federal government to only govern for the very large populations in the cities, and that is bad for the country as a whole - places outside those large population bases are disenfranchised because no amount of voting would matter.<p>The electoral college seems to do a similar thing. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s perfect, but in principle I don&#x27;t see it as a bad things that people in say Montana have a means to influence the presidency.')
