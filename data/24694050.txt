Not that this is going to make me stop taking it as needed because this is the society we live in (and I&#x27;m currently in college), but yeah. I was just talking to a parent of a 5th grader the other day and they were telling me all about how often their kid got in trouble at school (like I did in elementary school), and how she read up on the neuroscience and decided medicating was appropriate. They had me thus far, until they went on about how they didn&#x27;t tell anyone at the school (it&#x27;s beneficial t share this with teachers...) until the staff sent emails regarding the kid&#x27;s improved behavior. One person even reached out and said &quot;your kid hasn&#x27;t been himself all week.&quot; SO I THOUGHT THE PARent was going to say that&#x27;s what made them change the dose, BUT THEY DIDN&#x27;T!!! They took &quot;your child hasn&#x27;t been himself&quot; as a COMPLIMENT. Something is very wrong here and it&#x27;s not the parent&#x27;s fault, it&#x27;s our priorities in America regarding an outdated school system and long work week. Obedience is valued more than creativity. How are we supposed to improve with that mindset?')
