That&#x27;s a world in which the United States has sharply lower copyright terms than Europe. And even in that world, Charlie Brown <i>still</i> isn&#x27;t public domain this year.<p>It&#x27;s just not a strong argument.<p>Don&#x27;t forget: you were paying for Charlie Brown last year when it ran on network TV; you just weren&#x27;t paying the same way you are now. This is really just a story about how broadcast TV is being obsoleted by streaming; it&#x27;s not a copyright extension story.')
