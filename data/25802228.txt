Compare the number of interactable elements in e.g. a Trello board to a FPS weapon loadout screen. Sure, the consequences of a sluggish UI in a video game can be worse than a sluggish UI in a web app if it&#x27;s running on the main thread and blocking the game&#x27;s execution, but plenty of games update their UI less than once a frame, or run it in a separate thread altogether.')
