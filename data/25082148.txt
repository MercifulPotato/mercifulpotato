The fact that we&#x27;re paying $146M for each engine on the SLS (takes 4 to launch) and SpaceX is promising an entire launch for Starship at &lt;100M is obscene.  (Oh, and SLS ends up at the bottom of the ocean...Starship you can just refuel).<p>While I don&#x27;t agree with all thing Musk, he&#x27;s revolutionized the global spacelaunch industry by reducing costs 10x.
