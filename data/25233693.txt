Perhaps to add to his torment, I like to retort that computers won&#x27;t need to kill us, they&#x27;ll just need to convince us to kill ourselves.<p>&gt; Certainly there are many ways to affect that outcome via social media. I wonder what other tools the deepfake future will provide? Stealing the voice of a dead loved one could be used to great affect to push a troubled soul over the edge.<p>Anyway, are we talking about changing the death from being caused explicitly by computers to users being motivated by computers to kill themselves? I think the comment is instead talking about there being myriad ways computers could manipulate their users into killing themselves. It depends on the predicate of &quot;that&quot;, but one construction seems more consistent.<p>Shouldn&#x27;t the second &quot;affect&quot; also be &quot;effect&quot;?')
