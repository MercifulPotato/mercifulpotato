It&#x27;s rhetoric device used to make a claim about reasoning. It implies that you&#x27;ve thought through all the possible reasons and you&#x27;ve come up with the obvious answer.<p>But if you were really making a sincere question, the answer to &quot;why else&quot; is: that is where they lived when they became homeless.')
