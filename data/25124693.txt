Also, pull doesn&#x27;t modify your remote tracking branch (origin&#x2F;branch) - fetch does that.<p>I do agree that usually, when you have a local branch dedicated to a particular remote tracking branch, it&#x27;s not a good idea to merge the remote into your local branch - it&#x27;s generally much better to rebase your local branch onto the remote tracking branch (pull -r).')
