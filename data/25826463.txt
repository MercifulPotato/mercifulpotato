I&#x27;m sure as anything not doing science. I bash on computer systems while they&#x27;re running with whatever implements are near by; just like the people who run train engines do. Maybe that makes me a mechanic, but I feel like there&#x27;s a distinction because there&#x27;s a lot of original design in addition to fixing and modifying the work of others.<p>[1] Not in the State of Texas; I&#x27;m not licensed, and don&#x27;t intend to be.')
