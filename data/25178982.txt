I think my problem with reading a 10 or 20 page paper on the Macbook is that I cannot get into a comfortable position to do it, like I can with paper or a tablet. On my desktop, even if I zoom in or increase the font, when I am reading something intense I tend to end up terribly slouched or with my face too close to the screen.<p>I can write fine. I can sit upright and ergonomically type. But my reading on a computer&#x2F;laptop is a mess.<p>Maybe my chair is insufficient, or whatever I don&#x27;t know. I just can&#x27;t do it.')
