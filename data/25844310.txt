Regardless of which indexing mode you are using, peppering your code with +1 or -1 is eventually inevitable. It&#x27;s why I think the choice is a matter of preference and has little to do with technical reasons.<p>Overall I still prefer 0-based indexing - a few bytes of RAM is cheap nowadays, when the calculation can be simplified using 1-based indexing, deliberately not using [0] and pretending that the array begins at [1] is often an acceptable option (the trick was originally invented for porting Fortran code...)')
