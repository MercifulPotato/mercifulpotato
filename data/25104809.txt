It only flies numbers and has no substantiation on the figures presented. It&#x27;s only a feels good story.<p>Their numbers don&#x27;t add up. My apartment consumes around 400kWh a month. Assuming I charge a Tesla with 82kWh battery and I use it all in a month, the additional energy consumption is: 82&#x2F;400 = 20%. And that is only on the fat chance that I will be driving less than I do today.<p>So prove me wrong.<p>It&#x27;s physics. All the energy that the cars consume has to come from somewhere. And people will drive more especially because the car is now somehow &#x27;green&#x27;')
