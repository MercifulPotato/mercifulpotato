R is more than just technically Turing complete.<p>It&#x27;s definitely a specialized language.  It&#x27;s not the go-to for managing servers or anything with a lot of I&#x2F;O, but it has those capabilities because they&#x27;re useful for managing projects. And I&#x27;d be hard-pressed to justify using a language for statistical analysis if it doesn&#x27;t focus on statistical analysis.  It&#x27;d be like rolling my own cryptography.<p>You need to differentiate between &quot;base R&quot; (everything that comes with a new install) and community-contributed packages.  Base R is amazingly reliable.  It has detailed documentation[0].<p>User-package land is more of a Wild West, that&#x27;s true.  I would personally not use anything that&#x27;s not on CRAN unless I can walk up to the maintainer&#x27;s desk (in non-pandemic times).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cran.r-project.org&#x2F;manuals.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cran.r-project.org&#x2F;manuals.html</a>')
