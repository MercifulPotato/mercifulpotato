Conveniently I had setup a new home office in late 2019. No need to waste time and effort commuting and I am more productive at home with less distractions. I also had more time to think and reflect and took the opportunity to change job&#x2F;employer to a role I find more satisfying and meaningful.<p>I find that I exercise more regularly as the logistics are easier - no need to try and get up at 6AM for a class, or forget my running shoes, or try to lock my bike up securely. Everything I need is here at home.<p>With more time at home I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to improve my cooking which I&#x27;ve always wanted to do and the extra time with my partner has been great.<p>Downtimes have been learning to live with less alone time; whilst my partner and I are comfortable and do things separately its not quite the same alone as say a full day WFH whilst they were out for dinner or in the office.<p>Seeing my family in person less often is not ideal but I&#x27;ve compensated with video chats and in the process I now talk to my family more frequently and with more of them. I&#x27;d say that is a positive.<p>I see people on sites like instagram that seem to need to demonstrate how they have used this situation to somehow radically change their lives with extreme diets or levels of fitness etc. which is unrealistic expectations. For me its been about gradually doing more of the good and less of the bad, and overall found a good balance.')
