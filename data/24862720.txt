What we currently have for local law enforcement is mainly territory-based all-purpose paramilitary forces. (State and federal law enforcement is mostly divided among domain-specific agencies, most of which report to top-level departments with some focus other than generic law enforcement.)<p>&gt; but by which force should domain specific forces not fight each other if central authority is disbanded?<p>No one has suggested disbanding central authority, either at local or higher levels, only disbanding centralized all-purpose local paramilitary law-enforcement agencies.')
