That&#x27;s why I called it absurd. It&#x27;s a &quot;kids these days&quot; thing (parent post was about scientists and politicians -- this isn&#x27;t off topic, as politicians are involved, but kids account for the numbers). They call themselves &quot;doomers,&quot; and though some of them base their predictions of doom firmly in reality, there&#x27;s a large faction that doesn&#x27;t. &quot;Human extinction by 2030&quot; (or its predecessor, &quot;human extinction is inevitable by 2030&quot;) are memes in that circle. They cross-pollinate, as memes do, so you might have seen a few, but may not have internalized that a double-digit percentage of kids believe wholeheartedly in them.<p>Back when I was in high school, the eco-panic 10 year prediction was that oil would run out and the world economy would collapse. It didn&#x27;t. I see some of my classmates on facebook from time to time. They remembered this instance of crying wolf and updated their priors accordingly. Now they ignore legitimate climate worries. It&#x27;s unfortunate.')
