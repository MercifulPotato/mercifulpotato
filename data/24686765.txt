It&#x27;s certainly not a tenant-favouring framework.<p>If the law said landlords could not require those kinds of references when advertising a tenancy, that would be a legal framework hostile to landlords without the reference problem you described.<p>(Admittedly there would be unintended consequences.  Maybe the reference problem would continue surreptitiously.)')
