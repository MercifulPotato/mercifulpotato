Most people, including medical professionals, don&#x27;t have the time or interest to actually, really listen to you - nor enough understanding to not require going into explaining detail and patterns.<p>I do however have seemingly infinite amount of time to talk, share, and explain my story in depth if they are willing, wanting, and curious.<p>I am in this difficult position right now regarding doctors not understanding, and behaviour and decisions not being so much critical thinking and reason based but behaviour based on indoctrinated knowledge that&#x27;s skewed by the medical industrial-institutional complex: in brief, my chronic pain causes severe executive dysfunction - and only recently was I able to try a dopamine agonist which is the only medication that&#x27;s helped the pain and very significantly reduce the executive dysfunction - but only starting at .5mg dose, however I have only been able to get a .25mg daily dose by 5 different types of doctors - including pain management doctors - because dopamine isn&#x27;t commonly used for pain, it&#x27;s &quot;somehow&quot; slipped out of part of their practices - much like how MDMA was demonized for many decades and now MAPS.org has proven its extreme effectiveness in treating things like treatment resistant PTSD; MDMA which can&#x27;t be patented, so what better way to kill competition than a drug war.<p>Anyway, I have been struggling to see a neurologist and&#x2F;or neurosurgeon - primarily as I am in Canada and the system is very slow - who apparently are the types of doctor who are less conservative when it comes to medications like dopamine agonists; used to treat people with Parkinson&#x27;s for their tremors (and ~80% also have pain issues that it helps with), and also research shows dopamine helps improve executive function in people with Alzheimer&#x27;s as well. The pain level and executive dysfunction level has me struggling daily however, life is very hard just waiting when I know just having a higher dose of cabergoline would greatly alleviate symptoms, so I&#x27;ve now initiated seeing a neurosurgeon and neurologist when I go to San Francisco for December.<p>I&#x27;m right fucked if a neurologist or neurosurgeon won&#x27;t prescribe me a higher dose - and unless a good samaritan points me to how to buy it from a black market - then come the new year I will be done trying to fight; I&#x27;ve looked through tor browser those sites don&#x27;t seem to sell cabergoline - a little surprising as it would seemingly pair well with other sex-related enhancers that are popular, since it can aid in reducing refractory period - I guess it&#x27;s just knowledge that&#x27;s little known.')
