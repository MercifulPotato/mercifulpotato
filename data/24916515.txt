Its stupid to shove a heatsink on nand. It does not help. Not a single bit. Period. Under any normal daily usage, or even if you had a workstation, you&#x27;re not going to be reading&#x2F;writing so constantly frequently that you&#x27;re ever going to cause the controller to heat up and cause throttling. If you experience any excessive heat. You have bigger issues in your case. Period. Your only proof of throttling is benchmarks running constant read&#x2F;writes over a period of time. This is not real world usage and doesn&#x27;t make it necessary to go out and start shoving heatsinks on every single nvme drive. If that was the case then all the laptops which have space between the nvme and the case, or motherboards which lack a &#x27;heatshield&#x27; like the gigabyte board you linked to, would have throttling issues. Which they don&#x27;t.<p>&gt; You should change your tone around here.<p>So now you&#x27;re threatening me?<p>-----<p>Anyway I&#x27;m done, not gonna sit here an argue anymore.')
