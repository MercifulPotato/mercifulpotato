People having more children is the dream scenario for all business--more children = more consumers = more economic growth.<p>This has nothing to do with some evil corporate boogeyman.<p>Just look at the data. There&#x27;s a direct correlation between rising standards of living and having less children. This is because, if you give humans education and birth control, it turns out most of them don&#x27;t actually want to have 8 kids.')
