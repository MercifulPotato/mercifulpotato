This is not at all intended as snark - it&#x27;s just that (as you already know) the huge data set might not have enough value in it to start a business.<p>Regardless of commercial value, it could be a very nice resource to experiment with NLP methods - simple TF-IDF for classification models, topic modelling for unsupervised learning, training&#x2F;fine-tuning your own BERT model, etc.<p>To actually answer the question, the best &quot;Big Data&quot; (very much distinct from &quot;Data Science&quot;) course I ever did is a now totally outdated course by Cloudera that went through Hadoop in great detail - mappers, reducers, shuffle-and-sort, the works. It really helped me understand what was going on under the hood when I ended up using Hive and then Spark a few years later. It might have merged into Developer Training for Spark and Hadoop&quot;[0], though I&#x27;m not completely sure about that.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cloudera.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;training&#x2F;courses&#x2F;developer-training-for-spark-and-hadoop.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cloudera.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;training&#x2F;courses&#x2F;developer-tr...</a>')
