Item(by='bjoli', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605102243, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25056543, text='The weighting is lower than the model M, and the action is smoother. It is however louder.<p>I like the Fs a lot more, but I type very lightly. Model M is almost too stiff for my pinkies.  I thought about ordering a new model F. The repairability is amazing. The firmware as well.<p>But then I realized: I don&#x27;t want a keyboard where I might have to open up and solder something back in. I just want one that works. Currently I rock a silenced MX brown, which I find OK, but the MX switches have lousy tactility. Topre keyboarss, or even a regular rubber dome keyboard, has a lot better tactility and almost no noise.<p>Had the Matias keyboards not had their quality problems I would definitely have used one of those. They are, IMO, the best modern switches feel-wise.<p>Other than that: I don&#x27;t know why there aren&#x27;t any topre-ish &quot;opto-electric&quot; keyboards out there. You would get the smoothness of opto-electric, the silent tactility of a rubber dome, with key register before bottoming out. MX brown is a lousy tactile switch, but the easily available competition (apart from topre) is even worse.<p>So: no. Unless you really love your model m and would like it smoother with the caveat that you might have to whip out a soldering iron in a year, I would not buy the new model F. The guy is doing a great job, and QC seems to be a high priority, but they haven&#x27;t stood the test of time yet.')
