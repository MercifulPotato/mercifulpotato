IIRC this was happening in soccer with heart attacks happening because of drugs.<p>Yes, but this is a choice. We still like to imagine that sports must be &quot;natural&quot;. There is nothing natural in how the top performers are bred (my wife was a national junior champion and in the very top of Europe and did not continue despite being invited to the national team - all the fun of sports is gone).<p>Since we accept that we breed people that do competitive sport I see no reason why not to give them all the opportunities. This includes taking risk with their health and life.<p>The only problem is that sport starts at 4 years old and there is a risk of parents who would be ready for anything for their children to be sport heroes.<p>My children did al lot of sports and they stopped after their black belt in karate because it was not fun anymore. They were not really interested by the competition so it did not matter. They love sport. I play volleyball in an amateur team that almost always loses. But the fun is incredible.<p>&gt; The distinction between men and women teams is arbitrary but fairly sensible. If you didn&#x27;t separate them then you&#x27;d have men at the top and women at the bottom, which does not fun make.<p>I know but since it looks like the gender is becoming a mater of choice, I do not know how this will be deal with.<p>I was thinking the same thing when I read somewhere that the &quot;appartenance to a racial group&quot; in the US is by choice as well. I wonder why some, say, white people do not assess themselves as &quot;Afro-American&quot; to make use of the positive discrimination for admission at universities (or whatever this is called in the US)')
