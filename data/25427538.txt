Do I also have to invent time donation to propose other time-savers like dishwashers?<p>&gt; &quot;my 5 min is so important, I&#x27;m willing to risk someone&#x27;s 60 years&quot; (scaled to thousands of people).<p>The scaling matters! Boston has 1.8 million drivers losing 150 hours in traffic per year, according to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;inrix.com&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;2019-traffic-scorecard-us&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;inrix.com&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;2019-traffic-scorecard-us&#x2F;</a>. Imagine that all of that traffic was caused by our desire to save a single human baby. 270 million hours lost to save 700,000. Would you agree that&#x27;s not worth it? That probably those 270 million hours would produce enough economic output to save a different baby instead?<p>To me, a 75% increase in travel time is high enough and 35 mph is slow enough that I think everyone&#x27;s 15 minutes is, in fact, worth risking someone&#x27;s 60 years, once every couple of years. I could be proved wrong about the math, but it seems to me it&#x27;s mostly an argument about risk tolerance.')
