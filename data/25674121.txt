The N64 was a cut-down SGI machine -- it had texture filtering, a Z-buffer, and perspective correct texturing. Things the PlayStation didn&#x27;t have, because in the mid-90s the state of the art in Japanese 3D hardware was to modify sprite blitter chips to do 3D with affine transforms. Nintendo contracted with the American SGI to get SGI tech into the N64, a savvy move. The PlayStation had more polys on the screen at once, but they looked worse. And they had a CD-ROM, which let them undercut Nintendo on the price of games.<p>But the N64 didn&#x27;t <i>suck</i>. Neither did the Gamecube, which was superior in capability to Sony&#x27;s sixth-gen offering (though not Microsoft&#x27;s).')
