I&#x27;ve spent some time on spreadsheets for task tracking, giving priorities, due dates, estimated completion time, and subjectively evaluating &quot;payoff&quot;. A spreadsheet isn&#x27;t the best UI for something that changes so often though, I&#x27;d like to write something better that works for me and maybe share it, or someone can share their preferred personal tracker with me.')
