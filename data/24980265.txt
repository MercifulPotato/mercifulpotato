The only time a cover letter has contributed to a negative response, the candidate stated they didn&#x27;t care about the company and just wanted the money. That was also pretty much what they said in the phone screen, so yeah, not impressed. Other than that, we made some really good hires <i>because</i> the cover letter gave valuable context to an otherwise bland CV.')
