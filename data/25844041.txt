It feels like X11 was given up on while Wayland and its implementations and ecosystem aren&#x27;t quite there yet.<p>I guess for Windows, a dummy driver is the only way to go since the layers above that are off limits for 3rd parties and it would be Microsoft who had to go ahead and do something there. But as you mentioned the wayland community is pretty chaotic with getting basic features implemented, so effectively it might be the same situation as with Windows ;-)<p>I&#x27;d be interested in seeing your finished product and trying out how it will handle different things you throw at it though.')
