Being the only prisoner in the dilemna doing the right thing seems like it sucks a lot. Thank you for soldiering on &amp; getting us all so far as you did.<p>I&#x27;m glad there&#x27;s good people at the helm. I don&#x27;t know how to avoid uncomfortable personalization, but this really was a very notable incident for me, where on Twitter you talked a bit about how you didn&#x27;t intend to blog or talk or converse with people about what sounded like some fairly large changes that you had in mind.<p>This is such an absolutely critical quasi-mystical level of the stack, in an area that&#x27;s totally essential for people to get themselves online in a meaningful capacity, yet one which so few folk have much experience with. I&#x27;m glad we have new maintainers, but I still feel the loss of some greater brighter alternate reality where more people are able to better build their own stable online presences via the alternate-history version enhanced&#x2F;remade version of MetalLB that, it feels like, no one will ever know. I can&#x27;t imagine how stupid &amp; terrible trying to support MetalLB must have been, I can&#x27;t imagine what it feels like to have giant powers that be take &amp; take without investing back, but I also just think of that brighter future, that unknown better model. Surely we&#x27;ll make more goes in the future, more tries, to make better ways of bringing traffic in, &amp; it seems sure MetalLB will continue to be one of those chief ways, but those paths will not be touched with the intimate grace of experience you, the creator&#x27;s long trekking would have brought.<p>I&#x27;ve thought about trying to beg access, beg for some time to try to document the learnings, lessons, would do-overs over MetalLB. But I don&#x27;t think I can bring enough critical review &amp; questioning to bear, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ask the right questions at the right times. I&#x27;d hope time might soften some of the hard feeling, but I also knew I&#x27;d be trampling on a year+ old declaration, a declaration essentially that the world did not deserve your insights.<p>I&#x27;m sorry for punishing your good faith good reply with this post! I write it sort of as a confession, but the crime is the confession, not the thought. This has been a big event for me; apologies for being un-easy with it. Mostly, thank you thank you thank you, for having carried us all so so so very far.')
