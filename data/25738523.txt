I&#x27;m no blind supporter of LEO (Ha!) but how are you suspicious of the claim, given the behavior and events of the past week&#x2F;two months?

I also built a platform to monitor social networks (check my profile). I haven’t picked anything up like all 50 states protesting. A few surely, but idk not some crazy coordination or anything (honestly seems more from the left). Could be underground, but idk. The capital protest had far more going on.')
