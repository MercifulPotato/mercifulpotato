This makes ROI pretty straight forward to figure out.<p>* There&#x27;s really no benefit to getting Type 1, you just need to get the Type 1 posture and then wait out the monitoring period in order to get type 2. If the customers actually care, they are smart enough to know that it&#x27;s a lot harder to fudge it for 6 months than it is for one four hour Zoom call.<p>* You can definitely get to about 60% of SOC2 just doing obvious best practice (code reviews, SSO, HTTPS only, database alerting). The next 20% is worthwhile but not intuitive, the final 20% is neither.<p>Agreed with the top comment about infosec teams being reasonable. At this point I think it would be pretty hard to do deals with public companies without having Type 2, and our domain isn&#x27;t even that security focused.')
