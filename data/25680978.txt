They clearly can&#x27;t manufacture their own car on any reasonable timeframe...but if they outsource vehicle production...whats the point?<p>It may very well just be a Hyundai with a design exclusive to Apple, Apple Carplay, and a few other doo-dads. And a ridiculous markup. So why not just buy a Hyundai with Apple Carplay and save $35k?<p>It isn&#x27;t an exaggeration to say Tesla is a decade ahead. The market is way too bullish about Apple&#x27;s prospects here. People are buying Teslas so they can live in the future...Apple is just selling an integration.')
