They are never good.<p>With free speech, it should come responsibility. You should be responsible for your speech, if it is false, and pay for it in a Court, but you should not be censored.<p>The problem is that the same people that accuse Trump of spreading misinformation with no proofs are the same that cheered on the New York Times and WP accusing Trump of being a Putin puppet with no profs whatsoever over years because they wanted to prevent the &quot;legitimate transfer of power&quot; as you say.<p>If what you say is false, you should pay for it, including Trump, but you should have the right to say it.')
