But I&#x27;m also unlikely to go somewhere where that&#x27;d happen - it&#x27;s more likely if I&#x27;m pressed for options i.e. somewhere out of the city.<p>I&#x27;d give the McDonalds burger a go though - it&#x27;s always interesting to see how far food tech can be pushed and how different it is from the real-deal. The key in my mind is synthetic collagen to give fake meat the bounce&#x2F;snap&#x2F;chew of real meat (FWIW I don&#x27;t eat fake meat often, just interested in food tech in general).')
