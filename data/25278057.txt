If you&#x27;re attacking a military unit to achieve a military objective, murder feels inappropriate. In my opinion, murder tends:<p>* to be done by an individual, not a group<p>* tends to happen to one, or a few victims. It&#x27;s odd to describe someone as murdering 70 people at once.<p>* tends to imply the victim was not professionally engaged in such a way that their death in those circumstances is not a plausible concern<p>* the motive is not political, else it is an assassination')
