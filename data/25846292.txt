The very concept of locking the screen is flawed. A flaw that also haunts Wayland, BTW.<p>The concept of screen lockers is having a special layer, that can&#x27;t be bypassed, which a locker creates. The whole security then hinges on the locker not crashing. X11 does have such a layer. Wayland compositors also implement it through such a layer. And for either the situation is, that if the locker crashes, that layer is destroyed by implication and the session exposed.<p>That&#x27;s a flawed concept.<p>What you really want is <i>detachable</i> graphics session. On the text console one can effortlessly use screen or tmux and to &quot;lock&quot; the session simply detach and exit to the regular login getty.<p>You want <i>exactly</i> the same, but for X11. And there&#x27;s no obstacle in printiple to implement this. It&#x27;s just that the Xorg server can&#x27;t detach. Almost all of the required code is there, fundamentally it&#x27;d be the same code that&#x27;s executed during a VT switch.<p>In the meantime one can use Xpra with Xvfb to create detachable X11 sessions, which then however lack GPU acceleration.')
