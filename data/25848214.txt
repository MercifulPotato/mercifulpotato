In basically every domain where non-developers invent algorithms, everything is immutable - spreadsheets, math!. Heck, even reading an article - the words you&#x27;ve already read don&#x27;t change their meaning just because you&#x27;ve kept reading.<p>Mutability is really a result of the fact that computers are physical machines. So I think if you&#x27;re going to teach software development, you should really start at the machine architecture and build up (ala NAND to Tetris) or start with an immutable-by-default language and only dip into mutation as an &quot;advanced&quot; concept, only to be used by experts and definitely not by beginners.<p>I endorse the second way, as I&#x27;ve seen it work very well, whereas I&#x27;ve seen more than one ship crash on the shore of understanding pointers...<p>Of course, my N is small.')
