(Post Post Scriptum) with Perspectives on Psychological Science<p>It&#x27;s even funnier considering &quot;Perspectives on Psychological Science&quot; was referenced in the article, and I also quoted it right in my comment.  I will requote it again:<p>&gt; P.P.S. At this point you might ask why are we picking on Freakonomics? Nobody cares about them anymore! Shouldn’t we be writing about Al Sharpton or Ted Cruz or whoever else happens to be polluting the public discourse? Or recent Ted talk sensations? Sleep is your superpower! <i>Or we could see what’s been published lately in Perspectives on Psychological Science</i> . . . that’s always always good for a laugh, or a cry.<p>See in that last sentence there?  This too seems like a sign of the times.<p>These comment sections get funnier every day.')
