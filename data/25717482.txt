Patients would be randomly assigned a doctor for their visit. The doctor would diagnose them, treat them, prescribe drugs if needed, and give them instructions on how to care for themselves after they left.<p>The study found that the patients were significantly more likely to follow the doctor&#x27;s instructions after they left if the doctor was the same race as the patient.<p>Note that the doctors were not the patient&#x27;s regular doctor. These were either patients who did not have a regular doctor, or patients who were going to the clinic because of an urgent condition when their regular doctor was not available. I&#x27;m not aware of any studied that looked at whether patients obey their regular doctor more often if the doctor is the same race as the patient.')
