It lets you optimize each meal for time to prepare, variety, cost, etc. It also prepares a weekly shopping list. (Seriously, great app, few rough edges though and onboarding is not friendly)<p>Also, sauces. 1 day making bolognese is 3 days of main courses.<p>Ideally you are only making 2 or 3 main courses during the week.')
