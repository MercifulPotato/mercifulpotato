I&#x27;m often aware that I dream, and can sometimes steer it. While it feels like a movie most of the time, it&#x27;s not really <i>visual</i> in the same sense.<p>Like just yesterday I became aware that I was dreaming. In the dream I had somehow ended up in jail. The majority of the dream was me trying to escape in various ways, a bit like a reverse Ocean 11 thing.<p>As I was dreaming I could picture the places around me, I particularly recall the gate in the main corridor.<p>However even though my dreams are usually very visual in some sense, it&#x27;s much closer to how I picture things in my mind when reading novels, rather than explicit images like when watching a movie.<p>I&#x27;ve always had a hard time with visualizations when reading novels. Like I&#x27;ll read the page or two the author uses to describe some location, but most of the time the details don&#x27;t really &quot;sink in&quot;. Instead my mind seems to quickly grab hold of the high-level things, like it&#x27;s an old apartment building, and the details are just generated based on that. Whatever detailed description the author makes usually doesn&#x27;t affect the mental image I&#x27;ve already built.<p>I guess it&#x27;s not that weird that the dream visuals feels more like that out of a book, both cases being generated by the imagination.')
