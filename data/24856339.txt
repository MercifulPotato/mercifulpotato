Am I alone?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Not really a tech question, but as a child I&#x27;ve always loved counting along digital (or analog) clocks, counting in my mind and see how precise I was.\nFast-forward 20 years, now seconds in clocks are so fast. Like, almost 1.5x faster. Is it only my perception and my flawed memories?<p>I&#x27;m asking because I know I&#x27;m not the only one, someone else mentioned the same thing here once, and that makes me fairly curious.')
