It&#x27;s like my brain suddenly recalibrated to understand the vowel and consonant changes in the accent (and particularly in certain areas the parts of the words that simply were dropped off the beginning&#x2F;end of the word).<p>People often tell me &quot;Wow, I wish I was good at languages like you&quot; and I honestly want them to understand how I feel: I didn&#x27;t learn German, I simply spent enough time in the language for my brain to catch up and learn it for me.')
