With that said, there&#x27;s certainly a hand-waviness to &quot;soft&quot; fields like gender studies or ethnomusicology (I took classes in both, just out of curiosity).<p>And no matter how much you think Derrida or Focault contributed to philosophy, I would argue it pales in comparison to their Analytic contemporaries (Godel, Lewis, Anscombe, Moore, etc.). I was extremely skeptical of philosophers like Nietzsche and after a couple of semesters, I definitely appreciated the Continentals a bit more -- but not enough to take him (and his ilk) as seriously as I take the aforementioned. The problem lies with falsifiability: it&#x27;s too easy to claim one just doesn&#x27;t &quot;get&quot; whiteness, or critical theory, or what-have-you.<p>PG studied philosophy, often talking about it in a very positive light, so the claim that he doesn&#x27;t see value in humanities is -- apologies -- bogus.')
