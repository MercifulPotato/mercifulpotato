The electrical engineers did. They looked at (in descending order) cost, I&#x2F;O capability, manufacturing lifespan, and then finally the software ecosystem.<p>When things started getting too similar the chipmakers picked up on this and started selling the software as feature: &quot;Our neato IDE has a Part Wizard! You pick the part and variant and our gizmo will set up a blank project with headers and mux already done. You can run Hello World with a mouseclick!&quot;  And thus we got things like CodeWarrior in Eclipse.<p>The dirty little secret in embedded is that everyone is lazy and they&#x27;re behind. If that manufacturer-provided IDE does the setup and gets my code launched on the part then let&#x27;s go. Hell, they even give me reference projects to steal from!<p>Look at all the work the OP does setting up a compiler and makefiles. Could we have done that years ago? Of course. But nobody wanted to make the effort.<p>A lot of us have moved on.  I recently worked in an ecosystem built with Zephyr, ARM GCC (psst: get it right from ARM and skip Launchpad), VSCode (w&#x2F;Cortex Debug plugin), Git, and CMake.  The only thing I had to pay real money for was the JTAG debugger.  It ran natively in Linux and it was <i>sweet</i>.')
