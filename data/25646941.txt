My business partner and I are both primarily devs and have a few bootstrapped products in the wild. We&#x27;re looking to connect with individuals who have experience in some of [sales&#x2F;marketing, bizdev, product, funding]. Our products are:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;porterhouse.app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;porterhouse.app</a> - Mac app that sends mass individual texts using your own iPhone. Currently get a few signups everyday but with very bad churn. We&#x27;re planning a relaunch next week with paid plans, a redesign, and ability to upload recipients via CSV.<p>Political campaign CRM (no public landing page yet) - Our focus is to be modern (the Slack to the HipChats in the space), and also make it really easy for political consultants to re-use and enrich their data across multiple campaigns and clients. It&#x27;s been used on a senate campaign of a connection and that went well. A few features away from trying to sell to the masses.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wreckingball.systems" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wreckingball.systems</a> - RFID tracking for the construction industry. Have the hardware built and awaiting approval from our first client.<p>I can be contacted at yeosuanaik at gmail')
