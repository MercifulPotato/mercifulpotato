It&#x27;s fast because it&#x27;s got short distances to memory and everything else.  Shorten the wire to memory cells and not only can you make signaling faster and run the memory at faster clock speed but you can do it with less accessory hardware for signal conditioning and error correction, which saves complexity and power.   Using shorter paths to memory also lets you use lower voltages, which means less waste heat and less need to spend effort on cooling and overall power savings for the chip.<p>Shortening the wire also lowers latency between all the various on board devices, so communicating everywhere is faster.<p>There&#x27;s a reason that manufacturers used to be able to &quot;speed&quot; up a chip by just doing a die shrink - photographically reducing chip masks to make them smaller, which also made them faster with relatively small amounts of work.<p>As the late Adm. Grace Hopper put it, there are ever so many picoseconds between the two ends of a wire.')
