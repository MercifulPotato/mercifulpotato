How it works is that very few people are allowed in at all, and every single person who _is_ allowed in is force-quarantined for two weeks in facilities specifically built&#x2F;converted for secure quarantine. Outbreaks that _have_ happened tend to start from guards in quarantine facilities, not from someone slipping by border security (which is hard to mess up if you let in single-digit numbers of people per day).')
