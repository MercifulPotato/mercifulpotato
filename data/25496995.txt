You should compare the current value of the options to their value at the last fundraising round, not between pre- and post-money in the same round.<p>The doubling in value happen between (e.g.) the Series A raise and the Series B raise, not at the time of the Series B raise, and when you compare the value of your options between the raises that&#x27;s when you&#x27;ll see the increase in value.<p>For example, imagine you have 10% of the company and after the Series A raise the company is valued at $1m, so your share is $100k.  Now you go and work for two years and increase the value of the company to $20m (pre-money).  Your 10% is worth $2m now.  If the company raises $5m for 20% ($25m post-money) in a Series B you now have 8.3% of the company (you were diluted) but your 8.3% is still worth $2m.<p>The stock option reward happens while you&#x27;re building the company.')
