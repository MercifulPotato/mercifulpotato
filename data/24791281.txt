Russia did meddle in the election and did hack the DNC. Russia also had close ties to high level members of the Trump campaign. It is not reasonable to dispute these facts. The question of whether Trump personally colluded with Russia is in doubt. But I don&#x27;t see this specific claim made much at all from legitimate news organizations. The dishonesty is how people want to cast doubt on Russia&#x27;s efforts to elect Trump by conflating it with the issue of whether Trump personally colluded with Russia.')
