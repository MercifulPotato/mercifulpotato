I think this is a pretty great example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.gnome.org&#x2F;GNOME&#x2F;nautilus&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;244" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.gnome.org&#x2F;GNOME&#x2F;nautilus&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;244</a><p>Patches are available for type-ahead, in particular the gtk-mushrooms fork. If open source is about &quot;scratching your own itch&quot; gnome is making it <i>really hard</i> for developers to do that. There was discussion of burying that features somewhere deep in the gnome registry, all kinds of options, but it&#x27;s clear that pull requests are <i>not welcome</i>, even if the option is buried deep in some config file somewhere and is only accessible to power users.<p>That seems to be the case a lot of the time when outsiders try to solve their own problems with a pull request. There&#x27;s just no room for compromise or for solving your own problems.')
