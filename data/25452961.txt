A couple of serial ports and a couple of parallel ports was considered a &quot;lot&quot; of I&#x2F;O. You <i>might</i> have stored your programs on an 8&quot; or 5&quot; floppy disk, but if it was before 1978 you most likely stored programs on cassette tape. Anyway ...<p>One of the things you could always count on was that these things radiated all sorts of spurious energy and being relatively low frequency beasts to begin with, finding a harmonic that you could pick up with an AM radio held &quot;near&quot; (where near could be 1&#x27; to 10&#x27; (.3 - 3m)) that interference and with the judicious use of delay loops cause that interference to modulate to &quot;tones&quot; and thus create recognizable &quot;music.&quot;<p>As a kid in high school with just such a computer I can tell you that &quot;playing music&quot; (no matter how poorly) on a nearby AM radio was orders of magnitude more impressive than pointing out by the pattern of lit and unlit LEDs that your amazing machine had just calculated a logarithm. (even though the latter was significantly more difficult from a programming perspective!) Once I got a printer, being able to print out NSFW pictures was a neat trick but for crowd appeal and cheap accessories, music over an AM radio was still the top demo of the time :-)')
