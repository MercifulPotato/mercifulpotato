They look like the same thing today, but this is merely a consequence of the fact that everyone is under Facebook&#x27;s thumb and Facebook works in the interest of corporations&#x2F;big money who pay for their ads.<p>If you shift the control to government, the dynamics change fundamentally. The power will once again start at the government (like it should) and not at the corporations. Money will still influence things, but not nearly as much as it does today.<p>We need to take steps to decouple money from political power, decouple state from economics.<p>Like guns, Facebook is not inherently evil. It mostly depends on who is holding it.')
