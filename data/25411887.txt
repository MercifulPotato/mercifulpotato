I doubt there are many who have done a more comprehensive study than AdamN of what it is like to be them.<p>For whatever it&#x27;s worth, I would agree. I am confident that most cyclist&#x2F;car accidents will be the car driver&#x27;s fault. Would you even be surprised, if this turns out to be genuinely the case? I wouldn&#x27;t! Do you even drive a car? I do! Car drivers are shits - or at least behave exactly like them - one for the philosphers, perhaps - and I cannot fathom how anybody that drives a car could think otherwise. Have you not noticed how these people behave? (Sure, lie to us all you like - but don&#x27;t lie to yourself!) Car drivers would run your kids down, and you know it, if it would save them 5 seconds - then in court they&#x27;d cry about how things are so difficult for them now they&#x27;re facing prison. Because they know they&#x27;d probably get away with it.<p>Out of the tiny number of times an accident is the cyclist&#x27;s fault, the vast majority could be avoided if the driver was paying an appropriate amount of attention - and the 6-year-old rule of thumb is a good one, I think, when it comes to gauging how much attention is appropriate - given they&#x27;re driving a 1500+ kg 200+ bhp murder machine, a major design goal of which is ensuring its occupants come out unscathed from any collision.<p>I am confident the remainder could be dealt with on a case by case basis.')
