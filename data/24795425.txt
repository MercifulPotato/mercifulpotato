I think I&#x27;m gonna have nightmares.<p>Of course, C isn&#x27;t taught like <i>this</i> over there, but the point is that C gives you way too much rope to hang yourself with, and that&#x27;s if you&#x27;re an experienced developer, let alone a college freshman. Sure, the argument can be made that screwing up as a freshman helps you learn in a way that doesn&#x27;t compromise your career, but I believe that quite a few of my classmates wouldn&#x27;t have given up on programming altogether had they not been thrown at C right away. I myself didn&#x27;t learn to love programming until I tried less spartan languages.')
