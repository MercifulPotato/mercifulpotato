Item(by='jes5199', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611506537, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25884859, text='I’ve recently unearthed a copy of WORM.BAS that is written to run on ZBasic for the Zenith Z100 - it’s the version of “snake” I played as a child. I wish I had an interpreter that could run it, but it relies on the Z100’s direct access to the RAM that holds the text mode font, in order to overwrite the letter shapes with bitmaps of sections of the worm&#x2F;snake. I have, more than once, tried to port it to a modern context, but the old coding style (no explicit subroutines, just GOSUBs) is very hard to read and even though it is not a lot of lines of code, it is a very painstaking process. I don’t know if hacking a BASIC interpreter would <i>help</i>, but it might!')
