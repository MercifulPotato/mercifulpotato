Eventually Niklaus Wirth decided to go back and see how much he could remove from original Oberon and still have it be a systems programming language with GC, thus Oberon-07 was born, with a couple of revisions, the latest one from 2016.<p>Going back to the original one, this is what you got in the package:<p>- A full stack single user graphical workstation, in a GC enabled systems programming language<p>- The only kind of application are modules, loaded dynamically<p>- Applications are just modules that register themselves into the system to be available on the REPL or in menus when loaded, e.g. Module.Command will load Module and call the procedure named Command, which can then be fed data from the REPL, mouse selection or selected application window<p>- This brings dynamism similar to Smalltalk and Lisp machines where you get access to whole OS and each application is extensible<p>At a given point during the 90&#x27;s the ETHZ IT department had plenty of people using Oberon based workstations.<p>For a couple of screenshots about Oberon System 3 and Active Oberon, with links about Xerox PARC related stuff have a look at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.progtools.org&#x2F;article.php?name=oberon&amp;section=compilers&amp;type=tutorial" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.progtools.org&#x2F;article.php?name=oberon&amp;section=co...</a>')
