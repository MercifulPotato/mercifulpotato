Office software, such as the ubiquitous spreadsheet, provide customisation\nfacilities, while the growth of the Web has added impetus to end-user scripting for interactive\nfunctions in websites. In scientific and engineering domains end users frequently develop\ncomplex systems with standard programming languages such as C++ and JAVA. However only a\nminority of users adapt COTS (Customer Off The Shelf software) products; furthermore,\ncomposing systems from reusable components, such as ERP (Enterprise Resource Plans) systems\ndefeats most end users, who resort to expensive and scarce expert developers for implementation.\nSo EUD is only a partial success story. We argue that the spread of end-user development\ndepends on a fine balance between user motivation, effective tools and management support. In\nthis article we explore that balance and investigate a future approach to EUD – meta-design – that\nproposes a vision in which design, learning and development become part of everyday working\npractic')
