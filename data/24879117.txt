It let you put your music library in the cloud and play it anywhere. Simple! Pay money and extend it with Google’s streaming catalogue too. Even better!<p>A simple product with a clear identity. In many ways a finished product with no need of big changes or a replacement. A Spotify-killer really. It certainly killed <i>my</i> Spotify-account.<p>YouTube music is the exact opposite in every way. No clear identity, it’s main selling point is some vague benefit of having access to the “YouTube catalogue”. Whatever. And your uploaded music is deliberately siloed off in a separate section which doesn’t integrate at all with the normal playback, search and playlist-functionality. A complete joke.<p>Why oh why does Google think this is an improvement for ... anyone? It’s offensive, really.')
