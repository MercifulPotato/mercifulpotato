Item(by='gridlockd', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603459415, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24867111, text='&gt; Because a PhD is useful for a lot more than getting a permanent academic position. My first &quot;proper job&quot; was at a research division of a big corporation. They had ~20 PhDs when I started and expanded to ~100 over 3 years. I don&#x27;t think any of those people would say their PhD was wasted because they didn&#x27;t get an academic job at the end of it.<p>Why do they have so many more PhDs now? Because PhDs are a now a dime a dozen, not because a PhD itself is valuable. The opportunity cost of a PhD is four years of lost income during prime employment age, plus extra student loan debt.<p>Even with a higher salary (and higher tax burden), it&#x27;s not clear that you come out on top during your lifetime. If you don&#x27;t come out on top, it&#x27;s a waste, unless maybe these years you spent doing your PhD were the best years of your life (probably not).')
