White supremacist groups in the US also focus on the positives and shared culture of white America. Hating blacks isn&#x27;t the core belief, it&#x27;s just a side effect of wanting everyone to know that whites are the best.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to say it&#x27;s hateful to say you want social castes out on the table for identifying who you share connections with, but that obviously comes with the fact that you identify those who don&#x27;t share that connection.
