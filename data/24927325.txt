I don&#x27;t like the idea of being liable for software I make. I love that the MIT license has a clause saying whatever happens to your computer is not my fault. It&#x27;s comforting when you&#x27;re just trying to share something.<p>But.. there are certain classes of software that I think should be written differently.<p>I feel like we made a lot of bad decisions. There should be a completely separate stack for hospitals, power plants, etc., including a custom operating system. Why is Windows running on every machine? Isn&#x27;t this a national security issue at this point?')
