The majority of screen readers present web pages in a kind of virtual buffer, which users can browse with the arrow keys and other shortcuts (e.g. H to jump by heading).  In this mode, the majority of screen readers don&#x27;t fire focus events to let you know, &quot;hey, your screen-reader-only element has been hit&quot;.  You would be limited to:<p>1. users operating a screen reader which does fire focus events;<p>2. trying to highjack scroll events for this purpose; and<p>3. less technically-inclined users (read: beginners) who move through the page with Tab&#x2F;Shift+Tab before they&#x27;ve learned the other keystrokes their screen reader offers.')
