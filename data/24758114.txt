Item(by='bluGill', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602529352, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24757580, text='standard stick built has a lot of things already factory done.  most lumber is a standard length&#x2F;width, and the entire print is built around those sizes.  2x4s come factory cut to 92 5&#x2F;8 long, which (after adding the other lumber needed for a wall) leaves a finished 8 foot wall ready for 2, 4 foot wide sheets of drywall.<p>What labor is done on site in a typical stick built construction project is mostly the same manual labor that needs to be done in a factory. Which isn&#x27;t surprising: construction sites are just mobile factories for buildings. When you have to make something with lot of empty space is makes sense to ship the factory to the final location.<p>Shipping is a factor too: a stick built house arrives on one flatbed truck. A similar prefab house needs 3, and special permits to get it down the road (which includes checking for lower hanging power lines).')
