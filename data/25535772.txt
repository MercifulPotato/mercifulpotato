Item(by='wielandbr', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1608894489, title='Ask HN: Quantitative comparison of permaculture and industrial farming', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I am new to permaculture but would like to get a better feeling for if and how mid- to large-scale commercial permaculture farms could feed the world (in a hopefully much more sustainable way). In particular, I am interested in quantitative studies of the following two questions:<p>* How does the biomass produced per unit area compares between permaculture and modern industrial farms?<p>* How does the cost structure of mid-scale permaculture farms compare to modern industrial farms?<p>If more general studies are hard to get, I am also fine with case studies. So far I have been unable to locate satisfactory studies on these rather central questions. Any pointers are highly appreciated.<p>PS: This is a cross-posting of a question I posted on the sustainability stackexchange (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sustainability.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;10420&#x2F;quantitative-comparison-of-the-economics-and-output-of-permaculture-versus-indus).')
