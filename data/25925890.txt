But that&#x27;s missing what he&#x27;s saying.  The Fed injected a shit-ton of money into the economy last year, mostly through PPP forgivable loans.  This money was supposed to go to the most vulnerable small businesses, but we now know it largely went to the big guys.  They used the money to pay for salaries, as per the requirements of the &quot;loan,&quot; but that offset money which they <i>would</i> have used for salaries, which instead got funneled into savings and largely put onto the market.  What stocks did people buy last year with this money?  TSLA, AAPL, etc.<p>There was also a large amount of stimulus checks and unemployment bonuses that went to the same destination.  Hence RobinHood having a record year.  That&#x27;s unrelated and somewhat contrary to the feds-bailing-out-big-business narrative though.')
