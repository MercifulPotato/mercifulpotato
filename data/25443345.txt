When you only partially implement libertarianism, money and effort creep out into other domains. Like other idealized systems, the internal logic is foiled when it&#x27;s limited. There&#x27;s no way to isolate one aspect because people can move both in space and in activity. You always end up with some hybrid system which obscures the merit and faults of the experiment.<p>For example, the American health care system is &quot;more libertarian&quot; than those in other developed countries, and it&#x27;s widely considered worse than any of them. People want to experiment with both more libertarian and less libertarian systems. They agree on only two things: the current system is bad, and the badness comes entirely from the other guy&#x27;s system.<p>Healthcare is a case where less-libertarian systems have been clearly successful. That would make a more-libertarian system an interesting experiment, but potentially a costly one. And worse, the costs are likely to fall on people without money and therefore less influence to call for change.')
