I therefore must balance my ideology with pragmatism.<p>I was a little coy above. I said that I &quot;release my code into the public domain to the <i>extent possible</i>.&quot; In practice, I dual license my code under the UNLICENSE (public domain, effectively) and the MIT. I do this because the UNLICENSE is unsuitable either because people are too risk averse for it or because public domain is for one reason or another not recognized in their jurisdiction.<p>I didn&#x27;t elaborate on this in my original comment because it&#x27;s not really pertinent. I think.<p>But yes, I can&#x27;t put code out there without a license because I ultimately want people to use it. And I&#x27;ve made the mistake of using a license that people don&#x27;t like to use before (the WTFPL). You do indeed get bugged quite a bit.')
