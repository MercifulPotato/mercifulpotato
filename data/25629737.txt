Shit happens, and I feel for folks who try. A couple turned out to be plain old scams, and I deal with it by not thinking about it.<p>A product would have to be pretty spectacular and the creator would need a great reputation for me to risk crowdfunding these days. I don&#x27;t mind losing a few pounds on good causes that don&#x27;t turn out, but technology &quot;purchases&quot; is a big no.')
