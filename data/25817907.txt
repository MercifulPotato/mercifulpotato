Like, just launch with couple tons of cubesats and as much fuel as possible, then deliver then to orbit as needed using you huge delta-v budget then go home. Rinse and repeat. You could theoretically even do inclination changes using the Starship aerodynamic surfaces if you were crazy enough. ;-)<p>As you are effectively using up just fuel in Starship (+ some wear and tear) it might still be cheaper than dumping a complete small non-reusable rocket.')
