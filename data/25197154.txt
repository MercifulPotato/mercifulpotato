They had used an Ethernet shield coupled to some 4G network something.<p>After a bit of back and forth the culprit was found: it was sending one byte packets.<p>The standard Arduino is extremely memory limited, so a typical trick is to use the Flash memory to store string constants, and then use those when writing to devices etc. The library code has some nice wrappers which makes things like sending a Flash string constant to some output stream like a serial port or say Ethernet shield fairly seamless.<p>However for reasons[1], the Flash variant of the &quot;send constant string&quot; call does this by reading and sending one character at a time. And the Ethernet library (memory constrained) or Shield did no extra buffering, so it sent minimum one packet per call...<p>[1]: IIRC the Arduino Flash is 16 bit and the characters in the string are stored zero-expanded, so it can just memcpy but has to strip away the top byte.')
