I did it 20 years ago, but it doesn&#x27;t feel worth it now.<p>- Buy a Dell XPS for $700.  At the time I got one of the fastest Intel CPUs on the market -- I think it was THE fastest in terms of single-threaded performance.  The whole machine is not that much more than the cost of buying the CPU alone.  Look at the CPU prices on newegg or Amazon.<p>- Buy a bunch more RAM and disk off newegg.  It&#x27;s significantly cheaper than getting it from Dell.<p>(Optional: I replaced the video card with the one from Amazon, because the fan on the stock XPS was very noisy.)<p>I&#x27;m using that machine now and it&#x27;s fast and stable.  The case isn&#x27;t ideal for expansion, but it works fine.  It will fit a bunch of disk and RAM.<p>-----<p>Looking at Dell&#x27;s site 6 years later, I think the strategy still holds.  They go from $600-$800.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dell.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;shop&#x2F;desktop-computers&#x2F;xps-desktop&#x2F;spd&#x2F;xps-8940-desktop" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dell.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;shop&#x2F;desktop-computers&#x2F;xps-deskto...</a><p>For $800 you get this CPU which looks pretty damn fast.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cpubenchmark.net&#x2F;cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Core+i7-10700+%40+2.90GHz&amp;id=3747" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cpubenchmark.net&#x2F;cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Core+i7-10700...</a><p>So the total cost with a bunch of disk and RAM is like $1000-$1200.  And you spend 10 minutes unpacking the XPS box, and maybe 20 minutes swapping out the RAM&#x2F;disk&#x2F;video card, and you&#x27;re done.<p>I believe that is a very good low effort solution to getting significant computing power.  In my case, I wanted to build Android and other Linux distros from scratch, which requires a lot of CPU and I&#x2F;O speed.<p>If you start going with custom components the cost adds up pretty fast, and the possibility of incompatibilities goes up nonlinearly.  So I think it&#x27;s a good idea to outsource most of this work to Dell.  I have seen people spend WAY too much time being a system integrator.<p>It&#x27;s not going to satisfy everyone, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s the 90% solution for 40% of the price.<p>(I now feel tempted to upgrade my 6 year old machine, although I don&#x27;t really need it :) )<p>----<p>addendum: Wow the CPU that the XPS gives is SIGNIFICANTLY faster than that of the OP&#x27;s build:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cpubenchmark.net&#x2F;cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Xeon+E5-2680+v3+%40+2.50GHz&amp;id=2390" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cpubenchmark.net&#x2F;cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Xeon+E5-2680+...</a><p>17475 &#x2F; 2927 single-threaded vs.  15513 &#x2F; 1801.  That is a HUGE difference because of the single threaded speed.<p>Although the Android build almost perfectly parallelizes (e.g. could use 16 or 32 cores), most software doesn&#x27;t.<p>This is what I noticed back in 2014: desktop CPUs have better single-threaded performance than server CPUs, and that matters for a lot of applications, including running VMs I imagine.<p>It looks like the total cost of this build was $1,368.74.<p>So again I would go with the XPS + upgraded disk&#x2F;RAM solution in a heartbeat.  For $1000-1200 you&#x27;ll get a significantly better machine.')
