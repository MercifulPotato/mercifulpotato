Accepting inequality as a matter of harsh reality is just status quo.<p>I strongly believe that all people deserve well being in aspects of economical, social and personal health. The strongest tool to achieve that is through culture.<p>In the past people thought that the only method to address economical inequality was to redistribute wealth forcefully. We should not assume that the only method to address social inequality is also by force.')
