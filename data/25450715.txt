Barely?!<p>The fact that you&#x27;re linking to news coverage featuring numbers in the... dozens  makes it seem like &quot;barely&quot; is justifiable in the context of populations of millions.<p>(It&#x27;s certainly arguable that outside distanced activities shouldn&#x27;t be the front lines of enforcement, but once you&#x27;re infected you really are a risk to not even just any individual you happen by but anyone down the chain of infection.)<p>&gt; Trillions of dollars of economic damages.<p>And if you assume that the damages came primarily from civil actions, then I guess that&#x27;d make sense.<p>The reality is that there was never an option to avoid economic damages once the epidemic was uncontained. The bulk of the impacts come from the threat of the illness itself. Where most people are avoiding economic and social activities, it&#x27;s not because they&#x27;re forced into it, it&#x27;s because they regard the personal or social risk to be significant. Lift <i>all</i> restrictions and only some margin of people will dive back in and even many of those will do so selectively. The major thing that civil actions do is coordinate the possibility of effective healthy mitigations.<p>&gt; Millions of lives will be lost due to the prioritization of the COVID over all else.<p>Probably not from economic impacts:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedaily.com&#x2F;releases&#x2F;2009&#x2F;09&#x2F;090928172530.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedaily.com&#x2F;releases&#x2F;2009&#x2F;09&#x2F;090928172530.h...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.history.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;great-depression-economy-life-expectancy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.history.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;great-depression-economy-life-e...</a><p>It <i>is</i> true that severe covid cases take up a lot of resources in the medical system and that could cost lives, but that&#x27;s an argument for mitigating measures.<p>&gt; My children canâ€™t go to school.<p>I might be persuaded based on enough further commentary that it&#x27;s crucial that your children get influences forming their critical thinking skills from outside the home, but I certainly wouldn&#x27;t assume it on the basis of a single comment.')
