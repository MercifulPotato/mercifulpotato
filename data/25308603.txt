Intel has fewer cores (10-cores or so) but 512-bit vectors on workstation processors. Consumer Intel (Laptops or Desktops) are usually only 256-bits per core, but that&#x27;s still doubling up over M1.<p>Finally, GPUs are 32-wide x 32-bits aka 1024-bit (NVidia or AMD NAVI), or 64-wide x 32-bits aka 2048-bit (AMD GCN), and you can see why GPUs do so well on a massively-parallel program like Hashcat. Those 1024-bit or 2048-bit compute units are arranged 4x per Compute Unit &#x2F; Workgroup Processor (AMD) or 2x per SM (NVidia), and then they offer 60, 70, 80, 100+ Compute Units &#x2F; SMs per GPU (depending on chip specific details)')
