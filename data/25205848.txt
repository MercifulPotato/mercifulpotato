Full stop.<p>I&#x27;m actually in this situation right now. I develop a web application for event management. In some cases it&#x27;s being used on older Chromebooks, where speed is, well, not there. While I&#x27;m testing on Chromebooks, I&#x27;m definitely not building my front end bundle on one. The faster machine I&#x27;m on, the faster I can iterate on building fast data tables, making intelligent choices about asset loading, etc.<p>So yeah, I think something like the Network Conditioner prefpane should exist to simulate a slow CPU for testing (does something like this exist?). But I very much enjoy my fast dev machine and I think it&#x27;ll have the best overall outcome.')
