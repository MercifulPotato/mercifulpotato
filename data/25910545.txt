They printed out a paper receipt and they verified those by a hand-count.<p>Second, considering who we&#x27;re dealing with, <i>it fundamentally doesn&#x27;t matter</i>. They aren&#x27;t actually arguing for more secure elections, they&#x27;re looking for any reason to throw out the results <i>because they lost</i>. If systems were up to &quot;international standards&quot; (I don&#x27;t know what those are, can you be more specific?) they&#x27;ll just say they&#x27;re &quot;liberal commie standards that you can&#x27;t trust, and we need <i>American standards</i>&quot; or some nonsense like that.<p>By all means have more secure elections. Just know that it won&#x27;t do anything in a scenario where the loser claims any result other than their victory is &quot;rigged&quot;.')
