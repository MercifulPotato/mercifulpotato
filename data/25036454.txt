My internet is cheap because our building has contractually guaranteed a single monthly payment on behalf of the many units in the building for some number of years.  You can make an investment based on that.<p>The City of Chicago is contractually guaranteeing payment on behalf of an even larger number of people.  Any private company can make an investment in better infrastructure based on that.  But the City is content with letting Xfinity provide garbage service in exchange for that money.  If they City said &quot;we will guarantee payment of up to $15 per month to any entity that can provide gigabit service to low-income families&quot; there would be multiple bids from local companies, and they&#x27;d all be able to do it profitably.')
