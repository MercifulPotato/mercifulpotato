Given the way patterning geometry works, if you want your chip to actually work you realistically need to use their libraries.<p>For major customers there will be a certain amount of tech support, especially on a new process; inevitably the first few wafers through will have terrible yields and it&#x27;s to the benefit of both parties to work out why.<p>A factory - any factory - is not just the set of capital equipment that makes it up, but the collection of staff that run it, including their often unwritten expertise on how the process works in ways that may differ from the theory.')
