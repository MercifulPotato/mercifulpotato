I was surprised I could get extra time on tests, extensions, etc. so easily. Unfortunately, none of those accommodations were even helpful for me. An extension would just make me fall further behind on other work, and I didn&#x27;t have test anxiety or a disability which would prevent me from taking tests quickly (though I was offered this accommodation anyway).<p>The only accommodation that I took once or twice was having a teacher re-weight marks from a missed assignment to other assignments, which was only good for me if I was going to do well on those other assignments. I think for mental health, the most important things my school did for me weren&#x27;t even accommodations. They were: letting me reattempt courses any number of times, letting me take a year off without even having to notify them, letting me take a reduced course load, and stuff like that. These things give no advantage to students who utilize them, but can make a world of a difference to students who need them. Without them I&#x27;d have failed my degree, but now I&#x27;m mentally healthy and I&#x27;m going to graduate soon.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s shitty that some people abuse accommodations, but most of them don&#x27;t give them an advantage over other students, and some students do need them, so getting rid of them is not really a solution. The main one that would give an advantage is increased test time (the solution to which is to write exams where students already have plenty of time -- the majority of my profs already do this).<p>As for the whole system being put at risk, I think the whole system is going down the shitter anyway. Why do I need to pay thousands and thousands of dollars a year for an education which could easily be delivered for less than a tenth of that price? Prestige? I don&#x27;t think universities will survive the modern Internet outside of programs which need hands-on lab experience.')
