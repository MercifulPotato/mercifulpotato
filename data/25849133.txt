SpaceX would love to get approval for unlimited orbital flights from Boca Chica, but it is four miles away from South Padre Island and it would probably require a massive deluge system and huge water storage to get approval for that.  The can also launch from Kennedy, but they are trying to keep all three options on the table for now.<p>The reality is that they bought the platforms for cheap, but haven&#x27;t made any renovations yet so for now it may just be a backup plan.')
