They&#x27;re so indexed on things that aren&#x27;t physically present in the moment it&#x27;s like talking someone through a psychosis or reasoning with someone with schizophrenia. It&#x27;s a mass hysteria machine. When I talk to some people, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m not even talking to people anymore, I&#x27;m talking to some node of the internet. We&#x27;ve basically invented language cancer, nice one guys.<p>It&#x27;s easy to imagine this being about the news (in whatever format: TV, radio, newspaper) or even <i>ideas in general</i>. This very forum is dedicated to talking about things that aren&#x27;t physically present.<p>Maybe I didn&#x27;t understand your argument, but to me it sounds a lot like you&#x27;re complaining about human nature.')
