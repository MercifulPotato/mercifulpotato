I can easily tell the difference but that&#x27;s cheating (after playing the sax of 17 years or so), the sax sounds a bit sharper and the oboe &#x27;rounder&#x27; if that makes any sense, which makes it easy to pick out what is played by which instrument. Originally this piece is for two oboes, but this is a really nice variation and lovely to see a saxophone used for more traditional music, I wished more people would do that (but saxes are typically frowned upon for performing classical works in a &#x27;serious&#x27; setting).')
