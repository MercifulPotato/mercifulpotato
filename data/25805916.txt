I can say that after writing it full-time for about half a year, and dabbling in and out of it for a bit longer, I&#x27;ve gotten as good with Rust as I was with JS or TypeScript.<p>I&#x27;ve seen people learn Rust as their first programming language, and it fills me with joy that the next generation of programmers won&#x27;t have to build up this vault of apocryphal knowledge I&#x27;ve had to over the years. Or, at least, not the same one. And hopefully not as large.<p>I&#x27;ve also found Rust to be a very pleasant application development language. As a former NodeJS developer, I&#x27;ve been able to replace Express with Warp and Electron and React with Iced. It&#x27;s not ready for all things, but it&#x27;s ready for a heck of a lot. And the question of &quot;what&#x27;s possible&quot; has broadened so much due to work by the community in even just the past year, I really think the majority of all other applications, including web frontend (cargo web), servers, desktop apps (iced), and mobile apps (cargo mobile), can be reasonably implemented in most part entirely in Rust within only a few years.')
