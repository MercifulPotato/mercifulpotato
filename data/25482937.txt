Item(by='joshuamorton', descendants=None, kids=[25483063], score=None, time=1608426494, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25482747, text='&gt; That&#x27;s a very bold claim to make, especially given that the half of the country that was heavily dependent on slavery lagged far behind, economically.<p>When you&#x27;re restricting yourself to first order effects, yes. But do you think that northern states didn&#x27;t, like, benefit from the southern economy. Eli Whitney was a northerner through and through. Cotton, however, was able to be acquired cheaply due to slave labor.<p>&gt; It enriched a relatively small but very wealthy planter class, but there&#x27;s a very strong argument to be made that it prevented economic development in the South. At the very least, something has to explain why the northern states economically developed so much more rapidly than the South during the first half of the 19th Century, and slavery is a very likely explanation.<p>Yes, the northern recovery was easier because they didn&#x27;t fall into a local maximum and have their economy <i>entirely</i> depend on slave labor to function. That doesn&#x27;t mean that the northern&#x2F;US economy didn&#x27;t <i>vastly</i> benefit from cheap tobacco (and particularly tobacco <i>exports</i>), cotton (and exports), and sugar production. (The price of cotton went up significantly in the direct postwar period, but went back down eventually due to Sharcropping and increased production in the south, as well as increased competition from Egypt and other nations).<p>We now, I think, generally recognize the interconnectedness of economies. Pretending that prior to 1865 economies weren&#x27;t also interconnected seems strange to me.')
