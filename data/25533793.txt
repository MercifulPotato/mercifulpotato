Here&#x27;s why you should avoid some of the common &quot;House Rules&quot;.<p>- Going around the board once before purchasing: needlessly prolongs the game and makes it unfair<p>- Fines collected at Free Parking: stretches the run time out artificially and makes the game far too lucked-based<p>- Landing on GO receives double salary: see above<p>- No auctions: takes away a major point of the game! You can&#x27;t just decline to purchase something, you must surrender the opportunity to your opponents who could snap it up on the cheap OR agree to plot against someone else by driving the price up.<p>- No requirement to build houses evenly: makes commonly-landed spaces death traps long before they should be, giving an unfair advantage to whomever lands on those properties. It&#x27;s no coincidence that the most commonly-landed on properties are in districts where buildings cost $150 a piece; nobody should be getting <i>one</i> hotel on the red&#x2F;yellow properties without first shelling out $1800!<p>- Unlimited buildings: a major late-game play is to deprive your opponents of the opportunity to purchase buildings, either by putting them on as many properties as you can or concentrating four houses on each of a dominated district.<p>If you don&#x27;t play with the official rules then, yeah, it&#x27;s just mindless dice rolling.')
