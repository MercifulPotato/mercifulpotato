Item(by='rootlocus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608135371, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25438596, text='&gt;  this idea that because some PS3 games that I have zero interest in have &quot;better&quot; gameplay, Cyberpunk isn&#x27;t worth playing seems insane to me.<p>It&#x27;s not really about Cyberpunk not worth playing, but rather that Cyberpunk severely underdelivered by raising the expectations of players who enjoyed these past games and were expecting something even better. I wasn&#x27;t expecting something better than DeusEx or older Bioware games (knights of the old republic, dragon age: origins, mass effect, neverwinter nights), but I really wasn&#x27;t expecting the mediocre story and the abundance of bugs.')
