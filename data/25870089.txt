The best managers are those who are good at management and business <i>and</i> the thing their team is doing, in the sense that they have a team and a company because it&#x27;d be too slow for them to the work all by themselves. But they could, if they weren&#x27;t under time pressure and lived forever.<p>&quot;MBA&quot; is being used here as a shorthand for a professional management class who don&#x27;t have any other skills, I don&#x27;t think it means explicitly the qualification. And because they don&#x27;t have any specific non-management skills, they think they can manage anything, which makes them mediocre managers at anything they do (at best).<p>In other words MBA has become a label for such people because the programmes appear to promote that worldview. But of course you can get people who have an MBA <i>and</i> who could also do their teams work, there&#x27;s no rule that says you can&#x27;t. And the discussion would probably not apply to those people.')
