Wouldn&#x27;t people coming to Lisbon just stay somewhere else if short-term rentals didn&#x27;t exist - like a hotel that is likely owned by a massive corporation? How would that be better?<p>I guess that way I look at it is that people want to visit cities for a variety of reasons. Those people need to stay somewhere. Wherever they stay will take up space, thus driving up rents through land scarcity. I am not really sure how people staying in someone&#x27;s apartment is much worse than staying in a hotel.<p>If rents are going up, it&#x27;s because there is more demand than supply. Unless Airbnb is actually increasing demand (perhaps?), I don&#x27;t see how it is really affecting this equation.')
