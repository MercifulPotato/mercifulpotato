The second expression is a solution to the maximum-subarray-sum problem. Both of them leverage a hell of a lot more than &quot;array&quot; programming; in each case, every single character brings its own semantics, and the combination yields the semantic of the entire expression.<p>Not disagreeing that NumPy is more popular. Am disagreeing that they are &quot;extremely similar&quot;.')
