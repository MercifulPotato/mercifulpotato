At this point if you are thinking do you really want to follow the system of someone who has taken 6 years, I&#x27;ll have to smirk and note your somewhat valid point.<p>It took 4 years of working with founders, and investors, to get the initial framework sorted out, which I made in Excel. I took another year to go through the framework again, and remake part of it in Access. Evidently I have a thing for MS. I released the Access version with the first few steps just here actually: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22445660" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22445660</a><p>Got around 120-ish users, got the feedback, etc, etc, and have been going through the framework again, and working on MVP v3. Currently, I am redesigning the UI, polishing various content, few other bits and bobs.<p>In terms of what I bring to the table: 24-25 years marketing and sales, 11-ish years working with startups, 4-5 years investor portfolio support (family offices and a couple of VC&#x27;s), investor relations, investor readiness, scout for a few VC&#x27;s, etc, etc.<p>I should state I have another startup that has been running for 3 ish years, and am also working on a growth system as well. I shall leave you with a link to a page that shows where I stand on some issues pertaining to startups: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;startizer.com&#x2F;problems-with-startup-material" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;startizer.com&#x2F;problems-with-startup-material</a><p>On a different note, I see a fair few founders looking to have a chat about their MVP, about early adopters, about launching, etc, etc. Happy to have a chat, don&#x27;t want anything in return.<p>Oh, one last thing, at no point will I be looking for outside investment, not looking to go big or go home, am already stuck at home as it is.<p>Cheers, Ace.<p>Edit: Sheesh, contact details; ace(at)startizer.com')
