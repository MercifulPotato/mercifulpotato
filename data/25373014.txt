There is no incentive to build a &quot;proper high-end&quot; fully active system for 500 Euro when you&#x27;re outcompeted on price and marketing by a manufacturer offering a &quot;pretty good but not quite high-end&quot; 400 Euro system that sounds good enough for all but a few (and then you&#x27;re all of a sudden competing with much more expensive systems as well).<p>Also, your estimate seems off to me. I don&#x27;t know your personal background, but prototyping a good-sounding speaker cabinet takes time beyond a few hours. Even more if you&#x27;re aiming for mass production. Add to that the DSP + n-channel Amp board, this will be expensive, even when building 10000, AND it is not trivial circuitry to design.<p>Also, &quot;proper high-end&quot; is a relative term. When researching which speakers to build and where to source chassis, I found a nearby &quot;proper high-end&quot; manufacturer integrating realtime measurements of cone movement into their DSP corrections...')
