So the TLDR (according to the author) is:\n&quot;The point is not to ‘not fail’, the point is to fail quickly and fail often in non-lethal ways so you have pragmatic, real-world knowledge to help you guide your decisions.&quot;<p>I liked the part where they also talk about &quot;asymmetrical risk&quot; and creating experiments where you may risk 10% of your capital, but if that thing works, it will double your business. I think this applies to all aspects of entrepreneurship, not just building the product. For example, I write about acquisition channels that consistently work for founders [1] and found the most successful ones place &quot;small bets&quot; that can potentially have &quot;big results&quot;. Like mentioning their idea in a FB community where they could get 1000s of potentially interested people. Time invested: 10 minutes. Results: 1000+ potential users. Not bad.<p>Nassim Taleb also talks about this &quot;asymmetrical risk&quot; concept [2] and a lot of his &quot;Antifragile&quot; book was about it. I&#x27;m really curious who originally came with this concept (it seems to go by different names, the OP calls it &quot;asymmetrical risk&quot;, Taleb calls it &quot;convexity), and it seems the first person who came up with it was someone from the finance industry decades ago.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firstpayingusers.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firstpayingusers.com</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.advisorperspectives.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2013&#x2F;07&#x2F;16&#x2F;nassim-nicholas-taleb-to-prevail-in-an-uncertain-world-get-convex" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.advisorperspectives.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2013&#x2F;07&#x2F;16&#x2F;nass...</a>')
