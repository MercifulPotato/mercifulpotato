For one, the &quot;blue wave&quot; of mail in ballots is a myth: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;LIX2cwQ.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;LIX2cwQ.jpg</a><p>Two: No one is really questioning the machines not &quot;working right&quot;. It is clear that there is no validation with the mail in ballots. MIB&#x27;s are some of the most rejected ballots there are, yet no one seems to have any stats on this, or the stats provided are very low. Then you factor in tons of twitter and facebook posts of women saying that they were sent two ballots, one for their maiden name and one for their current name, at both their current address and their old addresses. Never mind that it is state law in most of these places that a ballot has to be &quot;solicited&quot; and cannot just be mailed en mass via mail. Put another way, you can&#x27;t just mail 5 million ballots out to just 1 million physical addresses. I would not be surprised if during a recount, 50% of these MIBs are rejected.<p>Three: elections are quite predictable. There are 100&#x27;s of counties that for the last 40 years have always predicted the outcome. If this county is blue, then blue is our president, etc. This seems to still be the case this time around, except for the states in question.<p>People&#x27;s Pundit Daily <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Em0R9DRSbIE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Em0R9DRSbIE</a> for the most part has been a really good source of information on behind the scene numbers and what &quot;normal&quot; elections typically should look like. I&#x27;d recommend it.')
