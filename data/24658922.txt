The main difference from rss2email is that I&#x27;m not actually doing any SMTP - I&#x27;m just dumping files into a Maildir and letting isync do the uploading&#x2F;downloading. The actual reading then happens mostly with Mutt (which also just interacts with Maildir).<p>Like some others have noted, using email as a storage mechanism reduces part of the problem (tracking which items are read&#x2F;unread) to one that&#x27;s already solved (by IMAP). Additionally, using isync lets me have local copies of everything; this used to be really important when I was a &quot;poor&quot; grad student, because I could do cool stuff like download a bunch of comics ahead of time on my laptop, then read webcomics&#x2F;mailing-lists on the 2-hour bus ride. I still like having local copies of things on principle, although nowadays everybody is always-connected so it&#x27;s not as useful.')
