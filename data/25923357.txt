Sorry for adding to an offtopic, flamewar inspiring subthread. I hoped providing some sources for the GP&#x27;s comment might spur on some more productive discussion and i genuinely thought the other commenter was asking in good faith about sources for discussion. I was also genuinely curious as to the harsh reaction<p>I do see now the flamewar aspect to it and didn&#x27;t really stop to consider the initial topic of the article when I responded. I was just trying to focus on the actual topic of the commenter&#x27;s statement and kinda got lost in searching up articles. I was hoping to maybe bring some data and information into the  discussion that might steer it in a more productive direction.<p>It is an issue that could productively be discussed. It seems it didn&#x27;t end up being the case though and probably wasn&#x27;t the most appropriate comment thread to do so on.')
