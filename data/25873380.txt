EVs are great for people with garages, but not so much for the people in cities with no dedicated parking spot.<p>Banning ICEs is probably the best mechanism to get society to solve this problem.  Otherwise, most city-dwellers will just sit back and continue to drive ICE cars waiting for someone else to solve the charging issue.')
