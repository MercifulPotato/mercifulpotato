So much speculation is thrown around about how these hormones respond to real world experiences, but the evidence has been coarse grain from things like PET scans or sparse assays. Even if the tech used is not that new, the kind of data is. I am unaware of any data like this. Maybe I missed something. Is there another way neuroscience has managed to get an actual neuromodulator signal?')
