If anything, there is a tension regarding certain choices in the standardization of the orthography that are sometimes claimed to be Barcelona-centric and disregard the Valencian way of speaking.  This may be true, I&#x27;m not a linguist to judge; but it might certainly justify having separate entries in e.g., websites, just like one often sees for american and european spanish and french, or for brazilian and european portuguese (which nobody claims are separate languages).  Anyhow, the speech in the cities Tortosa and Castell√≥ (on both sides of the purported boundary between the languages) is nearly identical, and very different from that of, say, Barcelona or Girona.')
