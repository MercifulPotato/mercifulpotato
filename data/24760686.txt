These past few months, I&#x27;ve been really active, getting a lot done, but burning out, because I&#x27;m less time distracted and don&#x27;t snap out of work mode.  Later in the afternoon, I&#x27;ll hit a flow and don&#x27;t really break out of it until my fiance is yelling at me because it&#x27;s 9pm and I&#x27;m still at my desk.<p>I&#x27;ve hit a few points where I&#x27;m completely unable to focus, and last month did about 4 weeks in a row where I put in over 70 hours.<p>I need some level of interaction, or I just never break out of work mode.  And I don&#x27;t have all the distractions at home I once would have.')
