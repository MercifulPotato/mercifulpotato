Item(by='philwelch', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609198254, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25562648, text='&gt; The luxury isn&#x27;t cooking. The luxury is being able to have a large room full of machinery dedicated to preparing meals for, on average, 2.5 people. These days, average people can barely afford living spaces as-is. That room adds to the cost substantially and is not likely to be recouped against eating out, unless eating out means eating at places that are selling entertainment alongside food.<p>So, my kitchen has a range, sink, dishwasher, and full-size refrigerator. It is small but it is a full kitchen. It is the smallest &quot;room&quot; in my apartment; I probably pay a few hundred dollars a month for it. The cost difference between cooking at home and eating out makes up for that in a couple of weeks for me.<p>Kitchens aren&#x27;t that expensive.')
