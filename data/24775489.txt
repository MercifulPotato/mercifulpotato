Once upon a time, their Usenet archive was great, and gradually they eroded the search and the UI.<p>* As far as I know, they never offered their archive through NNTP or any open protocol. It seems to me that if they offered the archives now, a number of organizations might at least consider stepping up. Instead, they seem to operate as a data roach motel.')
