In my opinion, it&#x27;s not enough to distrust the server where the backups are stored. The client should also not need to keep around a key that can be used to decrypt the backups for the purpose of encrypting new backups.<p>This is quite easy to accomplish with public key cryptography - just use a new, random AES key for each backup job, then encrypt that with a public key you keep around. The private key can be stored offline in cold storage.')
