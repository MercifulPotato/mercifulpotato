It’s difficult to answer this question objectively, however I will offer my approach as an investor (please don’t shoot me for trying to answer the question).<p>Priorities and weights:\n1. (.25) Team (commitment, experience and expertise)<p>2. (.25) Market (size, accessibility, approach)<p>3. (.15) Product status (a. Concept b. Lab prototype c. Demonstrable prototype (alpha) d. Testable proto-product (beta) e. Market-ready (MVP)<p>4. (.15) Traction (a. No users b. 10-100 users&#x2F;customers and&#x2F;or award(s) c. 100-1000 users&#x2F;customers d. More than 1000 users&#x2F;customers<p>5. (.1) Revenue (a. No revenue b. Grant, SBIR or other c. Product revenue &lt; $100k d. Product revenue $100k - $250k e. Product revenue &gt; $250k<p>6. (.1) Gut instinct<p>A = a multiple on revenue (depends on industry)<p>0-12 months:  $0 to $2.5 million.  ($2.5MM * weight)<p>12-18 months: $0 to ~$3.5MM (A + $2.5MM * weight)<p>18-24 months: $0 to ~$5MM (A + $3.5MM * weight)<p>24-36 months: $0 to ~$10MM (A + $5MM * weight)<p>This is just my rough approach, and it’s not always appropriate. Based on some experience and where I invest, I would say it probably applies for most of the US other than Sili Valley or other Western US startup hubs where investors are more “optimistic.”')
