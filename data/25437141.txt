And the context in which we (all right, I) most often hear the word is the latter - when a government takes property without paying for it, or paying only a pittance.<p>Mea culpa, though:  Until I looked at dictionary.com, I didn&#x27;t know it <i>could</i> be used for eminent domain.<p>&gt; All I did was ask a question.<p>&quot;How can someone be so callous?&quot;  That&#x27;s a question, but it&#x27;s not <i>just</i> a question.  It&#x27;s pushing a viewpoint.<p>&gt; &gt; Note that this is a completely separate discussion from whether eminent domain actually pays people market prices for their homes.<p>&gt; By definition, it does not.<p>By <i>definition</i>?  I call BS.  In fact, the Constitution <i>requires</i> &quot;just compensation&quot;.  Now, have governments abused that, and actually offered less than just compensation?  Of course.  But &quot;by definition&quot;?  No.<p>&gt; elides the relevant factor: people are being &lt;strike&gt;expropriated&lt;&#x2F;strike&gt; deprived of their homes through threat of violence in order to lower the cost of infrastructure.<p>Nice whine.  But in fact the government does have the right to do that, and for quite good reasons.<p>And, if they make the tunnel, they&#x27;re going to have to take <i>different</i> peoples&#x27; houses.<p>&gt; Perhaps the government needs to exercise fiscal discipline. Perhaps the government can&#x27;t afford a new rail.<p>On that point, I agree with you at least some of the time.')
