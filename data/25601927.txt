In the early 80s consumer-grade DSP didn&#x27;t exist <i>at all</i>. There were some exotic studio processors with slow microprocessors supported by custom hardware multipliers, but 8MHz 16-bit microprocessors were considered fast, expensive, and exotic.<p>Roland had a stellar run with their hardware designs. The Junos may be one of the best synthesizers ever made hitting the bullseye for price, character, simple but flexible programmability, and a legendary sweet but powerful sound.<p>There&#x27;s a finesse to this kind of audio design that IMO makes a lot of Eurorack seem clumsy and uninspired in comparison.')
