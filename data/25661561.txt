For example, Brad Raffensperger is a man of integrity. Despite my personal distaste for his politics, he is thoroughly committed to accurately counting the vote and having a peaceful transfer of power despite immense pressure from his party&#x27;s leader, the most powerful man in the country. He is up for reelection in 2022, and he will almost certainly be primaried by someone who believes in these conspiracy theories. If that succeeds, we can kiss election integrity in Georgia goodbye.<p>I don&#x27;t think this coup attempt right now will succeed. But the stab-in-the-back myth being created as we speak is going to set the stage for a future coup later this decade, which may very well be successful.<p>And even if our election integrity safeguards continue to work in 2024, we will be left with an electoral system where we can only safely elect one party, because the other party will certainly perform a self-coup if they ever end up in power again. We will either have a de facto one-party system (keep electing Democrats because the Republicans are an existential threat to the republic) or a government-enforced one-party system (Republicans in power will refuse to certify any future elections they lose).')
