I don&#x27;t think depression is related to remembering (I am no doctor nor shrink) but anecdotally my wife has suffered severe depression for a long time and could remember most of her dreams just fine. I suspect it&#x27;s something to do how memories are retained, I say that because I don&#x27;t have sharpest short term memory.')
