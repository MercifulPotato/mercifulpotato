Is there an alternative social media? No, but that makes it a <i>monopsony</i>, since you work for Facebook by using the site, and they pay you in cat pictures. Facebook&#x27;s business is ads, and its competitors are Google and television.<p>Facebook doesn&#x27;t merely allow sharing information, it facilitates it -- worse, it selectively facilitates information whose availability is useful <i>to Facebook, not to you</i>. Facebook spends billions of dollars developing algorithms to control what you see on Facebook. Where in the &quot;free expression&quot; handbook does it mention that newsfeed posts which support the bottom line shall be seen more often than those that don&#x27;t?<p>This idea, that anything that happens on Facebook has <i>anything</i> to do with &quot;free expression&quot; or open, unmediated communication between acquaintances, is the first thing that we need to get rid of. When people stop believing that, they might use Facebook much less -- which would be a good thing!')
