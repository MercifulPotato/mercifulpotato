For others, it has only started to work well thanks to brave Americans standing up and risking their lives to demand that it work well for more people than before.<p>A lot of that work involved dismissing some ideologies as fundamentally incompatible with America. Speaking of civility, one time we literally had to go to war with ourselves over what one side would characterize as a mere “political disagreement.”<p>The Constitution failed to protect people from systematic rape, torture, and forced labor for nearly the first <i>100 years</i> of its governance over America. It failed to allow women to get credit before <i>1974</i>. None of what we have today is guaranteed. Plenty of nations have slid backwards from liberalism.')
