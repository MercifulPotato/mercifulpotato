Posts about other languages center on some problem that language solved for them, or some problem they have with it. Clojure posts are always cold-call cheerleading about how good it is in a general sense.  Tell me something cool you did with it. Tell me how it saved you a mind-blowing amount of work. I&#x27;m not interested in hearing for the Nth time how someone think it&#x27;s an overall excellent choice.')
