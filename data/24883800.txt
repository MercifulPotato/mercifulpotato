I have a Glowforge that was about $4k I think, and we&#x27;re a member of a makerspace that has like a $40k laser cutter we use.  But we&#x27;ve easily re-couped that through my stuff, my wife&#x27;s business doing laser cut&#x2F;engraved signs, and custom work for folks (e.g., signs for businesses, putting artists&#x27; works on ornaments, etc.).<p>And yep I do all the designs using a mixture of Illustrator and Procreate on my iPad. :)')
