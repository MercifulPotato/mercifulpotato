But money isn&#x27;t neutral, you need to pay attention to the Cantillion Effect.<p>When money enters into the economy through the wealthy, they buy stocks and it gets trapped. You can track this trapped money by looking at the velocity. When you increase the money supply by dropping interest rates, its essentially given according to whom is already wealthy. So if interest rates drop, you should expect the money supply to rise, velocity to drop, and assets to rise, but CPI should barely be touched. Therefore the more wealth inequality you have, the less that money supply increases through interest rates affects the CPI.<p>The CPI tracks how the common person spends their money. On the other hand if you were to institute a UBI, this would barely touch the money supply, but the CPI would sky-rocket. Disentangle the two concepts.<p>I&#x27;ve built up an intuition that the money supply should match changes in productivity, and that if it doesn&#x27;t it will eventually lead to problems. But it&#x27;s also notable that the trend is extremely important. If you do match, everything should be fine and this can last forever. If the money supply rises faster than productivity, you see what we&#x27;ve seen these past 50 years since we&#x27;ve been off the gold standard, a huge surge in asset prices. And if productivity rises faster than the money supply, people flee assets and into money. This is called a Deflationary Spiral.<p>Dalio in his &quot;Explaining the Economic Machine&quot; video talks about a &quot;Beautiful Deleveraging&quot;. My thought currently is that such a thing isn&#x27;t possible. If you wait for the debt to get so bad that you have to do something, you can&#x27;t match productivity anymore. Therefore the only thing you are left to do is grow the money supply less than productivity. And that changes everything. Suddenly the trend is to money. And once the money managers work that out, they all rush out of assets and into cash. This triggers a crash. So it&#x27;s the trend that dominates, and there is no way to balance the deleveraging.')
