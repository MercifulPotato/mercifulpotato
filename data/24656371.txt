It often flys in the face of achieving greater freedoms through rules and social cooperation.  People are familiar with the concept but often don&#x27;t think about it, like driving on the road, if people were allowed individual choice about how they want to drive on roads it would be a nightmare to drive on the roads, but luckily, people aren&#x27;t &quot;free&quot; to choose which side of the road to drive on ,etc, there are a bunch of rules, and because the vast majority follow these &quot;restrictions&quot; a greater freedom is achieved, you can get from A to B in relatively short time periods in relative safety.  Cooperative freedoms tend to give some of the greatest actual freedoms, however, they need to be underpinned and balanced with a set of core individual rights.  Working out that balance is... tricky.')
