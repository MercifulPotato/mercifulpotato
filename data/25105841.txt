But there&#x27;s also some confusion where winners get announced before the total counting is done. They are just announced when there is believed to be statistical certainty. A nation wide (full) recount is not happening in a few hours and if it was I would expect it to have a decent error margin. The UK also doesn&#x27;t have as many options on the ballots as the US you have president, house, senate, judges, reps, measures, state constitution amendments, etc. You can&#x27;t make a one to one comparison.')
