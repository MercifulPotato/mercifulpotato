Item(by='jandrese', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609877148, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25639569, text='&gt; The idea is most people will assess the value of their house at a premium<p>This seems a bit unlikely to me since you&#x27;re directly raising your taxes by doing this.  I&#x27;d expect the opposite, most people undervaluing their house on the assumption that &quot;it won&#x27;t happen to me&quot;.  Also, if I bought for $200k 10 years ago then it can&#x27;t possibly access for $450k today right?  People don&#x27;t have a good grasp on how fast a market can inflate given the conditions.<p>I would expect a lot more anti-tax guys who access their property at $1 and if someone comes up to take it they pull out their shotgun.<p>For this to work at all the government would have to provide a minimum and possibly maximum based on traditional assessments.  Basically the system we have now except that you can say that you&#x27;ve done some work to spruce up your house so it&#x27;s worth more and you like paying more taxes.  But it also has the &quot;feature&quot; where you can be evicted by a person with money at any time.  Can you imagine this in Silicon Valley?  Old people being kicked out of their home by tech-bros would be a daily story.')
