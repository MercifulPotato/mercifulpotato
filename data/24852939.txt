Again, the data matched the &quot;business as usual&quot; scenario.<p>The point here is that The Limits to Growth &quot;business as usual&quot; scenario predicts a collapse of the global system by the mid 21st century, with first signs appearing somewhere between 2015 and 2030.<p>This Global Trends report, like many other future-probing reports, do not seem to place much emphasis to the megatrends explored in The Limits to Growth. I find it strange, since resource depletion, environmental&#x2F;climate problems and sudden population drops certainly would have a massive impact on everything and completely perturb e.g. the geopolitical landscape.<p>Of course the &quot;business as usual&quot; isn&#x27;t going to end up exactly as described. But, since according to Turner, the data in 2012 was more or less tracking the &quot;business as usual&quot;, factoring it in might perhaps make for more robust predictions.')
