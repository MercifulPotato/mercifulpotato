It&#x27;s a different submission with different ID and URL. It gets no special bonus.<p>- The system automatically reposts your submission. It gets an automatic front page spot (low on the front page), and it drops from the front page quickly if still nobody is interested. The timestamp of your submission is changed, so it looks new (this leads to confusion sometimes).<p>- You get an email with a special submission link. When you resubmit using that link, it&#x27;s basically the same as #2, as far as I know.<p>I still don&#x27;t really understand the difference between #2 and #3. Maybe #2 is triggered by super-users and #3 by dang? I have no idea.')
