This is how the pilot of the Lion Air flight the day before prevented disaster.<p>Yes, but the failure they experienced feels absolutely nothing like runaway trim. It&#x27;s great that some pilots were able to troubleshoot the failure in time, but that&#x27;s not something you can really expect from everyone. Adequate training may well have prevented the mishaps, but the airplane as a system was still poorly designed.')
