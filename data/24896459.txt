One of the easy ways to get kids to focus (for a little while) is to create stress and fear. E.g., parental pressure, yelling, draconian deadlines. So it&#x27;s easy for people to develop habits where they need stress and fear to really focus.<p>Once I realized that a lot of my procrastination and apparent struggles to pay attention were bad childhood habits (driven by bad parental habits), things got better in two ways. One, I started structuring work in ways that created modest, even pressure. In my case, that&#x27;s a kanban system with small units of work and frequent delivery, so I always have next deadline that&#x27;s pretty close. Two, I have looked for other sources of energy and have tried to build habits around that. For me it&#x27;s that I enjoy being productive and feeling like I&#x27;m making a difference. So I&#x27;ve built habits around that.<p>And in case it helps, the habit-building secret for me is that if an experience is at least mildly pleasant or rewarding each time I do it, it&#x27;ll turn into a habit. But if it&#x27;s a negative experience each time, I&#x27;ll build up an aversion that makes a mule look reasonable.<p>I hope that helps!')
