In hospitals, bed sores are a well known problem associated with excessive in-bed time. Muscular atrophy is another.<p>It&#x27;s kinda crazy how just a couple years ago there was a standing desk craze touting the miraculous benefits to muscular&#x2F;skeletal health, and now we&#x27;ve got a 180 degree turn with a major publication putting out a claim that laying down for extensive amounts of time is somehow a good idea (never mind the whole &quot;sitting is the new smoking&quot; thing!)<p>Geez!')
