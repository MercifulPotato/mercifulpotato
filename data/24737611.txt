It might have made sense back when it was written but it&#x27;s not how modern C is typically written, and it would be very annoying for modern C coders to put up with these shenanigans.<p>Multiple inclusions are hardly a problem nowadays, with header guards it means that subsequent inclusions won&#x27;t actually include anything and the performance impact is fairly negligible the vast majority of the time. C compilers are pretty damn fast these days and in my experience it&#x27;s the optimization pass that slows things down the most, not parsing includes.<p>Also in general I tend to take what Rob Pike says with a grain of salt, he&#x27;s a very smart guy and he definitely says interesting things but he has weird idiosyncracies. He&#x27;s definitely worth listening to, but I wouldn&#x27;t follow his advice blindly. See his weird take about how &quot;syntax highlighting is juvenile&quot; for instance.')
