The community agreed that no semantics or ABi breaking changes will land to Rust,\nEVER.<p>This is not a lesson from Py th on, but from C++, which introduces breaking changes every single release, which are much smaller than Python but still a pain in million LOc code bases.<p>If that ever happens, it was agreed that the result would be a different language, with a different name.<p>That is, editions don’t have this problem because the FUD that you are trying to spread every single time this issue comes up cannot happen, by design.<p>Your argument “Rust editions don’t solve this problem because they don’t handle semantic or ABI changes” is false,\nbecause in Rust there CANNOT be any semantics or ABI changes, and editions handle this situation just fine.<p>In the context of Python 2 vs 3 this argument makes even less sense, because editions allows combining libraries from different editions ina forward and backward compatible way without issues. Source: work on multiple &gt;500kLOC Rust code base and one &gt;1 million LOC and they all use crates from all editions, and mix &amp; match them, without any issues, doing LTO across them, using dynamic libraries, and all possible combinations of binaries across 4 major platforms.')
