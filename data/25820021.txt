I can afford the boots I can afford today and I like them. But I am sure that 10 years from now Iâ€™ll be able to afford better ones.<p>If you can get 10 years out of a pair of boots it means they were good. I&#x27;ve had a pair of Caterpillar boots break after 2 years. I&#x27;m happy to see a review site with a strong focus on long term ownership.')
