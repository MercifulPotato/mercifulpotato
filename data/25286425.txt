The IDE I use the most often, Xcode, gets progressively worse to use on older hardware too because the engineers that work on it upgrade their computers to the latest as well. If your tooling has slower release cycles, your hardware can often hold out longer, but if you need to work with fast-moving tools you get to feel this pain yourself. It&#x27;s really problematic because these policies have been around for quite a while now, so there are multiple levels of reasons pushing you towards the easy route of just buying faster hardware, which perpetuates the cycle even more.')
