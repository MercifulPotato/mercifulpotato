I typically use my Sony a6000 with a 30mm f&#x2F;1.4 lens at f&#x2F;2.0. You won&#x27;t be able to get the same kind of background separation using the tiny sensor on the HQ camera.<p>I bought a Tamron 1.4 8mm lens that gives a similar effect to what my Sigma 30mm E mount lens gives at f&#x2F;4 or so, if it&#x27;s positioned about 2&#x27; away.')
