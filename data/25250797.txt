Jekyll is okay but extremely slow with hundreds of Ruby plug-in dependencies and nonsensical breaking changes between versions.<p>The author is pedantic and seems to just not want to use other tools. That’s fine. But this is a dumb road for others to follow.<p>Remember the entire thing started because they don’t like front matter. They could literally have written a script to parse front matter, which are literally a few plain text lines.<p>Then they wanted asciidoc but without the dependency. Except their own code will likely have an asciidoc dependency unless they wrote their own entire asciidoc parser. In which case they could also have done this and plugged it into the same script.<p>“You don’t want to get stuck into the thinking of others,” they scream into the wires, followed by hobbling themselves into the most minimal viable product straight jacket imaginable.<p>Fool programmers and their time are soon parted.')
