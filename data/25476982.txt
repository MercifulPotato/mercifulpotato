True, it may rely on other service, but not in the way that the two services would do the exact same job together as if you&#x27;re invoking a `private` method helpers.<p>For ex., filling a shopping cart should be its own thing. Searching for stuff to fill that cart can be another service that is just a dumb catalog. No data consistency problems here.')
