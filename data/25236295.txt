This kind of boundless credulity, which is unfortunately quite widespread, has sent innocent people to their executions.<p>You are ascribing a &quot;kernel of truth&quot; to a completely unsubstantiated claim because the comment includes specific details and because of the username of the poster, which they themselves chose and did not have to justify.<p>There is absolutely no evidence that the claim by &quot;exzappos&quot; is true or false. Please don&#x27;t imply anything else.<p>&gt; the real reason I believe these claims is because my gut says it is true. Not the best reason, of course.
