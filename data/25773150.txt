Not everybody has got rich parents or sugar daddies, some people start from nearly zero and try to climb the social ladder.<p>A higher salary can unlock multiple benefits, in terms of long-term economical security (e. g. in case of market crash and companies go bankrupt &#x2F; berserk mode, laying people off) and maybe buy yourself a house&#x2F;apartment.<p>Plus, saving for children&#x27;s future is one of the best gift a parent can do.<p>Coming to an end: having a salary which is similar to what in SF are offered would be really good')
