Not sure if I agree but it&#x27;s a reasonable position. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any major country like that though. A representative volunteered and  publically campaigned as being for X, Y, and Z, so either they vote for those positions and the public gets what they asked for, or they don&#x27;t and they lose their job. In practice, life is more complicated of course, but that&#x27;s the idea.')
