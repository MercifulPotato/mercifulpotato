Light can travel without a medium because the photons are themselves moving forward. They have a frequency, but the frequency is caused by movement side to side, on a different axis than their heading.<p>Sound waves are physical. They are by definition in an atomic-based medium. Matter at the source of the sound is pushed, compressing it, which pushes the matter in front of it (uncompressing the original matter). If there&#x27;s no matter to push, sound isn&#x27;t a thing (thus nobody in space being able to hear you scream). It&#x27;s not so much information being transmitted as matter being shoved. The frequency is amount of time between shoves, and that wave is in the direction of the motion (because the forward shoving is the frequency and the motion). Sound waves are not an abstract transmission of information.<p>It&#x27;s certainly true that you can encode a sound as an information and send that information electromagnetically, but that transmission is not itself sound. Similarly, you could measure the speed of traffic in LA, email those times to New York, and then drive some cars in New York in a way that produces the same traffic speed, but you did not transmit the traffic at the speed of light, and this exercise would not be meaningful to a discussion on the maximum velocity of a car.')
