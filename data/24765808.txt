Item(by='conductr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602599003, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24765652, text='&gt; are people really weighing that so heavily that they’re moving?<p>Given region as a large portion of young&#x2F;single professionals, I believe it. What you pay to move&#x2F;break a lease is a fraction of what you’d save after a few months of “normal” rent. Or no rent if you’re going to stay with your parents. It will be relatively easy to move back when they need to, and prices will be better. This group has no deep local community dependancies (eg family, childcare, ete). and is still probably rather nomadic from their college days.<p>I personally live in Texas, lower COL, but I am tied into my local community due to family, owning my home, and general entrenchment type stuff that comes with age. Otherwise I’d have bailed in April for a rural or expat setting.')
