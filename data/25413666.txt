It&#x27;s orders of magnitude away from any sensible by the books calculation on what Tesla&#x27;s valuation should be.<p>Just concede that you invested because you felt like it. It&#x27;s probably okay, you very well might end up making a ton, and honestly who&#x27;s to say the traditional methods are correct or are even applicable in 2020? But let&#x27;s not kid ourselves trying to justify Tesla&#x27;s value using traditional metrics.')
