Item(by='totalZero', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611853779, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25943501, text='Wall Street is driven by money, relationships, and reputation. Obviously, Plotkin lost money here in terms of his this-year payout. But I believe he also takes a hit in other ways.<p>On Money: Plotkin&#x27;s fund lost money for his investors, all of whom are rich people who will be upset with him. There will probably be some redemptions, and AUM will go down -- not just because he lost some of it, but because investors will pull out some of what remains.<p>On Reputation: Plotkin ends up with egg on his face because he held the bag for a bunch of mom-and-pop investors on Robin Hood. You know how Soros is known for famously breaking the Pound Sterling? Plotkin is now known for infamously being broken by GME.<p>On Relationships: Plotkin lost even after getting an injection of liquidity from Cohen and Griffin. That can&#x27;t be good for his standing with those two power players.')
