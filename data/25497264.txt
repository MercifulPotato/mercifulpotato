My partner went to see doc, they ran a few tests, told her it would probably be covered by insurance and then we got a bill for $1700. They said it wasn&#x27;t &quot;surprise&quot; bill because it wasn&#x27;t out of network. I told them &quot;it is a surprise to us!&quot;<p>From then on, we always ask the cost of every single test&#x2F;procedure. (In fairness to the hospital, they did give us a $50&#x2F;month, interest free payment plan.)')
