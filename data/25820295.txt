First the pre-smartphone carriers acting as gateways (and they were absolutely happy to do what Apple are doing now), and then Apple when the iPhone came out. Google put billions into establishing a parallel ecosystem where you can install apps outside of the Play Store and even fork the entire OS.<p>They did this because the creators of Android were very wise. They knew that total power over what apps could be run would corrupt them, so they made sure to put in back doors so if they did become corrupted, users could still escape. And indeed they were correct about that: Google is now fully corrupted in the same way Apple is. However, you can still install the Parler app on Android if you want. It&#x27;s not as convenient as through the Play Store but it&#x27;s not much worse than the experience of doing so on a PC or Mac.')
