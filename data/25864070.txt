The stories always talk about how he traded 10,000 Bitcoins for two pizzas. That&#x27;s only a small part of the story, what actually happened is drastically worse. He sold several times that many Bitcoins in other low-value transactions at the same time (some straight up for cash) and did the pizza trade more than once.<p>Pizza guy likely traded a minimum of 50,000 Bitcoins for less than a few hundred dollars of value. That&#x27;s $1.6 billion presently at 50k.')
