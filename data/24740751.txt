I have no trouble at all switching between the Kinesis and a macbook keyboard (which is also set to Dvorak) but I&#x27;d definately be slow to type English (back to normal person typing speed), and writong code in vim would be a nightmare if I was forced to use a random machine and not able to switch the layout.<p>Luckily, you can switch easily to Dvorak on most systems for the last couple of decades. Something that&#x27;s less true once you start inventing your own layouts (though I think Colemak, Neo and Workman are decently suppprted).<p>Also, people who learned to touch type QWERTY suggest you can swap back even after learning a new layout. I never learned qwerty that well but return to standard nerd level of familiarity.')
