I generally am opposed to paying for what I don&#x27;t use (prevalence of unlimited data plans in the US drives me nuts), that&#x27;s why the article resonates with me - I usually frame it as &quot;don&#x27;t optimize for the edge case&quot;. What the post misses to me in the house example is that homes usually at the very least maintain their value, so the added expenses are only related to maintenance (higher property tax, cost of heating, cleaning, etc).')
