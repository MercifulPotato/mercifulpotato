You&#x27;re either a team lead or an &quot;exceptionally strong individual contributor&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s not really that chill, and if you don&#x27;t continue to do those things (lead or be exceptionally strong) that will show on your perf and therefore your compensation. Going from L4 to L5 means committing yourself to doing that on an ongoing basis. Remember at Google that &quot;consistently meets expectations&quot; is only a 2 out of 5 rating, just above &quot;Needs improvement.&quot;<p>Coasting at L4 (&quot;SWE III&quot;) could be fine. Large independent technical contributions, manage your own priorities, participate in design, etc. Solid individual contributor. Really equivalent to &quot;senior developer&quot; at most other jobs.<p>But now let&#x27;s say you want to go transfer to a new project. The manager on the other team sees you&#x27;ve been at Google many years, but still at L4. Hm. Results may vary.<p>Not everyone makes a good team lead. Especially in a place like Google surrounded by PhDs and super achievers. But the expectation at Google up until very recently was basically that you should become that, or get out. Now in the last few years, it&#x27;s been stated it&#x27;s perfectly fine to plateau at L4. But I&#x27;m not convinced that that&#x27;s the reality of the culture or expectations of managers.')
