There also is no spec for &quot;Minimum voltage for logic high&quot;. You should be able to test this by hooking the fan up to power, measuring the voltage on its disconnected PWM line, and finding a steady voltage (5v?).<p>I don&#x27;t know enough about the RPi to know if any PWMs can be configured as open drain and 5v tolerant. If not you&#x27;d need to add a single discrete transistor.')
