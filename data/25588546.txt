I&#x27;d rather empower workers collectively than make people dependent on welfare. This, in contrast to UBI is I think viable across the spectrum and actually what people want.<p>This one I don&#x27;t get. Empowering workers, in leftie politics, usually means some version of labor, wage, union,... protection laws (not saying this wrong, I&#x27;m myself seeped in leftisms). Thus creating a dependency to the state to protect one&#x27;s work from the ruthless.<p>Where is the principal difference between being dependent on the state for cash vs protection?<p>Wrt the larger UBI point: I see it more as an opportunity for people to find deeper, more personally meaningful, work. My inner optimist hopes people would seek out more fulfilling, self-determined, work. My inner pessimist sees the Wall-E thing, though I would not call it underpinning. My inner realist would like to see more studies.')
