The deceased are gone; they have no rights, they can&#x27;t be harmed, they can&#x27;t be wronged. Even the desecration of remains is an affront to the living, not the dead. All that&#x27;s left is for the living to respect (or disrespect) the legacy of the deceased, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned there is no question of ethics.<p>So yes, I think it&#x27;s quite disrespectful to &quot;digitally resurrect&quot; someone and have that avatar do things the real person wouldn&#x27;t do. In fact I think having it do anything is disrespectful because can we truly say what another (now deceased) person would have done? That&#x27;s an unanswerable question, there&#x27;s only speculation.<p>The ethical question I see is whether it&#x27;s right to unleash this upon the living. Though I suspect it will happen regardless.')
