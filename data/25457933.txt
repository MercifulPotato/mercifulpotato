Should one expect LESS? The global culture just doesn&#x27;t mesh and its messy to provide exception policy in  platforms across borders. This isn&#x27;t a political bait &#x2F; trick either. I just finished reading NO RULES RULES and listening to the French and English markets and how they deliver context and feedback, it&#x27;s just one of those things you have to fight to overcome. I wish it was better, but with half the world right now culturally different than the West (if not more) - not going to change.')
