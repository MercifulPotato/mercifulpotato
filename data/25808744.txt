You can blame John for letting you down, but you can&#x27;t blame John for you feeling let down.<p>You are responsible for your own emotions. Recognizing that doesn&#x27;t make you a zen robot. You can still feel. But don&#x27;t put those feelings on other people and make them responsible for making you feel the way you want to feel.<p>You can recognize patterns for your emotions, like &quot;I get sad when people make fun of me&quot;, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that you have to be sad when people make fun of you. Recognizing the distinction is what gives power to change.<p>And sure, there are limits. The feelings that arise when tortured for example are rooted in physiology and near unavoidable. But I suspect that John didn&#x27;t let you down by waterboarding you.')
