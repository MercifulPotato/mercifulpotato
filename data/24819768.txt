We really saw this for say, SSL deprecation.<p>If you made good choices (e.g. maybe you depend on Python&#x27;s Requests) you had to go out of your way to make problems for yourself, by default the software understands that it should prefer shiny modern cryptography, allow anything that&#x27;s probably fine, and reject nasty broken stuff. What counts as &quot;shiny modern&quot; or &quot;nasty broken&quot; will vary over time, but it&#x27;s not likely you, as the application developer, were best placed to decide when you wrote the code, so unless you specifically did so the runtime decides.<p>In contrast Microsoft shipped not one but several distinct C++ APIs <i>and</i> .NET APIs where you&#x27;d need to go back and periodically modify old code (e.g. to specify newer TLS versions) or now it doesn&#x27;t work because there was no provision for programmers to just let the runtime do the Right Thing.')
