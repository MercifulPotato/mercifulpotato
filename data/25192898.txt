Even so, looking at this project, I can&#x27;t help but recognize some names among the primary developers.<p>I don&#x27;t even remember what all the drama was about—as I recall, it was exceedingly stupid—but I know it was nasty enough to drive Saurik and much of the rest of the old guard away from the Jailbreak community for good.
