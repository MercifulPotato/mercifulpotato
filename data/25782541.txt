Great question. You are right that Clarity smart contracts have direct visibility into Bitcoin, so you can write a contract that has logic triggered by pure Bitcoin transactions.<p>Moving Bitcoin to Stacks is a bit more complicated and there are several ways:<p>a) Wrapped assets. Tokensoft + Anchorage (custodian) have a solution that they&#x27;re calling xBTC where a &quot;wrapped Bitcoin&quot; is issued on the Stacks chain. Such wrapped assets exist on other chains like Ethereum as well with one main difference that xBTC is secured by Bitcoin itself.<p>b) There are more decentralized solutions similar to Keep network, where threshold signatures can be used to move the assets by a group of nodes.<p>c) The most decentralized way of doing this is by locking your BTC directly on BTC chain, using Clarity to monitor funds, and then having Clarity trigger release of funds on Bitcoin chain. This requires Clarity logic to trigger Bitcoin state changes. This is theoretically possible but at R&amp;D stage currently.')
