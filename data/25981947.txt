Item(by='danShumway', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612122793, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25972313, text='&gt; The problem with UBI is that some jobs suck but need to be done<p>I&#x27;m somewhat skeptical of the UBI train, but this particular objection has always rubbed me the wrong way. Those jobs <i>should</i> cost more.<p>If the only thing keeping people in a job is the threat of poverty, and they&#x27;re not being paid enough otherwise to incentivize them to do the work, then that&#x27;s not a free market. It&#x27;s not really significantly different from holding a gun to their head or coercing them into doing the work.<p>What&#x27;s going to happen if the people stuck in dead-end jobs retrain to work at better jobs? What&#x27;s going to happen if the economy improves and suddenly they have more opportunities? The problem with underpaying essential jobs is that it forces people to think of those market outcomes as undesirable. I don&#x27;t like the framing that says that if elderly-care workers retrain and have a choice whether or not to work in nursing homes, that&#x27;s a bad thing. That seems very, very counter to how we should think about a healthy jobs market.<p>I don&#x27;t want a framing that tells me that the economy becoming too good or people having too many job opportunities is a problem because those people need to be financially pressured into working underpaid jobs. To me, that&#x27;s a very anti-free-market way of thinking about the economy. Jobs that are difficult or undesirable should have more compensation because they have less demand. That is the entire basis of the jobs market and of supply&#x2F;demand, we shouldn&#x27;t be trying to undermine those principles.')
