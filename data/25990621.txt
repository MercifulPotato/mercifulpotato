I spent most of 1999 rewriting a payroll application in VB6 + SQL Server + ASP which was one of the last remaining things on an IBM crate that they wanted to get rid of because it wasn&#x27;t trendy any more. I ended up basically rewriting some of the stuff verbatim. The only gain was that they had a web GUI for it rather than a terminal emulator and I&#x27;m not sure that was a gain for that class of application as the users had muscle memory.<p>Roll on 20 years last check and the mainframe was still in there and the payroll system had been rewritten three times over since with virtually no functional change. The mainframe still does internal stock control and reporting.<p>I think the last rewrite was nodejs which the lack of strong decimal types on financial applications gives me the shivers.')
