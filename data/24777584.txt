In my case the changed test code is testing the ShoppingCart interface and in yours it&#x27;s a unit test of something lower down. There&#x27;s not extra cost, it&#x27;s just in a different place.<p>Or are you suggesting that your tests don&#x27;t know about 10 vs 11 at all? There&#x27;s a reasonable architecture where such data comes from outside your system, and the spec for your system is &#x27;price breaks should reflect this data input&#x27; and then you mock that data input and test it, but that&#x27;s a different thing.')
