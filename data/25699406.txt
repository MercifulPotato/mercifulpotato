Literally, there is nothing more authoritarian going on right now then that.<p>Donald Trump and other republican politicians spread lies about election in an attempt to overturn election in any way possible. They tried and failed dozens of lawsuits to overturn that election. Trump trying  to bully Georgia Officers to find votes for him.<p>And somehow, those lies being spread among their fans and their party proves that ... democrats should not have won the election.<p>Election means that your party can loose. And your party then can try to convince people that they are better party. But you loosing election and then not being able to accept that your party should be ruling everything or that it was rejected by large groups of people does not mean you should get some concessions.<p>Just because you are throwing anti-democratic tempper tamptrum does not mean you have entitlement.<p>&gt; But calling a populist movement with millions of supporters, terrorists is very short sighted. It will only accelerate the fire.<p>Whether they are terrorist depends on what tactic they use. Not on how many supporters they have.')
