To some degree, the politicians will do what resonates. The difference is that for most of our history you pretty much had to be a gentleman to even consider the senate or presidency.  (I mean that classically, not in the misogynistic sense.)  It was probably Bill Clinton and then Trump that have demonstrated that the masses will gladly elect a non-gentleman and Trump has really leaned in to the lowest common denominator politics.  That combined with self-selecting media.  It&#x27;s potent.  You basically can distill the different tribal voices down to a vote for socialism or a vote for racism and it&#x27;s sad to say but it worked pretty damn well and we had one of the biggest turnouts ever.')
