Is there mountains of commented out code, dead code, and misdirection? Has the code been adequately tested? Do you use appropriate code analysis tools (lint ect.), to enforce the above. Still having nitpicks in the code, questionable design, lines that could be eliminated, ect. is different from sloppiness and having no clue how to address these issues.')
