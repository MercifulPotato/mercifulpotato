Getting WAS to run locally could take a day or two of configuring. And since everything was manually done and had to be tweaked when loading in new stuff. And if you broke something (or it broke by itself) it was easier to just wipe it and reinstall everything from scratch, again wasting a few days of work.<p>And if you tried running your own EAR files, it could take an hour from a code change to actually test it. Building it, installing it, reloading the server, and then getting to the correct state of testing. If you discovered a bug, you had to patch the code, build the file again and start over, wasting another hour. Some of it was evaded by using JRebel, but if the changes couldn&#x27;t be swapped you were SOL.<p>No way WAS+EAR can be compared to running stand-alone images. It was a clusterfuck of dependencies and dependent configuration.')
