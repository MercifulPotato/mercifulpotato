I don’t understand why we have such a hard time figuring this out. Too much time sleeping through intro to logic, I suppose.<p>You start with an easy one to prove you’re not completely insane for considering this idea. You move to the hard ones to make sure you’re not going up a blind alley.  By the time you’re done, they’ll all be easier (and if they aren’t, then pain is information. Use it.)<p>If you haven’t done the hardest one by the midpoint, odds are good someone is relying on wishful thinking. But doing the hardest one first is masochism.<p>Software is written by humans.
