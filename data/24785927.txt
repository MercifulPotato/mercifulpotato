CUPS doesn&#x27;t recognize this printer automatically, you have to add it manually. So you have to go through a dialog that is basically user hostile and I can&#x27;t imagine how many people with less technical knowledge give up here.<p>Regardless of using PCL6 or the Lexmark driver from Lexmark, the printer continues to be unable to print PDFs directly from the browser. Other PDF viewers print normally. CUPS logs no error but prints it on a piece of paper instead.<p>When attempting to view the print queue of my printer, it crashes if a document is being sent but has not started pritning yet. It is fine if the document is queued but not printing.<p>Sometimes, CUPS doesn&#x27;t print the document immediately but waits 30 minutes. Other documents sent to the queue in the mean time print immediately. Sometimes the program that attempts to print causes a hard lockup in CUPS, so I have to restart the CUPS service.<p>&quot;Connect printer&quot; isn&#x27;t the easiest in CUPS if it decides that autodiscovery doesn&#x27;t do it, which it often does.')
