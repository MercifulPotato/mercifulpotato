On a national as well as on the global scale. However I&#x27;m not that sure if the inequality among generations is a big as the article pictures it. Most billioniares don&#x27;t fall in the millenial generation. That disorts the picture. I assume that if those extrem rich wouldn&#x27;t be taken into account the wealth gap between those generations wouldn&#x27;t be that big.')
