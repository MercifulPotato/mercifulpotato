Item(by='deathanatos', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607930627, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25413357, text='&gt; <i>Regularly watching cyclists flaunt the rules that the car driver would be cited for breaking</i><p>Yes and no. I am sorry when cyclists flaunt the rules — it does happen — but there are also those of us that strictly obey the law. (It helps keep me <i>alive</i>.) But I see cars break many of the same rules, quite often. For example, seeing a car run a red isn&#x27;t even a rare thing. (A rare one is seeing a car driving the wrong way.) Between the two groups, I don&#x27;t think I see one break the rules more often than the other. (I certainly see more violations from motorists… but I also see more motorists.)<p>&gt; <i>never seeing a single cyclist cited for the law breaking,</i><p>I&#x27;ve seen this, multiple times. Oddly, only while biking. Probably about as (in)frequently as I see motorists get cited.<p>&gt; <i>So as long as the law says cyclists must obey the same rules car drivers are also supposed to obey, the subset of cyclists that break those rules on a regular basis do not help, in the least, the arguments to try to convince car drivers to be more respectful of cyclists.</i><p>That there are those out there that don&#x27;t obey the law should not matter to validly argue that the world would be better — that is, fewer cyclists would die — if both motorists and cyclists alike would obey the law.')
