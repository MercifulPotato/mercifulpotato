The mixing and processing of sound is prior to being sent to foldback monitors is a completely standard process in just about all live and studio sound engineering. Latency is a very important consideration for sound engineers, and it&#x27;s why in situations like stadium performances, the only sounds that matters to a musician on stage, is the sound coming out of the foldback monitors directly in front of them. I&#x27;m getting a rather strong impression that you don&#x27;t know much about what actually goes into sound engineering.')
