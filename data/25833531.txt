Threads are details, while most people watch for OS processes first. That they are green doesn&#x27;t help anyone if there&#x27;s nobody to ask why or colours don&#x27;t show properly. This is misguided newbie fixation that alienates those users who just need a reliable tool with sane defaults. Just another user feedback.<p>This is a lesson to all of us, that we might have very good reasons, but there&#x27;s still a chance to be wrong about things.')
