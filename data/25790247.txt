If you&#x27;re arrested, or even questioned, you&#x27;re seen as guilty. Besides if you&#x27;ve nothing to hide you&#x27;ve nothing to fear.<p>This view doesn&#x27;t hold when the police get you for speeding (go find real criminals)<p>Many police officers are quite reasonable, but then you have Derbyshire, whose actions over covid have likely killed people (by reducing compliance with lockdown orders)<p>The difference with the police in covid is the public are suddenly seeing that the police are dealing with normal people, not just criminal scum who should be lucky they aren&#x27;t shot.<p>As I understood it, the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 really clamped down on DNA and fingerprint storage. Not enough, but at least it was a move in the right direction. Particularly bad was that if you were charged and found innocent, they would still keep your records for 3 years.')
