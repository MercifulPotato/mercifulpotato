If you ask anyone on the street if they would like any of these things out of technology they would unanimously say yes. But I agree it is not worth the trade-offs to actually fight for these things for most people. It doesn&#x27;t mean these things are not desired, it is just that other things are desired more.<p>Also, why do you put the word people in quotations? Just because most aren&#x27;t interested in pursuing technological freedoms doesn&#x27;t make them less of a people.')
