Is such a shame that the support is so spotty, and even Apple(who I think started it, probably as a CUDA alternative for their AMD cards), are deprecating it.<p>Even with it not being able to squeeze all the perf from a device, it&#x27;s still handy, especially being a cross device api.<p>It would&#x27;ve been ideal for piet, especially since compute kernels can also be run on CPU on all cores, given a CPU driver. And I think some OpenCL implementations support spirv. So it wouldn&#x27;t have needed any fallbacks, the same kernels would run either on CPU or GPUs.<p>I&#x27;m still going to use it for my project. But, it&#x27;s a shame that AMD RoCm OpenCL doesn&#x27;t support running kernels on their CPUs.<p>Also, Rust might benefit from something like SYCL. There is some attractive convenience in having a DSL built into the language for parallel computing. But one can dream.')
