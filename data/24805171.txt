The trouble with curing it is that it seems to be a problem with your brain not receiving the signal it expects form from the auditory nerve.<p>This famous reddit trick[0.] for at least temporarily curing tinnitus seems to lend credence to this idea. It essentially involves making noise near the skull, which presumably does temporarily stimulate the auditory nerve even if the ear drum itself is not able to correct create a signal.<p>My tinnitus has nothing to do with my ear drum, and interestingly enough this trick does not work for me.<p>I suspect curing tinnitus would require understanding a lot more about how nerves work and how to simulate sending an auditory signal without actually sending one.<p>0. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;np.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;WTF&#x2F;comments&#x2F;3l3uri&#x2F;these_guys_lighting_a_mortar_shell_in_their_garage&#x2F;cv3474n&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;np.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;WTF&#x2F;comments&#x2F;3l3uri&#x2F;these_guys_light...</a>')
