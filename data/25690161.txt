We are talking about a disease that has an IFR of .59%, with a vast majority of those deaths happening in those over 80 years old.<p>If you truly believe that that trade-off is worth it, then I completely understand now how authoritarian governments convince otherwise logical people to submit. Create an enemy, make everyone afraid of it, and then claim you are the only one who can protect them.<p>I am sure you are a smart, logical person. But your approval of what would be martial law for a .5% IFR is astounding.')
