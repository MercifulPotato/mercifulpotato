Like, they are a corporation actively participating in the material worsening of our national security. I don&#x27;t even want to <i>think</i> about a threat model that includes undermined router hardware! If they can&#x27;t be patched remotely those things need to be recalled, destroyed, and Wal-Mart fined significantly.<p>(When I say slammed I mostly mean &quot;pay big fines&quot;, maybe jail time if the flaw was known, and it should result in real reputational damage to Wal-Mart and its willingness to sell anything with a network connected computer in it. At the very least, if the buy cost is even less than the china price, that difference is coming from somewhere. Wal Mart should have spotted that.)')
