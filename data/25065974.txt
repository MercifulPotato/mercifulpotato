Item(by='friendlybus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605150549, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25065823, text='Youtube is a metaphysical sun bursting out with multiple different interpretations of any given topic, 90% of them subtlety wrong. Very few have anything original to say. They pad their ten minute timer with history, use youtube&#x27;s suggested topics and only 1-2 minutes of the episode covers what you want, and usually from such a limited perspective that the little details will still trip you up. For every Ben Eater, there&#x27;s thousands of poorly aimed videos that clog up your brainspace.<p>There&#x27;s also people deliberately misrepresenting knowledge for clicks &amp; selling products. Micheal Crichton was right not to be concerned about the fall of journalism. He said (to effect) anybody can write whatever they want. The value is in the edited content. Which he meant by mainstream, validated press agencies that used to control most intepretation. The concept still applies, most of youtube will not be missed.')
