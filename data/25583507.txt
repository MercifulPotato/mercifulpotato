It may be luxurious because of the price tag and lack of polish for the money (i.e. you could easily get a more polished product for the same money). I.e. a Mercedes will get you more luxury and polish for the same dollar.<p>Tesla is, if anything, similar to Apple in how closed-off they are. Teslas are attractive  because of their design and powerful electric powertrain, but polished they are not.')
