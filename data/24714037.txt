I always wondered what held that back from being more popular &#x2F; more used by more people..<p>Which brings me to the time of having all sorts of friends and family pinging on yahoo messenger for a while  - then that was killed off.<p>Perhaps if worldsChat had this spatial talking kind of option it would of gotten more traction.
