The tech giants are attempting to throw an election and they don&#x27;t care who knows at this point. For the 2012 election Facebook execs bragged about illegally assisting the Obama campaign by giving them practically the entire FB social graph, for free. That violates federal campaign finance laws. Nothing was done about it and you&#x27;ll never get anyone on HN to go near talking about that fraud, which was entirely out in the open.<p>The media ran every possible baseless story they could about Trump the past four years, often with zero supporting evidence to the story in question. Every time they turned out to be fake stories, the media conveniently ignored it, refused to run retractions and moved on to the next fraudulent story. Twitter allowed max distribution in every single instance. Now a story blows up about Biden, and they go in to hyper overdrive to stop it, colluding with Facebook. You&#x27;ve got people inside of these companies directly working for the DNC and using company resources to violate federal campaign finance laws.<p>There is a growing list of people in big tech that need to go to prison for election interference.')
