Only claims, nothing more. Americans have been fed false propaganda against communist USSR for decades, and I have a gut feeling the same is happening against communist China. Maybe it has to do with China&#x27;s plan to collapse the US petrodollar global monetary system [0] and the US is trying to rouse a new Red Scare and push us into a second Cold War.<p>EDIT: Okay I&#x27;ve found 1 source of evidence from the comments in this thread [1]. I wish clickbait headlines would point to these claims instead of claims from other journalist making claims based on other journalists claims.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lynalden.com&#x2F;fraying-petrodollar-system&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lynalden.com&#x2F;fraying-petrodollar-system&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25570485" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25570485</a>')
