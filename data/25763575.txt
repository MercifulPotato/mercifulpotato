But the point is now we&#x27;re arguing a <i>very</i> subjective standard, and the determiners of those standards aren&#x27;t a judge or jury, but a few CEOs. The standard of &quot;when is it justified to refuse to host an entire platform based upon the nature of how they moderate their worst content&quot; is an incredibly complex question, with no objective answer, and how these company&#x27;s answer it has a profound effect on freedom of speech, since deplatforming a site like Parler doesn&#x27;t just censor the speech of those who ought to be censored (by any standard), but everyone else on the platform.<p>It&#x27;s fairly obvious where this will lead, but I doubt we will correct it before it causes immense harm (not necessarily directly, but due to the blowback that will come from censorship without due process and tit-for-tat escalation.)')
