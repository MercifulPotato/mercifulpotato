I pump all my Facebook&#x2F;Messenger&#x2F;Hangouts traffic in my browser through a VPN to the server where the bridges are hosted so Google&#x2F;Messenger won&#x27;t flag them for security.<p>This took a couple of tries of logging in outside of the proxy to FB, getting the security warning and then switching back to the proxy with the same cookies so FB&#x2F;Google algos learn the IP is safe. Hopefully when I move, if I keep all those same rules in place (using FoxyProxy for Firefox or Chrome-based browsers) and turning off location on my Android device permanently (will also move to a PinePhone soon), I can make it difficult for Google&#x2F;FB to know my location after I move from my current city.<p>Singal and Telegram are great because they have standard APIs that make it easy for a Matrix Bridge. For FB and Google I have to trick them, which makes them hostile to developers and tech people. We&#x27;ve had to do this for years with libpurple plugins as well:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;battlepenguin.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;there-is-an-ios-device-attached-to-my-google-account-and-i-do-not-own-any-apple-products&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;battlepenguin.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;there-is-an-ios-device-attach...</a>')
