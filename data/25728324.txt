Applications abuse the systray to force themselves on the user and that is a bad thing, that should not be supported or apologized for.<p>I&#x27;m not against apps running in background, just that monolithic implementation with systray is the wrong approach. Android has shown a good model: background service that cannot talk to UI, but can send notifications or communicate with separate UI app. With this model, user has control over what is running in background or what started on login time by system (not app-specific!)-provided tools, like systemd user units under Linux or LaunchAgents under macOS. When the user wants something off, it will be turned off in one place, with no ors or buts or other black patterns that prevent user turning the application off.')
