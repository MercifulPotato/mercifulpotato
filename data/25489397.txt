They are arguably more long-lasting, adaptable (upgradable), more powerful and cheaper than laptops. But of course, their prinicpal disadvantage is their lack of portability.<p>If portability isn&#x27;t a consideration, them I still recommend desktops when buying a computer. My home desktop is 8 years old (bought in 2012) and running fine and fast. Of course, it has been upgraded e.g. it has more memory and a second hard drive.<p>Desktops give you the space to upgrade without having to wastefully throw away perfectly working components.
