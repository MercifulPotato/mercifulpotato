The only use case I think they would excel at is as a thin client for VMWare&#x2F;Cisco virtualization solutions, or as a barebones terminal for Linux distros (at which point anything with a keyboard works for you).<p>Anyways, if laptops do security the same way laptops do touchpads, I would not be excited to depend on that. At all.')
