I have been working on it since April last year learning PHP, MYSQL, Nginx, Wordpress, Redis and so on. I am a salesperson by trade.<p>The main difference between hackerspad and other alternative sites it that it is devoid of ads and the idea is to charge businesses for listing. It makes just enough to pay hosting cost.')
