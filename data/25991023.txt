Many probably would rather quit Facebook but think they can&#x27;t because a part of their social life they think important is there. Or even a part of their education is (many students have a Facebook group for their class).<p>I sympathize with you but it would help to try and understand people who care about privacy but still use Facebook if the goal is to solve this problem.<p>I&#x27;ve had luck so far I haven&#x27;t got trapped in Facebook though.')
