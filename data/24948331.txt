It <i>also</i> offers nothing more &quot;in amends&quot; than they already offered. It <i>also</i> suggests no &quot;consequences&quot; for those who erred. Your added cheap-but-emotionally-performative intensifier words – &quot;we <i>deeply regret</i> the <i>pain and anguish</i>&quot; – are <i>also</i> viewed as &quot;meaningless hollow BS&quot; by many.<p>See how easy it is to nitpick tone?<p>The social function of apologies also requires gracious acceptance of actual admissions of error.')
