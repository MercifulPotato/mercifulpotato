If Party A wants, they would be able to send impeachment to trial without real reason and then by the fact that Senate didn&#x27;t convict you would get a reelection of Senate.<p>Way I see it, this would allow manipulation of the election process. In my mind, it would be much more logical that the House has to be reelected as they pushed forward an impeachment that was not convicted upon. This would make it so that House would not bring forward frivolous impeachments as they would have their own positions on the line.<p>About unseating a president, I understand your point. I agree to a degree. A sitting president can be limited in power by the fact he doesn&#x27;t control the legislative branch. This may seem less optimal but it has a couple of advantages. Executive branch can keep on working within the confines allowed to them, without having to juggle for political support in the parliament. This allows the President to keep working with little regard to losing his position. This is especially good for military or foreign affairs as they can work on this with little to no political support.')
