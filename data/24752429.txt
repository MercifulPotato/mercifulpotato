For example, my wife is currently watching &quot;Good Girls&quot; in which we see the following things that really make me never want to live in the US (I wonder if this really happens though, can someone confirm?):<p>- You can pay to stay out of jail so only poor people stay in jail after a crime, before the trial (guess OP proves this is real).<p>- The poor people have the worst lawyers and thus the worst chances, and even though they are innocent can be left in debt by the process.<p>- A couple has a daughter, she needs a kidney. They need to pay 80.000 euro (forcing a choice between crime and the life of the daughter, easy choice I&#x27;d think)<p>- A guy stole crutches because he needed to pay 400$ to take them home (can&#x27;t walk without them)<p>- Woman tells ambulance personnel to leave her alone so she can take an Uber to the hospital to reduce cost of healthcare after being shot<p>- A guy working at something like a loan shop (where people just seem to pile on debt) wants to use the address of a customer so his nephew can get into university (I guess it matters where you live?)<p>- The couple from point 1 needs to choose between electricity&#x2F;water and healthcare, decide to mix up checks they send to the companies to buy some time.<p>I mean the point is already nicely made by &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;, how do you want to reduce crime in a society when civilians are constantly forced into such impossible choices? It makes for good TV of course but the stress you must feel when you can just make ends meet in he US must be extreme. I mean there are so may series where the criminals are just perfectly reasonable and lovable, doesn&#x27;t that tell you something is wrong?')
