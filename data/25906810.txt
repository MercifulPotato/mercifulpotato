Both companies probably have &quot;working&quot; L5 technology, it just comes down to how much they&#x27;re willing to gamble on the reliability and how early they&#x27;re willing to put it out there. These things will obviously never be 100% reliable, so now the question is how many 9s each company is willing to wait for.<p>Waymo realizes that one accident is all it takes to completely destroy their operation, just like it killed Uber&#x27;s self driving division. Tesla on the other hand has shown that they are prepared to be far more reckless and release things early just for headlines. To me it&#x27;s meaningless who puts it out &quot;first&quot; because that&#x27;s not a metric of how good the technology actually is. I&#x27;m interested in miles driven and disengagement statistics, which Tesla hasn&#x27;t really been openly putting out like Waymo.<p>All I know is that right now, Waymo is the only company with an actual publicly available L4 driving car out in the streets, that is fully driverless with no one behind the steering wheel. And they have been for over a year. Meanwhile Tesla&#x27;s latest private beta still requires someone behind the wheel and paying attention, and therefore is only L3.')
