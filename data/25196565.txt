If your single comparison point is the existing banking and credit card payment networks, you can take a look at e.g, Raiden which is already deployed on mainnet and can scale with the number of the nodes participating in the network. Hundreds of thousands of payment transactions per second are already possible.<p>The main issue is that most of them still are very complex to get fully operational, there is no big consensus among users on &quot;what-to-use-when&quot; and they all require a non-insignificant cost to setup in terms of all the contract transactions needed to get in and out of the chain.<p>There is no reason to doubt that they be more mature along with ETH2 and that that L1-L2 will complement each other nicely.')
