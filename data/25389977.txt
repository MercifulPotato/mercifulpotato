Item(by='triceratops', descendants=None, kids=[25393578], score=None, time=1607715937, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25381931, text='&quot;Mueller is untrustworthy therefore his investigation&#x27;s conclusions are untrustworthy&quot; is what you&#x27;re saying.<p>But at the same time you linked me to an NPR article about the initial summary of Mueller report that said &quot;No collusion&quot;, which you believed. But then the actual report came out and it said &quot;Quite possibly collusion&quot; and therefore Mueller&#x27;s a liar? That&#x27;s some pretty impressive doublethink.<p>It&#x27;s clear no amount of evidence matters to you so I won&#x27;t try any more.<p>What makes you so sure you aren&#x27;t the one being psyops-ed by whichever media source you trust?<p>You hold diametrically opposing opinions simulataneously (&quot;No collusion!&quot; &amp;&amp; &quot;Mueller&#x27;s a liar!&quot;) to fit your image of a charismatic leader. You believe in some amorphous &quot;they&quot; who are silently manipulating everyone behind the scenes. These are all classic signs of being psypops-ed.')
