That said, this claim isn&#x27;t correct. If the non-exported cotton was a key ingredient in the industries that make up the other 95% of exports (and the non-export economy), the economy would be dependent on that industry. Now I don&#x27;t think that every aspect of the US economy was dependent on cotton, but textile exports, for example, wouldn&#x27;t be included as cotton exports, and textiles used at home, wouldn&#x27;t be either. So this metric does underestimate the economic impact of an industry.<p>&gt; Second, whether the workers on the plantations are paid labor or enslaved people doesn&#x27;t change the economic calculus for Eli Whitney. He sells cotton gins either way. Back then cotton could be, and was, produced by free labor. When the Civil War disrupted the American cotton industry, free labor in India and Australia and Egypt filled the market gap:<p>I agree. This doesn&#x27;t change the core point: his fortune was built off of slave labor. There exist alternate timelines where it might not have been, but we don&#x27;t live in those timelines. Trying to tease counterfactuals out of history isn&#x27;t really good academics. The flow of history is complex enough that smart people can come to contradictory conclusion. Thus, what happened: the US cotton economy was built on the backs of slave labor. Anything else (even conjecture that I agree with, that the US economy would have been stronger sooner with less slavery as it was essentially a local maxima and prevented other forms of innovation) is conjecture.')
