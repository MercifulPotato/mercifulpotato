The driver gave up on trying to follow the ap and he insisted that the mountain was the address.  Naturally he gave me a 1* because I wasn’t happy about being kicked out on a mountain top.  Uber never replied to my attempt at disputing any of it.<p>The only thing worse than the arbitrary thing is the double rating.  I’m forced to give 5* to shit service.<p>It’s annoying')
