The existence of that power is anti-consumer because no one else can afford to build anything better, because Google makes more money than your hypothetical new world&#x27;s best product ever by charging absolutely nothing for their competing product.<p>Step 1, in 1997, was to build the world&#x27;s best search engine.<p>Step 2, was that running the world&#x27;s best search engine allowed them to create an ad network that most accurately knew what the largest number of viewers were looking for, best ad platform and massive revenue. All others follow from that.<p>Steps 3 and on were to start an email service (what are people talking about), create an image search tool (shows what pictures people are looking for), acquire&#x2F;develop a mapping application (where are people and where are they going), acquire a video hosting platform (what are people watching), create a mobile OS (get more people on the Internet and especially on their parts of it), create a web browser (get more people on the internet and especially on their parts of it), etc. etc. etc. Those other properties only work because they&#x27;re financed by and create value for Google&#x27;s ad network.')
