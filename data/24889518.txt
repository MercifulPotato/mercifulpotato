I advocate for solutions based on public policy, even if they&#x27;re partial. But I object to individual solutions, because they&#x27;re no solution at all. It doesn&#x27;t matter how many people do little actions, if there are a few big actors (say multinational corporations) exploiting and polluting the environment, the result is worse than zero! It is just like taking as aspirin to &quot;help cure&quot; a cancer that is destroying the body. And in fact focusing on doing these little things is a net negative, because it distracts from the big actions that need to be taken to fix an urgent problem.')
