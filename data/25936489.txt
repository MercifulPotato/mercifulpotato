Item(by='robomartin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611794487, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25935511, text='I said this before [0] and will say it again:  The tech community will some day regret wielding this kind of power.<p>It&#x27;s about loss of trust, which is, perhaps, one of the most delicate things in the universe.<p>Now everyone in the world knows, in no uncertain terms, that your person, business, website, cause, discussion board, advertising capabilities, email, online documents and tools can evaporate and be taken away and shut down, with you and your business destroyed overnight.<p>That&#x27;s the world we live in today.<p>This, BTW, has nothing whatsoever to do with politics.  WSB was not about politics.<p>I thought this GME &quot;event&quot; might result in much-needed introspection and changes in the financial community.  If you didn&#x27;t catch Chamath Palihapitiya&#x27;s interview on CNBC&#x27;s &quot;Halftime Report&quot; today you should take the time to watch it.  I couldn&#x27;t find the full interview (easily 20 to 30 minutes long) or I would have posted a link (this is the closest I found [1]).  He clearly goes over some of what he thinks might have motivated the GME event.  I agree with quite a bit, if not all, of what he said.<p>Part of me hopes that folks now cutoff from WSB will revolt against this and continue on their mission.<p>Full disclosure:  I hold non-directional positions on GME.  In English, I make money whether it goes up or down...so I don&#x27;t care which way it goes.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25878457" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25878457</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;video&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;27&#x2F;billionaire-investor-chamath-palihapitiya-on-gamestop-surge-and-rise-of-retail-investors.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;video&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;27&#x2F;billionaire-investor-c...</a><p>BTW #2: This isn&#x27;t to say that such things as porn and other online conducts and content might not be in a range between objectionable to net-negative to criminal in different parts of the world.  The issue is with platforms placing themselves in the position of being arbitrers of what&#x27;s purity, values, truth and righteousness.  If that&#x27;s what they want to be they need to be financially and legally responsible for what they do not moderate.  We have laws to deal with the criminal elements among us.<p>BTW #3: (sorry for the edits).  This is also a case of famous Martin Niemöller poem [2]:<p>&quot;First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a socialist.<p>Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out— because I was not a trade unionist.<p>Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—because I was not a Jew.<p>Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.&quot;<p>Everyone was thrilled when they came for Trump and Parler.  Now they are coming for someone else.  The question is: Who&#x27;s next and where does it end?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;encyclopedia.ushmm.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;martin-niemoeller-first-they-came-for-the-socialists" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;encyclopedia.ushmm.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;martin-nie...</a>')
