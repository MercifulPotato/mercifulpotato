A fully fueled rocket is by mass almost all propellant. This is counterintuitive, other vehicles do not have that. Rockets also have very high thrust to weight ratios.<p>One of the effects is that flying an almost-empty rocket is really easy. When landing, the Falcon 9 first stage actually has too much thrust to even hover stably with one ninth of engines running and that at only partial thrust.<p>So an empty rocket flying doesn&#x27;t produce nearly as much noise or pressure waves. So, you could do it like this:<p>1. The light, almost unfueled rocket stands at airfield<p>2. People board the light rocket<p>3. The light rocket flies a short hop to an oil rig (20 km or so). Only one rocket engine needed for takeoff and landing.<p>4. The light almost empty rocket is fully fueled at the oil rig. It becomes a heavy fully fueled rocket. People stay inside.<p>5. Heavy fully fueled rocket takes off with all engines blasting with massive noise.<p>6. Most propellant is expended during acceleration. Heavy fully fueled rocket becomes light almost empty rocket.<p>7. The light almost empty rocket lands at destination airport with one engine.<p>8. People offboard<p>9. Goto 1.')
