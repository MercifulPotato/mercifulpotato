If you have really read the referenced article you must have noticed that its title is &quot;Is Switzerland better than Silicon Valley for software developers?&quot; (which has a rather different meaning than the title of this post, but maybe attracts less clicks) and it is about the Swiss tech scene and the demand and attractiveness for developers. I&#x27;ve answered to the unfounded reproach that Switzerland was &quot;Not much for developers who are looking for interesting challenges&quot;. You then claimed that pharma wasn&#x27;t high-tech, which is not true and overlooks the fact that a growing number of computer scientists work for life science. From my personal experience I can tell you that there are extremely interesting challenges, and a lot of ground breaking machine learning developments happen there today. It&#x27;s not enough to just quickly read the headline and then claim some stuff without any basis. Are you Swiss? Do you work in Switzerland? Do you have any relevant experience supporting your claims?')
