I could enter detailed information about each car such as year, make, model, vin, insurance policy, gas purchases, oil changes and the like.  It would tell you gas mileage and remind you of upcoming maintenance.<p>One day, the app was updated and all my local data was uploaded to the cloud.<p>Another app I had was camscanner from tencent that basically did the same thing.  Think of all the PDFs you scan going to their cloud.')
