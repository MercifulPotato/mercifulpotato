That&#x27;s why youtube-dl <i>exists</i>. If it was a service that YouTube already provided then there would not be as much reason for youtube-dl to exist.<p>&quot;Unenforceable&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean <i>practically</i> unenforceable, it means <i>legally</i> unenforceable. The laws of physics permit most cars to exceed most speed limits. Those laws are still enforceable.<p>Unenforceable clauses in contracts are things that are either contrary to law or otherwise don&#x27;t fall under contract law. So a clause that says &quot;if you sign this you must give up your firstborn son&quot; is unenforceable. That sentence just says that &quot;if we screwed up drafting this contract, just because you were able to challenge one clause due to being unenforceable doesn&#x27;t mean the whole contract is void.&quot; It&#x27;s a severability clause.')
