Item(by='jcheng', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603130422, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24825986, text='For some historical context, the late 90&#x27;s&#x2F;early 2000&#x27;s was a time when Java&#x2F;J2EE and the n-tier architecture were absolutely dominant in the startup world, and the ideas of functional programming were considered academic or outdated. Saying the word &quot;closure&quot; to most programmers back then would give you the same suspicious look you&#x27;d get for saying &quot;monad&quot; today. At least that was my experience as a junior programmer bouncing between web startups in those days.<p>In retrospect, the J2EE hype was wildly overblown, optimized for problems nobody needed solving, and introduced unnecessary complexity and boilerplate at every level of the stack. I can only imagine how frustrating it was to have a full understanding of how bad the status quo was, yet have your alternatives dismissed out of hand because &quot;not Java&quot;.<p>I remember thinking people like Paul Graham[0] and Phil Greenspun[1] were pretty brave for going against the J2EE dogma--to suggest that these &quot;little languages&quot; not only had interesting properties, but should actually be used in production. I found their arguments convincing, but didn&#x27;t have the guts to push for them at work.<p>[0]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;avg.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;avg.html</a>\n[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Philip-Alexs-Guide-Web-Publishing&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1558605347" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Philip-Alexs-Guide-Web-Publishing&#x2F;dp&#x2F;...</a>')
