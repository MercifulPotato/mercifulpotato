And you never want to endure present pain to avoid future conflict. You will fight anyways and only be weaker. Best to walk away from it all.<p>We should embrace it when people talk. Because people who talk are nothing. Right away you know they won&#x27;t do anything because it&#x27;s the people who are quiet, who you don&#x27;t even know exist let alone don&#x27;t see and hear are the ones that get you and are anything real. It doesn&#x27;t belong to you, and people do this because they are desperate and will eventualy destroy themselves on their own. Behavior institutions, really sick people on a slow motion suicide, that&#x27;s what you are dealing with and will ultimately run into.<p>On a side note:<p>Just my opinion, take it for what it&#x27;s worth, isn&#x27;t the absolute worst thing you can do for your health during the time of covid is to hit a crack pipe with an underage Ukranian prostitute? During the Charlamagne tha God interview, my former Vice President wasn&#x27;t just parroting something he heard and had no understanding. He had full knowledge of what crack cocaine does to people. I guess it was anxiety or trying to probe the conversation because this was out there. But doesn&#x27;t that make it even worse? Seeing how he has military intelligence capability and also sent a lot of people to prison decades ago while rewarding his own with hundreds of millions for the same thing.<p>How can you control a covid pandemic when you cannot even control a family addiction, one of the easier ones too. Just bad habits and lifestyle more than anything. I know. Not below the belt either. At the top it&#x27;s cut throat and he did it to other people.')
