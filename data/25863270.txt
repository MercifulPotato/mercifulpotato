Art isn&#x27;t equivalent with &quot;ancient&quot;.<p>For photographs of out-of-copyright works, the question if the photo is itself a creative work protected by copyright is answered differently depending on jurisdiction. In the US and, by extension, for Wikimedia Commons, it generally isn&#x27;t. In some European countries, it is.<p>I would generally subscribe to the idea that such photos are not protected. But it isn&#x27;t quite as obvious as one might think. Taking high-quality photos of these artworks does involve a lot of work and, on occasion, maybe even creativity. What if I edit the photo afterwards to bring out the details? What if I chose special lighting conditions that interact with the pigments of the specific materials used?')
