Do you operate your own power utility? I’m guessing “no”. I think it is reasonable to not do everything by oneself.  I also think it is reasonable to expect that justice be applied equally between comparable incidents, without being the person meting it out. That said I do appreciate the spirit of self reliance to get things done.<p>But that’s not what my comment is about. It’s about the unequal treatment and unequal outrage from a variety of actors in our society, when it comes to the political left versus the political right. It’s about valuing things like responsible disclosure. It’s about leaning from history and not repeating the same mistakes when it comes to witch hunts, or censorship, or whatever else.')
