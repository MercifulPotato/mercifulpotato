Item(by='markkat', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609962514, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25660836, text='&gt;When an individual is accused of a criminal offense, it may be reasonable to dissolve their privacy to some degree in the search for truth about that offense.\n&gt;However, KYC dissolves the privacy not of certain specific individuals accused of wrongdoing, but the privacy of all individuals, none of whom have been accused of anything.\n&gt;We can do better than that as a society. Warrantless surveillance of all people cannot be our standard.<p>So glad to see this view rising up. When so many private and public parties are required to collect my private data, how can it remain private? I&#x27;ve had unemployment claims made in my name this year due to a breach, and it was on me to fight the fraud that would harm me. The collection of private data does not protect us, it results in a honeypot and puts us at risk.')
