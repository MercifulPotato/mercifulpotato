Item(by='hogFeast', descendants=None, kids=[25826545], score=None, time=1611002519, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25826053, text='&quot;once you learn it&quot;...yes, everything is incredibly practical once you remove all the disadvantages. The point is: some people prefer complexity for complexity&#x27;s sake, and this doesn&#x27;t work well in a team environment (where the &quot;once you learn it&quot; part becomes quite relevant, one person who prefers complexity for complexity&#x27;s sake will take down the whole group, not understanding when something should be simple is an indication of ignorance...finance professors rarely have any understanding of actual finance, their ignorance on this is total).<p>These models aren&#x27;t useful. Also, the saying is wrong. The reason why is that close to 100% of finance professors will quote that saying (srs, I think I have heard this 20-30 times now) because they use models that are wrong and not useful but this model seems to give them an intellectual reason for doing so: any &quot;wrong&quot; model could actually be good, according to this idea. But wrongness is neither nor there because wrongness for a model is utility, they are identical. The only point is utility. And the reason why these models aren&#x27;t useful, as I have said already, is that they aren&#x27;t used outside of academia. Their only utility is giving finance professors something fun to teach. And again, the solution is to build models from the way the world actually is (and btw, these are numerous...almost every successful investor, fundamental or quant, has a systematic process...but these models aren&#x27;t fun to teach).')
