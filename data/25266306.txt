Can you go to a country? What do you need to travel there? Are masks, quarantine and tests required? What is the situation like there - can you go to bars and beaches, can you do business there?<p>On top of this, the regulations are changing all the time. How can you be sure that the trip you booked in two or three months time will still be allowed? These questions aren&#x27;t going away, each country has their own rules and risk levels. The uncertainty and overhead is real, and this is what the Travel Advice API looks to help with.<p>Using a simple API, you can get all the required information about a trip at your fingertips. Imagine booking a trip on AirBnB or Booking.com and having real time information about that destination shown to you. And then being able to opt in to notifications about any changes in your trip, allowing you to not worry and only need to amend arrangements when you are notified.<p>We&#x27;ve built the API to allow this for any website. The two products are direct API integration, and our User Itinerary Service. Direct API integration let&#x27;s you use this information in your website or service how you want it to be used, giving the most value to your customers. The User Itinerary Service allows any customer to be pro-actively notified before and during their trip (one or multiple destinations) about any changes they need to be aware of.<p>We&#x27;ve just come out of our beta and are looking for feedback! We have loads of exciting features on the roadmap and the product will go from strength to strength through the coming months.')
