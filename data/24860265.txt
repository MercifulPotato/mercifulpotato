If you want to say that the term &quot;kubernetes&quot; reforms to the API interface such that it can be implemented by any of a number of implementations, that&#x27;s fine but we should have a separate term for the default implementation.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t require a distribution to take upstream k8s binaries as is and just orchestrate them with a configuration management system, I think a lot of value comes from slightly moving things around and changing them to fit your vision. Better that than a murder of shell scripts.<p>Distributions are nice because you often don&#x27;t want to have to build out your own logging, monitoring, cert-management, secret-encryption, ingress controller, load balancer controller, volume controllers, object storage, etc, etc, etc every time you stand up a cluster. Basically for the same reasons we have Linux distributions (most people don&#x27;t want to have to roll their own Linux from scratch every time), Kubernetes distributions would be nice. None of this requires &quot;a murder of shell scripts&quot; (but I like that collective noun) nor does it prevent you from swapping the distro-standard components for your own.')
