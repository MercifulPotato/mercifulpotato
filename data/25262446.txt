Tilke gets a bad rap for this, but tbh he&#x27;s mostly not to blame (he has made some incredible circuits, as you mentioned). Sochi, Yas and Hanoi are all terrible though (thankfully we never will get a race in Hanoi).<p>I&#x27;m against the idea because there are so many good tracks to host races at, and I don&#x27;t trust them to build new ones that are any good. They&#x27;ve proven that they&#x27;re more than happy to put on boring races for anybody who has enough money. The fact that Abu Dhabi is the last race on the calendar, and that they&#x27;re planning to put Saudi Arabia right behind it guarantees that having an exciting title-deciding season end is just logistically impossible now. I mean, is there a single person in the world who thinks that KSA is going to have a decent circuit?')
