There are thousands of issues and bugs in our systems that require mindless human activity to work around. Eg- Where our voice rec models fail we have hundreds of people sitting the whole day listening to boring snippets of context less conversation and correcting it. Most hate that work. Where robots malfunction on the line some guy has to just wheel in a new machine and push 2 button. That&#x27;s all he does. That&#x27;s what I mean by ppl being used to fill in the gaps. They do it for a few years and end up having no great qualification after the bugs get fixed so they getoved to the next crappy filler job. There is no great dignity to it or satisfaction. And they end up laughing at Obama&#x27;s speeches abt reskilling cause they know the reality and end up voting for Trump.')
