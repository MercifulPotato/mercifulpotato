But a lot of that is likely a &#x27;moment in time&quot; thing when I got into development.<p>There were a few years where Authnet was the &quot;default&quot; gateway.  Other gateways offered compatibility modes for their SIM and AIM APIs, and if you had some random off-the-shelf cart, it probably spoke AIM out of the box.<p>Part of the difference in experience is also likely due to their model.  The Authnet model was very much &quot;take direct card data and relay it to your server and then to us&quot;, and the Stripe model is very much &quot;JavaScript up your checkout process to do tokenization, so you never see the card number.&quot;  If you&#x27;re at a point in time when JavaScript is a bit sketchy (the IE6-is-the-dominant-browser era), you might be more willing to go for a worse PCI compliance scope in exchange for the comparative bulletproofness of doing things server-side.<p>Now I work for a firm competing with both of them, so I can hardly express a preference today.  :)')
