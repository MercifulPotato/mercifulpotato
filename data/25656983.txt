Also part of the problem is that main Nouveau developers are from Red Hat and they are limited in terms of RE of actual Nvidia code. Unfortunately some of Nouveau contributors dropped their efforts once Nvidia began to be actively hostile to the project.<p>If you look at GPUs like GTX 650 they actually almost have feature-parity and 90% of performance. I personally used GT710 on my PC and while it super-low-end card it&#x27;s really decent under Nouveau and can drive 3 of 2K displays with 75Hz and lag-free.<p>As for Apple hardware it&#x27;s different at least because Marcan isn&#x27;t as limited in terms of keeping source code purity. After all Apple dont have any Linux drivers so there is no way to RE any code that can be directly applied to Linux graphics stack.')
