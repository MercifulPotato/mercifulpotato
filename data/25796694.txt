Its harder to live that life with people you&#x27;re around all the time. My Dad for instance was well liked at his job and in the community. As soon as he left work and those people behind the smiles and jokes stopped and he was just mean and quiet with a temper that was never far from reach. I think the person he was at work was the person he wanted to be, but the person he was with us was his true self.<p>Its either that or he truly hated my mother, my brother, and myself.')
