Of course, Haskell&#x27;s ecosystem is not so large that it&#x27;s trivial to find a well-maintained, high-quality version of a library that meets one&#x27;s other criteria. Programmers of a particular language are at the mercy of that language&#x27;s ecosystem.<p>This line of reasoning reminds me of how C++ programmers would deflect criticisms of problematic features by arguing that one could use only the features that one wanted (thereby effectually creating or curating their own sub-language) and only choosing dependencies that were equally written in that sub-language. So easy!')
