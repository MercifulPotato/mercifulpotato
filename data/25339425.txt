Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s daughter went on TV and called SF tech workers &quot;vermin&quot; and &quot;invaders&quot; and described the presence of tech works as an &quot;infestation&quot;. Open hostility and dehumanization is condoned. In no way did I feel oppressed, but it did come off as tone deaf the way people on one breath say stuff like that and in the next complain about how tech workers weren&#x27;t invested in the community.')
