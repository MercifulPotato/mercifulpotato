The presenter posted his material online (smart move) and no reasonable person would believe it was something worth investigating, let alone that it had ill intent.<p>It’s also strange that they’ve apparently backdated this blog post clearing the presenter. The text clearing him of wrongdoing was posted today, November 8th (Source:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jeremyphoward&#x2F;status&#x2F;1325606466556895232?s=21" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jeremyphoward&#x2F;status&#x2F;1325606466556895232...</a> ), but the time stamp in the post shows November 3rd for me. Perhaps they’re trying, again, to rewrite history to make their response to this situation look less bad.')
