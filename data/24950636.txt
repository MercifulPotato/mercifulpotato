It&#x27;s just the normality, from a statistical point of view.<p>No. Cultural normality may at times be very similar with, but is not the same dimension as statistical normality.<p>It&#x27;s easy to see in soon-to-envelope-the-world trends.<p>A small sub-sect of people do something abnormal, the image generated is pushed throughout society and media as an actionable concept (sociocultural normal), and then the trend becomes achievable en masse. If the trend is a huge hit, everyone does it (statistically normal).<p>&gt;People have the right to expect statistical normality in other people.<p>Let me play devils&#x27; advocate here for a moment.<p>Apply that argument to any sociocultural phenomenon or identity, and see if the argument seems humane and considerate.<p>That statement precludes a <i>lot</i> of people, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anywhere near a right.')
