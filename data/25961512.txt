The EU is complaining about AstraZeneca and not the UK itself. AstraZeneca is being accused of transferring supplies from EU factories to UK ones and only providing those to the UK.<p>&gt; now threatening war time-esque controls over production and intellectual property rights of private pharma companies, it is not AstraZeneca that this will cost big,<p>I think we think differently on this matter. You think Pharma won&#x27;t want to deal with the EU if their IP isn&#x27;t protected. It doesn&#x27;t matter, another company will enter using their IP and make that money anyways. Their IP being protected is only in the interested of the company, if their IP is not protected they will lose out to generic companies. Doesn&#x27;t matter where it&#x27;s developed, someone get it and figure it out and produce it where the IPs are not protected. Drug companies have lots to lose.')
