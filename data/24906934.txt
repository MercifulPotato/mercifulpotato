Item(by='defanor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603803489, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24906242, text='&gt; I expect &quot;Org mode is for keeping notes [...]&quot; to take up about three lines. What&#x27;s going wrong for you?<p>It takes 4 lines here, but the issue is with horizontal overflow: &quot;planning&quot; is in the end of the first line for me, and it&#x27;s cut on the last &quot;n&quot; (with no horizontal scroll). Below that, &quot;developed by many others.&quot; is cut on &quot;h&quot; in &quot;others&quot;. That&#x27;s in FF 68, where it&#x27;s also aligned to the right side, while in FF 78 it is centered. All the other elements are centered in FF 68 too.<p>It moves to the left and becomes readable (i.e., all words are fully visible) when I remove font settings (org.css:32) and the --body-left ones, or if &quot;display: flex&quot; is disabled altogether, but not sure what&#x27;s the exact issue. There&#x27;s &quot;overflow-x: hidden&quot; in the CSS, which probably contributes to it.<p>Edit: apparently it&#x27;s similar to the issue reported by john-aj here.')
