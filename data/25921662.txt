Does it play the biggest role? Let&#x27;s assume it does. Is learning only memory? I don&#x27;t think so.</i><p>The end result of learning (having learnt) is, I&#x27;d say, only memory.<p>If the memory is of static information or dynamic state (the difference between a file with data and a program&#x27;s runtime loaded with state) it&#x27;s still however just memory.<p>What else would it be?<p>Sure, the process of learning, on the other hand, can take different forms. Those would be analogous to loading a memory store via different mechanisms.<p>&gt;<i>Let&#x27;s say the information is about driving. I can have a driving manual memorized. Can I remember that information about driving? Yes. Have I &quot;learned&quot; driving? No.</i><p>Let&#x27;s say we can distinguish between two types of learnable things.<p>When it comes to information from the digits of pie or the lyrics of a song, or the periodic table and many other things, having such things memorized is enough for us to say we &quot;learned them&quot;.<p>Your example with driving, however, is not about mere learning some information, but about learning an activity. In your example we can surely say you&#x27;ve learned the contents of the driving manual. That&#x27;s not the same as learning to drive, but nobody said it is. It is still learning the information within the manual, though.<p>Now, for learning to drive one would need to learn some&#x2F;all of the same information (perhaps in another form, simpler, more colloqual, etc), and also the motions involved, how to respond to various road situations, etc. This however is a &quot;loading the memory part&quot;.<p>Isn&#x27;t the end result the same though? Information (somehow, not really relevant how) stored in the brain of the person that learned to drive (including things like &quot;muscle memory&quot;)? The process is not the same as memorizing static information (e.g. a piece of text), but the end result is still a brain that has a new state, similar to an RAM or SSD that has a new state.<p>See also my point above regarding static vs dynamic memory.')
