I choose productivity.<p>There&#x27;s a bit of a false dichotomy. When I was a C++ developer, I always edited in Emacs and used other tools (e.g. Visual Studio) for the convenience features. No one insists you have to use one or the other.<p>Having said that, people who use Emacs primarily for coding are likely not going to stick to it. Emacs is a text editor. Programming is merely one use case amongst many.')
