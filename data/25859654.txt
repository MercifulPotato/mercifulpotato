As with any open source, you don&#x27;t have to use the parts you don&#x27;t want. GNOME as a whole is a pretty big project, and like most projects, some of its parts are stable and up-to-date, and some aren&#x27;t. Lots of other desktops build on pieces of GNOME technologies because they work, and replace the parts they&#x27;re unhappy with. So I&#x27;m sorry if you feel a particular component made a mistake, but it really does not have to be a mistake that affects you, if you handle things the right way.<p>Can you be more specific about what kind of citation you&#x27;re looking for?')
