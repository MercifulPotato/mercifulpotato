We phased out the last of the coal plants 15 years ago. More places should, the air quality in the whole province improved markedly after.<p>- I drive a car with a small 14kWh battery, and a backup ICE for when I need it. 90% of my miles are electric. I don&#x27;t understand why this model isn&#x27;t more popular. I see no need to drag around a 60kWh battery &quot;just in case&quot; I need that extra range.<p>- Lithium isn&#x27;t the huge environment&#x2F;social problem really. Basically big evaporation ponds in desert areas. There&#x27;s even some work being done to pull lithium out of abandoned oil wells in some locations. Some of the other components are a problem, such as Cobalt in some formulations. But all these formulations can be played with. And they are one-time for the whole vehicle, rather than requiring continual extraction. And can be recycled. Can&#x27;t recycle petroleum or hydrogen.<p>Meanwhile the only practical sources for producing hydrogen require fossil fuels, typically natural gas, and end up emitting CO2. Emitting CO2 is not necessary for EV usage. But most practical sources of hydrogen do. And the efficiency is far lower.')
