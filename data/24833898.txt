It&#x27;s faster, more consistent, and frees you up to tackle other fires.<p>Some examples:<p>* publishing<p>* converting between file formats<p>* simple compositing pipelines<p>* sending&#x2F;archiving files<p>* validation<p>* organization<p>* tracking (approval&#x2F;completion)<p>* script repetitive tasks in programs to shelves or hotkeys<p>My first &quot;useful&quot; script was pre-composing an email that sends following a successful FTP send.\nMy second was a helper to relink project mediafiles (which might be on another&#x27;s desktop) as relative paths so I could open them on my computer. \nAs you scale up, your tools will likely grow more formalized - writing code to glue programs filetypes and departments together, tracking, approval, publishing&#x2F;rendering pipelines.')
