It&#x27;s the near impossibility to compete against the big players because of copyright and patent laws.<p>Without abolishing these unfair laws, you cannot disrupt them. You cannot displace them.<p>When I was at Microsoft I saw the advantages first hand. If I had the blessing of the C-Suite, I could go and squash any business I wanted to as long as they weren&#x27;t Apple, Google, Amazon, or Facebook.<p>Look at Slack, GitHub, LinkedIn, etc. Huge successes, and yet at the end of the day realized they couldn&#x27;t be viable without joining one of the big dogs.<p>The problem is those big dogs are black holes sucking up an enormous amount of information, that you cannot take with you if you leave because of #imaginaryproperty laws, and hence you are always at a huge information disadvantage if you try and compete against them and will get squashed.<p>Come up with a great new Saas app? At some point if you&#x27;re successful you will have to sell to one of them, or some exec will decide they&#x27;d like to take over your market and leverage their information advantage against youâ€”good luck hanging on to your top talent when the big players offer them 3x the salary and job security; good luck building your sales pipelines when the big dogs have access to your customer list and purchasing decision makers with a snap of their fingers; good luck hanging on to your suppliers when the big dogs offer better terms; good luck acquiring customers when the big dogs have 1&#x2F;10th the CAC.<p>I loved and was in awe of the talent of the people at Microsoft. But they don&#x27;t need the #ImaginaryProperty protections. It makes them do shittier work and makes us all worse off (and the only affect is a redistribution of wealth to the top 1%).')
