Yes SPARC was open before and not much happened from it, but just because something didn&#x27;t work the first time, doesn&#x27;t mean it not a good idea. The world is different now compared to then.<p>If we ever want to live in a world where we have open implementation that have a huge software ecosystem that is ready, we need an open well support ecosystem.<p>So, if you don&#x27;t care about open source, then you don&#x27;t care about RISC-V. If you do however, you probably should care.')
