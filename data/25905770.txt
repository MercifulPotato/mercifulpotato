Advertisers send Google data, and get back a fingerprint of a user.<p>This is only &quot;privacy friendly&quot; because Google limits the accuracy of the fingerprint provided to advertisers by bucketing users into cohort groups. These groups are supposed to be large enough to prevent advertisers to identify individual users.<p>Google would still retain the ability to uniquely identify individual users.')
