Especially the new ones have some room!<p>The starter kit&#x27;s price will go from 60 to 120 to 240 as I add features to it. I&#x27;ll also start marketing it more and use it for the SaaS. Similarly, the book&#x27;s final price will likely be $30, which is double its current price (and quadruple its Black Friday price).<p>I probably won&#x27;t raise the cost of the screencasts, but I do expect to increase the number of customers, despite the competition as I add more and more lessons.<p>The biggest factor is the recovery of my repetitive stress injuries. I can do a lot more coding now than I could a year ago!')
