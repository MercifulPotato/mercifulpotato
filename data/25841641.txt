Item(by='ineedasername', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611107603, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25841549, text='It is a throwback to the Prosperity Gospel and, before that, the Protestant concept of predestination-- unfortunately prevalent ideas in the early settlers &amp; founders of the US. Basically it says that God favors the faithful &amp; devout with prosperity. Therefore prosperity is a sign of God&#x27;s favor, and anyone who is not prosperous is therefore immoral&#x2F;bad&#x2F;lesser etc. Such things are more complicated than a simple analysis, but it&#x27;s one of the root causes behind the idea that &quot;poor people are poor by choice&quot;<p>Perhaps more perniciously, since this doctrine says that the prosperous are those blessed by God, then becoming prosperous is the main goal: the means by which that happens are irrelevant. Cheat&#x2F;Lie&#x2F;Con etc., but become prosperous? It must be okay, because the prosperous are blessed by God.')
