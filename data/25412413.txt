Have the Nazis go to a universe where Mars or Venus isnâ€™t a rock and slug it out over who will rule the solar system, have political intriegue with a bunch of Hitlers plotting against each other,  have the communists using dinosaurs as weapons,  have the Nazis encounter an very advanced Egyptian civilization that never fell, endless possibilities!')
