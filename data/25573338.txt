Item(by='prepend', descendants=None, kids=[25575887, 25574237], score=None, time=1609268024, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25571958, text='I used to do a lot of programming and the multiples are really high, especially since bad programmers can have negative productivity (kind of like Hammerstein-Equord’s stupid and industrious quadrant).<p>I remember a McKinsey study from the 80s or 90s that talked about 10x productivity but I can’t find it so maybe I’m misremembering. I don’t think people who actually try to measure this succeed well. I run away from anyone trying to precisely measure programmer productivity because it usually means some point haired boss will try to optimize on lines of code or something stupid.<p>So for me, it’s a bit of a hunch but a strong hunch. I’ve worked in shops of 100 devs where a single dev wrote the entire authentication stack that teams couldn’t handle. And I have lots more stories like this.<p>Nowadays I do “strategy” and I’d say the multiple is more than 10x in that there’s usually some magic mix to a good strategy that can’t be accomplished with giant committees and tons of hours. When it comes to creative tasks, I think the productivity leap from “ok” to “good” and from “good” to “super” is really high. Not every job is like this, but I think these are the most fun and so try to go towards them and away from commodity work.<p>I have limited experience in academia but have seen authors quickly crank out really useful papers where teams have been working for months. I suspect that’s more about just having good alignment of capability and need instead of some magic or intrinsic productivity power.<p>Personally my productivity is pretty sucky so I’m in a situation where I don’t meet my criteria but am lucky enough to get to work on cool stuff.')
