Again, there is so much misinformation about this that I don&#x27;t blame anyone. I think there was quite a lot of things being done.<p>I believe the goal was to keep people informed about the dangers of the virus and how to protect themselves, the most important parts being to wash your hands and social distance. I think they also provide information tailored to different sectors (like healthcare) and advise them on how to fight the virus. It&#x27;s then up to the different sectors how they handle their specific situation.<p>I think that Sweden is perceived to not take action when it did. I think this comes from the politicians stepping aside and &quot;transferring the leadership&quot; to FHM (doing the opposite would be political suicide in Sweden). In some other countries you have had politicians boasting how good <i>their</i> response is. I&#x27;ve even seen politicians claim that people of <i>their</i> race just handle the disease better. FHM doesn&#x27;t have the same vested interest in looking good.')
