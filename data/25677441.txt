Of course he meant that when the statement was made, and he will be perfectly fine to forget that and claim going public is best for the company.<p>A very interesting side story. Leon once tweeted that starlink has some risk of being shot down when flying over China. That&#x27;s before Tesla got the Shanghai deal. And now, I could not find that tweet or any screenshot of that. I bet Leon spent some good money to make it disappear.<p>Can any fellow confirm my memory?')
