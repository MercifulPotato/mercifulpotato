You had to pay a license for owning \na TV receiver. But then the public broadcaster also started offering streaming over the internet. Then they declared &quot;also a computer is a TV receiver&quot; and required everyone with a computer to pay TV license. If you refused, you were taken to court. The court agreed with the broadcaster. Only in the highest court was it thrown out. Had it not, there would have been an explicit tax on owning a computer in Sweden.<p>This was a despicable period and since then the law has changed. Now there is no license fee on owning a TV receiver. Instead everyone pays a tax whether they own a TV, a computer, whatever and no matter if they watch TV or not.')
