There are a few different options I&#x27;ve seen tried:<p>1. Project-based assignments.  These work well.  In certain cases a tool to check for plagiarism may be helpful, provided that a human review is used to double-check flagged assignments.<p>2. Essays.  These can be given as take-home assignments, in which case they are similar to 1.  They can also be given in an exam format, which is generally difficult to cheat and does a good job of testing understanding.<p>3. Traditional exams.  These work poorly in a take-home format.  They typically require invasive solutions.  The least-bad that I&#x27;ve seen are those in which teachers require students to get on zoom with a camera pointing at the student&#x27;s face, workspace, and screen.  The other big downside is that they generally make students more nervous about the test.<p>To any profs that read this: please use options one or two if possible.  Your students will thank you and may even do better for it.')
