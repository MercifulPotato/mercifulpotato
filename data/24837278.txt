I remember when a reddit post got 2000 upvotes that was a big deal. Then suddenly it became 4k, 8k, and then I stopped caring it got so large.<p>Reddit is becoming into a weird beast because I&#x27;ve found theres a mentality of people who assume you actively subscribe to the stuff set by default hence why people get upset when you don&#x27;t tout the same opinion. I&#x27;ve even had people ask me what I was doing in their subreddit, said I came from &#x2F;r&#x2F;all, and they basically said &quot;yeah right.&quot; Reddit is probably going to dominate the online forum market since it&#x27;s so much easier to create a subreddit than it is make your own website with forums.<p>My only beef with this is reddit silences things they don&#x27;t like, and not just things that sound reasonable. My rationale is let these people be. They&#x27;re dumb enough to discuss this garbage on your platform, so why not collect that data and just monitor it? Better than they go elsewhere and now you have no idea.<p>Also reddit trying to take their anonymous platform and make it so you act as a community member has always been weird to me. That makes sense for public people, not for general users. Especially when bot accounts just harvest upvotes. Twitter is basically what facebook used to be now.')
