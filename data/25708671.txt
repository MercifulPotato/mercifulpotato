Let me break down a couple of your statements:<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve yet to see evidence that he was hoping for it to turn violent? And if he did want that why did he speak out against it?<p>He&#x27;s not going to directly tell people to go commit violence. He&#x27;s going to (and did) whip up a crowd using hateful language, demonize the people who he doesn&#x27;t like, and make it clear that the crowd needed to &quot;take action&quot;. He used the common formulae of a persuasive speech, but left the call to action portion vague, so he couldn&#x27;t be held directly responsible; politicians do this all of the time.<p>&gt; does this mean we can expect Biden to be removed from Twitter if tweets anything in support of BLM?<p>No. The are huge differences between the people who attacked the Capitol and BLM protesters.<p>1) Volume: BLM actions have been widespread and ongoing. Whatever these crazy Trumpers&#x2F;white supremacists&#x2F;insurectionists call themselves, they&#x27;ve had several orders of magnitude less actions than BLM.<p>2) Violence: even though there have been so few Trumper protests, they&#x27;ve almost always had violence and in several cases, murder. There has been violence during BLM protests before, but it is so much more rare compared to the number of protests that they&#x27;ve had. Also, in general, BLM violence is almost always directed at property, not people, and is usually as a response, unlike what we saw at the Capitol. Has ANY police officer been killed by BLM protesters? After literally thousands of protests? I haven&#x27;t heard of it happening.<p>3) Purpose: BLM protests are generally about ending racism, social justice, and systemic equality. These Trumpets were taking action because they wanted to overturn the results of a democratic election. With that goal, they were basically trying to end our nation as a Democratic Republic.<p>4) Cause: BLM started, and has persisted, because people of color continue to be disproportionately killed by police (disproportionate in the reason why they were killed, not just in terms of numbers). It&#x27;s funny how blatantly justified BLM&#x27;s reason for existing became while watching how the Capitol Police handled the insurectionists. The Trumpets cause is that they didn&#x27;t get what they want, because we live in a democracy.<p>So no, Biden showing support for BLM will not get him banned from Twitter, because BLM is activism in response to murderous racism, and because he has the moral compass not to try to cause the downfall of our democracy.')
