Item(by='simias', descendants=None, kids=[25280178, 25279657, 25279481], score=None, time=1606931571, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25277669, text='FZF + ripgrep is really killer for me. I don&#x27;t even bother organizing my notes anymore, I just throw everything markdown files in a flat directory and then I have a script that uses FZF + ripgrep to search through it when I need it. I search by &quot;last modified first&quot; so unless I&#x27;m digging for something very old the results are instant. Code snippets, finances, TODO lists, cake recipes... It&#x27;s all in there.<p>I use the same system in Vim to browse source code. It&#x27;s very powerful, very fast, works with any language and requires zero configuration.')
