They will do this so with less cost than nuclear, by nearly all accounts (but not <i>all</i> accounts. However it seems quite likely to me that climate scientists will change their opinion as they revise the costs of nuclear to incorporate modern construction attempts.)<p>Why are we to choose the more expensive option? Simply because we like nuclear and want to subsidize it more than other clean energy sources? What good comes from nuclear&#x27;s extra expense?')
