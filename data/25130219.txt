I have a few profiles with their own bookmarks&#x2F;histories&#x2F;open tabs&#x2F;etc.   For example, one of my profiles is &quot;Shopping&quot;.  Another is &quot;Work&quot; and yet another is &quot;Social Media&quot;.<p>Context switching profiles at a macro level - as opposed to intermingling work&#x2F;shopping&#x2F;social - is beneficial to me.<p>When I switch over to &quot;Shopping&quot;, I have my tabs on whatever purchase I&#x27;m researching open.  I can drop the whole project for a few weeks and resume it later right where I left off.  None of it can bleed over into my &quot;Work&quot; profile.  I like the separation.  Helps keep my head clear.')
