Cu64 has some advantages because it has a comparable positron energy to F18 which leads to good image resolution but a substantially longer half life at 12 hours, which makes logistics of dose delivery and radiopharmaceutical preparation much easier than the 110 minute half life of F18.<p>Cu64 has recently been approved as the radionuclide pair for neuroendocrine tumor imaging in Cu64-Dotatate so hopefully we see more agents coming online.')
