That&#x27;s where you have 0(n) performance.<p>But hash tables are probabilistic data structures, so we don&#x27;t actually look at worst-case performance, but at the average case. It&#x27;s important that for this analysis we need to make some assumptions about the hash function itself (e.g. what its collision probability is). Out of that, we can compute that hash table operations are on average constant.<p>* There are actually multiple ways to deal with collisions in hash table, let&#x27;s focus on open hashing&#x2F;seperate chaining for now.')
