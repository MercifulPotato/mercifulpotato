Item(by='zwaps', descendants=None, kids=[25794815], score=None, time=1610718733, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25790206, text='I still have prime, and a good half of my &quot;next day shipping&quot; deliveries are delayed by a day, two days or even more.<p>Granted, the current situation is problematic, but this happened even before and since you are prime, you don&#x27;t get any money back or something like that. It&#x27;s just bad luck then.<p>Now, you might think you could rely on the services where you pay extra for same-day delivery or morning next day. But those end up missing the delivery window a good half of the times I used them - even before the pandemic.<p>Next day or same day delivery just isn&#x27;t something that seems to work reliably here in Western Europe.<p>I know companies where a local driver will literally get in a car and bring me what I need right away, but that doesn&#x27;t scale to Amazon levels.<p>Given that prime delivery rarely holds its promise, it is no surprise that Amazon needs to make non-prime delivery even less attractive.<p>But you know, there are other vendors! Plus, you are less likely to get a fake product if you order directly from there.')
