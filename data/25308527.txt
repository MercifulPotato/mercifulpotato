One day your skin is a solid piece of material and a disease is the result of a bad smell. The next day both are made up of a zillion cells.<p>This is no different. So what if the macroscopic chair is made out of the interaction between a bunch of different forces? It changes nothing. Molecules, atoms, and sub-atomics were already imaginary, in that you can only deduce them from tool-assisted and indirect observations, not see or feel them directly. &quot;this iron isn&#x27;t solid, it&#x27;s a mass of atoms.&quot; &quot;oh ok&quot;. &quot;oh hey the atoms are made out of these other sub-atomic things...&quot; &quot;oh ok&quot;. So now the sub-atomic things are really just forces. So what? Now suddenly at this next level of theory it&#x27;s all unreal?<p>It wasn&#x27;t already unreal? Or it&#x27;s suddenly no longer behaving as real? Neither of those are true. It&#x27;s no more or less real than yesterday, and it behaves no more or less real than yesterday.<p>What&#x27;s imaginary is this attempt at a new distinction.')
