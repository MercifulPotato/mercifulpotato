My (anecdotal) experience with apple warranties is the opposite - replacement device shipped that day and the courier picked up my broken one at the same time. Of course, I&#x27;m sure this was a one off, but it definitely left me feeling better.<p>Understand re; samsung, but as a consumer I don&#x27;t want to spend weeks researching compatibility between all of the devices I own&#x2F;plan on purchasing. Another example; I bought a sony bravia TV which runs android TV. Android tv advertised that it supports dvr recording features. Except sony force you to use another third party app &quot;youvirw&quot; which they ship an outdated version of which doesn&#x27;t work with androids flavor of live recording.<p>Unfortunately this is rife across the android world; watches incompatible with payments, stock launchers that are incompatible with android OS features, the list goes on and on. And the issue is that all of these are sold as &quot;android&quot; devices, and it&#x27;s not until you&#x27;re knee deep in the ecosystem that you realise that it&#x27;s all just lipstick on a pig.<p>Mt experience with the manufacturer-alternative apps is that in some cases their existence stops the alternative from working correctly (samsung knox vs android work profiles, fitbit pay vs google pay, huawei photos vs google photos),which just sucks. And you can only know about these issues if you research the compatibility of every app you want to use with your planned device...<p>And understand re; cheap devices, the comment thread is deep here!')
