Even China and Russia, who couldn&#x27;t give a rat&#x27;s ass about human rights, do not have anywhere near the mass incarceration problem that the US does. No other country has this problem.<p>All you have to do is go to any Reddit thread and watch Americans cheer about prison rape and masturbate over how if you selectively remove information you can make the crime sound worse than it actually was and use that low-resolution non-central point to justify imprisoning the person for 1827361872 years. I&#x27;m sorry dude, it&#x27;s not corporations, it&#x27;s not systematic incentives, it&#x27;s Americans. The American people are the problem.')
