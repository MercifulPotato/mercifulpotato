The First Amendment and associated case law is an actual specific legal thing, and is not necessarily the same as broader subjective feelings &quot;free speech&quot;. Specifically, it applies exclusively to the government, not the people. From a legal point of view, the purpose of freedom of speech and freedom of association is to allow the public at large to sort out what ideas and information is useful within extremely loose boundaries rather then the government using its monopoly on physical force to impose it. Part of that freedom is naturally social and economic consequences (as opposed to physical consequences): you have the &quot;right to generally say what you wish&quot; but <i>other people</i> by the same token have the right to have nothing to do with you, and to refuse to help you if they think you are wrong.<p>So no, like most of the times people use &quot;hypocrisy&quot; on the internet you&#x27;ve gotten it wrong. There is nothing hypocritical in the stance you describe, because the United States Government and private actors are not legally equivalent. The USG is both empowered to do things private actors may not, and forbidden from doing things that private actors can. Twitter may assert its rights to associate with whom it pleases. Under different law (the same that protects Hacker News and every other US-based user content site in existence), Section 230 of the CDA, Twitter is also empowered to moderate as it wishes to the best of its abilities without having to be 100% perfect without incurring liability rather then being forced to choose between full common carrier or full publisher. It could also voluntarily cooperate, within its various contracts and law. But the USG doesn&#x27;t get to do the same.<p>And rightfully so.')
