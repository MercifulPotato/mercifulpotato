If there were, everyone would be using it.<p>I can say with confidence that certain resume features are incredibly strong predictors of interview performance (at least in the related measures, in the field and&#x2F;or team I&#x27;m working in). I&#x27;m not HR, but your statement seems to also deny the possibility of this empirical observation.<p>&gt; Given this, why not hire lightly and fire lightly?<p>Because it would be a complete dick move to have someone relocate (possibly involving change of country) and then fire them 2 weeks later? That&#x27;s not even looking at the formal, bureaucratic or training overhead, or any of the other factors in this industry that make hiring and firing a bit more complicated than handing someone (and later taking away) a hardhat and a shovel.')
