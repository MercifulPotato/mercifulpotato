I find the Linux OS to be the best for programming, since it just runs everything like a breeze.  Windows is what I use for Office since macOS office is clunky and I&#x27;m locked in to the Windows shortcuts.<p>The issue with Macs for me is not the usability of the OS (apart from the lock in that Apple tried to do), but because of its irreparability. Spilt a few dropfuls water on your PC while using? Tough luck, gotta go to the Apple Care centre and wait till they fix it in a week or more. Meanwhile once I accidentally spilt water on my ThinkPad, I just disconnected everything, left it to dry for a day and voila! All of my data was preserved, no issues at all. Another time, I accidentally dropped the ThinkPad from my desk, yet it still works as good as new. Even if some issue were to happen to it, I can be assured of getting out-of-warranty support anywhere in the world - heck, I&#x27;ve had an old Dell repaired at the bloke&#x27;s who runs a computer shop in my grandfather&#x27;s village in rural India.<p>Another gripe I have is with Mac&#x27;s updates. People complain about Windows updates, but it just takes an hour or two tops if it&#x27;s a big one, and can be done on restart. Compare that to Mac - last year, Catalina took more than 10 hours on my Mac. Those are wasted hours of productivity, and it&#x27;s always the same story with Mac every year.')
