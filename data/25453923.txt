It should live separately from the render &#x2F; view code to make it easier &#x2F; faster to test without having to simulate a fake DOM. The average call to `render` takes around 100ms. The tests could be orders of magnitude faster and so much easier to test if people would just keep their business logic and effects seperate from their render code. Does no one remember MVC?')
