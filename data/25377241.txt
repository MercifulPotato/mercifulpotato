As I said multiple times there&#x27;s no studies about supplements on human patients, as the numbers are already tight for studies were only MDMA is administered and setting up a week long followup trial with supplements and placebo is impossible with their current resources.<p>I read your studies and as other three other comments here say I don&#x27;t really understand how they say supplements are necessary. They are old, on very simplified models that are no longer used in modern psychiatric or neuroscience research, and about brain chemistry effects on rats and not psychological effects on humans. There are a lot of studies with MDMA on humans now, and they point in a different direction. The type of research you are pointing to is what was used as an excuse among the scientific community for making it illegal in the first place.<p>Also I don&#x27;t dispute it&#x27;s neurotoxic, as most data points say it is. I&#x27;m just saying that the supplementation doesn&#x27;t really help with that. Yeah they help with neurogenesis and so does meditation, eating healthy, learning a musical instrument, sleeping well, getting sunlight, etc... That doesn&#x27;t mean it will &quot;cancel out&quot; or help with MDMA neurotoxicity particularly.<p>You are spreading new age pseudo-religious unverified magic cures for MDMA side-effects only that it&#x27;s in the form of capsules instead of lifestyle changes. That&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s what you are doing.')
