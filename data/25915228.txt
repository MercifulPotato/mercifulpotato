It&#x27;s half the price of Spaces, and I get better transfer rates from my DigitalOcean droplet to B2 than I get to Spaces, even within the same DigitalOcean datacenter.<p>There are tons of companies offering S3-compatible storage, and there&#x27;s not much difference between them, other than price. Performance capabilities are similar; they all limit bandwidth. All the ones I&#x27;ve evaluated charge for egress over a certain threshold. Some are more reliable than others. For personal use, there&#x27;s not a whole lot of difference between them for me.<p>One really cheap alternative for some use cases is Office 365. For $99&#x2F;year, you can get a family subscription, which allows six accounts. Each gets 1TB of S3-compatible OneDrive storage. If you can handle it being broken up into six 1TB chunks, it&#x27;s by far the cheapest storage out there. For comparison, Backblaze is $5&#x2F;TB&#x2F;mo, and Office 365 gets you $1.37&#x2F;TB&#x2F;mo. I didn&#x27;t end up using this option because the authentication mechanism was inconvenient for my automated use case and I didn&#x27;t end up needing so much storage, but it&#x27;s worth investigating if you&#x27;re on a budget and don&#x27;t need automated access via e.g. rclone mounts (or want to take the time to overcome the authentication issues I ran into).<p>I evaluated about a dozen S3 storage options for both backups and as backing storage for a personal Plex server (of media I own) and eventually settled on Backblaze because it&#x27;s cheap, easy to use, and I didn&#x27;t need more than 1-2TB in the end (since not a single one can keep up with streaming video bandwidth needs, I ditched the Plex idea).')
