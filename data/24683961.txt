Can one consider &quot;excessively generous compensation&quot; to employees a form of market manipulation?<p>Much like predatory pricing prohibits other players in the market from operating competitively, generous compensation to potential employees would prohibit those organizations from operating competitively if they don&#x27;t have the revenue stream to support those salaries, and thus making it more difficult to retain talent.
