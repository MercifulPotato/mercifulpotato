Then you&#x27;ll argue, &quot;but but the nyc outbreaks trace to Europe!!&quot; And I&#x27;ll argue back that China has industrial factories in Italy, and ask you how the virus got to Italy&#x2F;Europe in the first place. And you still won&#x27;t get it. It&#x27;s like the left just constant ignores common sense and hides behind reddit-teir &quot;you got a source for that&quot; nerdery.<p>All of this happened less than a year ago.
