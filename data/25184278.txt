I&#x27;ve never before met someone who almost entirely discards knowledge they didn&#x27;t experience themselves. I wonder to what extent you trust that I am a human being living somewhere else on the globe :) .<p>Regarding the synthesis of water, I have seen that experiment done first hand when I was in school, and I have seen a larger quantity of droplets of water when it was done than in other similar experiments where two gasses were burned, so I am well convinced. Synthesising buckets of water would be a much more complicated trick though, especially if you expect to see it happen all at once, because the reaction is 2H2 + O2 = 2H2O, so you need to react 1kg of hydrogen with 0.5kg of oxygen to get 1kg of water vapour, without blowing your whole house up - not an easy feat. Going a safer route, creating a process that reacts small quantities over a long time is also difficult, especially if you want to make a convincing looking apparatus.<p>An easier route if you want to convince yourself of this reaction, I still suggest the best way is to perform the experiment with hydrogen and oxygen, and then to perform similar experiments with other gasses. This way, you could compare the amount of vapour that condenses after burning hydrogen (you should see a lot) vs burning sulphur (you&#x27;ll see very little or none).<p>&gt; My view is that we live in a fabricated reality, where we have created types and classifications - but that these are ideas in our own minds. We are not describing reality, we are describing our classifications. We are lost in our stories.<p>The reason why I don&#x27;t think your argument holds water, at least for most science, is that we can see the products of science working every day, even if we don&#x27;t personally study them from first principles. I can see that my computer works, so I am convinced that all of the science involved in its creation is true - electricity, materials science, possibly some aspects of quantum mechanics, general relativity for my GPS clock, the speed of light when looking at the Latency of satellite communications, the chemistry of silicone which they use in the manufacturing process and others. I look at the plastic industry and pigment industry and junk food and medicine, and I know that chemistry is true. I look at how we successfully treat and prevent microbial diseases, or selectively breed plants and animals, and I know that genetics is true.<p>Do I need to deeply understand each of these phenomena? Not really, and I don&#x27;t even need to trust the scientists. All I need is to trust that the hundreds of thousands of engineers who apply these processes every day are not lying about <i>how</i> they make it work. I don&#x27;t need to trust them that it works, that I can see for myself.')
