If you can speak to someone, eg Doreen in this case has offered her perspective, that counts for far more with me.</i><p>For the record, I don&#x27;t like being used in this manner to further your agenda. I consider it malicious behavior.<p><i>I know most individuals are happy to offer help and their perspective out of natural good will. Mostly individuals are trustworthy.</i><p>Most individuals mean well and are stating the truth as they best understand it. That doesn&#x27;t mean their data is trustworthy or their inferences are trustworthy.<p>To the degree that people personally malign me, it&#x27;s bad faith and malicious interaction. But where criticisms of my remarks are motivated by and grounded in genuine <i>skepticism</i> and a desire to seek solid data, those sorts of feedback are entirely welcome by me.<p>It&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s uncommon for people to get that right. It&#x27;s much more common for people to be snide and dismissive out of hand than to ask genuinely probing questions to ascertain how I came to the conclusions I came to. They assume my conclusions are unfounded rather than wondering what makes me think I am on solid ground.<p>Over the years, people on HN helping me determine how to find solid ground has been valuable to me. So I do my best to be tolerant of the inevitably messy process involved.')
