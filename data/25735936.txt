It is <i>very</i> hard.  &quot;Correctness&quot; to Haskellers means modest things like &quot;the compiler tells me when I passed a NULL (Nothing) to a function that didn&#x27;t expect it&quot; or &quot;the compiler tells me when I mixed a part name for a part serial number&quot;.<p>Modest, but nonetheless Haskell does this in a ergonomic way which is very effective for writing quality software.<p>[1] or at least any reasonable ones don&#x27;t')
