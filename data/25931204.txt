It can speak to relative safety. In all the thousands of years, there has yet to be a single death that can be attributed directly to cannabis (and I don&#x27;t count &quot;marijuana-related visits&quot; to hospitals where regardless of which ailment a person has, if they test positive for cannabis it becomes a &quot;marijuana-related visit&quot;, nor do I count deaths where a person just happened to have smoked beforehand).')
