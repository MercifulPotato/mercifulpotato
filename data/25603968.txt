Item(by='jpmattia', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609515571, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25599445, text='&gt; <i>Isn&#x27;t the fundamental difference here that we can&#x27;t print more bitcoin to bail out bad investments?</i><p>Absolutely.  (Although it&#x27;s &quot;a&quot; difference, not &quot;the&quot; difference.)<p>&gt; <i>you can lend out bitcoin and even do fractional reserves, but ultimately, the bill must come due and over leveraged bad bets will get wiped out and good bets get rewarded.</i><p>Yes, and the subeconomy of bitcoin investing has a very different risk profile.  As an example: I mentioned in another comment, the exchanges are already doing fractional reserves in spades.  Bitmex has an insurance fund, and there has been at least one occasion where liquidation could not be covered by the traders and then exhausted the insurance fund.  What happened then?  The insurance fund paid out pro-rata on the successful bets (the successful traders made less than they should have&quot;) and much grousing ensued.<p>So it&#x27;s the rough equivalent of an old-fashioned bank run, but tempers lessened because some money was made and nobody was zeroed out (other than the losing bets who should have gone negative but were only zeroed out).')
