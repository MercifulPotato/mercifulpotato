All these providers also allow hooks into features like security, database, apis, ci&#x2F;cd, and so on.  You would be in a serverless architecture also which provides scalability and keeps costs low up front.   Not trying to discredit the author here, which is admirable in the intent, but feels like it&#x27;s trying to solve for something that several other solutions exist for unless I&#x27;m missing something critical.')
