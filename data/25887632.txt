I love that about nodejs - their official releases guide[1] is very clear about how long each release is supported for. Any important bugs found during the LTS window are fixed. Bugs found after the LTS period? Too late. If you run into those issues, its on you to upgrade nodejs.<p>As a library author, the chart tells me nodejs v10 will stop being maintained at the end of April. At that point, I&#x27;ll remove node 10 from my CI testing matricies. And I can remove any node 10 polyfills and workarounds, and start using features in my libraries that were only added in node 12. Clear and simple. If anyone complains about nodejs 10 problems, I can send them to the nodejs releases guide and firmly suggest upgrading their software.<p>In comparison, it sounds like gcc and the linux kernel devs are mutually confused about whether 4.9 is supported software. Gcc devs apparently don&#x27;t want to backport patches (and haven&#x27;t for years). And yet kernel developers are acting as if gcc 4.9 is still expected to produce correct code. Which is it?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nodejs.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;about&#x2F;releases&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nodejs.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;about&#x2F;releases&#x2F;</a>')
