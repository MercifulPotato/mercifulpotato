Presumably there is some cost&#x2F;benefit analysis at Google to decide which formats to use, and it is decided that a particular video should not be encoded using AV1 due to the resulting impact on disk&#x2F;CPU&#x2F;network usage (more disk, more CPU, less network egress).<p>I also suppose YouTube has a massive pool of low-priority batch services for transcoding and can do last-minute encoding for unpopular videos &#x2F; unpopular formats, so YouTube’s tradeoff will not be the same as your tradeoff. I just wonder what the tradeoff is.')
