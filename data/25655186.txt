However, there is as yet no experiment showing any kind of quantum behavior for huge objects (closest is a few hundred million atoms as far as I know).<p>Still, the point was about a classical model, not about physical reality being classical or quantum. To rephrase, my point was that even in a classical model there are quantities that can&#x27;t practically be measured (even though classical mechanics as a model assumes all objects have definite positions and momentums), and that doesn&#x27;t stop us from accepting in such a model that they are &#x27;real&#x27;. So, the idea of property that is &#x27;real&#x27; but not really measurable already exists in classical physics, it is not an invention of exotic interpretations of QM.')
