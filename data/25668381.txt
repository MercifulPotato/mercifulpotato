In general if I were a lawmaker I would be very shook right now. The people who are supposed to protect me are either incompetent or untrustworthy. Hindsight is 20&#x2F;20 now but with more organization today could have been a major attack. My guess is that we&#x27;ll see a purge followed by an increased militarization &#x2F; professionalization of the force that protects lawmakers. The Secret Service is well known, yet I haven&#x27;t heard of the Capitol Police until this incident.<p>Edit: Or maybe it&#x27;ll be a wakeup call for lawmakers to investigate whether they actually have the allegiance of the various law enforcement agencies that were present or absent today.<p>At an even more general level one key institution (the presidency) has just passively (actively?) supported  a major bodily threat to the most powerful people of another key institution (the lawmakers) so I imagine we&#x27;ll see the full force of America&#x27;s checks and balances in play now.')
