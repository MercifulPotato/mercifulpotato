I wonder if my prioritization of the echo-chamber&#x2F;fake news balkanization problems the web is facing now is purely because it&#x27;s a more novel threat than authoritarian government overreach?<p>But it seems like there should be <i></i>some<i></i> level of compromise that can address both risks. We restrict other natural freedoms in all sorts of ways in modern society, why not free speech at all? As an example that&#x27;s repeated so often it&#x27;s practically a cliche: even with the second amendment in the US, citizens are still restricted from owning nuclear weapons.<p>A new class of weapon was invented and society decided that no matter what they said in the past, this was too powerful to treat like any other weapon until now. Seems like this new form of hyper-speech could qualify for a similar approach?')
