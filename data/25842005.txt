We would understand each other better, we would integrate ideas easier and work more cooperatively. But until code stops being just a tool to implement some end and until code quality stops being regarded as cost we will keep writing spaghetti code. Regardless of language. Because when the team culture tolerates bad code, bad code will arise, be that in java, c, python, rust, Haskell. Whatever.')
