Turns out, I&#x27;m using &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; when I quote on pen and paper, and I use &quot;&quot; digitally. I had always thought that it was a weird stylistic choice on the part of the teacher that taught me writing in primary school, or that I had somehow &#x27;corrupted&#x27; &quot;&quot; into super-elongated &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; to be able to more clearly denote the beginning of a quote from its end marker.<p>Only now I&#x27;m realising I&#x27;ve in fact been taught to use guillemets and it took me only two and a half decades!<p>In hindsight, my primary school teacher was already about to retire when I was learning to write, so it&#x27;s likely that she had been brought up in a much earlier school of style than one that is being taught now. Considering that Turkish has been shedding its Francophone writing style [0][1] for a while now, I consider it an echo of a bygone era. That said, Turkish still considers French its &#x27;official&#x27; interface to Indo-European words, and there exists a structure that can convert any French word into a valid Turkish one. A simple example: <i>London</i> in Turkish is <i>Londra</i> — it sounds exactly the same as <i>Londres</i> spoken by a French speaker. A more recent example is <i>Pope Francis</i>, whose Turkish name is <i>Papa Fransua</i>, which sounds exactly the same as <i>Papa François</i> as it would be in French. Basically, the &#x27;method&#x27; involves saying what you want in French and encoding it with Turkish ortography, and then it&#x27;s a valid Turkish word. [2]<p>[0] Another one of these Francophone stylings is the tradition to capitalise the surnames, like <i>Amelie POULAIN</i>, or <i>Bora ALTUNİZADE</i>, which has been considered outdated for a decade or two.<p>[1] Writing style is moving towards Britain, but not words — 11% of modern Turkish vocabulary is still directly from French, second only to ancient Turkish from 11th century.<p>[2] Famously, Turkish alphabet contains the letter J solely to be able to encode French words with the correct sound — the J sound does not otherwise appear in any Turkish word, only in words derived from French. Outside of French words, Turkish retains the original Latin J sound that is also used in German, which is a Y sound, so it gets encoded as Y in ortography, removing the need for letter J. For example, <i>Joseph</i> in Turkish becomes <i>Yusuf</i>, <i>Johannes</i> becomes <i>Yuhanna</i>.')
