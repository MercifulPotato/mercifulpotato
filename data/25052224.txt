You know, one of the three states that elected half the members of &#x27;the squad&#x27;. Sure, California rich people can throw in a lot of money, but that&#x27;s true for both Republican and Democratic parties. Don&#x27;t dismiss our importance in the Democratic party. We turn up &amp; do the work, including the work of talking with our &#x27;red&#x27; neighbors and actually trying to work things out in this country.<p>As for high &amp; low vs middle, it just doesn&#x27;t make sense to me. Lots of rich people supporting the Republicans -- lots, lots, lots. Lots of rich people supporting the Dems. Poor people split by race and geography. Middle class people split by race and geography. The split by geography and race is more significant than the split by income, in almost every presentation of data that I see.')
