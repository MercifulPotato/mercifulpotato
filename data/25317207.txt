Plus they almost certainly require signed firmware so you also have to find an exploit to allow loading your custom firmware.<p>Far easier just to not connect the TV to the internet and use a third party solution like nVidia Shield instead. Fortunately pretty much no TVs will try to connect via open WiFi or 4G at the moment, though it is definitely coming.')
