He is a natural contrarian and has said things at various time that would likely be against social media policies. For example he had segments on his “Liberty Report” that encouraged mask skepticism and other such misguided things about dealing with Covid that he should know better about, being a former medical doctor.<p>I very much doubt he’s said anything in support of the recent insurrections though, he’s incredibly anti-war and generally promoting peace. IMO he has deteriorated mentally in recent years and has become significantly more kooky, which is a shame because IMO there are some things he’s been very right about and he’s almost the only one advocating for certain things.')
