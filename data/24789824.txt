I&#x27;m happy to meet up and do stuff outside of work, but I&#x27;m a bit more guarded than I would be with someone I don&#x27;t work with. I might hesitate to introduce them to some of my more &quot;out there&quot; friends (for whatever reason I seem to attract a lot of very weird people). once we no longer work together, they can just be a normal friend.')
