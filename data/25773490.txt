It&#x27;s still one of the most profitable companies on the planet.<p>Look at IBM; while Big Blue was once seemingly omnipotent and they&#x27;ve since fallen from that position, it&#x27;s still a double-digit billion company with over 300k employees. It&#x27;s not as big (relatively speaking) as it once was, but it sure didn&#x27;t die either.<p>Other companies have died, such as Digital Equipment, but that was the result of 1) a massive paradigm shift in computing and computing equipment (introduction of &quot;personal computing&quot;), and 2) some pretty bad business decisions (not just failing to get a hold of the PC market). Thus far, I&#x27;m not really seeing 1) happen, and 2) alone probably won&#x27;t be enough to completely kill intel, just cripple it temporarily.')
