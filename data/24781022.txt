It was a clear and beautiful beginning-middle-end arc.<p>My complaint is that adding another season doesn&#x27;t enhance a begging-middle-end story arc that&#x27;s already done, especially when it <i>clearly</i> was tacked on and not part of the original story.<p>What I&#x27;d prefer? Give the creator a blank slate and let them make another amazing story, rather than saying &quot;this Ducati is great–keep adding wheels!&quot;')
