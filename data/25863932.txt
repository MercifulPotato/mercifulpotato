I find I can handle 3 or 4 hours of a museum and I have to get out and do something else.<p>Of course, it really helps if you&#x27;ve been to a place before and will probably go back again. When I go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art I basically have a mental plan for what I&#x27;m going to see.<p>A museum membership is really nice if you&#x27;re in a place a lot. At a time when I was visiting NYC frequently and MOMA had just reopened after a major renovation and tickets were hard to get, I bought a membership. It was really nice to be able to pop in for an hour when I was in town and see some things I especially liked.')
