Anecdotally, nobody worth working for (and plenty of companies not worth working for) care about a 3 month notice period.<p>I&#x27;d say put the feelers out there and interview casually for a while before writing yourself off because of your notice period.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t know if other commenters are based in the USA where it seems common for employers to practice retaliatory firings.<p>In the UK if you have more than 2 years of service at your current employer, it&#x27;s very very unlikely that they can fire you without a negligence&#x2F;misconduct claim against you. You&#x27;re more likely to be put on paid garden leave, or somehow made redundant (but you should be paid a lump sum).')
