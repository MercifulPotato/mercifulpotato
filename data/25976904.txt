Ubuntu 20.04, the latest of the most popular distributions, does not have wayland enabled by default. They actively discourages you from trying it if you have Nvidia, which again is the most popular gfx card - not sure if one is supposed skip the proprietary drivers or not with Wayland but on X11 using Nouveau is not a pleasant experience.')
