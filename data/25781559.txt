Legally, you will be a freelancer anyway unless the US Company has a local office&#x2F;subsidiary&#x2F;branch office. Most likely, you will invoice the company say once a month and you take care of all taxes etc on your end depending on local laws.<p>2. Timezone is not an issue as long as you can agree on a good overlap that works for both parties.<p>3. yes, it is cheaper to hire from Latin America or Eastern Europe. Don&#x27;t compete with them on cost only because you will always lose coming from Western Europe. Focus on value and why they should hire YOU. If you are as good as a local American developer and are more cost effective (a bonus), it is win win.')
