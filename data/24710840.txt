The contents and the time period are clear from what you see. But things aren&#x27;t always that clear.\nFor instance, someone decides to make a documentary on a contemporary hot button topic.<p>Sure, and I agree that&#x27;s an issue, but here we&#x27;re talking about historical footage for the purposes of understanding history.. frankly anyone that &#x27;matters&#x27; and especially actual historians aren&#x27;t going to think it&#x27;s original, contemporaneous footage, whether they understand how it could have been produced&#x2F;altered or not.<p>If it &#x27;goes viral&#x27; and the uneducated assume it&#x27;s an original C19 recording... It doesn&#x27;t really matter? It&#x27;s sad for misinformation to be &#x27;viral&#x27; instead of stellar reporting, sure, but it doesn&#x27;t alter learned knowledge of history.')
