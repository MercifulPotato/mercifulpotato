There are a number of stocks that are grossly overvalued right now when you look at fundamentals.  Lots of people have been talking here &amp; everywhere else for the better part of the past year about how the Fed is printing money and it&#x27;s all going into a stock bubble.  Oh yeah, and cryptocurrencies.<p>This GME thing is just one little piece of an overall new zeitgeist.  I&#x27;m not about to even try to predict the next crash&#x2F;bubble-pop, though.  I just don&#x27;t have the stomach for this kind of market.  When a change comes, it may not happen in a predictable way.  I think there&#x27;s at least a chance we could somewhat be in uncharted territory here.')
