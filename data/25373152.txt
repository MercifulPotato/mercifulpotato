The never ending popups with absolutely 0 constancy across sites is atrocious, moreover if I rejected a cookie for a domain on site A I will be prompted on site B if I want to reject it again.<p>For every domain that wants to create cookies, I should be prompted by the browser (like I allow camera access) if I authorize it to do so, we can even imagine that each domain would have cookies purpose information (&#x27;mydomain.com&#x2F;cookies_policy&#x27;) in JSON that the browser is able to present to the user (describing each cookie of the domain). Then the browser would be responsible to never create cookies that I rejected.<p>The main advantage would be that in  incognito mode I would not have to repeat myself 10 times a day.')
