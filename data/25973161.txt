Assuming monthly payments, and a loss of income on March 1st, I&#x27;m still under the impression that UBI will give you $1,000 to spend as of March 1st, while a negative income tax will make you wait until April 1st, no?<p>But also, in my world there are no paychecks or ongoing regular income and income isn&#x27;t reported until the end of the year. How does that fit the model?')
