No version of TLS is immune to these middleboxes.<p>I suspect I&#x27;m being misunderstood. I don&#x27;t intend to suggest these pasky middleboxes spring up randomly on the Internet and anyone is at risk. These are deliberately installed on the edge of corporate networks, and their sole purpose is to intercept, unencrypt and filter traffic.<p>There&#x27;s no technological solution for a middleware box that emulates a client to servers, and emulates a server to clients, and is operating exactly as designed.<p>This shouldn&#x27;t be new or surprising or groundbreaking to anyone. It&#x27;s just a fancy name for a poorly implemented proxy.')
