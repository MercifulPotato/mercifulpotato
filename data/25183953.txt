What&#x27;s the issue?<p>The issue is that when someone says &quot;let&#x27;s stay away from politics&quot;, it&#x27;s pedantic and obtuse to start listing things that in some way involve politics.<p>It&#x27;s clear what they meant: the more something is related to politics and unrelated to work, the more we should try to avoid it.<p>Your response does the exact opposite of that, bringing up a bunch of hot-button political issues tenuously related to work, which is a great way to bring <i>more</i> conflict about politics into the workplace.')
