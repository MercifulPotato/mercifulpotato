Goldberg, for every one case involving a rape tape on Pornhub, she has 50 involving rape and CSAM being disseminated on Instagram and Facebook. Mainstream big tech is far worse than Pornhub for rape porn and have a built-in mechanism for harassing victims directly.<p>I agree that Pornhub should have to follow the same rules as American porn companies as far as ID requirements and copyright rules.<p>But let&#x27;s not pretend that any other part of this is about protecting children. Tech companies sent the DOJ more than 45 million instances of CSAM  in 2019 alone, most of which they never investigated.<p>This is about the DOJ pressuring Pornhub into allowing the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a DOJ subsidiary, to censor their content. Which they agreed to.')
