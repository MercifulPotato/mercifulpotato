It would be nice for sure, but unions are not coming back[1].<p>The campaign to disrupt unions was successful and they are easily dismantled without breaking the law. Yet the employees still need protection. Unions have been sorta replaced by HR. Employees almost always go to HR to resolve issues but they forget that this entity is for the company, by the company.<p>If we want to make any impact I think HR is where we start. We turn it into a public and legal entity, required by law if the company reaches a certain size. And it reports to the state government.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;idiallo.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;unions-are-not-coming-back" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;idiallo.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;unions-are-not-coming-back</a>')
