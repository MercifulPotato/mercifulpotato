So sure, nothing about Citadel&#x27;s role in this story is actually known.<p>OTOH, in this case, it&#x27;s genuinely hard to conceive of an alternative story that isn&#x27;t a cabal story.<p>Also, in practical terms... most of the action was on robin hood. If other brokers&#x2F;originators&#x2F;banks didn&#x27;t shut down  buys then this entire wallstreetbets craziness would flood in their direction.<p>Q: Did BoM &amp; Merrill Edge shut down trading on #wallstreetbetmadness stocks entirely, or just the buy side? One of the most damning things here is that robinhood only shut down buys. Seems like blatant market manipulation, but I don&#x27;t really know the rules.')
