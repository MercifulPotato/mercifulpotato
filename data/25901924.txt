What&#x27;s happening now seems like the time elapsed in the penalty box for bad behavior and now they are back on the ice. As you&#x27;ve stated, Boeing is too important to go out of business. Should a crash happen in the western world they&#x27;ll long for the difficulties and corrective opportunities they face now.')
