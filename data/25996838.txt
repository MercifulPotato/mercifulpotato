I myself have been guilty of this.<p>&gt; Lastly, unless marketing is highly restricted,<p>You raise a good point. There is only one status quo, but legalization can take many forms. As an example, I mostly agree with the model presented here:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;transformdrugs.org&#x2F;product&#x2F;how-to-regulate-stimulants-a-practical-guide&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;transformdrugs.org&#x2F;product&#x2F;how-to-regulate-stimulant...</a><p>(See the &quot;Balancing conflicting priorities&quot; heading for some (admittedly sparse) discussion of drawbacks.)<p>Drugs would be manufactured and sold only by government-licensed operators, in unattractive packaging with prominent warnings, and advertisement would be strictly forbidden.<p>I also think that legalization and regulation can&#x27;t happen in a vacuum. This may be an unpopular opinion in the United States, but I think that a social safety net (like welfare or even UBI) that allowed your friend to purchase legal heroin instead of mugging old ladies would be an excellent use of my taxes.')
