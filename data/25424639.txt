Item(by='elliekelly', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607987318, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25423509, text='Commissioner Phillips makes a pretty disingenuous argument. The purpose of FTC Act Section 6(b), as I&#x27;m sure Phillips well knows, is to collect information in order to inform the FTC&#x27;s ability to propose policy and legislation. In fact reports written from 6(b) requests are often called &quot;studies&quot; or &quot;policy research&quot; in the media.<p>&gt; These are different companies, some of which have strikingly different business models.<p>That&#x27;s usually the goal when you&#x27;re sampling how an industry operates.<p>And so disingenuous are the other points he makes that I honestly don&#x27;t believe Phillips believes most of what he&#x27;s written. But when I got to the sentence where he called the FTC&#x27;s privacy staff &quot;the most impactful privacy enforcers in the world&quot; and the FTC&#x27;s regulation of consumer privacy &quot;an effective enforcement program&quot; it&#x27;s hard to take anything else he says seriously.<p>I&#x27;ll admit I did get a kick out of him citing Executive Order 13892[1] which basically says government agencies must be &quot;fair and transparent&quot; when collecting information from regulated entities. How deliciously ironic he&#x27;s willing to put his foot down in the name of unfair, confusing, and overly broad information gathering.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.federalregister.gov&#x2F;documents&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;2019-22624&#x2F;promoting-the-rule-of-law-through-transparency-and-fairness-in-civil-administrative-enforcement-and" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.federalregister.gov&#x2F;documents&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;2019-22...</a>')
