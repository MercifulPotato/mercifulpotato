This means as a creator that’s not in YPP, you may see ads on some of your videos. Since you’re not currently in YPP, you won’t receive a share of the revenue from these ads, though you’ll still have the opportunity to apply for YPP as you normally would once you meet the eligibility requirements.<p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;youtube&#x2F;thread&#x2F;83733719" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;youtube&#x2F;thread&#x2F;83733719</a>')
