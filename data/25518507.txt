YouTube recommendations helped me find incredibly valuable content which I don&#x27;t think I would be able to find without the algorithm being new to the topic and not quite knowing where to look. These days, if I find myself interested in a new topic, I intentionally make a few searches knowing that YT will bring something relevant in the future and it&#x27;s generally going to be even better than the web search because for some topics, the barrier to making a good YT video is much higher than making a high ranking article or a web site.')
