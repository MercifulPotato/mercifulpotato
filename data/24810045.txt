I&#x27;m not trying to be facetious; a few seconds (or minutes) of additional runtime for scripts you hardly ever run or even run only once doesn&#x27;t really matter, but running such scripts often may worth then worth the effort to convert them to something faster.<p>I regularly find myself porting regularly used python&#x2F;js scripts to C#&#x2F;dotnet (because it&#x27;s fast enough, has good collections + LINQ for your somewhat-functional-programming needs and I can skip manual memory management, and async&#x2F;await programming is not perfect but available and easy enough, + nuget has a lot of stuff and so does the standard lib).<p>What made you pick C++ over e.g. go or rust or C#?')
