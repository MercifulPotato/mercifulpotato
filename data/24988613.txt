Regardless of what you think about the paradox, this is what it states:<p>&gt; <i>But when our hypothetical Blub programmer looks in the other direction, up the power continuum, he doesn’t realize he’s looking up. What he sees are merely weird languages. He probably considers them about equivalent in power to Blub, but with all this other hairy stuff thrown in as well. Blub is good enough for him, because he thinks in Blub.</i><p>It&#x27;s very, very hard to argue Go is &quot;up the power continuum&quot; from Haskell, or that Haskell is a Blub language compared to Go. Everything else can be debatable, but surely not this.<p>He could have simply said &quot;I was arrogant about Go, and need to look at it from a fresh perspective instead of comparing it to a language I&#x27;m more familiar with&quot;, no appeals to Blub needed.')
