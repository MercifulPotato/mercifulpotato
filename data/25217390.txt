Sure. Do I want them at any cost? No.<p>I could get a lot of those things today, right now if I was willing to switch to a linux desktop and PureOS phone. I have tried switching to linux many times and  and can say with certainty that I am willing to trade quite a bit to be able to use macOS instead of ubuntu, fedora, etc...While I haven&#x27;t tried PureOS specifically, I did have an Android phone for a while and much prefer iOS.')
