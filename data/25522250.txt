Pretty much, every junior (&lt; 3 years of experience) interviewer at first asks me what they should do if the candidate starts talking about something they know very little about.<p>The interviewers are people too. They get nervous too sometimes. They too don’t want to look stupid when they’re having a conversation with the candidate.<p>The first learning of interviewer training I try to solidify is that the interviewer is not intended to be the person who “knows the answers”. Candidates have specialized, deep knowledge in the specific areas they’ve worked on. How can an interviewer expect to know more than them?<p>Experienced interviewers will know that they are there simply to facilitate the candidate in arriving at solutions to the problem.')
