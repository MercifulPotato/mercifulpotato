We could not in general forsee the sheer calamity the pandemic has caused in its short timeframe near the beginning. Large and drastic changes would probably have a greater effect on short-term memory than if we&#x27;re essentially frogs in boiling water, even if the degree of environmental consequences ends up the same.<p>Because the changes the pandemic caused were drastic by its nature, so much behavior was regulated and put into law (large gatherings illegal, etc.) in such a short time. If it&#x27;s inevitable that climate change will never occur drastically, how can those restrictions on growth and consumption not continually get pushed back because of lobbyists who see no short-term consequences?<p>Or given how humans can act, maybe they&#x27;d go back to their normal levels of consumption out of spite anyways. It&#x27;s hard to tell.')
