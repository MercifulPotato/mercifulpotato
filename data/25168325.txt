The locked down Anki (for highly purpose specific and optimised interface for SRS language learning is what his app is).<p>I&#x27;ve tried his new app. Built in image search, pronunciation trainers, many included sentences with audio of varying difficulty. Now you can finally add custom words... It&#x27;s at least gradually honing his vision into an app.<p>They are also going to have community supported languages, rather than simply not have more rare languages.<p>Granted, it&#x27;s a premium app. Currently not got a freemium offering, and certainly not open source, so will put many off.<p>But at the same time, I know so many people who couldn&#x27;t work with Anki, but could easily work with the app, so it does at least offer the system to a much broader audience.')
