That&#x27;s pretty much the defining feature of being a human, that our world is constantly changing (because we&#x27;re changing it). A smartphone is just another distraction in a long line of man-made distractions that we&#x27;ve invented, worried about, and then adapted to. Oh man the headlines that exist from the past worrying about people reading <i>newspapers</i> on <i>trains</i> and how it will be the end of civilization. Heck if you go back to the 1800s, we were worried that <i>novels</i> would make people unable to tell facts from fiction [1].<p>&gt;It&#x27;s possible we&#x27;re not going to adapt well to this e-world<p>There are very few things humans have ever created that humans are unable to adapt to (and pretty much all of those things are weapons). That&#x27;s the other side of the unique thing that makes us human: things are constantly changing, and we are constantly adapting to the changes.<p>For as long as humans have lived, we&#x27;ve tried to distract ourselves from the banality of life. Some part of the population goes down a rabbit hole and stays lost and unproductive: that&#x27;s not new. The majority of people are mildly productive and then turn to distractions when work is over. And another small group shuns distractions in order to stay as productive as possible for as long as possible. This bell curve has existed through all of human history.<p>The people who get addicted to apps and social media and phones are the same people who were addicted to novels in the 1800s and comics in the 1930s and TV in the 1950s and video games in the 1990s. Even infinite scrolling isn&#x27;t new... libraries have existed for a long time, TV just keeps playing forever and ever, and there are more video games than you can play in a lifetime.<p>When cars and trains were new, people were questioning if evolved apes could survive speeds faster than 30mph. We are not just evolved apes; our specific evolutionary advantage is the ability to adapt, overcome, and get bored even when presented with unlimited stimulation.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;09&#x2F;14&#x2F;when-novels-were-bad-for-you&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;09&#x2F;14&#x2F;when-novels-wer...</a>')
