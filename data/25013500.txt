I&#x27;ve taken it from NYC to Baltimore (5 or so times that trip), Columbus, and somewhere I forget in NJ. The buses are never dirty, never had an issue with passengers, there are usually outlets to use, and there&#x27;s free wifi albeit with some services like video streaming blocked. I always found it a good value for the price and it remains my go-to bus service. Maybe crazy things just happen on busses sometimes, Greyhound picked up some cultural momentum for being associated with this through coincidence or more people using it than competitors, and there are 1000 people who had a good ride and didn&#x27;t post about it for every 1 person with a weird story.')
