I want to advance in my field as much as possible, but I&#x27;m a technical person. I don&#x27;t want to manage teams or sit in boring corporate meetings, which is what I see around as my peers advance.<p>I want to earn as much as possible while tackling more and more exciting technical problems.<p>What positions should strive for in 5, 10, 20 years?
