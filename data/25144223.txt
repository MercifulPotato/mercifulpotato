The only way it can flourish is censored away into manipulative misdirection and secretive groups.<p>This is repeated so much it is practically a meme at this point, but is there anything to actually back it up?  Especially when users have the ability to control what they see.  If someone is in a bubble of disinformation, it doesn&#x27;t matter how many voices outside the bubble try to debunk those claims.<p>It seems like a more effective approach would to be to work on preventative measures so people are never exposed to these harmful beliefs rather than wait until these beliefs are heard and then try to convince them they are wrong.')
