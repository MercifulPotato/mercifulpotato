All you have to do is configure your webserver to only redirect port 80 requests to port 443 if the request includes the &quot;Upgrade-Insecure-Requests&quot; header. Obviously since headers are sent unencrypted this means attackers could easily bypass it, but it&#x27;s still suitable for personal webpages with no user data. For example, here&#x27;s how you do it in Apache:<p>RewriteEngine on<p>RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade-Insecure-Requests} =1<p>RewriteRule ^ <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI}" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI}</a> [END,NE,R=permanent]')
