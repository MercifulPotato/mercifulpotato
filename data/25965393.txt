You&#x27;ve done a great job with the website. I wouldn&#x27;t be that interested about the articles and twitch streams in the main page. Instead, I would prefer to see some candle-stick graphs and more technical data about the top stocks. The bubble chart(?) of options positions on each stock&#x27;s page looks amazing. It would also be really cool if clicking on a bubble would take me to the comments about that. Overall, very cool idea and nice implementation. I&#x27;ll certainly check it regularly.')
