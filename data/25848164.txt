Memory corruption is insidious, so I rushed to the internet to buy new DIMMs, opened the sucker up...and there&#x27;s no DIMM. The RAM is just soldered into the motherboard. No upgrade, no fix. This is now a pile of unreliable junk that randomly flips bits in memory. So data evac commences, with MD5 hashes and double, trip-checking everything.<p>A reminder that not only software bitrots, but hardware too. Make sure not to buy a Stinkpad (or any hardware) with non-replaceable parts!<p>(and I just bought an M1 Macbook Pro...)')
