The actual processes used are crazier than that.<p>For a reference point, just look up how the light source for the EUV steppers work. [0] tl;dr: They are melting tin, dripping the molten tin in droplets of carefully controlled size, shooting those droplets into a vacuum chamber at 70m&#x2F;s, and then hitting them simultaneously with so many lasers that they are instantly ionized and then emit radiation of the desired wavelength. And they are using this Rube Goldberg-esque contraption as a glorified light bulb. Everything is like that.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osa-opn.org&#x2F;home&#x2F;articles&#x2F;volume_29&#x2F;march_2018&#x2F;features&#x2F;euv_light_sources_for_next-gen_lithography&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osa-opn.org&#x2F;home&#x2F;articles&#x2F;volume_29&#x2F;march_2018&#x2F;f...</a>')
