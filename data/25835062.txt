Overall I&#x27;m liking it, but I&#x27;ve found a couple things frustrating: 1) the docs and online issues&#x2F;answers are a bit of a mess, partly because many of the accepted answers are from pre-1.0 days; 2) the error messages I&#x27;ve found are long and not very helpful. It takes much longer to track down a bug in Julia than Python code.')
