The best bit is simply a decent judiciary, but that was mostly copied from the British. And even that is more poorly executed than elsewhere, due to the political nature of judicial appointees, and esp. due to the tradition of direct elections of some judges. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s arguably worse than the British model it was copied from, not because the Brits were psychic geniuses, but because of the not entirely unrelated fact that the UK model is much more open to reform; it&#x27;s aged better because it&#x27;s less crufty. When lead by a dangerously populist government that might be risk, of course, but so far even populists have turned out not to do too much consitutional harm - might differ in the future.<p>That risk has been realized.  Aren&#x27;t the parliamentary governments of Hungary and Poland falling into &quot;democratic&quot; authoritarianism?<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure the US system was mainly designed to prevent that kind of thing, and put up democratically-derived barriers against it.  The Trump presidency would have been <i>way</i> worse without them.  Trump has been very effective at keeping his party in line behind him (even to the anti-democratic extremes).  The things you complain about are mainly tradeoffs of that design.')
