You say:<p><i>&gt; at some point the code has to go from dev code to production code. If you&#x27;re managing dev and production in different ways, then you&#x27;re going to have to spend significant time &quot;productionising&quot; your dev code</i><p>This is true, but as I understand the article we are talking about, it wasn&#x27;t talking about a dev workstation and a production server for the same project or application. I can see how it could make sense to have those running on the same machine (but probably in containers).\nHowever, the article was talking about a dev workstation and a home server which had nothing to do with developing code, but was for things like the author&#x27;s personal email and web server. Trying to run those on the same machine was what caused the problems.')
