Therefore not incentivizing water intensive, methane producing products, AND as a bonus further limiting the destruction of Amazonian ecosystems sounds like a great way to attack it to me?<p>I remember a great story from a Macdonalds executive in a reddit AMA, who mentioned they had a pilot for a burger recipe which included grilled aubergine. The pilot was really successful and they had great feedback in tasting sessions but then they ran the numbers and quickly realize there wasn&#x27;t enough world production of aubergine to role out the new burgers in their target markets. That story although funny really gives an insight into the scale and volume of Macdonalds as a business and their non-negligible impact on the world food market.<p>For me most of Macdonalds taste is in the seasoning&#x2F;sauces, if they can make a passable smokey flavoured bean&#x2F;soya patty and suddenly have a ground breaking ecologic impact without even hitting their bottom line, I say more power to them.')
