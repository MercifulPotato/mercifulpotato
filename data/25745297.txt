Item(by='louthy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610449961, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25744913, text='&gt; If you think this is about Trump&#x27;s freedom to tweet, you&#x27;ve sorely missed the point<p>I really haven&#x27;t.  Trump is the only western leader to have been banned from the mainstream social media platforms.  You can&#x27;t claim this is the thin end of the wedge, this is a reaction [by those platforms] to the risks to western democracy in its entirety.  They gave him four years of rope to hang himself with, it was only a direct attack on democracy itself that caused this action.<p>&gt; If a handful of corporations with mostly homogeneous ideologies control who is allowed to talk to the public, then we don&#x27;t have any real choice when it comes time to vote.<p>Trump has all the means of communication that any previous president has had.  All he has to do is stand at a lectern and talk and it will be broadcast on national television.<p>Again, he wouldn&#x27;t have lost the access that he had if he hadn&#x27;t tried to directly attack the entire system of democracy itself.  All the other lies he&#x27;s told over the years were allowed to be seen.<p>&gt; corporate dictatorship<p>That&#x27;s a laughable leap, sorry.  If he hadn&#x27;t incited a violent insurrection, and if he wasn&#x27;t a few days away from the end of his tenure then we wouldn&#x27;t be having this conversation.<p>Let me put this another way.  Do you think everybody, no matter what harms they cause, deserve a voice on all platforms?  Would you expect Twitter to host the voice of Hitler?<p>Ultimately, they are private companies, they have no obligation to balance, fairness, access.  It seems the state forcing corporations to do their bidding would be far more of a slippery slope than the president, who has tried to actually destroy democratic process, being banned from a platform.')
