Why are those more competitive than the rest? There are factors like differential productivity gains due to globalization, technology, etc but I&#x27;m not convinced. Especially when one takes Baumol&#x27;s cost disease into account. There was a change in during the 1970s, but I don&#x27;t believe globalism was it.<p>The surprising thing about the current era is just how little wealth is inherited and how much has been largely generated during the owner&#x27;s lifetime, in many cases due to labor and receiving compensation in the form of stock. The vast inheritances we read about from the 19th century aren&#x27;t there this time, barring a few exceptions. Thomas Piketty wrote about this in Capital.')
