If I get assigned then I just buy back my position anyway, a little loss of profit, but most of the time these calls are expiring worthless and I keep the premiums. Could probably make more money getting calls closer to the money, but I don&#x27;t want the hassle really.<p>It&#x27;s amazing that people will consistently pay me money for the chance to buy my stocks at the end of the week.')
