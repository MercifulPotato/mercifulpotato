Item(by='rhn_mk1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604046918, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24940026, text='Laws applying generally differ from your licensing choices in that laws affect everyone, and your license only apply to those who explicitly want to obey them.<p>Therefore, laws will inevitably end up not matching somoene&#x27;s ethics, while it&#x27;s entirely up to you whether you allow others to do things you consider unethical with your software.<p>So if you do indeed not forbid others from using your software in a way you don&#x27;t like, you don&#x27;t have anything to complain about: it was your choice.<p>* * *<p>Separately, I&#x27;m not certain about the distinction between law and morality. Law is a set of rules of what things shall and shall not be done, being a code of moral rules in this sense. This is also what we use it for: we as societies generally use law to express our ethical stance on murder and violence, for example, but also theft, the permission to take drugs and drink alcohol, to go out at night.<p>In this case, it&#x27;s beneficial to my conscience if the law is a codification of my own morality. But the author claims that they make a distinction: there are ethical rules that should not be codified.<p>Wwere does the line go? I can understand justifying that position by saying that people with different moral codes would riot, making it impractical to forbid what I see as immoral.<p>I ask this question because that was not explained, and is the justification for preferring to abolish copyright rather than instill the 4 rules, even though the author seems to agree with both, and both are just as impractical to implement at this time (would make people riot).')
