Goods got scanned when unloaded from truck, and of course the register.<p>One day a customer complained we had no more washing powder of the most popular brand. Boss came, said they just got some the previous day, checked the inventory system and saw there should be three &quot;trays&quot; left, each with 12x packs of 1.2kg. He went to check the back, nothing there.<p>After a bit more searching he had a hunch, and checked the cameras. Sure enough, someone had loaded the three trays into a duffel bag earlier that morning and walked right out.<p>So yeah, even with all the normal human elements in the logistical chain, kinda hard to keep track of blatant theft.')
