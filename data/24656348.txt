Their pay should be tied to their performance otherwise Mozilla looks like they&#x27;re being run by fat cats exploiting a sinking ship which IMO is hurting their brand as a pure non-profit organization worth rallying behind.<p>The only way Mozilla is going to remain relevant is through better products which are only going to be created by a highly talented technical team, laying them off whilst paying the people more who laid them off &amp; led FF&#x27;s multi-year downturn isn&#x27;t going to reverse their trajectory.<p>I&#x27;d prefer more messaging around a renewed focus + leadership team before any PR marketing campaigns.')
