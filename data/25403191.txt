Item(by='davidivadavid', descendants=None, kids=[25403217], score=None, time=1607819773, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25383946, text='It&#x27;s surprising to me how most of those think-pieces about technology invariably oscillate between naive technological neutrality and extreme technological determinism.<p>Isn&#x27;t it far more likely that technology is neither of those things?<p>Technology is a means to an end.<p>The trouble comes when that end isn&#x27;t made explicit. For all the talk about SV people being &quot;visionaries&quot;, very few of them seem to articulate what their ideal world looks like, and what part the technology they&#x27;re building plays in it.<p>Talking about technology as being &quot;neutral&quot; is nothing more than lazy complacency in the face of the hardness of actually coming up with a compelling vision to sell people and reveal their preferences for possible worlds we could live in.<p>Instead of going through that step, technologists are happy enough to settle on vaguely defined &quot;needs&quot; and &quot;problems&quot; that society has, without considering what matters, which is <i>which</i> needs and problems you <i>prioritize</i>. Human needs are almost endless, but prioritizing different needs results in completely different global outcomes.<p>That&#x27;s also perfectly fine, provided that you&#x27;re explicit about what outcomes you&#x27;re aiming for, and you&#x27;ve worked out n-th order effects of those outcomes.<p>Technological determinism is another cop out that allows technologists to never be held accountable for the world they&#x27;ve helped build with the products they&#x27;ve created.<p>It&#x27;s technology itself that is determined by conflicting visions. There isn&#x27;t <i>one</i> &quot;Technium&quot;, there&#x27;s a whole ecosystem of technological systems resulting from different cultures, visions, teleologies interacting in complex ways.<p>It seems like Kelly is confusing path dependence for determinism. Sure, some technological paths (plural) lead to logical sequences of technologies being developed. Doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s only one path.<p>P.S. Kinda rambling, posting for discussion more than anything else.')
