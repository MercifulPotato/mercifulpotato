Item(by='tzs', descendants=None, kids=[25220833], score=None, time=1606402563, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25217979, text='The article says that Route 53 uses randomly generated name server names, so if at your registrar you are pointing your domain to Route 53 name servers, and then you remove the records for your domain at Route 53 but leave the record at your registrar pointing to Route 53, it is unlikely that another Route 53 customer could add your domain and get your traffic. Their randomly generated Route 53 name server names would probably not match yours.<p>I wonder how effective that actually is? As far as I know there is nothing in the DNS protocol like the &quot;Host&quot; header of HTTP that allows the name server to tell what name the client knows the name server by. Two differently named name servers will actually be distinct only if they have different IP addresses.<p>The question then is how many IP addresses does Route 53 have for name servers?<p>Ideally, you&#x27;d want to have a separate IP address for each customer&#x27;s name server. Do any of the big hosting companies do that?<p>I&#x27;d expect that they could do it without needing a lot of extra IP addresses by giving each customer who has a static IP address for the hosts an option to have traffic to port 53 of that IP address transparently sent to the hosting provider&#x27;s name servers along with tagging to let the name servers identify what IP address it was for so it can serve the right name data.<p>That would allow each customer to have as many apparently dedicated name servers as they have hosts with static IP addresses.')
