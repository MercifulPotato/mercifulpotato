Are you looking to make a technology decision for a product, or are you looking for one to learn to help you get a job?<p>If you&#x27;re looking for a job, AWS has the largest market share (33%), followed by Azure (19%), and GCP (9%).<p>If you&#x27;re looking for a place to host your product, you probably can&#x27;t go wrong with either of the three, but there are some minor considerations...<p>Personally, I would consider GCP a little more risky long term. There was a report last year about Google considering existing the cloud business and setting a goal to be a top two player by 2023. Since this seems unlikely, what then? Google has some anti-trust concerns, but the bigger anti-trust concern is probably Amazon. There is a non-zero chance that AWS gets split out from Amazon at some point.<p>Finally, I don&#x27;t really know GCP that well, but it&#x27;s my understanding it&#x27;s a little easier to manage for smaller teams. I believe AWS is considered IAAS while GCP is more PAAS (although the lines get blurred depending on product). In my experience, for companies using AWS... having a DevOps team that smooths over the rough edges of AWS and provides tooling on top of AWS warts has been a requirement.<p>I have no experience with Azure, but I can&#x27;t see Google out performing Microsoft in any world as long as MSFT has .NET stack.')
