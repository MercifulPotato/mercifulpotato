You can mitigate this by using OCR but it still isn&#x27;t perfect and has a high chance of messing up tables or any special text placement.<p>Some fancy combination of encodings (e.g. using JBIG2 except for images) can probably help with the filesize.<p>---------<p>The best way to handle sensitive information is probably to use codenames (for people, places, etc) so you can share the original documents without worrying so much.')
