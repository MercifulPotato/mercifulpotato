The outage today, which what was being written about in the article, was caused by the OCSP.APPLE.COM service not responding. The OCSP service was likely being used to validate if an Apple Developer certificate was still valid.<p>Operating a &quot;trusted&quot; Certificate Authority generally requires operating under some rules. For example, the &quot;Certification Authority Browser Forum&quot; requires operating a CRLs (now considered bad) or a live OCSP endpoint.<p>Let&#x27;s Encrypt does this, as does every other certificate issuer.<p>As is being discussed, separate OCSP is bad from a privacy standpoint - if a check of OCSP is being made, it gives telemetry on if you are trying to validate a certificate. If you can see the traffic it does reveal the certificate being checked.<p>FWIW, there is an OCSP Stapling method of attaching &quot;recent&quot; OCSP responses inside of TLS requests so that a TLS client doesn&#x27;t have to make a separate request to an OCSP service.')
