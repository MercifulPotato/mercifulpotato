The common tech wisdom is they’re as vital as they’ve ever been, but have shifted their focus to mostly enterprise or b2b products (that normal people don’t know or care about)<p>That is completely true of course, but people said the same thing about IBM too. The rebuttal is always something like “but Azure” and yet they’re undeniably not the primary leader or innovator in the public cloud space. Most of their products are that way, outside of Office and Exchange and AD. Microsoft has gone from leading, to skating where the puck once was, and that isn’t a good sign imo')
