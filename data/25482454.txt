I suspect it&#x27;s probably not the best solution for each of those individually, and I&#x27;m definitely curious what other options are out there, but it&#x27;s quite a convenient drop-in replacement for a lot of Google&#x27;s cloud offerings for people who are looking for alternatives. Also I should note I don&#x27;t actually ever use the nextcloud UI itself, I don&#x27;t disagree it can feel a bit clunky sometimes. I use 3rd party clients and use my personal cloud to sync everything via webDAV and cardDAV.')
