I hope I wasn&#x27;t misunderstood.<p>I&#x27;ve used Consul, Vault, Vagrant and Terraform so far and all of them are worth the time investment (Nomad is on the todo-list but for personal reasons I cannot play with it right now).<p>It&#x27;d be great if Hashicorp used less marketing bs and provided a clearer description... At first I glanced the Vault description, didn&#x27;t really understand what it was supposed to do and walked away thinking &quot;I probably don&#x27;t need it&quot;. Which is bad because once I started using it I really loved it.')
