And this is part of the problem--that they censor communications between willing participants.<p>We wouldn&#x27;t stand for this with the phone companies and we shouldn&#x27;t for any other oligarch-controlled monopoly entities.<p>The larger a share of the world audience a platform owns, the less it should be able to censor.<p>Otherwise, one of these days, someone you don&#x27;t approve of will get power over these companies and then it will be too late to regret it.<p>I don&#x27;t like the proverbial nazis on the front lawn, but when your &#x27;front lawn&#x27; is the entire country, and it&#x27;s less literal nazis and more &#x27;people who get accused of being witches&#x27;, it&#x27;s harder to support.<p>With great power should come great responsibility.  I don&#x27;t think we should hand over control of everyone&#x27;s speech to a cartel of billionaires.')
