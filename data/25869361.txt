Like calling this &quot;rust for windows&quot; makes it sound somewhat grandiose, and maybe as if Rust is somehow endorsing or expanding support for Windows, when it appears to be just a crate which auto-generates wrappers for windows API&#x27;s.<p>The same applies to &quot;Windows Subsystem for Linux&quot; - maybe I&#x27;m alone but to me this sounds more like Linux was getting a bit windows embedded inside it rather than the other way around.<p>Also I find it a bit arrogant that VSCode wants to name-squat the very general term &quot;code&quot; in my PATH.  vscode is already quite short and clear, and would have made a perfectly suitable cli name.')
