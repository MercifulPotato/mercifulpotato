I think there are lots of things that can incrementally increase your longevity.   Don&#x27;t smoke, don&#x27;t drink too much, don&#x27;t abuse drugs, eat food (not too much, mostly plants), watch your weight, exercise your body, exercise your mind, have sanguine outlook on life, love and be loved, etc.  None are silver bullets, but taken together they probably significantly increase your chances to get to 90.
