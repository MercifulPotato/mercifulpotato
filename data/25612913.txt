There might be a tax for this, but there might well be some exemption, especially if Person A is willing to wait a while before...<p>Person A wants to sell Person B the castle. Instead they sell HoldCorp. The castle never changed ownership, and no tax is paid.<p>Later person C wants to buy the castle. They now buy HoldCorp from person B. The castle still didn&#x27;t change owners and no tax is paid.<p>If jurisdiction X tweaks their law you might need to tweak your procedure slightly. Maybe Person A must stay as non-beneficial owner for 5 years after the sale, or maybe you must use a two lawyer shell corporation in Bermuda to properly insulate HoldCorp from the taxes. A lawyer will sort this out for far less than the taxes, all of which goes in their pocket and isn&#x27;t used on government services for ghastly poor people.')
