Like bubble popping material?<p>I mean, they can&#x27;t do what P&amp;G, Unilever, Mars, and many other umbrella brands did. It&#x27;s just impossible, and the reason is simple: they can&#x27;t have the share of voice and share of shelf these companies had, and that allowed them to be what they were.<p>They didn&#x27;t just had a big portfolio of brands, they were literal bullies that left no room for competition, and they had built brands so strong - through buying millions upon millions of GRPs, through years, in a time where TV was the king of mass media - that they pushed their weight on retailers and won a lot of share of shelf (literally saturated shelves).<p>The times have changed, this doesn&#x27;t work anymore. Now brands are more diluted, it&#x27;s mainly built on small niches, consumers attention is extremely fragmented so you can&#x27;t monopolize media space, and the weight lays on Amazon and retailers, not the other way around...')
