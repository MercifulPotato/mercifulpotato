Give everyone 1 week to comply.<p>* Make a government address to send coins to for disposal, and publish a form to fill in to say you have disposed of your holdings.<p>* Contact everyone in your log telling they need to fill in the form (even to declare they no longer have any holdings).<p>* After the deadline, arrest anyone who has not filled in the form or who declares zero holdings and subsequently visits exchanges etc.<p>* Sure, this method will miss some who carefully use tor.  But that&#x27;s a tiny minority.\n*')
