This lowers the initial cost, but increases the additional cost for each platform as less of the previous implementation can be reused. This leads to thinks like the discarding Vulkan because it&#x27;s somewhat harder than Metal for the macOS port and then having to still do the Vulkan work for Linux which may cost too much for the expected Linux sales even thoug the the difference between Metal and Vulkan might have easily been covered by the Linux income.')
