By definition that means without limits. To then put limits is to make the plan limited. Instead of doing thesemental gymnastics to defend Google might I suggest that the people storing petabytes of data are taking advantage of Google&#x27;s goodwill but not doing anything inherently wrong. That being said Google calling the people who use petabytes abusive is hypocritical, and wrong. Google wants a certain type of user that overpays for &quot;unlimited&quot; and uses a pittance. Instead Google found that they advertised themselves into a pickle and are trying to blame people using the service as advertised.<p>Google can either advertise unlimited and live with the costs or advertise what they&#x27;re actually willing to provide. Users using a service within the advertised constraints is not abuse.')
