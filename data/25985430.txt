The term is &quot;short sell&quot; because the borrowed shares are sold to someone else. The new buyer is also long.<p>Long interest is always greater than short interest for this reason. This is why short interest can be greater than 100%.<p>The facts didn&#x27;t really matter in this pump, though. The running joke on Reddit was that no one was reading the &quot;DD&quot; anyway, just hopping on the bandwagon.')
