Also how do you think these algorithms became popular in the first place? If implimenting an algorithm around SIMD didn&#x27;t give proper performance then they wouldn&#x27;t exist.<p>You have to understand that current software exists because it solved a goal. If you have to first have your algorithm implimented in hardware then nobody can make anything. Without SIMD these projects simply wouldn&#x27;t be able to exist. That&#x27;s the hard math of it.')
