Back in 2005 or so I converted my entire CD collection to digital, and managed it happily using Itunes.  Somehow in the transition from itunes to Apple Music, Apple refused to recognize any of the tracks I created from my own, legally purchased media.<p>My wife currently has no way to listen to any of the music we legally own, using her iphone. So guess whose next phone is going to be Android, with an SD card containing 1TB of music we own?  The other advantages of iphone are not important to me, and the apps she uses are available on the playstore. For bonus points I can buy her a pretty decent Android phone for a few hundred bucks, instead of a new device costing well over a thousand.<p>I understand Apple wants to push everyone to monthly paid services.  As a customer, I DO NOT want yet another $10&#x2F;month expenses - I&#x27;ve got a lot of those already.  I just want to listen to music I already own.')
