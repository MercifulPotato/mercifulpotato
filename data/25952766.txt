Not probable!<p>gdp growth =&#x2F;= energy consumption growth<p>Also 1.03^1000 = 6.8<i>10^12, but wolframalpha says the number of stars in the milky way is 3</i>10^11. Considering that we&#x27;re nowhere close to capturing even 1% of the energy output of energy that reaches the earth, let alone all the energy that the sun emits, your estimate of 1000 years is probably off by a few orders of magnitude. Finally, if we&#x27;re actually capturing all the energy of the milky way, presumably we&#x27;d be a space faring civilization and can therefore colonize other galaxies, making that a non-issue.')
