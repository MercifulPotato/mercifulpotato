Overall cannabis use has not increased after legalization.  The same amount of money is being spent now as before.  Yes, there is a slight tax income, but the reality is that people are getting it from the same people they used to.  Everyone buys from friends and family just as before.  So the government, and all those investors, are not seeing the predicted profits.')
