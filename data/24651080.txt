I cannot afford to renew all my devices every few years, nor do I want too.  Just looking around my room now, I probably have several thousand dollars worth of SDR dongles, battery packs, wifi adapters, raspberry bits and external drives for various projects.  They are all on the old connectors&#x2F;standards but work perfectly well.  I have no intention of tossing everything because there is a new cable standard with go-faster stripes.')
