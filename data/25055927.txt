However, if you look at like a cell phone maybe it makes more sense.  No one has ever complained that you couldn&#x27;t update the RAM or the CPU in a iPhone.  In order to upgrade the hardware of your cell phone you have to purchase another one.  I&#x27;m guessing Apple is looking at the Mac hardware in the same light.  &quot;Want more power?  Buy a new laptop!&quot;<p>The more interesting question is how does this affect the Mac desktops?  It would be a shame to throw out a whole Mac Pro machine just because it only has 64GB RAM.  Then again, this event did release the Mac Mini, which is a desktop and does not have upgradable RAM or storage or CPU.  Hmmmm...')
