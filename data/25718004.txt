I didn&#x27;t like the premiums (and almost inevitable decay) though. I went with shorter term puts on companies that would be unlikely to survive another downturn (after they came back up from the initial crash, like NCLH). Then for the case of possible inflation I bought LEAPS on stuff like MSFT and platinum ETFs (physical and miners&#x2F;refiners) since platinum has tended to go up when industry does, but is atleast a commodity that hasn&#x27;t already exploded like gold did. I&#x27;ve also been buying some utilities since they should be less affected in specific situations. And of course a healthy dose of more speculative stuff and swing trades.')
