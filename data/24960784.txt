Much more likely is that your buddy does you the favor for free because you&#x27;re friends, because he trusts you to deliver because you have a relationship, and because it&#x27;s not his money anyways.<p>Also, what exactly is fishy with Pivotal&#x2F;Accenture? I mean they&#x27;re services firms which is why their multiplier is relatively low but not sure what exactly is fishy?')
