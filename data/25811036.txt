I apologize if my comment came out curt. I know how that feels. However, I think you should reconsider your opinions on Yubikey. They’re significantly better than all other commercially available security solutions at the moment.<p>Edit: your comment also gave me an idea. Perhaps there should be a phone-based service that you can dial that locks out your account for a predetermined time period? Or it could even be tied to someone else that you can trust.')
