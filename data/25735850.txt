I&#x27;ve been trying to get family onto it and away from WhatsApp for years, and we finally tried this week.<p>Unfortunately, my messages to the family group are stuck spinning (24 hours now) and I&#x27;m not seeing any new messages in the group (and should be). Nightmare.<p>If anyone knows a fix I&#x27;d love to hear it (have tried leaving the group and rejoining, restarting phone etc)')
