I got an iPhone when they first came out in Canada. They guy who sold it convinced me to change my plan to include video messages. When I got home I realized the phone didnâ€™t have the ability to take videos. Those who are unaware there just was no video app when the phone first came out as crazy as that sounds. I started searching how to take a video and to my surprise you can not unless you happen to jailbreak it and use the camera app on cydia. From that point on I saw the benefit of jailbreaking. I am considering jailbreaking again after my device suddenly became blocked from tinder I am a gentleman and not sure why I was banned but it annoyed me and one day will probably jailbreak again just to bypass the ban. I think if the iphones ever fully locked down I would try a different brand.')
