Item(by='YeGoblynQueenne', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605443931, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25098921, text='It&#x27;s not too late, no, but can I ask- why are you intersted in a data scientist role? Is that the only, or best way to &quot;get out of the lab&quot; given your background?<p>Because I must confess that I don&#x27;t see the immediate connection between an MSc and PhD in agriculture and a (assumingly generic) data scientist job. You should be perfectly capable of performing data science tasks in an agriculture context, but it seems to me you are asking for something different, a &quot;pivot&quot;.<p>At the risk of sounding rude (for which I apologise in advance) are you asking simply whether there&#x27;s still space on the current bandwagon? If so, I must advise you against it, because employment bandwagons are awful things to get on. Crodwed, badly paid, poorly understood, not that useful, scarcely productive- in short, short-term and not very fullfilling.<p>Is it just a matter of making lots and lots of money with the skills you clearly have and that you must have worked hard to acquire? Well then, there should be much, much better placements for you, outside the lab, in the sector you studied about.<p>My concern is that seeking to jump on the data science bandwagon right now will only flood industry with more and more semi-skilled, half-baked professionals, who don&#x27;t really understand and don&#x27;t really care to understand their subject matter, similar to what has happened with software development. The world is full of bad devs who are &quot;passionate about javascript&quot; or something like that and who are struggling to promote their personal brand because they have no other skills than the promotion of their personal brand. Don&#x27;t allow yourself to fall that low.<p>Edit: in the interest of full discolosure, I&#x27;m a CS graduate with an MSc in data science and studying for a PhD in AI, but I&#x27;m not looking for data scientist jobs and am not interested in them, because I find them boring, unproductive and unfullfilling. I have actually worked as a (freelance) data scientist for a while.')
