Both narratives support the idea that shipworms were most likely carried from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. The question is how early the Canal of the Pharaohs was operational. The shipworms may actual help set this date.<p>I wonder if a Phoenician equivalent of the Roman&#x2F;Byzantine <i>Periplus of the Erythraean Sea</i> existed in Carthage and was lost after the Third Punic War.')
