Up is more common since you only need significant equipment on one side and access requirements mean that keeping the bulk of it &#x27;down&#x27; is easier. No polishing is necessary. However, I recall reading that some polymers can be polished if you want, but IIRC it depends heavily on the  polymer, the abrasive, intermediate fluids in use and result desired. Re: Source, I raided libgen for <i>thermoforming</i> over the last few months, visited about 10 equipment factories and studied their mechanisms and control systems, but actually learned this tidbit from <i>1000 Australian Inventions</i> or some such book which I bought for my daughter before our family returned to China... to keep inventing ;)')
