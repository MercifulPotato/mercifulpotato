Try sshfs (fs over ssh) and see what I mean. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I use and like sshfs for a quick data transfer, but it&#x27;s just not good enough to run your application with.<p>For a stable POSIX filesystem in production latency is key. Often times in a datacenter 10GE is recommended for network storage solutions, not because of bandwidth (which is also important), but for the 10x reduced latency of a 10GE NIC. Most applications simply expect response times of microseconds or a few milliseconds at most from a POSIX Filesystem, they simply cannot run (without modifying the codebase) on something much slower.<p>But if you had to rewrite your application anyways, then you might want to use plain S3 without the FS, that is easier to operate in the long run.')
