Are there many other unions like it?<p>IIRC, there are in the movie industry.  I think writers, directors, etc. all have their own unions.  Also given the nature of construction jobs, I&#x27;d be curious how construction trade unions compare.<p>Different companies in different industries can have quite different structures and cultures (e.g. McDonald&#x27;s vs GM vs Google).  The instantiated example of McDonald&#x27;s didn&#x27;t mean future companies had to be like it, and I see no reason why the instantiated example of the UAW means that another type of union structure&#x2F;culture can&#x27;t be created for another set of circumstances.')
