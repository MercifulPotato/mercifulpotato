I&#x27;m not talking about &quot;too shy to buy groceries&quot;. ASD should be prevented medically. That is not to say people with ASD aren&#x27;t often amazing people or that their lives aren&#x27;t worth it, but minimizing the rate at which ASD occurs will mean far fewer people will suffer in the future from something that is (hopefully) preventable.')
