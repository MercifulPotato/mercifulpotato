I am as amused by the clever ways to get youtube-dl back onto GitHub as anyone else, but it&#x27;s protesting the wrong thing in the wrong place.<p>The problem lies with whichever member organizations inside the RIAA (or nonmember orgs friendly with the RIAA) convinced them to file the takedown.  Most of us aren&#x27;t positioned to find that out, but that&#x27;s where the most can be gained.  Maybe the EFF or similar orgs can help.  Then we&#x27;ll know what the true motives were, and how to address them.')
