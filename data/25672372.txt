I&#x27;m more than happy to pay for an eGPU dock (have one sitting in the corner from when my main workstation was a macbook).  I know not everyone wants to HAVE to pay for an eGPU, but that&#x27;s a better solution than &quot;You can&#x27;t have two monitors&quot;.<p>My solution was to dump Apple laptops entirely (which I know a lot of people won&#x27;t want to do).  This Asus G14 has no issues powering 2x 4K displays without even breathing hard.  No throttling in games or videos, and it supports 40GB of memory on top of a replaceable NVMe SSD.')
