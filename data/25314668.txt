Or sleep on a friend&#x27;s couch. Or get gifted a few hundred bucks from a loved one to tide them over. Or move in with a partner when otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t have.<p>But there will always be some people who don&#x27;t have any social connections left to spend - if your parents have died, or were abusive, or you&#x27;re a first generation immigrant, moving back in with them might not be an option. Maybe you&#x27;ve had $300 from grandpa several times before, and lost it to your gambling addiction. Maybe you&#x27;ve stayed with your sister before and scared them with your untreated mental illness.<p>None of which is common - but if a million people are struggling to make rent it&#x27;s a simple numbers game: <i>some</i> of them won&#x27;t have any social connections to fall back on.')
