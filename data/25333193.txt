A good analogy (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;johnhcochrane.blogspot.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;free-solo-and-economic-growth.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;johnhcochrane.blogspot.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;free-solo-and-eco...</a>) is with rock climbing. The rock climbers today are not much fitter or physically superior to climbers 100 years ago. At best there are minor improvements in shoes, but that&#x27;s it. What allows someone to free solo El Capitan in 4 hours was standing on the shoulders of giants who had discovered and disseminated climbing techniques in the last century.<p>This effect is even more pronounced with software, because of how easy it is to reuse others&#x27; work. I don&#x27;t need to learn from the collective experience of Linus Torvalds and other kernel developers, I just use Linux. I don&#x27;t need to understand the intricacies of text rendering (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gankra.github.io&#x2F;blah&#x2F;text-hates-you&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gankra.github.io&#x2F;blah&#x2F;text-hates-you&#x2F;</a>) or compiling or the universe of hardware. I can still add economic value with my software while standing on the shoulders of these giants. I can gain knowledge from all the great documentation out there, as well as helpful Q&amp;A websites. Imagine how many projects would have been abandoned and economic value lost without knowledge being disseminated on StackOverflow.<p><i>That</i> is the productivity gain of the last few decades. If someone can&#x27;t see that, or wants to condescend about the lowering of standards, they&#x27;re missing the point.')
