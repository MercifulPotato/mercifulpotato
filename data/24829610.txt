If you mean specifically &quot;the firehose&quot; of the public Twitter feed, the Federated Timeline of an instance is generally pretty close firehose of its own (it shows every public toot known to the instance from all the servers it &quot;sees&quot;), depending on instance size you join. Join a large instance and the Local and Federated Timelines both can give you a Twitter-like &quot;firehose&quot;. Some of the crazier, larger instances even have bots trying to follow every public account on every server they can find to make their Federated Timeline &quot;as complete as possible&quot;. I don&#x27;t personally recommend joining an instance like that I don&#x27;t really see a point in that, but such servers exist.')
