I realized that for many people, &quot;flag&quot; may not be understandable, even when the text is in red. I thought maybe using &quot;report&quot; instead, or some kind of icon?<p>What else is out there? Facebook uses &quot;Get Help&quot;, iirc. Reddit&#x27;s says &quot;report&quot;.<p>My process after pressing the button is much better (no mandatory forms to fill out), but I want the user to know the button is there in the first place.<p>Also, where is the best place to put it? Top right corner? With all the other actions, at the bottom? Near the title?<p>Accidental clicks are a much lower concern than under-reporting of problem posts.')
