Instead of setting quarterly goals or using OKRs, we move towards a single north star: maximizing how much money creators earn. It’s simple and measurable, allowing anyone in the company to do the math on how much a feature or bug-fix might be worth.<p>Quite frankly, this doesn&#x27;t seem sustainable. There&#x27;s only so much high-visibility&#x2F;high-value work. When your headcount is large relative to &quot;desirable&quot; work, people will compete for the &quot;desirable&quot; work. They will lie about the 60 hours of work they did last week, and tell you that it&#x27;s the culturally-normative 20 hours of work, because it makes them look like 3x engineers.<p>&gt; expecting responses within 24 hours... we can compete–and win–on flexibility<p>Including in SRE &#x2F; ops roles, where people need to be on-call?<p>Let&#x27;s be clear about something here. You have a headcount of 25, and ostensibly nobody is full-time. It&#x27;s certainly possible to avoid internal competition at that size, with the right culture.

How large can the kibbutz grow before the workers&#x27; paradise is no longer so sunny?')
