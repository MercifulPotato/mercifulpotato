I was actually discussing this earlier.<p>The economy has been shit for middle class Americans for quite a while. Rent and home prices have been increasing far faster than wages. Furthermore, lots more nickel and diming has led to more debt and misery for the average middle american. The situation is even worse for people lower than that. However, especially for lower middle class white Americans, they aren&#x27;t too far removed from a time when that was enough to have an OK life. So they remember or have heard about it. And they are unhappy.<p>And for a while we were working on fixing that unhappiness. But then some people came along and said something different. They said that those other people over there are the reason for your unhappiness. If it weren&#x27;t for them things would be better. They are your enemy. And they&#x27;ve been doing this for decades now.<p>And things were getting more tense. Then (probably with a little outside help) someone else came along and really encouraged ramping up that anger. And said all the right things. And said if we just take over, we&#x27;ll be able to make it right this time. And so many people believed this that they didn&#x27;t really stop what that actually meant.<p>This may seem like I&#x27;m just BSing here, but I&#x27;m not. It&#x27;s the same technique used by gangs, cults, and neo-nazi&#x27;s. They target the young, naive, and emotionally frail. And they promise companionship and strength. And for people that feel alone and left behind, that is enough. They don&#x27;t need to be dumb or evil. Just a little broken. And then the evil ones come in and take advantage.<p>But if you haven&#x27;t ever seen how difficult it is to help someone recover from being in a cult or a neo-nazi gang... then you wouldn&#x27;t realize how hard it is to deal with these groups.')
