There are double standards everywhere, affecting everyone in some way and to different extents. Some face a <i>lot</i> more double standards than others. Consider that your experience is not unique to you nor to those who agree with you politically. Far from it.<p>&gt; &quot;And it&#x27;s not like you can just casually jump from say a hobby subreddit that bans all Trump supporters on sight to a right-wing version of the subreddit that offers a remotely-similar experience.&quot;<p>In that case, if you wish to genuinely participate in that particular subreddit, you keep your politics to yourself and stick to the relevant subject matter. You quickly learn to segregate subjects, some forums are fit for one type of discussion, some for other types. Some have a very strict enforcement of tone, some are basically free-for-all.<p>Even if someone posts a political opinion that you disagree with, you are not obligated to react, in fact reacting may show your hand and sour everyone else to you, for something that is unrelated to the subject matter of the forum.<p>Discretion is the better part of valor, after all.')
