Single-thread performance is still incredibly important. The Mill focuses on single thread performance almost exclusively for that reason: nobody ever made the mythical auto-parallelising compilers we were all supposed to have by now, not even for Haskell. The big wins for exploiting parallelism in most ordinary software have been just scaling up lots of independent single-threaded transactional workloads via sharding, and massively concurrent runtimes like the JVM where you can move all the memory management workload onto other cores and out of the critical paths. In terms of ordinary programmers writing ordinary logic, single-threaded perf is still where it&#x27;s at which is why the M1 has 4 big super-wide cores and 4 small cores rather than 32 medium cores.')
