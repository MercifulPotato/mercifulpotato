At the federal level, where I have personal experience, it seems like it&#x27;s entirely retribution instead of rehabilitation.<p>Do people generally want rehabilitation?<p>I find that when I talk to people, they want rehabilitation for minor crimes and retribution for major crimes, but when feel comfortable enough with talking about it, they generally don&#x27;t want the minor crimes to be illegal to begin with.  Once you get them to discuss the group they actually want in prison, it tends to consist of people they retribution against.<p>Try asking people what is a crime that deserve 2 years of prison, give or take a year.  I find few are able to place crimes into that window, even though 2 years is plenty of time to rehabilitation people if one was actively working at it.')
