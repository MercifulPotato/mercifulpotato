I don&#x27;t like this video much. It&#x27;s tedious and lengthly.<p>Probably no reasonable human being would assume that Quantum Mechanic as we know it is the &quot;holy grail&quot; of physics. We came up with it within 100 years. Can we explain everything? Of course not.<p>To me, the fact that we have the uncertainty principle and schroedingers cat already prove that we basically built our understanding of physics on the premise that we can never understand it. We were basically throwing the towel and saying &quot;yeah this is it&quot;. Advances are made through measurement and verification. How do you understand something that you can&#x27;t measure, because the measurement changes the system?<p>It was pretty obvious to me when I studied physics that this is 100% not how the world works. It&#x27;s a model, like everything else. In the model of quantum mechanics, which undoubtedly is one of the most impressive human achievements nonetheless, we have essentially complete uncertainty on the quantum scale. We can not peek beyond it and it doesn&#x27;t give us any insights into how to peek beyond it. It is, in a way, the end of the line.<p>And like any end of the line in science, it needs a radically different thought or model, to overcome. I always found it amusing how physicists, who really should know better, actually believe that quantum mechanics is how the world works and that this is it. I always was with Einstein in rejecting Quantum Theory. It&#x27;s a nice model. But that&#x27;s really all it is. A model. This is not how the world works and we have come to see its limitations. We need something better if we ever want to leave our solar system and colonize space. Even Einstein fell into the trap of thinking that Quantum Mechanics is more than a model. &quot;God does not throw a dice&quot;. Probably he does not, but it&#x27;s the best approximation we could come up with. He should have refuted it and looked for something better instead. Who knows where we would be now.')
