Every so often, I get a massive headache (its effect compounding from my pretending it will go away soon) after which I need to take several days away from the screen. Obviously, this is impractical.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure that reading books&#x2F;on a Kindle e-ink display has not made headaches worse. But I can&#x27;t transfer much of my routine away from the computer.<p>So far, I&#x27;ve tried taking more breaks to focus on something distant, maybe now I will try actually scheduling breaks instead of taking them when I remember. Maybe I need to change how I set the brightness, or try distancing myself from the monitor, get special glasses, ...
