By cutting back on investigative journalism and focusing on commentary and shows like &quot;The O&#x27;reilly Factor&quot; Fox could create &quot;news&quot; content for less than their competitors. I&#x27;m not sure if the apparent &quot;right&quot; lean was due to the ownership or to market realities that made that kind of content more appealing to right-of-center media consumers.<p>This model has been pretty successful financially and the other major media outlets in the US have followed suit (though often leaning left instead). I <i>think</i> MSNBC was one of the first with the obnoxious melodrama of Keith Olbermann.')
