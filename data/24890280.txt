Item(by='feanaro', descendants=None, kids=[24892241], score=None, time=1603662975, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24889197, text='&gt; Google works hard to maintain their dominance on a lot of fronts, some questionable and in need of regulation, but the biggest reason for their position is, as it always was, ranking algos.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this repeatedly brought into question in recent years and I&#x27;ve also observed it myself. Google&#x27;s search quality is suffering horribly and it seems at least partly related to them moving away from the PageRank-like algorithms that made it famous (or, more reasonably, including many new additional components to it which are unrelated to PageRank and which are drowning out the signal).')
