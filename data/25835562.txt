I&#x27;ve seen entire chapters devoted to &quot;character evolutions&quot; and the associated spew of repetitive skills&#x2F;character sheets.<p>What I personally like is when there&#x27;s a secondary resource (aka a wiki) which tracks changes to the various character sheets and skills over time. Perhaps this could be done within the novel by using appendices? Wouldn&#x27;t help extensively with Patreon-based web novels, sadly.<p>All that said, litrpg - not to mention software development books, cookbooks, etc - do still need these kinds of extended typesetting resources.')
