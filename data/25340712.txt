Dealing with my ISP’s support was really frustrating. Not once did a 2nd or 3rd line technician get in touch with me to acknowledge that they had done any kind of investigation and analysis of the intermittent issues that I kept experiencing. The ISP did send out a guy that replaced the optical transceiver in my end, but to me it just felt like a wild guess and not really something that they did because they had any specific reason to believe that the transceiver was actually faulty. It didn’t help.<p>I ended up just cancelling the service and signing up for one of their competitors instead.')
