It&#x27;s not materially worse there right now.<p>But back to the original argument. How are the UK, France, Poland and Italy doing? Those are big European countries.<p>UK: 213 deaths\nFrance: 506 deaths\nPoland: 357 deaths\nItaly: 731 deaths<p>231 million people, 1807 deaths, more than 2x as bad as the USA. And that&#x27;s before adding Switzerland, Czechia, and other countries where things are worse.<p>It&#x27;s also irrelevant that Czechia did well in the first wave. This is about who is doing worse right now as measured by actual humans dying. The reasons don&#x27;t matter.')
