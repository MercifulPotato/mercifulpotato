Item(by='flas9sd', descendants=None, kids=[25897314, 25895633, 25897163], score=None, time=1611519936, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25893626, text='I&#x27;m using it for 1-on-1 chats in my family and the application makes you forget that it&#x27;s smtp&#x2F;imap&#x2F;pgp underneath. It feels like a WA clone. Will it disclose past message contents on private key leak? yes.<p>If you fetch mails via pop3 be aware, you&#x27;ll move them away before DeltaChat can move them into its own folder via IMAP to build its message threads. If you&#x27;re doing IMAP only you&#x27;ll see the messages with your mailclient unless moved. Maybe consider using a dedicated email-alias or account. If the receiving SMTP on submission doesn&#x27;t strip your connecting IP Address in the Received headers this is quiet a lot on the wire that DC can&#x27;t do anything about and where you would rely on transport encryption.<p>It made a point what a thoughtful chat-view, pgp-using email client can do, so I still recommend to give it a try.')
