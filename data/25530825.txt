That said, regulators are working with real world data.<p>The expectation is for people to be able to exit the building or at least get to a lower floor, because that’s the usual case.   Failing that ladders can generally evacuate people from the 5th floor.  Jumping is very much considered a rare last resort, but is more controlled than people simply falling that distance.  Further, first responders are more likely to be onsite which again increases the odds.<p>As an example of 4 people jumping from the 5th floor and only one being sent to the hospital. While everyone else in the building evacuated normally. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;europe&#x2F;family-jumps-fifth-floor-balcony-escape-apartment-fire-a7048756.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;europe&#x2F;family-jumps...</a><p>So, while there are a lot of relevant regulations building height is a meaningful distinction.<p>PS:  On an 18m tall building. The 1st floor is ~0 meters off the ground, the 2 floor is 3 meters up, 4th floor is ~12m up and 5th floor is thus 15m and the roof is at 18m.   A window adds 1m but someone dangling removes ~2m based on their height.  As in dangling from the 2nd story window is ~2m fall and a 15th floor balcony would be a 13m drop vs ~14m from a window. (Using G, 1, 2, 3, 4 is the same numbers just offset by 1.)')
