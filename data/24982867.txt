I will never update it.  It is not even fully patched, to avoid the nagging patches.  I update Defender, that&#x27;s it.  I don&#x27;t run untrusted code so that isn&#x27;t an issue.  Some day I will have to get Win10 for a newer machine, but it will be LTSC.  LTSC should be able to play games just fine and is what the default Windows 10 should have been, in my opinion.  I will have to get a really beefy machine to compensate for the extra bloat in the Windows 10 kernel.<p>I am not at all impressed with how Microsoft handled Windows 10.  One would assume that with all the telemetry, they would have a solid highly optimized OS by now.  This is not the case.  A family member has nothing but problems with Windows 10 + VR + games, etc...  I have identical hardware and have none of their issues.')
