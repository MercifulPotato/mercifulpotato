HRâ€™s job is to fuel growth by finding ways to make teams more efficient, effective, and enjoyable. Lots of admin work, but also a lot of strategy.  That can be relatively easy at very well funded start-ups, it can be very hard after the 2,000th hire, and impossible at any size if your underlying company culture and&#x2F;or C-suite is broken.<p>A lot of the points in this article are valid and are worth understanding.  We should take an equal amount of time trying to work on a vision for what HR should be.  A lot of start-ups build the product but not the company.  A good founder should have at the minimum a lucid vision for HR.')
