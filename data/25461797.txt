So, while we&#x27;re making up numbers, they might actually end up ordering 10 copies of 0.01% of their items.  Make the penalties for getting caught onerous enough, and they might deter the practice completely.<p>Sure, some vendor might then only put a solicitation in 1 in 20 items, but they&#x27;ll still have a significant chance of getting caught, and it&#x27;s not like Amazon should be so transparent about the process so a vendor can game it.<p>But to my original point: it&#x27;s totally practical for Amazon to take visible action in response to a <i>single</i> complaint, without opening the door up to griefing.<p>The reason for this is that they don&#x27;t need to rely 100% on crowdsourced feedback for compliance enforcement (and to think they would shows a really blinkered webtech-centric viewpoint).  The complaint -&gt; investigation -&gt; substantiation -&gt; enforcement process is tried and true technology <i>that&#x27;s even older than UNIX</i>.')
