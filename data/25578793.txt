It&#x27;s almost a decade old, but hasn&#x27;t aged a bit. Its &quot;recipes&quot; are practical, elegant, and often somewhat cheeky: I&#x27;m thinking in particular of a puckish trick he uses to lazily interpolate variable bindings into a format string automatically by resolving it in the context of previous stack frames (helpfully packaged as a modular function that emits nice errors), and another to tamper with the restrictions of the GIL by executing threaded computations in separate interpreters. But while the book is loaded with black magic, it&#x27;s also the first place I turn when trying to refresh myself on more quotidian topics like navigating a filesystem, making subprocess calls, overriding class instance behavior with magic methods, etc.')
