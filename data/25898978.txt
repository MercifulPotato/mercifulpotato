They literally had a FSD program they were testing with certain employees, and once they found that that people quickly get distracted and stop paying attention, they gave up on that approach and went for the new strategy of jumping straight to level 4 and skipping level 3.<p>So either they&#x27;ve been doing absolutely nothing for the past 8 years until getting level 4 driverless car in Phoenix. It&#x27;s only a level 4 right now, since it does not work in all conditions, but it&#x27;s still far ahead of Tesla&#x27;s level 3 which requires the driver&#x27;s attention.<p>So far Tesla hasn&#x27;t shown anything that Waymo did not have at least 5+ years ago.')
