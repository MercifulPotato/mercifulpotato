Apple has always been anti-environmental in just about every design decision they make.<p>Soldered SSDs? Proprietary connectors that change every couple of years? Lack of ability to take old mobile devices and run recent open-source OSes on them? Non-user-replaceable batteries? Everything about the ecosystem is designed to get people to buy new devices every 2 years.<p>I don&#x27;t own any Apple devices. I just upgraded my desktop computer&#x27;s SSD from 2TB to 4TB for a grand total of $400 and nothing more in manufacturing impact than the SSD itself and a cardboard box for shipping. I have a PC case with modern internals but a 10-year-old power supply and a 15-year-old case. How&#x27;s that for NOT creating unnecessary trash on the planet?<p>With Apple I would have had to trash the PC and buy a new one because they solder the goddamn SSDs to the motherboard.')
