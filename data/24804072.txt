It is filmed by shoulder cameras and the mounter is just playing piano on the console: there isnâ€™t a shot longer than 4s in the entire movie, and the average of changing camera angle is 0,7s.<p>Seems like hyperbole. I just looked at Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol (aka Mission Impossible IV).<p>In the first two minutes there were multiple shots of over 10 seconds.<p>And at the 0:14:44 mark there is a 24 second shot.')
