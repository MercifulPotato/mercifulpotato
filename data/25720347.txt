For home cooking I don&#x27;t know many better at teaching (maybe Chef John from foodwishes.com). He&#x27;s great at differentiating between the must-haves and the nice-to-haves in recipes, and what the trade-offs involved are. This helps me build intuition, which then helps me with all cooking.<p>Watching Matty Matheson is fun but damn do I feel ill with some of his recipes. They are food porn - a fantasy not intended for the real world.')
