If this returns an affirmative value, then ECC is working.<p>Support for patrol scrubbing is a bit more variable. It&#x27;s supported in my ASRock motherboard (B450M Pro4). It was also supported in two previous ASUS motherboards (AMD AM2 and AM3 platforms, respectively), although they called it something else that I can&#x27;t remember. As well, a lack of a setting for patrol scrubbing doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that it&#x27;s unavailable; it could just be enabled but not user-configurable.')
