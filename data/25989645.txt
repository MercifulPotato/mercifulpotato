Item(by='taylodl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612194453, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25987995, text='The key to remember is it&#x27;s not the same basket of household items - they provide for substitution. Apples are too expensive? Maybe they&#x27;ll be replaced with grapes. Beef is too expensive? Maybe it&#x27;ll get replaced by chicken. They substitute items in such a manner to keep the inflation index as low as possible. That&#x27;s important because social security checks are adjusted based off that inflation index so they&#x27;re motivated to keep it as low as possible.<p>As you can imagine people claim this doesn&#x27;t reflect <i>true</i> inflation as we&#x27;re not necessarily comparing apples-to-apples (ha!) and it also excludes energy costs.')
