Most students are going at the wrong speed in one or more areas because of the supposed need to sync everyone up completely.  Starting with literacy.  If they don&#x27;t have the reading level for subject matter then they are not going to be able to learn those things and that needs to be trained up first.  And if they have better core skills then they may be held back if the material doesn&#x27;t keep up.<p>Personally I think this is a failure to apply technology to education.<p>If there was a proper individualized track in the school then you wouldn&#x27;t have a situation like this where kids were going to college.  They could be kids around other kids and still have their own learning path.')
