(plus, the bush family has supported the florida sugar cartels..the fanjul brothers from cuba. google it if curious. that&#x27;s a whole another topic and would distract.)<p>sugary drinks are the worst culprit and sugar is too expensive for it. high fructose corn syrup, otoh.<p>but here is a dirty secret: corn is subsidised by the govt. and HCFS is the by product of our mid western corn. and instead of dumping it, it gets back into local consumption.<p>in a way, we are funding our own HCFS based diseases. i think i have come to a point..in the past 8 years i have been farming..where i can pretty much connect every societal and financial and environmental ill to farm subsidies.<p>cancel farm subsidies forever and the pandora&#x27;s box will disappear. poof!')
