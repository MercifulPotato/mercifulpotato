So I hit Alt+Enter with my cursor there, and had it create me a class. Then I hit Alt+Enter on that class and had it move it to a separate file. Then I added the base class it should inherit from, hit Alt+Enter, and had it scaffold out all the methods I need to override. About fifteen or twenty seconds with a modern IDE and didn&#x27;t require any of my intellectual capacity to actually execute.<p>I realized that another class in this multi-GB codebase had a typo in its name, and hit Shift+F6 to rename it. Typed in the correct name, and twiddled my thumb for two or three minutes while it renamed every instance in the codebase.<p>Found a file that used a declaration style that&#x27;s against our coding style. Hit Alt+Enter on one example, told Rider to configure the project to always prefer the other style and replace all examples in the file.<p>None of those are particularly magic, but having so many of them that are completely reliable a context menu away makes an enormous difference. Also with a recent file list popup and really excellent code navigation, I find that I don&#x27;t keep a file list or tabs open at all. I just jump to symbols and toggle back and forth between the last couple of files.')
