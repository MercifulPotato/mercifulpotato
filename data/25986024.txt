It wont be popular to say this again now - but I dont care: Trading stocks on RH is gambling - it is no better than trading in a casino. The SEC should step in and regulate them  like a casino, in the name of investor protection (aka NOT day-trader protection)<p>RH is the social media of trading. Its all about the quick hit of dopamine via a mobile-first experience. Any conceptual inkling of educating their customers around long term investing is out the window. Why? Because thats not their business model. They profit when you trade a lot because they get paid by HFT. So investing is not in their mantra. Only ridiculous day trading as we have now.<p>This isn&#x27;t a story about market stability, price formation, RegNMS, margins, collateral. Thats all a distraction.<p>This story is about the &quot;autists&quot; at r&#x2F;wsb sticking it to wall street. Which is fine, its all good and entertaining. But random punting isn&#x27;t going to create wealth.')
