In 2000 the average PC was 1997 era hw... with a Pentium2, AMD k7, or a Celero overclocked to ~450MHZ? making a great alternative to a Pentium2 and a Pentium III@450.<p>Windows 98 was on its peak and the Pentium MMX often was horrendously slow to start up things. Good with Windows 95, but by 2K everyone was onto 98&#x2F;SE because of good additions and an <i>easy</i> PNP support.<p>W98SE was used even when XP got released and a few years more.<p>Also, <i>your</i> statement about the P4 with that huge amounts of RAM (2GB) is even more unusual than a PII in y2k.<p>When I had an AMD Athlon in 2003, I barely had 256MB of RAM. I stayed with that up to 2009 with Debian 4 DVD&#x27;s.I tried some Fedora releases and they where a huge no-no in my machine, and Solaris was impossible.')
