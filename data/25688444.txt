Once their growth slows, you can expect them to show higher Net Margins.<p>The key for high growth companies is Gross Margins. The higher the gross, the more they can reinvest. And, the higher their net margins will be once the growth slows.<p>Tesla is vertically integrated. That means they don&#x27;t need to share profit with a supply chain to the same extent as the incumbents. Hence, I split the difference between the incumbents and Apple&#x27;s net profit.<p>Feel free to adjust the numbers to what you speculate the future holds.
