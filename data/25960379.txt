I highly suspect that the link you&#x27;re saying is that a broker would be responsible to cover loses on trades they made if the clearing house does not; not that the brokerage is required to accept unlimited risk just because someone wants them too.<p>&gt; But that is Robinhood&#x27;s liquidity issue and not does justify Robinhood disabling cash accounts from buying stocks.<p>Robinhood having a liquidity issue 100% justifies them not offering services that they may not be able to actually cover. Because the alternative is way, way worse. You want Robinhood to just... make up money that they owe people but don&#x27;t actually have? I&#x27;m fairly confident that financial institutions can&#x27;t just make up numbers in order to manipulate their way into compliance.<p>I very much dislike Robinhood as a company, but what you&#x27;re suggesting doesn&#x27;t make sense.')
