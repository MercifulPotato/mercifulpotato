Consider the fact that Asian students in the US  spend on average 110 minutes a day studying as compared to Whites&#x27; ~55 and Black student&#x27;s ~35 [1]. Forcing a balanced outcome with disparate inputs is not what many consider just behavior. I have not only witnessed, but carried out, similar policy in tech. E.g. companies setting diversity targets that are substantially higher (often over 2x higher) than the said groups&#x27; representation in the field. I have also worked at companies that let women and URM candidates take two attempts at passing the pre-onsite technical phone interview while white and Asian men get one chance.<p>Maybe this isn&#x27;t the kind of &quot;social justice&quot; Google union activists are arriving for. But if that&#x27;s the case the union activists should lay out specific goals, like establishing name-blind resume reviews, eliminating gender and racial quotas, or something else. Otherwise, my instinct is to lump their views into the same trend as the social justice activists I have encountered during my time working in tech which tends to be hostile to meritocracy and desires picking outcomes a priori.<p>To be clear, it&#x27;s fine to be in favor of affirmation action as an individual and I often support it myself, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t want a union enforcing it and I could see why many people would be alienated by a union movement espousing it.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;blog&#x2F;brown-center-chalkboard&#x2F;2017&#x2F;08&#x2F;10&#x2F;analyzing-the-homework-gap-among-high-school-students&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;blog&#x2F;brown-center-chalkboard&#x2F;2017&#x2F;...</a>')
