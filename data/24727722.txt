Privacy is a separate issue. They could just make Oculus also connect to other social networks including facebook&#x27;s competition. Then the anticompetitive complaint is gone as Oculus&#x27;s market share no longer gives Facebook an advantage. Yet the creepy privacy-violating continues more than ever. Sort of like IOS and Android, where no matter which option you choose for various apps to perform functions with your phone, you probably get tracked, most of it ending up at Facebook and Google anyway.')
