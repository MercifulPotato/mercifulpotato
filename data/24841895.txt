All 6 books are well-written. IMO the later novels are every bit as good as the earlier novels. (We shall not discuss the son&#x27;s unfortunate knockoffs.) I suspect some readers were disappointed with books 2 and 3 because the story didn&#x27;t go the way they wanted. But that&#x27;s because the sly devil Frank was teaching us a lesson. :-)')
