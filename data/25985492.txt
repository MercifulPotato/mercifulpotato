The nice little menu option in that article is just not there.<p>&gt; What&#x27;s more, there&#x27;s additional development work[3] on bypassing Safety Net as well.<p>If they decide to remove the fallback, that method dies.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t even own a Samsung phone and I found all this out in less than five minutes.<p>The info on samsung models is a mess because they put out almost identical phones with different chipsets and subtly different capabilities.<p>All the non-US models, almost all with exynos chips, can be unlocked but that does me no good.<p>&gt; you didn&#x27;t mention the specific Samsung model you have which may complicate things<p>S20 FE 5G SM-G781U1 if you really want to know.<p>&gt; Besides, even if you don&#x27;t root the device, installing a custom recovery partition will allow nandroid backups[5], which are clearly superior to other backup mechanisms.<p>I know, and I wish I could do that.')
