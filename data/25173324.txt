I found no example of specifying the digest as part of the image name.<p>Docker does not support this.  You can get an image file and calculate the SHA-256 digest of it.  But Docker does not let you say &quot;start a container using this particular SHA-256&quot;.  That&#x27;s because the SHA-256 that docker uses internally is just a hash of dockerd&#x27;s internal metadata about the image.  That metadata is different on every machine.  I felt extremely disappointed when I discovered this.  And I lost a lot of respect for the Docker developers.<p>If you want to deploy based on image hash with Docker, you must add your own verification step before creating each container instance.  Terraform&#x27;s docker plugin does not perform this step.  And the local dockerd will not check the SHA-256 on reboot.  If you just follow Docker&#x27;s &quot;best practices&quot; and use the provided tools, all of these sources will needlessly have root on everything you deploy:<p>- Your docker image repository<p>- Any machines with credentials to push to your docker image repository (CI system, engineer machines, anyone with access to engineer machine backups)<p>- Anyone with permission to push any public image that you use.  The way most CI systems are configured, all jobs get the same credentials.  So this includes your build and test jobs.  That fancy linter Docker image you&#x27;re using?  Anyone who can push to its Dockerhub account can replace the image version you selected with one that roots all of your systems.<p>- Dockerhub itself<p>Why would RedHat switch to a Docker replacement without this crucial security feature?<p>Am I missing some important point that makes all of this ok?<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.podman.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;markdown&#x2F;podman-create.1.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.podman.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;markdown&#x2F;podman-create.1.htm...</a>')
