Was looking at the code of a plugin to hide the workspace switcher popup and tried a few things to instead reduce the animation time to something that does not necessarity stick around over my windows too long to bother me when I want to view the content beneath. Took and few hours but I got it configured decently, and &quot;live reloaded&quot; it to get the effect instantly.  Here I reused my JavaScript knowledge to solve it; if it wasn&#x27;t so easy due to my previous unrelated knowledge I probably wouldn&#x27;t have invested any time in it.')
