Two objects will give a score which indicates similarity&#x2F;dissimilarity and then some further logic needs to say if that score is good enough for a match. Some NIST certifications for instance end up placing requirements with false-match-rates at 1&#x2F;10,000 (e.g. one left index finger matching someone else&#x27;s left index finger at that frequency when trying a lot of random pairs).')
