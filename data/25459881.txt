Perhaps more than warranted by my actual FOSS contributions, but I digress.<p>I used to be hard-core in the free software camp, and while I wouldn&#x27;t say I have abandoned it, my stance has certainly softened. A couple of recent articles and presentations that have affected (or mirrored?) my own thinking:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dtrace.org&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;bmc&#x2F;2018&#x2F;12&#x2F;14&#x2F;open-source-confronts-its-midlife-crisis&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dtrace.org&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;bmc&#x2F;2018&#x2F;12&#x2F;14&#x2F;open-source-confronts...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;copyleftconf2020-allison" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;copyleftconf2020-allison</a><p>A couple of quick takes<p>- The tivoization issue: The rejection of GPLv3 by the Linux kernel in practice means that the free software movement has failed here. I&#x27;m hoping activists pushing for Right to Repair and similar legislation will prove more successful in enabling people more control over their own devices.<p>- The cloud service provider loophole: The almost complete rejection of AGPL by, well, more or less everybody, means that the free software movement has also failed here. Plain GPL doesn&#x27;t provide more protection against a service provider &quot;leeching&quot; your code than a permissive license. If copyleft has failed here, what are alternative approaches here then? Data portability and anti-trust legislation?<p>- Protection against leeching by evil corporations vs maximizing usage: If, like some of the core Linux kernel people have said, &quot;there&#x27;s no value in driving freeloaders away&quot;, is copyleft worth the trouble?<p>- The end user vs. developers argument: The FSF spends a lot on this, about protecting the rights of the end user. But if we look around at non-techie people, largely they just don&#x27;t give a shit. Perhaps the copyleft movement needs to work on its messaging, or is this a completely lost cause.<p>- FOSS business models: To begin with, trite as it sounds, &quot;write FOSS&quot; is not a business model. The more interesting question is perhaps how build FOSS communities that can, in one way or another, sustain themselves economically.<p><pre><code>  - If you don&#x27;t have a plan to make money, does leeching (see above) matter? And no, &quot;I&#x27;ll license my code under (A)GPL, if somebody wants another license call me and lets talk $$$&quot; is for the vast majority of cases not a realistic business model either.\n\n  - Dual licensing: Not really applicable for trying to build a community. Why would an outsider contribute and assign copyright to a project under a &quot;poison pill&quot; license so that someone else can make a buck off that work?\n\n  - Open core: Evidently successful (see e.g. cossi list), but is this really FOSS, or is it proprietary software with an open source loss leader? \n\n  - Commodity community: Essentially sharing the maintenance burden of the non-differentiated part of whatever you&#x27;re doing. The Linux kernel being a good example of this.\n\n  - Support or selling &quot;LTS&quot; licenses: E.g. redhat. Can work, but seldom achieves the kind of growth numbers that makes VC&#x27;s salivate (if that matters to you).</code></pre>')
