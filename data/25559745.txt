I have a deep ingrained irrational fear of phone calls and exposure made it worse, those years I worked in phone support. Do you also tell people with depression to just get over it?<p>No, this is an idea that just isn&#x27;t for some people, like me and the GP comment. That&#x27;s ok. Not everything needs to be a cure, people are allowed to just avoid things that are optional and not fun for them. And not every idea has to appeal to everyone. To me and the GP, this idea is terrifying. No thanks.')
