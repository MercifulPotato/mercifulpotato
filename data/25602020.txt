Item(by='hoten', descendants=None, kids=[25602637, 25602611], score=None, time=1609493915, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25601656, text='Yeah, and every encounter with a warrior in the same game I believe (or maybe majora&#x27;s mask?) you damage them untill they flee the room. I don&#x27;t think you ever kill a human in those games. Maybe Ganon, but he comes of as a man-pig hybrid. Although I&#x27;m not sure how the knights in Link to the Past fit into this, surely those are human soldiers you&#x27;re killing...<p>Another data point: What happens with the highway bandit in Breath of the Wild? They eventually teleport away, they don&#x27;t explode into a poof of death.')
