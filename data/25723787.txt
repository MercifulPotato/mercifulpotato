Item(by='topspin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610333657, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25721131, text='&gt; When would you choose FPGA over something like an STM32?<p>Essentially for the same reason you choose to use a GPU instead of a CPU.  FPGAs deliver application specific circuitry that outperforms a general purpose device.  Typically these are high throughput applications; signal processing (SDR), image processing (find the license plates), audio processing etc.  While it might be conceivable to do many of these tasks with very fast MCUs, often there are power budgets or other constraints that can&#x27;t be met.<p>For example, imagine your application might be handled by either a.) STM32F4 running full tilt at 160 MHz or b.) an iCE5LP4K at 50 MHz.  The former could consume just south of 200mW, whereas the latter might be around 10mW.  That&#x27;s a very big difference when you&#x27;re running on a 100mAh embedded lipo battery or 40mAh coin cell.')
