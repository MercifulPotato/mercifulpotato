I honestly laugh when I hear people using it as their &#x27;solution&#x27;. It&#x27;s a bloated nightmare, fueled by young devs that literally know only one way to develop. It&#x27;s a crutch that needs to go away and privately I hear a lot of senior devs talking about how it&#x27;s just a matter of time until the whole thing implodes on itself.\nSeriously in 5 years the entire industry is going to shift away from this nonsense and I can&#x27;t wait to see it happen. The entire front-end is a wasteland of resource consuming bloat. The tool chaining is a nightmare, the entire approach just shifts a huge ton of unnecessary baggage to the front-end.\nIf any of these so called developers were worth their salt they&#x27;d be writing in vanilla JS, React is an even worse crutch than Jquery ever was.')
