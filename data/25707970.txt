Most people agree some regulation is needed to prevent bad actors. Social media keeps changing their policies, while not really adhering to it, not to mention it is intrusive to begin with. It is only consistent to regulate them like we do other large sectors like food, and energy, plus there is precedent for breaking up big tech from a couple decades ago.<p>There&#x27;s also something not mentioned very often, these apps are &quot;free&quot; and lose money at first, but they sell your information and now they control the conversation, something most people are not in a position to decide or even know about, of course until it&#x27;s too late and you have your life in their servers. Imho, this is a conflict of interest similar to private healthcare insurance, where the profit and the wellbeing of the human involved (sometimes the customer, sometimes the product) is not the #1 priority, and as a result a large enough company has the scale to damage a large number of people.')
