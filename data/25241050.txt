It&#x27;s an axiomatic truth that everyone has to &#x27;take a stand&#x27;, implying that you have to call it out, and in a context moreover where not a single person applauded the murder of Floyd.  How disingenuous for you to call it a stand, implying that there&#x27;s a debate.  Instead what you mean is, sign up to a calling out of the police.  What betrays the problem at hand, why companies cannot feasibly all be political by nature, is that there a zillion possible social causes that one could rationally argue are impossible to call out, from shootings domestically (1100 in my city this year so far), to corporate malfeasance (sweat shops overseas, finance fraud), to foreign policy (bombings of middle eastern countries).<p>If you and I worked together and you stood up and demanded everyone call out the Floyd thing, outed as you call it, you and I would be debating the above points in front of everyone.<p>THAT is why companies should allow for an apolitical space.')
