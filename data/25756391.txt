He&#x27;d often geek out in those kinds of discussions, talking how in the &#x27;70s people were actually doing security in computing, vs. the current security theatre, and how many things are totally possible to do, just no big company <i>wants</i> to do this now (even though loudly claiming otherwise), because it is expensive, and it&#x27;s more profitable to focus on profits than security. For some technical references from Nick, see e.g.: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20946537" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20946537</a><p>For example, quoting verbatim from the link above:<p><i>&gt; [...] Modern OS&#x27;s, routers, basic apps, etc aren&#x27;t as secure as software designed in 1960&#x27;s-1980&#x27;s.
