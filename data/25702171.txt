If two pilots pull&#x2F;push controls to opposite directions they kind of neutralize each other, and obviously the suicidal one would have element of surprise as an advantage.<p>In fact just that happened on EgyptAir flight 990. A suicidal copilot was able to crash the plane even with another pilot present, and that happened from a higher altitude.')
