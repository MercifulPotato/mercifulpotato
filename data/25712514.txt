I was talking about your normal life being altered from more than 5k steps taken to less.<p>For instance, I need about 1k steps to the subway and I bring kids to the kindergarten or pick them up for, say, 2k steps. So on a normal workday, I get 4k steps just by getting to and from work. That&#x27;s missing now. Consequently I have to start exercising just to keep the status quo ante.')
