They&#x27;re just willing to crack jokes about a hell of a lot of stuff that would make most white collar employees cringe.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t cringe if I heard off-color jokes at an auto repair garage.<p>I think I&#x27;d call the police if I saw a bunch of dipshits sitting around a workstation, targeting random women from the other room with facial recognition software to share degrading posts about them being receptacles for their own sexual gratification.<p>Aside from TV sitcoms and online forum caricatures, I haven&#x27;t a clue what that kind of sociopathy has to do with blue collar workers.')
