Item(by='cbozeman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611803326, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25937365, text='&gt; Doesn&#x27;t it seem to you like something is fundamentally worse about politics now than it was 20 years ago?<p>Yeah, but this has nothing to do with social media in my estimation. It has everything to do with the elites of the world, but in particular, America, capturing most of the wealth that gets generated.<p>You can&#x27;t have a middle class without an enormous amount of people making a healthy sum of money. In an ever-increasing desire to capture more of that wealth, there&#x27;s were we ended up. Naturally the elites that are smart enough to realize this don&#x27;t care, because they won&#x27;t have to bear the consequences of these actions. They&#x27;ll be dead and gone by the time it degenerates into a real problem, or they just expect to move to another nation, set up shop there, and repeat the cycle.<p>This is where a lot of people lose the plot. Its not a political problem - its made to look that way because that keeps scrutiny off the fact that its a financial problem. 47% of Americans living in poverty. Half the citizens of the richest nation in the world, live in poverty. That&#x27;s laughable.<p>And if everyone&#x27;s busy being gainfully employed, living a mostly fulfilling life, they don&#x27;t have time to LARP as a MAGA Shaman. They&#x27;re busy working, grilling some hamburgers and hotdogs and ribs in the backyard, drinking a cold beer while the kids play in the pool, and the reason I can tell you that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re doing, is because that&#x27;s what me and mine do most weekends. I don&#x27;t have time to go to D.C. and act like a jackass... when I&#x27;m not busy working, I&#x27;m busy with my hobby of building furniture, and when I&#x27;m not busy doing that, I&#x27;m in the gym, and when I&#x27;m not busy doing that, I&#x27;m off doing other shit.<p>But all that stuff is only possible if you&#x27;ve got a middle class salary. And the middle class has been asked to pay more than they can reasonably fork over, for entirely too long. Hard to take seriously the compliant of a multi-millionaire about the state of her tax bill of $4.8 million on her $11 million yearly salary, because scale matters. She can live in a $1m a year apartment in NYC, send her kids to private school that costs $40,000&#x2F;yr, each, and still have, literally, millions left over for every thing else.<p>Meanwhile, the husband and wife making $60,000 a year as a nurse and $80,000 a year as an engineer end up with around $90,000 after taxes, if they&#x27;re lucky. $7,500 a month. Two decent cars - $1000&#x2F;mo. $2000&#x2F;mo for a modest house in a decent part of town. Gotta throw a little something into savings, retirement, investment, etc., so knock out another $500. $1500 if they&#x27;re really smart. Now we&#x27;re down to $3000 and we haven&#x27;t gotten to cell phones, Internet, car insurance, etc.<p>It adds up, and fast.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just a little more jaded than you are... maybe I&#x27;m just old, and with age comes a lot of clarity about just how the world works. I&#x27;m angry, but I&#x27;m angry for the kids, not me. They&#x27;re going to really bear the brunt of this, and it isn&#x27;t just &quot;unfair&quot;, its unconscionable.')
