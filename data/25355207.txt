One package was last updated 13 days ago. An acquaintance who sells things online is seeing the same thing, packages in transit with no updates for 1-2 weeks.<p>It&#x27;s possible we&#x27;ve just been unlucky and these packages are lost, but it could also be indicative of a larger logistical problem with USPS.')
