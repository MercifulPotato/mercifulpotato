To respect and protect it shall be the duty of all state authority.</i><p>and freedom of expression while enjoying numerous protections reaches its limitations when that dignity is under attack (article 5):<p><i>(1) Every person shall have the right freely to express and disseminate his opinions in speech, writing and pictures and to inform himself without hindrance from generally accessible sources. Freedom of the press and freedom of reporting by means of broadcasts and films shall be guaranteed. There shall be no censorship.<p>(2) These rights shall find their limits in the provisions of general laws, in provisions for the protection of young persons and in the right to personal honour.</i>')
