If the data is replicated 1.6x then there&#x27;s only 1.6 magnetic disk heads per each file byte. If you replicate it 6x then there&#x27;s 6 magnetic disk heads for each byte. At ~15x it becomes cheaper to store in SSD with ~1.5x reed-solomon&#x2F;erasure code overhead since SSD has ~10x the per-byte cost of HDD.<p>(there are also effects on the tail latency of both read and write, because in a replicated encoding you are less likely to be affected by a single slow drive).<p>(also, for insane performance which is sometimes needed you can mlock() things into RAM; the per-byte cost of RAM is ~100x the cost of HDD and ~10x the cost of SSD).')
