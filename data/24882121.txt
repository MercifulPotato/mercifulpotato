(Wikipedia)<p>It’s not an unused letter that you can snap up as a cool way to write zero. People will read it, some will recognize it and assume it has meaning, because it has. That’s how letters work.<p>There are zeroes with dashes through them, but if you look closely they almost always take care to keep the dash inside the (non-)circle zero to make the difference clearer.<p>I realize most people in the world won’t care about this, but with Northern European eyes, this looks stupid.')
