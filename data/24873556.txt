How would I feel about someone borrowing a book from a library and then photocopying it to keep a local copy? If the intent was to re-distribute then I would not feel comfortable allowing it. However, if the proposed remedy was to ban personal ownership of photocopiers I would not even consider that a valid approach. But would I expect I could keep my own photocopied version instead of paying retail price for the book? And what if a purpose built photocopier was designed and marketed for the express purpose of photocopying books from the library?<p>My personal feeling, and obviously not a legal opinion or even morally infallible in any sense, is that storing a local copy of digital content that has been consumed should be allowed. Where it becomes grey (or my feeling tends towards disallowing) is if I share or re-broadcast that content in any form.<p>That is, I feel the DMCA is in the wrong here. Unless they can prove intent to re-distribute it feels wrong that they can ban my ability to maintain a copy for myself. I believe it ought to be a right to store such content locally.')
