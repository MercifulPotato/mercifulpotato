Item(by='krick', descendants=None, kids=[25393520, 25394294, 25393542], score=None, time=1607727730, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25391502, text='There are barely 80 votes at the moment of writing this comment, of which barely 10 are a &quot;NO&quot;, so it&#x27;s a bit early for &quot;high percentage&quot;. (Edit: Now it&#x27;s 73&#x2F;(798 + 279 + 73), less than 7%, so the point stands.) But I&#x27;m a &quot;NO&quot;, FWIW. And while I&#x27;m not surprised by the &quot;high percentage&quot; of &quot;YES&quot; votes because of HN demographics, I do not approve. I mean, I don&#x27;t really care what other people do with their lives, but this shouldn&#x27;t be expected to be the default choice.<p>For the record, vaccines are not a controversial topic in my country like they seem to be in the USA. Kids are vaccinated at school, I received numerous vaccines during my life, some of them totally optional and quite expensive, which I paid for anyway, because it felt like a safer way to be. And of course I do not think vaccines are an evil plan of Bill Gates to... I&#x27;m not even sure what the crazy conspiracy theory about that is supposed to be, but I&#x27;m pretty sure there is some.<p>But <i>I am</i> a crazy conspiracy theorist in a sense that I firmly believe that COVID-19 is hugely overhyped. Of course, I&#x27;m scared and ashamed of saying that, because nowadays this seems to be a stronger version of saying &quot;Hitler did nothing wrong&quot;, but you are asking about &quot;why no&quot;, so here we are.<p>Basically, it&#x27;s a trade off between reasons to do it and reasons not to (as always).<p>Is there a reason to avoid doing it? Well, yes. Basically, expectation that everyone should do it is that reason: the topic is insanely hot, and it&#x27;s never a good thing. This is a huge business opportunity for every pharmaceutical company that gets to push their vaccine right now, and this is some hastily cooked shit you expect me to take. Some of these vaccines are quite a novelty, which is not a bad thing on its own, but this is unlike most vaccines I have ever taken, which are basically decades old and literally millions of people have taken them before me. Maybe it&#x27;s totally safe, maybe it isn&#x27;t. No couple-months-long trial will ever answer that.<p>Is there a reason to take it? Well, sure. Like there is a reason to take a flu vaccine. Which I don&#x27;t do, because there are new mutations every year, and there are countless more versions of &quot;common cold&quot;. Yes, people die of that, and it&#x27;s never a pleasant experience, and I live in a cold climate, where this is a very common seasonal thing, but it&#x27;s just how things are. It&#x27;s ok.  And I&#x27;m not going to elaborate on all &quot;Hitler did nothing wrong&quot; thing, because what I&#x27;ve said so far is more than enough to trigger someone, but, well, I know people that had been sick with COVID-19. I contacted them in person when they were already sick, and it just so happens that neither of us was wearing any mask. I wasn&#x27;t really a responsible citizen all the time. It doesn&#x27;t seem that the stakes are much higher than with a flu. For some of people it seemed to be more like a really light version of a common cold.<p>So there&#x27;s a little of &quot;no&quot; vs a little of &quot;yes&quot; and it just so happens that &quot;no&quot; overweights quite confidently.<p>Maybe it is fair to say that I should&#x27;ve voted &quot;I&#x27;ll wail&quot;, because this &quot;no&quot; isn&#x27;t final. But then no &quot;yes&quot; is final either, anything can happen, the last year should&#x27;ve taught us that if anything. And I don&#x27;t have any specific date I have to wait for. The point is, currently I&#x27;m not going to do that, and I hope it stays this way.')
