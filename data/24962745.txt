Item(by='notankies', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604266772, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24962063, text='&gt; Which then begs the question: why are you upset that we&#x27;re criticizing ourselves?<p>I&#x27;m not, I&#x27;m annoyed with yet another half-Woke &#x27;net commentariat pretending that pointing out the American&#x2F;Colonialist positionality of discourse in an American fluff piece is insight, when it&#x27;s just half baked rhetorical whining about someone writing from their own lived experience and positionality. The author of the article, in short, is being mocked for using the language of his culture because the prevailing ideology of the moment proclaims American perspectives to be unilaterally oppressive.<p>The implied argument is that the Colonial positionality is the most oppressive discourse and therefore the least valid, so using language like &quot;discovers&quot; is argued to continue to marginalize Native cultures, but it&#x27;s a criticism that is only applied to mainstream American positionalities in order to rewrite American history in a way that justifies &quot;decolonization&quot; and as such I find it a shallow and dangerous criticism worth mocking.<p>Quick, someone tell me what &quot;Land Back&quot; means, but describe it without violence or ethnic removal. And if you don&#x27;t know why that phrase is relevant to this screed it&#x27;s time to pay attention to the memes in the graffiti and the chants of protestors in the US and in Canada.')
