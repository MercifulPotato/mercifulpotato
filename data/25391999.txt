It was a game with a great deal of tactical and strategic depth that it allowed a huge range of player ability.  It definitely wasn&#x27;t the kind of game where some newbie could just start playing and get a lucky win or be a master in days or weeks.  It felt more like a sport where you needed to practice the basics (like you mentioned on taking PBs) while you also learned a lot about strategy.<p>My favorite times were the Bolofests where traveling boloers would come into town and we&#x27;d all get together to play on a LAN.')
