Italians, Jewish people, and the Irish have all been excluded from &quot;whiteness&quot; at times. The term expands as needed to provide solidarity against Black people. &quot;Black&quot;, on the other hand, is an actual ethnicity --- the one we created when we kidnapped millions of people in Africa and stripped them of their original culture.<p>Anti-whiteness crusaders can and frequently do go too far, but I object, strenuously, to the idea that mainstream articles about problematic whiteness are somehow comparable to anti-Black racism. That isn&#x27;t true, and I think you know that.')
