So what you think those nukes are more hotter than the sun itself. All that air fucked up burning the atmosphere. China from 1 Jan 2021 not accepting any trash till that time US was importing trash to China because US was avoiding to be a trash country now it is they have a huge problem. US has paid alot $ so China was accepting all that junk. There was a Cold War US was eating Russia. Russia after puting Sputnik 1 in space, was the leader in technology all the world was silent. US even send people for a research to Russia and what they seen was new for them. Children where going to school for 5 days and for 6 hours all oth them knew Mendelejev table and homeworks for two hours. In US kids where dumb for two hours at school and homeworks for 20min. \nSo US was able to invest in Russia but Russia was a leader at that time. So US invested in China. CHINA was doing job and did a disaster in decades to China land and to the world at that time US was exporting trash to China ant payng for that and resseling items made in China to the world.\nUS steped out from Paris climate organisation at the end.<p>In the end nobody who is technicaly guilty does not want to pay off.<p>By the way even Nort Korea does not have such huge national debt as US - trash nation.<p>*Sorry for my language. The End Is Near if you have no Future no kids. Then you are just regular user who eats, drinks and watch TV thats all what you do surrounded by devices you even dont use or they have no use.<p>Now its Covid-19 lockdown etc. You will not survive being alone without a discotek and rave or dating. By bye<p>Regards.')
