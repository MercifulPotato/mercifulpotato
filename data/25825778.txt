There are more trains. You get to walk more.&quot;</i><p>I hear this a lot, but what does this <i>really</i> amount to? I live in a city without a car, and all my walking on my daily commute (during non-covid times) burns 125 calories or so. That&#x27;s nothing. Eating two oreo cookies is more calories than that.<p>Moreover, consider that America is no more car centric than it was in 1970 or 1980, but people are much larger now than then.')
