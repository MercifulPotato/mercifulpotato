If you don&#x27;t have access to Play Store, you have no easy way to install your favorite apps (say Waze) or your bank&#x27;s app, because those are not on f-Droid or available through direct download. Running these &quot;favorite&quot; apps is possible in principle in a Google-free environment with something like microg, but how does an average user get them installed? From where?<p>I have a run a Google-free phone for years now (currently crDroid on Moto G7) and I have experimented with moving apks from a second phone (with Play Store installed) to the de-Googled phone and it is quite an effort. So I keep my old phone shut down, at home, with only WiFi access as needed (no sim card) when I need to deposit a check by image for my bank for example. But I have no good solution for proprietary apps I want to use on the road, like Waze, without a great deal of effort. Yes there are acceptable open alternatives to many proprietary apps but these are in some cases not my &quot;favourite&quot;.')
