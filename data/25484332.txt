It reminds me of a paper by Cameron Browne (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ccg.doc.gold.ac.uk&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2016&#x2F;03&#x2F;browne_phd08.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ccg.doc.gold.ac.uk&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2016&#x2F;03&#x2F;browne_...</a>), which does similarly, but using less advanced technology. While the approach was janky in some ways, the game that the system invented, Yavalath, has received some praise for being an interesting and compelling take on the n-in-a-row genre.<p>I&#x27;ve been dreaming of doing similar with an alpha-type system, and so I look forward to reading this paper.<p>Edit: After skimming it, it doesn&#x27;t look like they&#x27;re going the distance like Browne did. Browne had the computer evolve games that the AI would rate ideally, while the DeepMind paper only has the computer consider a handful of pre-selected variants. I don&#x27;t anticipate it would have been much extra work to evolve games, and I would have found it much more interesting.')
