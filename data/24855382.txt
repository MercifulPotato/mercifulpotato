Hard pass on that element.<p>I have the exact opposite feeling.\nI would not selfhost email but I would selfhost a password manager and my files behind WireGuard, like many have said.<p>I have almost moved from cloud hosting to home server. This perfectly reasonable for non critical services that donâ€™t require more than 90% availability. The simplicity of such a setup nowadays is a breeze of fresh air. Debian stable, WireGuard, syncthing, ssh, git, ... all are low maintenance and works fine with Linux and iOS clients.')
