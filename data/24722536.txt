I have heard lots of good things about the Ontario Rat II, especially the D2 version which you can pick up for about $40, but have never tried it myself. The Rat II is generally considered a good &quot;starter&quot; folding knife. Personally I&#x27;d recommend going straight to Spyderco - for $100 you can get something really high quality which you will enjoy and use. I got my brother a Para 3 LW and it set me back $98. He seems to like it.')
