Before, you had to consume finite resources (time, energy, postage stamps, etc.) to tell someone else about something. This gave a natural rate limit.<p>As a thought experiment, what if the degrees of separation were less rigidly enforced, but people&#x27;s &quot;power of voice&quot; decays the further it goes from those who directly follow them, resulting in a similar result? Then for every user, there&#x27;s a probability they&#x27;ll see or not see a given post (significantly reducing as the degree of separation increases). Clearly this isn&#x27;t ideal and there&#x27;s compounding factors (if you have 3 friends share it, should that probability be additive?)<p>Share rate limits in WhatsApp led to people imploring others to copy paste fake news to share it to others, so clearly this isn&#x27;t as simple as limiting normal shares.')
