Our protein synthesis machinery is dependent entirely upon RNA. I think there’s a perspective here that the RNA world never disappeared, just became symbiotic with higher-order protein structures. On one hand, RNA viruses continue to replicate successfully (i.e. SARS-nCoV-2) and on the other we rely on rRNA, tRNA and mRNA to function as a highly-conserved part of cellular function across all organisms.<p>When I was in grad school my default assumption was that ribozymes (catalytic RNA) are far more abundant than we currently know. RNA just very difficult to work with so there’s a selection bias against our ability to measure its behavior in vivo.')
