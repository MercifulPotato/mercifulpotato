Concepts are abstract, changes are incremental and it&#x27;s never really &quot;done&quot;. Even if part of it is beautiful, in some short time it&#x27;ll be outdated and replaced by something else.<p>Woodworking, on the contrary, is something concrete I can touch and hold on my hand. It has practical uses, people can appreciate it and judge its form and function. If done even moderately right it&#x27;ll last many years or decades.<p>It&#x27;s really rewarding to be able to point at something you&#x27;ve done yourself, mistakes and all, and see it in daily use. The feeling lasts a whole lot longer than &quot;I&#x27;ve refactored this class into something better&quot;.')
