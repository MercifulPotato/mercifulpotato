Let me just build on it: I remember reading a lengthy piece about the first Epstein criminal investigation in 2006. There were accounts that the investigators and prosecutors involved were being threatened by people working for Epstein, and that&#x27;s part of why he got the sweetheart deal that he did.<p>Now I&#x27;m a minor businessman, and I&#x27;ve worked with high-quality law firms before. Most of them are really good at what they do. But if they&#x27;re handling my criminal case and I say &quot;hey, could I pay you extra to violently threaten the US attorney for me?&quot; I would be shown the door about 3 seconds later. No amount of money in the world would get them to say &quot;yes&quot; to that.')
