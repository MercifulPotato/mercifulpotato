Huge fan of Segment from the start, and Twilio is slowly getting itself into the middle of everything. (I realized only recently that they&#x27;ve owned Authy for years following the recent rebranding.)<p>I find it interesting that Segment (and thus the entire downstream ecosystem) has gone this far while staying strictly oriented around users and accounts, without first-class support for other entities -- namely a notion of workspace&#x2F;team&#x2F;contract&#x2F;opportunity&#x2F;etc. &quot;Groups&quot; was sort of a false start that didn&#x27;t get a new direction. There&#x27;s still a ways to go connecting all the dots between how companies structure their data and how all third-party products are prepared (or not) to mirror that structure.')
