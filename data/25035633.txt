Doing something outside of an economic context is like that old comedy sketch about a leaking oil tanker being towed &quot;outside the environment&quot;. Most human interactions are at some level transactional and driven by individual incentives.<p>This is true even for personal side projects and charity work. In all Western societies and economies that I know of, it is both legal and acceptable to offer people compensation in exchange for them doing stuff for you, whatever that stuff is and whatever that compensation is.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are human societies in which this is totally untrue, but I would be surprised if the rules of those societies were applicable to open source software development outside of very specific situations.')
