We always welcome interns.<p>3 - apprenticeship: there is a program so that you can start working after college. I know some people went this route and are now full time employees.<p>4 - other ways like PhD etc...<p>Bottom line is: you don’t need a fancy uni (I did a state uni in france). What’s important is that you are good at what you do and you do it for yourself, not just to work in a FAANG company.<p>Tips:\nSkills that Google is looking for: critical thinking, collaboration, communication, analysis of trade offs and being a genuinely nice person.<p>Books that got me into Google:\nThe Algorithm Design Manual by Skienna\nGrokking Algorithms by Aditya Bhargava')
