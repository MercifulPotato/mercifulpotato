Item(by='cycomanic', descendants=None, kids=[24727579], score=None, time=1602225449, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24724367, text='&gt;&gt; I only recently understood that my Coax cables are basically like an RF spectrum similar to Wifi except inside the cables. It appears this is taken as obvious because I had a really hard time finding someone explain it like that.<p>&gt;Back in the days nearly everyone had the experience of connecting an outdoor antenna to a coax cable.<p>&gt;BTW, you can even run Wi-Fi over a random, abandoned RG-58 TV coax in the wall by simply connecting a suitable coax adapter. Some will mention the problem of impedance mismatch, but it&#x27;s negligible [0]. The downside is that MIMO is not possible, only 1T1R is possible, and 150 Mbps is the best possible speed for 802.11n (but I wonder if it&#x27;s possible to use a mixer at both ends to convert the second antenna port to a different frequency, so both bands can operate simultaneously in a single coax cable with a duplexer for MIMO).<p>This reminds me of a hack we did at work. We needed to connect the networks of two of our labs without going through the  official IT equipment (don&#x27;t ask). The difficulty was one of the labs is a Faraday cage, so essentially no accessible ways of routing cables in and out. However, we do optics research so we had some fiber connections between the labs, they are a limited resource though. What we ended up doing was connecting a media converter to use the fiber connections. But ethernet over fiber uses separate fibers for duplexing and the fibers between labs are a limited resource. We ended up using a circulator (which essentially separates the forward and backward transmission from a fiber into two fibers), and used a single fiber for full-duplex without issues.<p>Take home message, if you have enough SNR (the media converter bridges are designed for 15 km) you can get away with all sorts of hacks.')
