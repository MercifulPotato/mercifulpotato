Such a disappointment after being such an awesome company early on.<p>100% agreed. I&#x27;ve had a lot of admiration for Google&#x27;s technical prowess over the years, but their products just don&#x27;t excite me anymore like it used to during Google&#x27;s hey-days (Gmail, News, Maps or whatever new service they came up with). They&#x27;ve completely flatlined and they just seem... dull nowadays. It&#x27;s honestly surprising they haven&#x27;t rediscovered themselves given the amount of talent available at Google.')
