You can’t go very far with just throwing strings around (or bytes).  You can’t safely refactor, say, Java code like you can do in Intellij.<p>Maybe you can piece something together manually that does the same thing, eventually.  But if you have to do all of that work yourself then I wouldn’t call it integrated.')
