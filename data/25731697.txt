The implications of Trump being disappeared from the modern internet, however, are very troubling. He&#x27;s a sitting world leader, but Zuckerberg, Dorsey, Bezos, Cook and Pichai snap their fingers and he is effectively erased from the internet almost overnight. Of course Twitter should be able to block him, they&#x27;re a private company, he can go to another network. But when he goes to another network (Parler) it&#x27;s shut down with 24hrs notice by Amazon. To anyone who&#x27;s the least bit of a political dissident, alarm bells should be screaming in your ears. If a handful of tech execs can (and will) do this to the US president, what chance would you stand against them, or anyone, if they want to silence you?<p>My technical question: What would it take to stay online in a situation like this? Twitter&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;Reddit etc. are out, running your own network on AWS is out, Cloudflare DDOS protection is probably out.<p>Would it be possible to host your political views on any commercial hosting vendor in this case? Is running a server at home enough, assuming you can avoid DOS somehow? Would you have to start your own ISP, and if so, could your ISP be kicked off the backbone?<p>I&#x27;m interested in this as a technical (<i>not political</i>) question: is there any way to speak online if big tech decides they don&#x27;t want you to?')
