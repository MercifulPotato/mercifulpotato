Item(by='klyrs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603646013, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24887323, text='The negative correlation between NJ and AK is curious.  What I&#x27;d like to see here (and in all of these forecast sites) is some confidence analysis.  If you pick Trump in NJ, looking at the plots, you&#x27;ve selected a tiny fraction of the data to examine.  Who cares if the predicted value is wonky; show me the confidence interval!<p>Treating this as a tea-leaf reading (that is, deliberately searching for meaning via free association, without investing it with a truth value) I&#x27;m reminded of the &quot;own the libs&quot; meme.  I see folks on foxnews.com comments bragging about it; I see lefties complaining about it, but I suspect that it&#x27;s overblown and not actually a driver behind people&#x27;s decision-making.  But that&#x27;s what comes up for me when I see &quot;NJ goes Trump&quot; forcing &quot;AK goes Biden&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m amused by the resulting thought experiment... if dems started airing &quot;socialists for Trump&quot; campaigns in otherwise safe GOP states, would it move the needle there?  Even sillier: if you aired those ads in NJ, would it move the needle in AK?')
