People look like other people. There has to be more to suspect someone than just what their face looks like.<p>If the police make an arrest based on facial recognition alone they have essentially given up doing police work and are just following suggestions that a computer makes. If that&#x27;s what society chooses to use for justice then fire all the police officers and employ some minimum wage workers to do the job instead.')
