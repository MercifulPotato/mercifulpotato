You can either call functions (and you don&#x27;t have access to the call stack), jump backward to a previously defined block entry point or jump forward to the end of a previously defined block. Threading then requires a double indirection in the core loop, and you have to use an explicit IP &quot;register&quot; in a global variable.')
