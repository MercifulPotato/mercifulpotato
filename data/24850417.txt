Anecdotally, a lot of folks on the talon slack seem to be refugees from Dragon-based solutions, and a common observation is that Talon&#x27;s voice recognition is much lower-latency than Dragon. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t confirm this as I haven&#x27;t used Dragon myself.<p>My impression of talon&#x27;s speech recognition is that it&#x27;s good enough for voice coding, but could be improved when it comes to dictating English prose. That said, there are promising avenues of improvement. If you pay for the Talon beta, there&#x27;s a more advanced voice recognition engine available that&#x27;s much better at English, and you can also hook into Chrome&#x27;s voice recognition for dictation.')
