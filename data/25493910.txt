Across history you will find slaves that were treated well, accumulated wealth, were educated and held in high regard - yet they still legally were the <i>property of another person</i>. The fundamental distinction with slavery is not a bad paycheck.<p>In this case, the distinction wasn&#x27;t a bad paycheck either. The compensation was fine <i>on paper</i>, it just wasn&#x27;t actually paid out, which is plain fraud. If the response of these workers is to ransack the place, that just tells you how bad&#x2F;corrupt the legal system must be.')
