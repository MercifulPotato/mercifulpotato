Obviously a 0.1% effective vaccine won&#x27;t be able to attain herd immunity.  Within a set of simplified assumptions, you need to stop 60% of the transmission to get fewer infected each generation from a R0=2.5 disease, and vaccines with less than 60% efficacy against transmission cannot stop 60% of the transmission themselves (though they certainly would still help).')
