The exchange rate between USD and other currencies fluctuates about as much as USD&#x2F;BTC.\n2. The exchange rate between BTC and other currencies is relatively stable, or at least uncorrelated to the USD&#x2F;BTC rate.<p>But in fact you see neither of these. So either (1) all developed-market currencies are seeing massive fluctuations that are all somehow perfectly correlated with each other, or (2) BTC is the one that&#x27;s fluctuating, not USD.')
