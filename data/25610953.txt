It wasn’t “reform” at all; courts had already ruled mass telecom surveillance illegal under “general warrant” provisions of the constitution. The programs were being shut down. The FREEDOM act “fixed” this and reauthorized the program by requiring FISA warrants to target specific “persons”—but here’s the catch: “person” was defined as per the FISA Act, where “Verizon” and “AT&amp;T” are “persons”. So this wasn’t reform, the net effect was the same, but now the government just needed a warrant for each telecom company rather than having authorization to just spy on all of them at once. Read the bill... I absolutely couldn’t believe anyone was calling this “reform”.<p>As for EFF’s support of this horrible bill, link is here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;deeplinks&#x2F;2015&#x2F;05&#x2F;usa-freedom-act-passes-what-we-celebrate-what-we-mourn-and-where-we-go-here" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;deeplinks&#x2F;2015&#x2F;05&#x2F;usa-freedom-act-passes...</a>')
