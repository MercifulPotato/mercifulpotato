Out of a group of 4 tech people that I spoke about privacy, one is concerned but won&#x27;t go further than having an iPhone (even if he knows privacy is just marketing from Apple) and the others though they have the technical knowledge to make some changes really don&#x27;t care.<p>One even told me that he wished Google knew him better so some functionalities worked better for him.<p>The non tech people don&#x27;t even let me talk to them about privacy. I lost half my Whatsapp contacts that didn&#x27;t want to install Signal.<p>&gt; But at $15&#x2F;hr, even just an hour a week is $780 a year. That&#x27;s real money.<p>Please stop with this meme that every second of one&#x27;s life is equal to some amount of money.<p>For example I&#x27;m learning Flutter on my spare time right now. It doesn&#x27;t cost me a dime because otherwise I would watch YouTube videos or some other unproductive activities.<p>If you push it too far soon you&#x27;re going to calculate how much sleep &quot;costs&quot; you!')
