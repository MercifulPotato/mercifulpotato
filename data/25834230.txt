I deliberately chose not to write a WYSIWYG editor in order to keep the files plain text and as simple as possible. I&#x27;ve written a WYSIWYG editor before, and didn&#x27;t like the result. I guess having to use some markup makes it slightly technical in use, but I&#x27;ve also added menu entries and keyboard shortcuts for all the features, so it shouldn&#x27;t be too difficult to get started.</i><p>Q: Did you try some commercial competitors? How would you compare? I understand scrivener is one popular option<p>A: <i>I&#x27;ve used it, yes. It&#x27;s excellent, and perfect if you want a full WYSIWYG editor with a lot of features. I went in a different direction exactly because I wanted something simpler.
