I&#x27;ve had interviews with every company I&#x27;ve applied to when it&#x27;s been for a specific job. I don&#x27;t always get results when I speculatively apply or apply for something which I might not be the best candidate for. But if it&#x27;s something I know, then it&#x27;s as simple as touching up the CV, writing a personalised cover letter about my experience in industry, what I can bring to the company, what I&#x27;m interested in working on etc.<p>People underestimate cover letters so much. Nothing says you&#x27;ve done your research than 300-400 words about <i>why</i> you want the job. Shotgunning CVs to a billion companies is a brute force approach.')
