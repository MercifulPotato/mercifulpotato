This demand might be fulfilled by building new powerplants using renewable sources (since currently that&#x27;s cheaper than fossil or nuclear. However as long as these new sources are connected to a grid which still has non-renewable power plants mining bitcoin will produce as much CO2 as using a washing machine, smelting aluminum or driving a tesla per kWh.<p>Now if (assuming everything else stays constant) for some reason all bitcoin mining stopped the decrease in demand would lead to decrease in production from more expensive (possibly due to regulatory overhead and&#x2F;or subsidies to renewables) more fossil-fuel based energy sources')
