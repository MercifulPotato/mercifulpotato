Their Customer Support page says:<p>&quot;NOTE: Drobo Thunderbolt had been working properly up to RC2 posted on Nov. 11. If your Drobo has a USB port, use this. In the interim we are looking into the issue. &quot;<p>My experience is a combination of kernel panics on startup, volumes not mounted, and not showing a filesystem in the Disk Utility. I was worried I&#x27;d lost all my data until I ran across this and was able to plug one device in via USB. Unfortunately, my Drobo 8D doesn&#x27;t have a USB port, so I&#x27;ll have to wait for a software solution.')
