Leaving my feet out from the duvet seems to help me stay cool and sleep deeply. Might not be for everyone though<p>* a very dark bedroom, bin the blinds and get blackout curtains.<p>* No booze, no caffeine after about 3pm.<p>* Don&#x27;t head a big dinner right before bed<p>* Don&#x27;t drink a load of water for a few hours before bed either, or you&#x27;ll wake up to piss.<p>I think that&#x27;s all pretty standard stuff.')
