I&#x27;d say the best thing is to either ask for a wishlist or simply give an amount of money in some form that is not offensive: giftcard etc. But this varies from person to person. Some people like receiving anything at all and consider it as a token of attention. Know your target before buying up gifts. When I tell family and friends &quot;Please! no gifts for me&quot; I absolutely mean it.')
