If so, they might not engage with you because they (like me) aren&#x27;t knowledgeable about such  services&#x2F;activities.<p>It might be helpful to provide a sense of the services&#x2F;resources you&#x27;re offering and some verbiage that fleshes this out a bit.  A quick web search turned this[0], among other stuff up, but I&#x27;m not clear if that&#x27;s even applicable to the communities you wish to serve.<p>While the goals you discuss seem to be both meritorious and have significant potential to help small communities, it might be helpful to provide more concrete examples as to what your services seek to accomplish, and provide some resources to give interested people a better understanding of what &quot;planning and economic development&quot; actually entails.<p>What you&#x27;re proposing seems to have a lot of potential and could help smaller communities to prosper.  I hope you have much success!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ashland.or.us&#x2F;Page.asp?NavID=12061" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ashland.or.us&#x2F;Page.asp?NavID=12061</a><p>Edit: Fixed typo.')
