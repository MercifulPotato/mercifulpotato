After all, someone has to decide what the voting algorithm is, what the chance of being a spammer before you are blocked is, etc.</i><p>I <i>think</i> that what is being suggested is that there be multiple, user-selectable, opt-in providers of crowd-sourced moderation services that are orthogonal to the unfiltered communication platform.<p>Something like the 3rd-party spam filtering services for blog comments or email.<p>I imagine, though, that a 3rd-party &quot;view&quot; of the Twitterverse would also be a Twitter client, have it&#x27;s own web presence, and basically be a white-label version of Twitter. Twitter itself would be largely relegated to being a backend pipe that the different sites have in common for interoperability.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine how these federated Twitter clones would themselves be able to provide a curated experience without running into the same liability problems.<p>The alternative is that these optional collaborative moderation services are somehow integrated into Twitter itself, which, while not impossible, poses some serious issues of combinatorial complexity, scalability, and sustainability.')
