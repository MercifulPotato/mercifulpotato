Because every GPU vendor has a different notion of what a &quot;core&quot; is. Some count the smallest parallel execution unit as a &quot;core&quot; and thus boast chips with thousands of &quot;cores&quot;, some group these smallest units into larger units and count those as a &quot;core&quot;, which results in smaller numbers of &quot;cores&quot; per chip. I would guess Apple is doing the latter. I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s possible to deliver the graphics performance the M1 is delivering with just eight &quot;cores&quot; in terms of smallest computational units.')
