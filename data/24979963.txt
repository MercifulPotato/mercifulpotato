And if you do treat them like data centers, it’s going to cost a lot more than just running a data center.<p>And if you decide to switch from AWS to Azure or GCP or Oracle, what happens to all your engineers who specialize in AWS? Are they going to forget everything they know and go learn something brand new and start from scratch? Or are they going to just quit and find a job working with AWS that they already know? You’re already locked in to every tech decision you make, and if you make the decision to not be locked in, you’re locked in to only vendors who don’t have lock-in which is a form of lock-in itself. Either way you’re gonna be paying a lot more than your competitors who are just focused on running their business.<p>It’s wishy-washy lack of decision making. No one cares about your tech stack, just pick one and get back to running your business.')
