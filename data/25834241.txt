It is true that a free society will have more protests and unrest, sometimes violently, but that doesn&#x27;t change the promise that a free country is less likely to have a multi-year civil war or government led genocide in a decade. Given that four people died at the Capitol and millions typically die in wars, that&#x27;s a trade-off I&#x27;m willing to make. \nThe argument for free speech typically doesn&#x27;t claim it&#x27;s better than an optimal world where only truthful and productive speech is possible, just that it&#x27;s better than what you _actually get_ in practice if you attempt to only allow truthful speech, which is handing unchecked power to the people making that judgement.')
