Everyone would collectively perhaps be better off with pulling out of or at least scaling back on big industry shows. But that doesn&#x27;t mean it makes sense for <i>just you</i> to pull out. (And, certainly, your events team probably isn&#x27;t going to push for scaling back.)<p>There&#x27;s also a huge mutual back-scatching thing going on. I remember in a former life we wanted to pass on a big software vendor&#x27;s user group show because, while we sort of needed their software for some important customers, we got <i>very</i> little traffic at this expensive event. Their CEO called our CEO and basically said to him &quot;Be a pity if something happened to our partnership.&quot;')
