Unfortunately, it&#x27;s no longer open to the community. Now my new hope is HardenedBSD [0], which has a roadmap to independently implement all major PaX&#x2F;grsec features, but there is no ETA.<p>&gt;&gt; <i>Anyway, I&#x27;m typing this as I sit across the street from a cybercafe so note not to waste your time backtracing. This is my job, don&#x27;t take it personal. sincerely and respectfully.</i><p>&gt; <i>It&#x27;s tough not to (especially since all this went down while three hurricanes were headed our way) but I guess that&#x27;s what I get for living in a Gibsonian novel these days.</i><p>Cyberpunk is now!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hardenedbsd.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hardenedbsd.org&#x2F;</a>')
