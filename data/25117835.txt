The network and sound drivers did not work out of the box on any version of Linux I tried. Ubuntu install process would not even complete. Pop! did come up, but no sound or network. I borrowed an old USB network adapter and was able to get most everything working once I had access to the internet.<p>The sound still breaks after every kernel update though as the drivers continue to evolve. I&#x27;ve been running Linux on my desktop for twenty years now, and I couldn&#x27;t suggest anyone who hasn&#x27;t to try a Linux on a next-gen motherboard as it is pretty much always a disaster for a year or two.')
