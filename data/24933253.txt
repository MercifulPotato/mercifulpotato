And when non-Arctic peoples tried their hands in the region without similar adaptations, the result tended to be &quot;everyone dies,&quot; as in the Shackleton and Franklin expeditions.<p>Note that there are places on Earth we haven&#x27;t been able to successfully inhabit. For example, somewhere around 17,000 feet appears to be the maximum possible altitude for permanent human habitation.')
