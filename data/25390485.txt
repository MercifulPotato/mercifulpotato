My complaint is just that even the simplest tasks, like word processing, end up taking orders of magnitude more computing power (or just don&#x27;t work very well).  The average commercial web page is an extreme example of this - I&#x27;d rather go back to mid-90s layouts and animated GIFs than endure most news sites.  (I wonder how much of the demand for steady increases in computing speed was simply driven by the need to slam the consumer with as many advertisements as possible.)<p>But yes, it is impressive that my $500 phone blows away the $50,000 workstations I started on.')
