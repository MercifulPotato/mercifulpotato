GitHub for its part helped kill them and then salted the earth, tooâ€”it&#x27;s hardly possible to even talk about &quot;wikis&quot; anymore, because it&#x27;s not clear whether a person is actually referring to a <i>wiki</i> wiki, or &quot;some loose leaf Markdown that exists in a repo somewhere (but it&#x27;s not necessarily clear where), and that&#x27;s unlikely to allow direct editing without approval&quot;.  The latter flies in the face of the very etymology of the word.<p>(To be fair, the same velocity-diminishing forces are at play in the typical practices for using GitHub to collaborate on code, too, but people are even less sensitive to that than they are about wikis.)')
