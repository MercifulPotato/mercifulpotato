There are racists who see whiter people as more beautiful, or darker (specially indigenous) people as lesser, but hate is extremely rare and frowned upon.<p>It&#x27;s the hate part that I can&#x27;t wrap my head around. Xenophobic tribes maybe hate visitors for their race, but they also could reject them for their effect in neighboring tribes, we don&#x27;t know.<p>TL;DR: I can understand if people find Scottish people attractive, or Mexican people ugly, but I am indeed guilty of not understanding how people can actually grow hate from that.')
