None of them really meshed well with what I was used to doing with Camtasia (on Windows) or Resolve. They were all too limiting[0] in one way or another for the types of videos I create.<p>Resolve would be perfect if it worked with my set up. I hope one day it gets there.<p>[0]: I don&#x27;t make cinema style movies. Mainly 1080p screencasts. So things like nice looking titles, simple animations, zooming &#x2F; panning, adding overlays of various shapes and sizes, blurs, etc. are really important to me. Nothing I tried on Linux really comes close to how easy it is to do that stuff with Camtasia and make it look nice. Resolve is pretty close tho, after you put in enough time to build up your own custom libraries.')
