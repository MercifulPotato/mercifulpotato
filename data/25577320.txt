Bitcoin&#x27;s value lies in how many people want to link their net worth together.<p>Tesla actually has some sort of future final value, at some point it&#x27;s going to be clear how many cars they&#x27;re going to sell, how many engines and batteries and solar panels and AI modules and whatnot. At that point they&#x27;re gonna pay dividends, and that&#x27;s gonna decide a reasonable price point. And its current share price just doesn&#x27;t make sense. What are people going to do when they receive 7 cents dividend per year on their 700 dollar stocks?<p>Or is TSLA going to pull an Apple and constantly come up with different types of devices to sell? Forever?')
