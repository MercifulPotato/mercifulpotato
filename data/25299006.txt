Not a bad machine - it&#x27;s still going after several Ubuntu updates, and currently powers the kid&#x27;s screen time.  There were some annoyances that kept it from being my main coding machine - it was bulky, battery life is nowhere near as good as a MBP, the keyboard felt like it was off-center (probably because it, unlike many other laptops, has a numpad), and the trackpad gives next to no feedback.  But it&#x27;s a well-made machine that&#x27;s kept going.<p>It disappeared from System76&#x27;s lineup for several years.  I wonder how the new ones compare with the old.')
