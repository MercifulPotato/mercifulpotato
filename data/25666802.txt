The claim was made that all religion is based on misinformation.<p>I argued that that claim is wrong.<p>Someone responded saying, &quot;find one true account that religion is based on&quot;.  I responded asking whether they could find an account that is proven false.<p>The context here is important--I&#x27;m not arguing my belief in religion, or that you must believe in religion.  I&#x27;m arguing that not all religion is based on misinformation.  I brought up my question to point out that his question is irrelevant, and he can&#x27;t prove anything to be false, therefore he can&#x27;t prove that it&#x27;s all misinformation.<p>If I see a bird fly over my head, then claim to you, &quot;a bird flew over my head&quot;, I can&#x27;t prove it.  Neither can you disprove it.  That doesn&#x27;t mean it didn&#x27;t happen, or that my claim isn&#x27;t real, or that my claim is misinformation.<p>~2000 years ago people witnessed Christ die and some claim they saw Him come back to life.  They wrote about it.  Those letters still exist today.  I agree that this information alone is not enough to justify someone changing their life to believe the letters--merely existing doesn&#x27;t &quot;prove&quot; that what&#x27;s in them is true.  But pretend for a second it <i>really</i> did happen.  What evidence&#x2F;proof do you think you&#x27;d find that could prove it?<p>This is honestly getting watered down a lot though, with people jumping in without reading everything.  I don&#x27;t blame them--I do the same on HN.<p>If someone wishes to discuss why I personally believe, and what I believe in, that&#x27;s a different thing altogether that I&#x27;m happy to discuss but not here on HN.')
