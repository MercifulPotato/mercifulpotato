I&#x27;ve also been waiting 3 years for it, and am probably getting impatient. I think it worries me that there still isn&#x27;t any scheduled release date. And what has happened is as a user of Java, no framework has been able to develop in that time around a fiber or coroutine model, where in other languages, like C#, the TAP model has had ample time to develop and for libraries and framework to transition to it, best practices to occur, etc. While on Java we&#x27;re still waiting.<p>Now, I actually still believe Java is doing the right thing (hence the name). And the right thing if successful is more right, thus the name. And you make a good point in that Java is already popular and can probably afford to take a really long time to bring a better async story to its table.<p>But lately I&#x27;ve been wondering if Loom can fail? It seems to still somewhat be experimental, is there any chance it wouldn&#x27;t ship? That after all the hard work, it doesn&#x27;t get merged into OpenJDK? Maybe it turns out to be more hassle, break too much user code, be too difficult to bring back to Graal, or fail to be natively compiled by Substrate, etc.<p>Hopefully not, and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re more aware then anyone of the risks here. And I trust you and the team working on Loom. But sometimes seeing what&#x27;s happening and being done in C# and other languages, I do stop and wonder if worse is better, but when Loom does arrive (if ever?), I&#x27;ll probably be happy that this was the route Java took.')
