So if we count all possible sequential combinations, N, we&#x27;ll know that the chance of a single winning combination being sequential is N&#x2F;42,375,200.<p>Say the powerball comes out as any number 6 &lt;= M &lt;= 20. There are 6 ways the numbers 1-45 could be picked such that M is part of the sequence. That&#x27;s 90 ways total. If the powerball is 5, there are only 5 ways, same continuing down to a powerball of 1 where there&#x27;s only 1 combination of numbers 1-45 where it could be part of the sequence. 90 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 brings us to 105 as our N.<p>So this single event had a probability of 105&#x2F;42,375,200, or 1&#x2F;403,573. This means that for similar lotteries one would expect to see a sequence after about 200,000 picks.<p>EDIT: If you only count events where the powerball is the high number, as happened this time, N goes down to 15, making the odds 1&#x2F;2,825,013, so one would expect such a sequence after about 1.4 million picks.')
