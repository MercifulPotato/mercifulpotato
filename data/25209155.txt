Many worked for a while. I&#x27;ve lost &gt; 100 pounds four times ... before gaining it back.<p>Now I&#x27;m trying something new that&#x27;s working quiet well so far, 30 pounds down in 2.5 months. The real difference is that eating this way transforms me into a non-fat person behavioraly: I now stop eating when I&#x27;m full, which was a magic act only other people could do before. And now I just eat once or twice per day, not out of willpower, but because now that&#x27;s all I want.<p>You may not want to hear about the food that does this for me. I sure didn&#x27;t. As desperate as I&#x27;ve been, until recently I just closed my ears to it. It&#x27;s a bad fit for me culturally, by taste (previously), training, and experience. But now I love it, and not just because it&#x27;s working so well:<p>Meat. And organs. Mostly beef. High fat. I went carnivore. It seemed gross and impossible back when I was a raw vegan. Now here I am. And it&#x27;s not just the weight. It has cleared up multiple digestive and inflammatory issues. It started as a one month cleanse but I&#x27;m not tempted to stop.<p>Many times a diet has worked for me because I was coming to it from a bad diet, and anything that got me off of junk food would have worked. Not this time. I had been on a clean very low carb diet for years, and managed to gain lots of weight on it after a large initial loss. Carnivore seeems to be reversing that, fingers crossed.')
