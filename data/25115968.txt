I ate the same amount of food but cooked myself and healthier. I lost almost 10 lbs just by not eating processed food. It&#x27;s quite scary to think how our diet in America leans so heavy to processed food (deli meat, our bread has sugar, etc). I highly recommend what others are mentioning to eat frozen veggies and chicken breast that are super easy to meal prep and cost effective (Costco sell these at ridiculously low price). It won&#x27;t be as fast as calorie counting but cutting 50 calories a day for two years can cut 15 lbs.')
