Item(by='thaumasiotes', descendants=None, kids=[24916330, 24916054], score=None, time=1603865295, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24915691, text='&gt; Of course some believe that Vitamin D is a substance only required to prevent rickets, while others have assigned it all kinds of different roles<p>The phrasing there is a little weird. Conceptually you wouldn&#x27;t expect Vitamin D to have the function &quot;preventing rickets&quot;, in the same way that the function of Vitamin C is not &quot;preventing scurvy&quot;. Vitamin C does several things, and the different failures of those different things manifest as different symptoms of scurvy. Scurvy is what happens when you don&#x27;t have enough Vitamin C, as rickets is what happens when you don&#x27;t have enough Vitamin D.')
