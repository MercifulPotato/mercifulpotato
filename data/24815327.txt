A database might go down for any reason.<p>I also have daily backups, but I write logs (locally and regularly copy from the production server) for all database actions to disk for the purpose of checking through them if something goes wrong, or having the option to replay them encase something like this happens. SO you have your database backups as &quot;save points&quot; and the logs to replay all the &quot;actions&quot; for that day.')
