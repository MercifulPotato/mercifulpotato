You can say that, superficially, C++ is also just “C with types”.  You can write “C in C++” and ignore the types, as many developers do, and risk runtime crashes or errors.<p>I have to deal with this sort of code on a daily basis.   When I talk to the people who wrote that code, they mostly shrug and say that C++ was too complicated for them, they just used what they know.<p>The flip side of this is people (like me) who know C++ pretty well, keep track of most of the advanced features, and use them semi-regularly.  Unfortunately, this effectively creates a barrier to entry to those same other devs.  You can blame those other devs all you want for not keeping track of the language, but what if they don’t want to and have other, more important thing in their lives than to keep track of the language?  So I’ve come to the conclusion that in my opinion the problem is you (or in that case, me), not them.   If you want your code to be long lived and maintainable you have to take the people around you into account. I’ve come to consciously limit the number of C++ features I use in code other people see to a bare minimum.')
