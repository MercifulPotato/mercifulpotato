The sweet things in life are all the things you sacrificed in the process of re-making yourself in the image of the machine you built and are part of. Get the fuck out of the bay area and start over as an artist and mystic, or just hang out with some. Find a wife among ordinary people and make babies like some blissful idiot. Learn a musical instrument. I dunno. Do things hippies say to do. The purpose of life seems to be life itself, so you would at least be making more lives, or making existing ones more pleasant. Care about others intrinsically for no reason, and most will care about you. That&#x27;s all anybody wants, is to be cared for and loved. Thus far you only cared about accumulating money (or that&#x27;s the only care you acted on) and anyone who cares about you probably cares only because of that, even if only as an example so they can learn how to accumulate money too. It&#x27;s what you&#x27;ve been about, thus far, and have dedicated your life to, thus far. Congratulations on being an expert in something but now you should be a beginner.')
