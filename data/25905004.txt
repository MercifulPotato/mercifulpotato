The sarcastic reply is that lawyers don&#x27;t need more money. The more serious reply is that the work a lawyer does doesn&#x27;t increase the &quot;value output&quot; (I don&#x27;t know the formal term) the same way that an engineer or researcher or teacher does. A lawyer, like an economist,  helps grease the transactions of a society, but if society is already greased, the lawyer could be doing something directly &quot;useful&quot;.')
