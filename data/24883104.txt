Now imagine 18 different scientist, from their respective fields, writing research papers using their preferred notation.<p>Sure, there&#x27;s going to be a lot of overlap - but there&#x27;s still room for confusion, even for seasoned engineers and scientists.<p>(I just used ML and DL as an example, because that&#x27;s the field where I&#x27;ve noticed the most of this - because of the nature of those fields)')
