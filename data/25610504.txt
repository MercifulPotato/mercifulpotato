Companies know they have unfair leverage on employees dependent on sponsored visas. Employees on sponsored visas have very little options and next to no rights, in this case the author felt suicide might be their only way out.<p>&gt; This is a good example of why the arbitrary system of nations restricting free trade by deciding who is allowed to work where is a method specifically designed to aid in this type of exploitation.<p>Not really. Only nontransferable sponsored visas tied to specific employers (or ones with terms so short that they&#x27;re effectively the same) have this exploitation problem.  You don&#x27;t have to go all open borders to fix this, you just need to give sponsored immigrants just as much job-hopping freedom as permanent residents already have.')
