Some of those solutions don&#x27;t prevent you from publishing multiple versions of the message and only revealing one however.<p>On the other hand if you&#x27;re trying to show that you <i>did something</i> (not just authored a message) at a given time, it&#x27;s a bit harder, because you can always notarize the video long after it has been recorded. The best way to deal with this one (in the absence of trusted parties that might attend in-person) might be to do it in a public place e.g. in the library while a specific event is happening, on the street while some specific work is being done, in front of a newspaper stand in a shop etc. However I can see any of those faked using video editing.')
