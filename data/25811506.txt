What matters is whether they shun you or include you in the moment. Perhaps they don&#x27;t really even notice you enough to care if you&#x27;re awkward or they just know you&#x27;re so awkward and &quot;other&quot; that there&#x27;s no point in keeping track of yet another awkward moment of yours. It doesn&#x27;t mean their perceptions don&#x27;t influence your life.')
