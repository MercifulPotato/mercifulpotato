You can find almost anything in AUR, including all the proprietary crap, and install it all with one command. It&#x27;s also very easy to write a PKGBUILD and upload it to AUR if you don&#x27;t find what you need, because the package format is so much simpler.</i><p>I&#x27;m a Debian fan, but these two points are very true. Arch documentation is great, and writing PKGBUILD files is easier than packaging for distribution via Apt. I don&#x27;t even use Arch, but I still release for it because it&#x27;s easy.')
