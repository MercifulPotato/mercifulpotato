Lasted about 3 years, - the UI was just not the same. Then I went to MacOS. The MacOS UI is great, but the runtime for C++, various software packages is cumbersome. Not to mention the absence of a CUDA environment in MacOS (MacBook pro)! Now, I have a hybrid setup: all UI is done on MacOS, all runtime is done on Ubuntu desktop. PyCharm remote server (Ubuntu desktop in my case) works like a charm.')
