Item(by='chmod775', descendants=None, kids=[25070866], score=None, time=1605190983, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25069553, text='&gt; Nothing is really at no cost. It is paid for with tax money or directly.\n&gt; The author is not specifying &quot;for those who could not otherwise afford it&quot;, but describing it as at no cost for everyone.<p>The author never specified whether or how things are paid for, but for me personally I am assuming tax money. He also leaves open whether luxury goods&#x2F;foods are still paid for.<p>&gt; Show me that country or even that city please. Show me the social experiment, that tries to get people to work without pay, as long as they have access to &quot;all the things we need in our daily lives&quot;. As far as I know, it has never been done.<p>Why are you asking me to show you something I never claimed existed?<p>I claimed there&#x27;s places with social security (housing, food) and free public transport (Luxembourg for instance).<p>&gt; So that&#x27;s why I call it pure fiction.<p>Anything that doesn&#x27;t exist yet is fiction.<p>It seems that you both misunderstood the article <i>and</i> my comment, then tried to maneuver me into a position where I would defend something nobody ever claimed.<p>To be fair, the author leaves a lot of things unexplained, so one&#x27;s imagination is going to fill in the gaps.<p>Personally I imagined a city where basic necessities are provided for free, but where you have to pay for anything that is a cut above. Greatly expanded social security essentially.')
