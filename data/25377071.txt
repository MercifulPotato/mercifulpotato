In my experience, hobby programming has become like a video game i&#x27;ve already played a million times, there&#x27;s nothing new or fun, it&#x27;s just rote and tedious.<p>Like other comments state, i have also opted to see this as a part of my own growth path, and making peace with this &quot;loss of spark&quot; has opened up many other doors and opportunities.<p>In short, there&#x27;s more to life than programming.')
