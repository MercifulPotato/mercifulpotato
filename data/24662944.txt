The three most &quot;modern&quot; and popular linux &quot;package managers&quot; made in the last decade (Snap, Flatpak, Docker) all bias toward static linking and sandboxing (in the case of docker, forced sandboxing, but the others are opt-in).<p>Sidenote: I include docker as a package manager in that list because recently I actually ran into a very large and popular command line application that, per their documentation, <i>prefers</i> distribution and execution via docker over anything else: aws-cli. They don&#x27;t keep any other linux package managers up to date, despite <i>having</i> a package in snap and distributing a .tar.gz. They recommend invoking it via docker. Rather interesting, and I&#x27;m surprised we haven&#x27;t seen a frontend for &quot;docker as a pm&quot; gain traction, to increase usability over &quot;go into your .bashrc and alias aws=docker run aws&#x2F;aws-cli:latest $*&quot;')
