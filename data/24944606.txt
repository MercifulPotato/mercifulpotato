They&#x27;re so situationally dependent and can rely on social signaling.<p>If traffics is light, it&#x27;s pretty easy of course. But get into congested areas and you pretty much have to be at least somewhat aggressive and even take things like Pittsburgh lefts. And if you&#x27;re not at least somewhat aggressive, cars behind you can start honking horns and taking dangerous actions because, from their perspective, you&#x27;re blocking the road. (No criticism intended; you have to do what feels comfortable for you.But it&#x27;s probably one of the routine driving tasks that takes the most judgement.)')
