The powerless diplomatic figure that is the monarch does not impact the overall decision making in any meaningful way.<p>Sweden and Canada fit that definition as well, and are not socialist countries according to what Marx meant by socialism. They&#x27;re very much countries with a foundation of ownership rights and private enterprise, but taxed to a certain extent as to fund extensive government welfare programs.
