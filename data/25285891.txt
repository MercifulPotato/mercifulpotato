There are C(50,6) = 15,890,700 possible draws (C(n,k) = binomial coefficient)<p>45 of the draws are made of 6 consecutive numbers (1-2-3-4-5-6, then 2-3-4-5-6-7, etc, until 45-46-47-48-49-50)<p>A single draw has a 45 out of 15,890,700 chances of being 6 consecutive numbers<p>A single draw has a probability of 1-(45&#x2F;15,890,700) of NOT being 6 consecutive numbers<p>Assuming 1000 draws (lotteries) per day, in a year we expect probability (1-(45&#x2F;15,890,700))^(1000*365) = 36% that none of the lotteries draw 6 consecutive numbers<p>So there is a 64% probability that at least one lottery will draw 6 consecutive numbers in a year. If there are 1000 draws per week (instead of per day) the probability is still 17% that this will happen in a year.<p>So this South African draw is kinda expected.')
