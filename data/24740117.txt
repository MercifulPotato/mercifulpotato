For example:<p><pre><code>    enum Animal {\n        Dog,\n        Cat,\n        Pigeon\n    }\n    let pet = Animal::Dog;\n    let sound = match pet {\n        Animal::Dog =&gt; String::from(&quot;ouaf&quot;),\n        Animal::Cat =&gt; String::from(&quot;miaou&quot;)\n    };\n</code></pre>\nThis would not compile, because you&#x27;ve forgotten to cover the pigeon. You would need to either add one of the two lines below:<p><pre><code>    Animal::Pigeon =&gt; String::from(&quot;rou rou&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nor<p><pre><code>    _ =&gt; String::from(&quot;eeeeeeeeeeeei&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nThe last line is a catch all, which would cover anything not checked for explicitly.')
