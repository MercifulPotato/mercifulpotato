Nonetheless, the world will see a popular first-world society reduced to rubble, and other first-world societies will see themselves in the wreckage.<p>No matter the excuse, there&#x27;s no way there won&#x27;t be a mass reaction afterwards. Sure, other countries may well avoid taking direct part in the immediate hostilities, but soon after you&#x27;ll see a counter-block if only due to realist concerns (after all, if China can get away with that the world is <i>already</i> multi-polar).<p>If war happens, I expect an attempt at a quick military win and slow starvation if and only if the ordinary military efforts outright fail; And the alternative being humiliating defeat which the CCP can&#x27;t afford, and the CCP doesn&#x27;t get some face saving way to climb down.<p>IMHO, at any other scenario it&#x27;s better for the CCP to sacrifice men and win in an ordinary manner than to get much of the world to unite against it.')
