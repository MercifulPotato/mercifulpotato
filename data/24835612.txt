I posted here about this before, but almost exactly four years ago a friend and I put on a concert of our own favorite Tom Lehrer songs to great enthusiasm. By what must be total coincidence, just a few days ago I had posted some videos of that concert to youtube, keeping my fingers crossed they wouldn&#x27;t get copystriked... and now I wake up to this. I knew of his permissive attitude toward copyright, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting him to make it official.<p>Mr. Lehrer, thank you for brightening our lives.')
