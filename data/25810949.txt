His only reason is that an attacker can steal his laptop with the key plugged in. That’s a user error.<p>I much rather have Yubikey over all other forms of security because it simply forces the attacker to be physically present. Why is that important? Because even if your laptop is stolen with your Yubikey at a local Starbucks, you’re more likely to catch that person versus a completely remote attack. Security isn’t just about attacks. You also need to think about mitigation and recovery following the attack.')
