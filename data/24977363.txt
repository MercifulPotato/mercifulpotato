Linus didn&#x27;t write it for x86 originally.<p>What the hell is this nonsense?<p>Linus was working on a terminal program for his 386 with native x86 task switching and that&#x27;s the origin story of Linux.  It&#x27;s clearly recorded on the wikipedia page for the kernel, and he speaks to this in Just For Fun IIRC.')
