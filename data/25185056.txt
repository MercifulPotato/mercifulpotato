This is one big reason why natural queries such as &quot;what&#x27;s the population of US&quot; are of importance to Google.<p>However, almost no websites or mobile applications have this feature. Why is that? Is it due to bad developers tools for building voice search (eg. bad usability), because product managers still don&#x27;t believe in it, because initial testing showed that people want to stop using voice after they land to the website or what is it? \nWhat do you think? Have you tried voice search on your application or website?')
