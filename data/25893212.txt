The problem is our culture is being eroded away with each minute spent using the internet.<p>I struggle with this problem daily - as a web developer, my job is to fight for people&#x27;s attention. I strive to build as good of a UX as possible and serve interesting content to users in the name of getting more clicks, more ad impressions, and more revenue. This is happening at a global scale, with ever more companies fighting over the individual&#x27;s attention span to make a buck. Attention is a finite resource. If we capture 2 hours of your day, then you lose 2 hours you could have spent making friends at a local volunteer group while improving your community. I feel like we&#x27;re cannibalizing society.<p>All that being said, I think online communities are a wonderful thing, but psychologically, they lack something important. People feel lonelier than ever while having more access to new communities of like-minded people than ever before.<p>I&#x27;m hoping VR&#x2F;AR helps bridge this gap, but this in-between phase we&#x27;re in is just kind of depressing.')
