I feel incredibly lucky, but also, a tiny bit guilty. I have very minimal patient contact, and I could not help but wonder if by taking the vaccine, I was depriving someone more needy of the vaccine. In the end, I decided that due to inevitable bureaucratic&#x2F;managerial inefficiencies, any action I take would not materially affect when non-hospital employees begin to get vaccinated, and that by getting vaccinated could potentially prevent me from spreading the virus in the future. Who knows whether I made the most ethical choice, but at least, I tell myself, I considered the question.<p>edit: I would add that telling friends and family that I got vaccinated actually uplifted their spirits: It seemed to give them hope that this would all end. Its different when people you know get it, versus hearing about it on the news.')
