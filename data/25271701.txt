It is the meaning given to the word by casuistry&#x27;s critics, or rather probably the critics of the Jesuits, as they used the technique a lot in the past.<p>A &#x27;fuller&#x27; defintion:<p>&gt; <i>Casuistry (&#x2F;ˈkæzjuɪstri&#x2F;) is a process of reasoning that seeks to resolve moral problems by extracting or extending theoretical rules from a particular case, and reapplying those rules to new instances.[1] This method occurs in applied ethics and jurisprudence. The term is also commonly used as a pejorative to criticize the use of clever but unsound reasoning, especially in relation to moral questions (as in sophistry).[2] The word casuistry derives from the Latin noun casus (&quot;case&quot; or &quot;occurrence&quot;).</i><p>[…]<p>&gt; <i>Certain kinds of casuistry were criticized by early Protestant theologians, because it was used in order to justify many of the abuses that they sought to reform. It was famously attacked by the Catholic and Jansenist philosopher Pascal, during the formulary controversy against the Jesuits, in his Provincial Letters as the use of rhetorics to justify moral laxity, which became identified by the public with Jesuitism; hence the everyday use of the term to mean complex and sophistic reasoning to justify moral laxity.[14] By the mid-18th century, &quot;casuistry&quot; had become a synonym for specious moral reasoning.[15] However, Puritans were known for their own development of casuistry.[citation needed]</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Casuistry" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Casuistry</a><p>This is&#x2F;was a pretty good overview of the technique through ages:<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ucpress.edu&#x2F;book&#x2F;9780520069602&#x2F;the-abuse-of-casuistry" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ucpress.edu&#x2F;book&#x2F;9780520069602&#x2F;the-abuse-of-casu...</a><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;954645.The_Abuse_of_Casuistry" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;954645.The_Abuse_of_C...</a><p>Old review:<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.journals.uchicago.edu&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1086&#x2F;293127" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.journals.uchicago.edu&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1086&#x2F;293127</a>')
