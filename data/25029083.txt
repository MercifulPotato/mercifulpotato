Essentially you use a dumb secrecy technique (every second letter of every third word). Then put your (secyrely) encrypted message as the payload.<p>The question of interest is &quot;how to generate sentences that allow the most dense insertion of data?&quot;.<p>The best two I saw were:<p>* Used a copy paste (with link) of tweets &#x2F; jokes &#x2F; song lyrics with trite comments around them.<p>* Used an html formatted email with images embedded. The images were fiddled to hold the bulk of the payload and the surrounding sentences were just to describe the image to give it authenticity.<p>The funniest was a dirty poem generator based on an oracled (to inject the payload) monte carlo sim. It ised historic dirty letters and all sorts of poem formats.<p>This was at a hackathon in Hampshire (uk) ~2014')
