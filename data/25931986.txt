At its core it is a web site to share 280 character long strings, but as of recently you cannot do this anymore without JavaScript! They shut down the legacy page at the end of 2020 that was blazing fast and a pleasure to use. And what irritates me the most about their modern Js based mobile page is that it frequently happens that I tap a twitter link on HN which takes forever to load, then it shows two blue spinners one at the top and one in the center and then after another eternity it says &quot;this content isn&#x27;t available&quot;. Then I hit reload, the whole thing repeats and this time the 280 characters display just fine. How? Just how do you end up with this?')
