Entire family on @gmail\n2. All Android phones setup to send photos to a shared family@google account so no one needs to &#x27;send me those pictures from Anon&#x27;s birthday&#x27; - it&#x27;s all getting sent into the same account.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how to seamlessly pull off #2 without trying to lift and move the entire family over to iPhone&#x27;s or something like that.')
