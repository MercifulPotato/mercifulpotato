I’ve still got my Hayne’s and Chilton’s hanging around for cars I don’t own anymore (all US autos from 1988-2010) and this book is by far the thinnest.<p>On top of that, there was NO INFORMATION on the parking brake assembly at all. My buddy, a Ford mechanic, broke the bad news to me, the entire lower side of the dash had to come off. This wasn’t some niche model either, it’s an Explorer, which remained largely unchanged from 2011-2018. The documentation for the dash disassembly was basically three pictures, no exploded diagram of the half dozen trim pieces that all interlock, nothing.<p>Maybe they packed it in a while ago?')
