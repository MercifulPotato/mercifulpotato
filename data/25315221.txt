I don&#x27;t have anything cite other than common sense.<p>We know that case counts generally do not have wild swings. In other words, prior performance indicates future behavior. If the two week moving average of positive case counts is 500 - then we can roughly predict what to expect the following day for positive case counts plus or minus the current infection trend.<p>My experience has been that people who simply get tested are already isolating&#x2F;quarantining. That has been my approach. So if 500 people tested positive then I generally believe those 500 people isolate themselves and they are no longer infecting people because of their quarantine. Then 500ish people show up tomorrow to take their place.<p>That&#x27;s my point. Once people are identified as sick then they aren&#x27;t spreading the disease because of &quot;hey don&#x27;t be a giant dickhead&quot;.')
