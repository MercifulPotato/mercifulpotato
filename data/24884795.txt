Also when you say &#x27;most&#x27; its a slim majority, about 55% which is fair to recognise. And I agree on its own it wont help economically, but this is one tool to help this balance, these things are done in part, not one variable solves all which also needs to be recognised as will it have some positive effect, rather than does it fix the entire issue, if you believe dynastic wealth and intergenerational inequality is in fact an issue as many wouldn&#x27;t.<p>&gt; This will make it very difficult to compete globally in the capital intensive industries.<p>While there is likely some edge cases, helping small business and putting focus there doesn&#x27;t have to be against big business. There is good and bad options within this statements. Monopolistic behaviours aside when I say focus on small business I dont mean restrict larger business. But you can look at rules that level the playing field. For example you could ensure distributors have open order systems so Walmart cant get goods at half the price anyone else can. Or make tax forms efficient so that 10 man business doesn&#x27;t need a full time accountant priced into their small operation type changes.<p>This wont effect the capital intensive industries + will also benefit big business, however the benefit will be felt more for smaller operations.')
