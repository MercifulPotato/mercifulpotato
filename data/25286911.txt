Probably just a subset of the spec. Detailing the hundreds of different feature sizes. There is no way you can compact that into a single three digit number only describing the smallest feature size of the gate. I believe it has been regarded as naming&#x2F;marketing for decades, but the future is not evenly distributed. It used to be indicative of density and denard scaling, but now physics and geometry is more complicated and other factors distorts that relation to such a degree that there is soon more noice than signal in communicating minimum feature size.')
