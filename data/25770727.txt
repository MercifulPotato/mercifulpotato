We believe that the world needs less guns, not more of them. We believe however that these prints will stay on the internets regardless of blocks and censorship, since that&#x27;s how the internets works. If there&#x27;s a lunatic out there who wants to print guns to kill people, he or she will do it. With or without TPB. Better to have these prints out in the open internets (TPB) and up for peer review (the comment threads), than semi hidden in the darker parts of the internet.&quot;<p>-The Pirate Bay<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thepiratebay10.org&#x2F;torrent&#x2F;28522986&#x2F;Liberator_-_First_3D_Printable_Gun" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thepiratebay10.org&#x2F;torrent&#x2F;28522986&#x2F;Liberator_-_Firs...</a>')
