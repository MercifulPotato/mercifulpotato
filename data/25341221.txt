Item(by='propter_hoc', descendants=1, kids=[25342654], score=1, time=1607396794, title='Ask HN: Quoting/invoicing stack for B2B SaaS', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hi HN,<p>We&#x27;re growing pretty fast and just set up a new legal framework for our SaaS with our lawyers. I&#x27;d like to set up a system that does the following:<p>* When we move a client from Demo to Proposal in our CRM, create a quote template<p>* The quote template is cloud-based, includes a statement of work for one-time implementation fee, a bunch of legalese, and an e-signature field<p>* When the client e-signs the quote, the CRM status is updated from Proposal-&gt;Won, a receivable is created in our accounting system, and the client has the option of paying via Stripe.<p>We happen to use Xero and Copper for accounting and CRM, and could switch CRM if needed.<p>I have a friend who works at a much larger organization where they use Zuora CPQ for billing+quoting, and Salesforce as CRM, but that&#x27;s overkill for us. I&#x27;ve also noticed that Stripe is coming out with a quoting tool (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;billing&#x2F;quotes), but it&#x27;s not clear that it&#x27;ll be able to integrate with the CRM or include e-signatures. It looks like Qwilr might work, if we switched from Copper to Pipedrive.<p>In any case, I was wondering what others use for this?')
