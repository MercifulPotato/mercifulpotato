Of course, we can&#x27;t know for sure, but if storage becomes good enough in the next 30 or so years, the lifetime economics of a nuclear plant get pretty bad.<p>That said, maybe the economic risk isn&#x27;t as important as the emissions risk. If renewable + storage doesn&#x27;t work, and we are still running coal plants in 30 years, that&#x27;s probably worse than if renewable + storage works and ratepayers paid for an underutilized nuclear plant.')
