I can&#x27;t be the only one who sees this.<p>Pichai can&#x27;t decide if he wants Google to be a safe space for progressives or a ruthless profit machine. He keeps playing both sides without success or conviction.<p>Icing on the cake - he effectively threw Dean under the bus by questioning his decision. This tells every other manager in the company to ape Pichai&#x27;s indecisiveness and cowardice. Why does Dean even stay? He could trivially attract capital for any venture he might wish to start. His contact list is literally everyone who matters in Silicon Valley.<p>Pichai will continue to get away with it because Google&#x27;s profit machine is on cruise control for now.<p>At some point in the future, Google will get a real CEO and that person will inevitably send out an all-hands that curtly requests anyone who doesn&#x27;t like Google should leave ASAP. At some point, what else can you say? Managers can&#x27;t exist only to change diapers.<p>As for Gebru...the shoe fits. You tried to play chicken with the machine and lost. And the fact that this story won&#x27;t go away bears out how desperate you are to extend your fifteen minutes.')
