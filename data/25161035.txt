If you own the code, there is no reason to let any corporation use you like that. Just change the license to something anti-corporate if you started with too permissive one, it&#x27;ll make it apply to all the new commits and force such corporations to pay for commercial license or stop using it. If you think they are willing to hire you to work on your project, they are even more willing to just pay for it.')
