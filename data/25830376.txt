Watermarking an audio stream like this wouldn&#x27;t require that high of a bit rate. It could easily be hidden &quot;under&quot; the content using coding techniques like direct-sequence spread spectrum.<p>A real world example is GPS, which uses a spreading code to provide about 30 dB of gain. GPS signals aren&#x27;t directly observable relative to the noise floor in many receivers. It&#x27;s not until after the signal is &quot;de-spread&quot; that it becomes observable in a spectrogram. This process requires prior knowledge of the signal structure.<p>In short, if you don&#x27;t need to send data at high rate there are many ways to hide your signal.')
