You&#x27;re asking for them to give you something but they&#x27;re not getting anything in return. When people use Facebook&#x2F;Google etc. they get a service that they end up valuing very highly in return. That common argument of &quot;Give me your phone and PIN&quot; is so pointless because people wouldn&#x27;t even give that stuff to Facebook if it didn&#x27;t give them anything back.<p>We&#x27;ve got to find a better set of arguments that we can use to convince people. I&#x27;m very strongly into privacy rights and I&#x27;m not convinced by this argument. Why would someone who doesn&#x27;t care be convinced?')
