It seems so alien to my pampered US sensibilities, all spoiled by our glorious interstate highway system and regional State highways. How can the vast majority of a country&#x27;s small towns and land area be not even remotely accessible by so much as a dirt road?? I get that few people live there, but the ones that do, how do they go anywhere else in Russia?<p>In the US, most of the country is at most 5-6 miles from some kind of road. Maybe there are spots in Yellowstone that are 20 miles from a road, but thats orders of magnitude less remote than what Maps depicts about Siberia!<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25574180" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25574180</a>')
