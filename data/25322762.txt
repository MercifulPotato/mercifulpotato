What am I missing?</i><p>I am not a webdev either. This is a trivial CSS indeed. I don&#x27;t think you are missing anything. When I posted this on Hacker News, I was hoping some people would like it because they might find it useful. Like I said, I am not really a front-end developer. But I do hack up simple HTML pages together for simple text-based websites from time to time. While doing so, I find myself using this minimal (and trivial) CSS frequently to make the page appear slightly more pleasing compared to what it looks like with the browser defaults, so I moved all that CSS out to a separate repository and shared it here. It is useful to me. If it is useful to someone else, that&#x27;s a bonus!')
