So if I give you an employment offer that is good for 30 days, and you counter the following day with a higher salary, then I legally can say &quot;No, and we will not hire you&quot; (i.e. the 30 days clause became invalid once you gave me a counteroffer).<p>This isn&#x27;t exactly the same, but we are at least taught to treat it similarly.<p>Also, she didn&#x27;t merely say &quot;I will look for work elsewhere&quot;. She said something to the effect of &quot;Let&#x27;s meet to decide my end date.&quot; There&#x27;s a significant difference.<p>[1] Although being an at-will job, the legality is rather moot.')
