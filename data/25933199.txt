What I&#x27;ve found -- after personally studying the subject -- is what a lot of people consider free market is the opposite of what the literature considers it to be.<p>To answer your point:<p>Most&#x2F;all of the issues you raised are met by &quot;pooling&quot; aka insurance. The need arises at random and when it does there is a massive cost and you urgently need the service. This is what insurance is for.<p>What I was suggesting isn&#x27;t that people go and pay the doctor out of pocket -- although they can. Rather that they purchase insurance. Those who can&#x27;t get $$ indexed to some national average or whatever scheme you prefer. The point is everyone gets to purchase insurance if they so prefer.<p>The problem is that choice of insurance providers is artifically limited right now and the choice of healthcare providers is as well. So you have a system where you are captive to the need and those who provide the service have a monpoly. Naturally costs will rise. Putting political preassure on government to increase spending is easy way out but that will only shovel more money from the pockets of the many into the pockets of the few. In fact this was predicted when Medicare was first introduced, and here we are. It is not like doctors and providers magically became greedy capitalists in the last 40 years.<p>Also to be very clear this isn&#x27;t an issue of &quot;profits&quot;. Insurance companies don&#x27;t have huge profit margins. They make their &quot;wealth&quot; by being a monopoly. The execs make their money on the rise in stock prices which isn&#x27;t sensitive to their 3-5% profit margin.')
