So, in your Rasp Pi, you route their DNS server to point your own (as you would with an &#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts file), that way when DoH occurs, you control the final resolution.<p>What I&#x27;m suggesting isn&#x27;t merely setting up the &#x27;default&#x27; dns server. What I&#x27;m suggesting is &#x27;cnaming&#x27; the name servers that apps attempt connecting to, to point elsewhere.')
