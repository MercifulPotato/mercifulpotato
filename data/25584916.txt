I&#x27;m not too worried about someone local pulling readings out of the air, but giving all of this crap access to my wifi, relying on cloud services that could go down at any time, and even adding a bridge straight in (your SIM comment) is just rediculous. For things like cameras or other high bandwidth applications wifi makes sense, but for the usual sensor&#x2F;switch stuff, there&#x27;s no need for a full IP network.<p>Plus, all of the stuff controlled locally means the latency is sooooooooo much lower. It&#x27;s awesome being able to hit a switch in the homeassistant app and have the corisponding plug or light turn on <i>instantly</i>. It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re flipping a physical switch.')
