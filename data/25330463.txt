I assume the average solid color is just so the new pixelized region doesn&#x27;t stand out against the rest of the non-pixelized ones, being an average color.<p>Applying it to an HN comment the result would be a solid average of #F6F6EF (beige background) and #290027 (text), so a solid darker beige with some random black text over, all pixelized. How can any of this be used to recover the original text?')
