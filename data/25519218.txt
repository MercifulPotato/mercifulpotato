In theory that’s true (since the brain barrier is actively pumping it back out and there’s gotta be a limit to that rejection), but I don’t think it’s worked out in practice other than causing massive constipation.<p>It&#x27;s a medication that gets stolen by drug users which is a bit frustrating if it&#x27;s not working for them.<p>BNF and Department of Health (England) don&#x27;t describe addiction to loperamide, but do describe its use as an adjunctive treatment for people trying to come off opioids, which suggests it&#x27;s not that problematic: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bnf.nice.org.uk&#x2F;treatment-summary&#x2F;substance-dependence.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bnf.nice.org.uk&#x2F;treatment-summary&#x2F;substance-dependen...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.publishing.service.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;system&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;attachment_data&#x2F;file&#x2F;673978&#x2F;clinical_guidelines_2017.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.publishing.service.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;...</a><p>&gt; Prescribing symptomatically can reduce some of the physical effects of withdrawal. There is no systematic evidence that any of these medicines work to improve outcome but they may be useful for the clinician in situations where it is not possible to prescribe effective opioid substitution. Particular care is needed concerning the risks of polypharmacy and ensuring appropriate supervision and support in such cases.<p>&gt; •Diarrhoea – loperamide 4mg immediately followed by 2mg after each loose stool for up to five days; usual dose 6-8mg daily, maximum 16mg daily.')
