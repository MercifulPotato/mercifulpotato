Item(by='Tomminn', descendants=None, kids=[24773617], score=None, time=1602637564, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24763463, text='No, just because something changes doesn&#x27;t mean it can be used to send information. You need changes <i>you can control</i>.<p>The thing about the change of &quot;colour&quot; in this analogy is <i>you don&#x27;t know in which direction it changes</i>. So let&#x27;s say you observe you &quot;marble&quot; through a &quot;purple filter&quot;, which gives has:<p>- a 50% chance of being transparent to your marble (corresponding to a red-blue superposition marble collapsing to a purple marble)<p>- a 50% chance of being opaque to your marble (corresponding to red-blue superposition marble collapsing to a green marble).<p>The issue is that when you learn your marble is purple, while you know with 100% certainty the marble in australia is green, there is no way you can send information to Australia using that. This is because the other 50% of the time, your marble will be green, and the marble in Australia is purple.<p>So if I&#x27;m sitting in Australia, when I measure the marbles in my envelopes with purple filters, all I see is purple marbles 50% of the time and green marbles 50% of the time <i>no matter what measurements you are performing at your end</i>. So you can&#x27;t send me messages by performing measurements at your end because you can&#x27;t change the statistics of those measurements.<p>But you&#x27;ll know the answer to every measurement I performed, if you&#x27;ve measured the other marble with a purple filter too.')
