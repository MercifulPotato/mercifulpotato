I&#x27;m working on a hardware issue and I&#x27;m completely stumped.\nI am essentially trying to use Ethernet on the STM32F429, using FreeRTOS2 with CMSIS2 and C.\nThe problem seems is that there&#x27;s no guides out there for this setup (CMSIS2 is too new?). Does anybody know an Ethernet example for STM32 series done with CMSIS2?')
