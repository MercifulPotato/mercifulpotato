Having a clear, consistent process for branching, reviewing and merging code is virtually 100% of the battle with <i>any</i> vcs.<p>We use a very basic GitHub PR squash+merge process. One other person must review all code and it must pass checkbuild. Simple enough. To avoid horrible conflicts we have daily standups where we make our work areas known so these concerns, dependencies and blockers can be handled asap.<p>For us, a PR&#x2F;branch that lives longer than 48 hours is rare, so things don&#x27;t have a whole lot of time to get fucked up. If we know we are going to be working on something longer term, rebasing after every merge to master is strongly encouraged.')
