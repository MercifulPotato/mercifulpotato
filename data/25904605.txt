This is to cool down from an internal ambient of 20C. It absolutely takes more work to cool from 20C than it does 10,5 or 0C. This is the conservation of energy.  Cooler _efficiency_ changes as it approaches the setpoint do not mean that I can have free energy by having a larger delta.<p>Modern refrigerators have been designed specifically (forced by the government) because they are always-on devices that in aggregate consume large amounts of energy. You are conflating low power and always-on consumption of energy.<p>I&#x27;ll absolutely engage with you, but it needs to be over facts and mathematics and not hand wavy arguments about &quot;pretty efficient&quot; vs a incandescent lamp.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openstax.org&#x2F;books&#x2F;physics&#x2F;pages&#x2F;12-2-first-law-of-thermodynamics-thermal-energy-and-work" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openstax.org&#x2F;books&#x2F;physics&#x2F;pages&#x2F;12-2-first-law-of-t...</a>')
