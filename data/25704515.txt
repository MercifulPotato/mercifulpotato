Trump would never have had any success without Fox News cheering him on and giving him biased fawning coverage.<p>If anything, Twitter and Facebook have been too subservient to political power by letting flagrant and harmful TOS violations just float for these folks.<p>Traditional media is more responsible for the rise of Trump than any social network, IMHO. There&#x27;s been a consistent lack of journalistic ethics, of subservience to white supremacy and an unwillingness to report on it. How many diners in small towns is The NY Times going to report on without talking about the confederate flags and Camp Auschwitz symbols that unify these extremists?<p>We are at the Beer Hall Putsch stage right now. We have a long war against fascism ahead of us. I wish that Politico would report in the journalistic failures of traditional media with 1&#x2F;10th the ferocity they have against  social media.')
