At least for me, an affiliate link is an untrustworthy link because that link is working for the manufacturers and retailers, not me.<p>I can&#x27;t think of a decent way to monetize a review site without relying on a revenue stream that&#x27;s susceptible to corruption (product access, affiliate links, advertising, etc.).  Just look at the whole Hardware Unboxed &#x2F; Nvidia thing that happened recently.  The whole review industry must be completely FUBAR for Nvidia to think they could get away with that.')
