Everybody copies each other shamelessly, driving relentless competition.<p>But when it comes to creative properties its practically bankrupt. A lot of market movers are just copying each other and lack the capability to make anything transformative. \nTheir gaming market seems flooded with hundreds of mobile companies with near identical products.\nIt doesn&#x27;t surprise me that Chinese investment firms are chomping at the bit to acquire more creative properties from other countries.<p>They really dont have to do much other than localize the acquired properties and release them to a market starved for good games.\nIts a smart investment, in my eyes.')
