In Japan, some teachers of English have started introducing their students to MT and showing them how to use it to communicate better in English. One technique for a native Japanese speaker to use MT when writing English is to modify the Japanese input so that it is translated more accurately. For example, subjects are often omitted from Japanese sentences when they can be understood from the context, and MT regularly mistranslates such sentences; the English output improves if all subjects are made explicit in the Japanese input.<p>The use of MT in foreign-language education, however, makes some educators and students uncomfortable, as it is not yet known whether reliance on MT when studying a foreign language hinders, helps, or has no effect on long-term language acquisition.<p>A paper discussing these and related issues is here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;researchmap.jp&#x2F;multidatabases&#x2F;multidatabase_contents&#x2F;detail&#x2F;232973&#x2F;42b94e8ab8dd246afbf9b18cbb8ac7b4?frame_id=621150" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;researchmap.jp&#x2F;multidatabases&#x2F;multidatabase_contents...</a>')
