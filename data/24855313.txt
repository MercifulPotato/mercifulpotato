What wealth exactly is exported from urban centers to small towns and rural communities? Tax revenue? Ya likely that.<p>Otherwise I&#x27;d argue the reverse. Banking, media, software etc. seem to export wealth from smaller communities back to urban centers. In this regard large urban centers can be regarded something as absentee landlords receiving grapes and oil and Amish furniture and exporting spreadsheets and compliance audits.')
