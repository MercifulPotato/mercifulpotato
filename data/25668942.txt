Here everyone (including the carpenter, plumber, bank&#x2F;finance people and more) almost expects you to have whatsapp. Even some of the biggest businesses are on Whatsapp offering product&#x2F;order updates, customer service and more. Not to mention every friend of yours would constantly pester you to be on it. I guess one <i>could</i> live without it, but it will be pretty uncomfortable and you&#x27;ll lose touch with almost all of your friends and relatives.')
