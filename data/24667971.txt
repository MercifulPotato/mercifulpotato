This idea is embedded quite early on in age as the article author suggested - you’re usually pointed at a career in middle school that makes it easier to achieve above said goal.<p>The flywheel then spins ever faster as every decision you make thereafter is about getting closer and closer to this vague goal of “success&#x2F;wealth&#x2F;societal perception”. You pick universities based on rankings, large tech companies over startups, management over individual contributor work and of course America over everything else.<p>This problem isn’t isolated to India by any means, and like all stereotypes isn’t applicable to all people from India but in a country of 1B+ people, it’s just dialed up to 11. Hacktoberfest and GSOC are just unfortunate victims to this resume building. The fastest way to put these on your resume and flex it, is to create a spam commit and shortcut your way to a tshirt or certificate.')
