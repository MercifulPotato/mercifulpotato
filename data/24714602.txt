Almost nobody is more competitive about status than subcultures internally, almost like a middle-finger towards society at large.<p>This shows in video game competitions, programming language and editor wars, literal startup company competitions. I mean nobody is more vicious in their status fight than the stereotypical nerd-turned-techbro fighting for the attention they didn&#x27;t get in high school. A lot of famous tech people literally fight like they went into a sort of delayed puberty in their 20s and 30s.<p>This comes through not just in this essay but a lot of Paul Graham stuff, the kind of &quot;you bullied us in high school and now we&#x27;re rich!&quot; subtext.')
