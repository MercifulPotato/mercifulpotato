Yes the world is hard and unfair, but that doesn&#x27;t mean people make mistakes for which only they are themselves to blame, that also is completely natural. No not all burden lies on you, but it&#x27;s perfectly possible a lot of it actually does. Yet, I have a feeling in some circles there&#x27;s this tendency to always try and blame something or someone else, which is almost living in denial. Maybe I look at things in a different way sometimes because I&#x27;m in engineering, were hard problems just lead to mistakes and in most cases it&#x27;s obviously my mistake so you learn to deal with that. But to give some examples: people getting lawyers to fight teachers which gave bad grades to their children even when it&#x27;s obvious the children just didn&#x27;t perform well where the rest of the class did. My neighbour blaming the trees because the leaves fall on his lawn, despite the tree being there already when he moved in. People going to live next to a river and then starting action comitees becasue their basement floods when it rains a lot. Etc. Don&#x27;t get me worng, I know in a case like the last it can in fact be nuanced and it can be possible there are actually upstream problems, but these are just examples to give a gneral idea of cases which I see where I think &#x27;maybe, just maybe, there really isn&#x27;t something else to blame and you should just accept it&#x27;.')
