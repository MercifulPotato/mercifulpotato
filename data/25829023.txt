That said, it&#x27;s also possible that the project goes in another direction and that concern never bears fruit.<p>I wish there were some sort of template like an Architectural Decision Record to document the things I&#x27;m thinking of, how they might become an issue, and some basic ideas about doing things differently.<p>Any suggestions or things to look at?')
