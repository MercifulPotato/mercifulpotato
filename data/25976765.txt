As ICE cars are replaced by EVs, things could go one of two main ways:<p>1) the massive existing supply of ICE cars, plus the massive drop in petrol usage due to EV replacing ICE cars, will mean that second-hand ICE cars and petrol drop massively in price for a while. This causes people to reconsider their EV purchases and a stalling of EV adoption until the ICE-car surplus drains away. This keeps the ICE car infrastructure around for longer than otherwise.<p>2) (the political bit) ICE cars currently have a certain political protection due to their ubiquity - politicians are often unwilling to raise taxes on cars or petrol, even if it&#x27;s warranted due to e.g. air pollution or climate destabilisation. A high enough popularity of EVs (e.g. once 30% of cars on the road are EVs) could change the political scene, resulting in a surge in support for getting rid of ICE cars entirely - people are encouraged to have their ICE cars junked in exchange for whatever incentives, and petrol doesn&#x27;t drop enough to be a complete bargain. ICE cars are relatively rare and people aren&#x27;t confident in their future, so they keep dropping. The faster they drop, the less political resistance to simply banning them outright. Eventually ICE cars are dead, or as good as.<p>That said, there are a TON of different factors that are hard to predict the impact of. For example:<p>* Regardless of scenario, the drop in ICE cars will reduce the revenue of petrol stations, resulting in more of them closing.  Fewer petrol stations will exacerbate the switch to EVs, just like the rollout of superchargers and workplace&#x2F;on-street chargers. It&#x27;s entirely possible that once we hit e.g. 50% EVs, there&#x27;s simply no money in petrol stations and several stations have to shut down, causing a feedback loop of fuel stations being less convenient and more expensive, encouraging more EV adoption.<p>* If petrol stations start closing then there might be a switch to buying fuel deliveries online, which will (IMO) likely result in &#x27;boutique fuels&#x27; and customisation. I have no idea what effects that will have, honestly. Either way, the main reason I think this is viable is because this isn&#x27;t new; when cars were first invented, petrol stations didn&#x27;t exist and people bought their fuel at the local chemist in cans&#x2F;bottles.<p>* It&#x27;s unclear how far hydrogen will go, but if hydrogen vehicles are common then they may keep petrol stations around for longer than otherwise, as hydrogen stations will likely also be petrol stations. AFAICT Hydrogen vehicles will primarily be trucks, as basically nobody else needs the range that hydrogen offers and hydrogen requires far more up-front infrastructure investment, which requires scale.<p>* If EVs truly require less maintenance, then we might see a lot of mechanics out of jobs, and as a result we could see lower maintenance costs, making ICE cars comparably more appealing after the initial EV boom but before the surplus mechanics retrain and move into different sectors.<p>* There may be short-term resource squeezes on EV production - for instance, IIRC lithium mining takes ~7 years to set up a new mine (likely far less to scale up existing mines, mind you) and when you&#x27;re scaling up exponentially, a small underestimation today will result in a large shortage in 7 years. A stalling of battery production could result in a spike of EV prices, which would encourage a second wind for ICE cars.<p>* Places that import a ton of energy, like Japan and Korea, might be sticking to fuel cars for a while longer than places with cheaper electricity. In particular, if Japan ever imports a ton of hydrogen, then directly fueling hydrogen cars would make <i>far</i> more sense than Battery EVs charged from a hydrogen-powered grid. If they adopt Hydrogen EVs, then that keeps the R&amp;D ticking along to keep hydrogen in the game elsewhere.<p>* The politics for ICE cars are heavily tied to the climate - if there&#x27;s any major political seachange for climate action, well, the reality on <i>that</i> is that ICE cars have zero future and need to be gotten rid of ASAP. So unified demand for a step-change on climate = ICE cars are flat-out dead by 2030.')
