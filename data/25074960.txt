This isn&#x27;t like life saving heart medication or something, its just music streaming. A company is not obligated to provide a service forever, even if they did kill off the competition. There also has to be a reasonable balance between: &quot;users want this&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s cost effective to maintain.&quot; Having empathy does not obligate someone to charity. On that note, if there is truly a market for the service, rather than few angry niche customers, then someone else will come along to fill the void.')
