Without these, immunities are decaying.<p>No, not really. I understand where you&#x27;re comming from but this is a myth, that even some generalists doctor contribute to.<p>Yes the immune system can &quot;register&quot; a new pathogen and how to produce antibodies for them, but honestly we have vaccine for (almost) every sickness that can put a non-immunodepressed down if the immune response is too late, and adequate serums and care when a vaccine isn&#x27;t available.<p>But your immune system do not &quot;decay&quot; if not stimulated. At all, and it might even be the opposite (the effect is within the error margin of the studies for now).')
