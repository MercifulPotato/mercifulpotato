TRY THIS EXERCISE ACTUALLY LISTEN WHEN PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO HELP YOU.<p>I don&#x27;t think you understand, I AM your target market for this product and I&#x27;m trying to tell you the model makes no sense, you seem to be focussing on the dollar issue. I did NOT say you are priced too high, I said the pricing&#x2F;usage model does not make SENSE for THIS product. You think I have the time to keep going back for some non defined &quot;process&quot; every time I want to automate something? Especially when the limits are this low?<p>I am not going to start using your product when you could vanish after I have advocated for this automation to be installed. The reason? Because I would be the one that got blamed when things suddenly break.<p>For data entry solutions, I could have it scripted or use any number of solutions that run in software installed on my side of the network that never will get shut off by you, your buyer, your ISP, whatever.<p>I hope you prove me wrong and you make a lot of money. You never did answer the other important question is what happens if your service goes down or is sold? All those people that integrated with you are going to be royally screwed unless you can offer an in house replacement platform or a guarantee in the notice that is more than reasonable. In the places I&#x27;ve worked this is a no go from the start if this touches anything critical in the flow of business.<p>I don&#x27;t want to argue anymore, it never makes progress after this so take the advice or not up to you.')
