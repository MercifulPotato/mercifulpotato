There&#x27;s no connection with these physicians and the virologists required in order to detect a SARS outbreak, and (to my knowledge) no such connection existed.<p>Remember, you&#x27;re using this argument to dismiss the fact that the outbreak happened in <i>the</i> one city where the world&#x27;s top virologists on the topic of bat coronaviruses were performing gain-of-function experiments. The virus samples were obtained hundreds of miles away in Southern China, where these bats actually live and where the SARS1 outbreak originated. There are no bats in Wuhan, no bats were found in the food markets and no other intermediate host has been identified.<p>That&#x27;s a lot of circumstance that isn&#x27;t dismissed <i>quite</i> as easily.')
