The source of all your objections here is that if body cameras had a 5 hour buffer, it&#x27;s vitally important that buffer be saved even if nothing important happened. It&#x27;s fine if you think that&#x27;s true, but your alternative is to throw out all footage after a 30-second buffer unless an officer decides that they are in an important situation, implying that the footage missed is not important at all.<p>How about not offloading 5 hours of video if nothing happened? That&#x27;s not somehow less honorable or ethical than never recording the video at all <i>when you know, from endless examples, that the camera will often not be turned on in critical situations.</i>')
