Employees don&#x27;t do this calculation, as the employer normally pays for all work expenses. Their paycheck is pure profit -- no expenses to account for. As such, people don&#x27;t really think of paychecks in these terms, so it sounds strange.<p>It makes sense in the comment above, as the cab driver actually has work expenses that they pay for out of pocket and are not reimbursed for.')
