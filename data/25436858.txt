Taiwanese, Japanese and Chinese corporates will find that despite India today having the most corporate friendly PM in India&#x27;s history, Indian workers are not submissive. Apart from being quite politically aware, India also has large and powerful labour unions that were actually encouraged by past governments to not only protect labour rights but also as a check on corporates (India was enslaved by a corporate and thus understood - yes, past-tense because the current PM is a duffer here - the dangers of giving corporates a free run).<p>Ofcourse, American media will only focus on &quot;loss&quot; to the corporates (as this headline also highlights).

Non-engineering graduates&#x27; monthly salary had reduced to Rs 8,000 ($109).
