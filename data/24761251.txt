In practical terms, &quot;never&quot; is too harsh, but the bar should be very high. When military gets involved in local matters there is a risk that it takes power and holds it for a long time. Sometimes a military junta might be the least bad option, but this is not a path the country should risk taking lightly.<p>There were plenty of countries where gangs possessed and used automatic weapons, from Scandinavia to Germany, from Brazil to former Soviet Union. And that is not even touching Africa. A gang with machine guns is not a reason to ask military to take over law enforcement. My 2c.')
