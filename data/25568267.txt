My daughter is a budding foodie and wondered if we could find the bucatini.  I aired her what that was and she said it was the type of pasta in the dish (that I had eaten) and that they were like noodle straws.<p>I bought the last box at Kroger somewhat intrigued.  It took a bit longer than spaghetti to cook, and honestly I didn’t find it particularly interesting.  Just a fat noodle that wasn’t particularly good at holding on to the sauce.')
