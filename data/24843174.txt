For example, while curtailing your individual liberty, you are punished for driving drunk, firing a gun into the air, or defecating in public places, due to those actions endangering the health and safety of others.<p>Yet, for some reason, masks and lockdown orders are the hill folks are choosing to die on (in some cases quite literally).<p>But, I have to admit that in a world that appears hopelessly infected by American-style hyper-individualism, at a time when it seems we&#x27;re more distant and disconnected from one another than ever before, and yet paradoxically pushed apart by greater and greater extremes of partisanship and tribalism, while sad and disappointed, I&#x27;m not terribly surprised that some prioritize their own convenience over the safety of strangers.<p>Well, until they&#x27;re on a ventilator facing their own mortality.  That does seem to turn folks around on the whole thing...')
