The antihypertensive drug contains a tetrazole ring, which is an aromatic five-membered ring with one carbon atom and four nitrogens. For many years, the synthesis for this compound, developed by Novartis, used tributyltin azide to form the tetrazole, with xylene as a solvent. However, in 2014, China’s Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical, which makes valsartan for some companies, filed a patent for an improved method for forming the tetrazole ring.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cen.acs.org&#x2F;pharmaceuticals&#x2F;pharmaceutical-chemicals&#x2F;NDMA-contaminant-found-multiple-drugs&#x2F;98&#x2F;i15" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cen.acs.org&#x2F;pharmaceuticals&#x2F;pharmaceutical-chemicals...</a>')
