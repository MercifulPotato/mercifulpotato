Does the government need to know every financial transaction you make? For hundreds of years they couldn’t for technology reasons. Now they deeply desire it and have the means to do so. Would you want the government to have direct access to your brain and thoughts? I assume not. But if you have nothing to hide, is this really a problem? Why are you so worried? It’s why I don’t want the government to have instant access to everyone’s google searches. People use google as a quick extension to thinking, and if the government could see everything I’ve googled in my entire life I’m sure they could paint a picture of a crazy person.<p>Transacting in commerce is equal to freedom. I don’t want the government to instantly know everything I have ever bought in my life. And if you accept that under some threshold ($100? $1000?) the government should not instantly be informed, you’ve opened the door to (insert terrible thing here)! So either we give the government access to everything instantly or we restrict it for some reason. I am in favor of restricting.')
