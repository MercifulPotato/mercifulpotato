Potentially it can send information at light-speed and your whole universe become infested with a boring paper-clip AGI. Throttling will create problems at the boundaries for the conserved quantities, and for reproducibility.<p>But the mechanism I suggest, is a rather elegant (chaos resistant) way to allow to give control over a deterministic universe simulation without having to restart from the beginning, it is akin to re-rolling the dices if you don&#x27;t like the result.<p>It is a somewhat natural way to search for the initial configuration of the universe. It present some nice properties. For example you can archive a whole universe by its seed. Which allows many more interesting search strategies. Like in chess you can create variations to guide the search towards region which are of interests for you.<p>I&#x27;d like to entertain the idea, that Bottled Universe Inc. , has to ship some Tera-Year old universes by Xmas. They have created plenty of variations in the universes and selected one just for you. You plug the seed, and you are guaranteed to see the emergence of beautiful universe when you run it inside your less powerful computer-brain.')
