It&#x27;s not even accurate to describe ADHD medications as dopaminergic drugs, as stimulants have significant norepinephrine activity as well.<p>There are even non-stimulant ADHD medications that have no dopaminergic activity at all (Intuniv).<p>Complex human thought processes can&#x27;t be reduced to single neurotransmitters. Everything you do is a complex interaction of many pathways that use many different neurotransmitters.<p>ADHD also isn&#x27;t purely a chemical disorder. Plenty of ADHD people learn to focus and be productive through therapy and constant self-directed change. Plenty of ADHD people treated with stimulants just use their chemically-induced focus to mess around on the internet and continue to waste time.<p>Effectively treating ADHD requires approaching it as a mix of medication and lifestyle changes. Reducing it to just dopamine is a trap.')
