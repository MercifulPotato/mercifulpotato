Major papers published by FAANGs always have very long lists of authors, in addition to dozens other engineers credited inside. It’s becoming very difficult for university labs to compete with this kind of groups, since it takes a lot of effort to bring together even small groups from 3-4 different professors.<p>The author points out that there are important drawbacks caused by research work shifting towards industry:<p>- little visibility into how they reach their results: there are no lessons learned about what was tried and failed, and why, at least not outside the company;<p>- it’s often not clear which parts of their solution are important and why, and why certain parts were fine tuned or combined in a certain way;<p>- dissemination of knowledge outside the company is often minimal;<p>- focusing on results and metrics minimizes exploration of related ideas that are not directly important for the current objective and metric.<p>On top of that I would add the risk of accepting misleading results due to limited peer review (see Theranos).<p>I think these points are spot on. While on one hand it feels like we are making major technological progress, on the other hand a lot of the knowledge and the ability to use that knowledge effectively may become locked inside a small group of companies. While their current intentions are noble, I think it would be better for society if major research work continued to be carried by institutions that operate in the public interest.')
