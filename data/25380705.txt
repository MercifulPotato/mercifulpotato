They&#x27;d been buying up failed retailers for years. They also bought Macy&#x27;s, Saks, Lord and Taylor, and a home improvement chain that was shut down. Hudson&#x27;s Bay was the oldest buy and they kept that name.  Up until the epidemic, they were doing well for a company in classic brick and mortar retail.')
