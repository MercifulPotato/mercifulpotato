Will ride, but no fun and will break and give you headaches soon.<p>700-1000: Decent bikes, but you have to make some compromises. Fun can be had, will not randomly break because of bad quality components.<p>1000-1400: Good stuff, not extravagant. Won&#x27;t have to compromise on much, you can be satisfied with this forever unless you want to be competitive, and even then it&#x27;ll do fine.<p>1500-2500: &quot;Premium&quot;, lighter weight, carbon stuff, really nice.<p>2500-4000: Same, but you can have cool carbon aero frames and stuff and lighter components.<p>5000+: Pro bike worthy.')
