C# also does not define threads, linq, etc... which if it was C++ would all have to be defined in the standard.<p>If you compare only the language definition itself, C++ is actually shorter by a couple pages than C#: it ends at page 457 on the pdf:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;isocpp.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;papers&#x2F;N4860.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;isocpp.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;papers&#x2F;N4860.pdf</a>')
