The version of the 13 test I&#x27;ve seen has you multiply by 4 and add instead:<p>4173 -&gt; 417 + (3 x 4) = 429 -&gt; 42 + (9 x 4) = 78, which is divisible by 13, so 4173 is.<p>Of course, these two tests work for the same reason.  You&#x27;re saying 10a + b is divisible by 13 iff a - 9b is, I&#x27;m saying 10a + b is divisible by 13 iff a + 4b is, and those differ by 13b.')
