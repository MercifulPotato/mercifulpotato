And repeatedly doing this is statistically pretty certain to lose you significant amounts of money—particularly when compared to just investing in the market as a whole—over the long run. It’s just another way that the poor are trapped in poverty, even though you can of course always find individual cases where someone got lucky and made millions.<p>Even with negative expected value, playing a lottery could be a rational decision given the right motivations and circumstances. Suppose for some reason you expect to be living paycheck to paycheck your entire life, barely having any surplus, and that there&#x27;s nothing meaningful you can do to alter that trajectory. Investing scraps every month at 10% average returns (especially if you don&#x27;t start till you&#x27;re 30+) might allow you to retire a month or two sooner, buy slightly newer clothes, or maybe eat out a few more times each year, but even if you just lit that cash on fire you wouldn&#x27;t have a substantially different life. However a few chances at $250k+ could fundamentally alter your possibilities, giving you a freedom that you otherwise couldn&#x27;t dream of.')
