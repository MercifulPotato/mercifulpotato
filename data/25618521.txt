The reason Facebook didn&#x27;t go the way of Friendster, Livejournal, and MySpace, is that he figured out how to play the game (as it currently exists) better than anyone else.  Cory Doctorow would be like someone trying to win the Tour de France when everyone else was doping.  In this analogy, Zuckerberg is Lance Armstrong, playing the existing game the way you need to play it to win that game.')
