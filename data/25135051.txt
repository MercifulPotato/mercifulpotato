Taking your first sentence at face value it appears you believe in an all or nothing approach.<p>Also, and again I know this is a sensitive area so I understand why you are coming across this way, but comments like &#x27;you should be much more worried about this problem than you are&#x27; are unnecessary and divisive.<p>I am extremely worried about climate change. That is why I am concerned by extreme &#x27;all or nothing&#x27; impractical approaches that will simply achieve nothing. I prefer something to nothing.<p>&gt;in ten years you folks will need to be in a position to switch to a technology which is already reasonably viable so better get scaling<p>Do you consider needing to upgrade 400,000 substations and installing charge points along ~200,000km of roads within 10-20 years reasonably viable?<p>My whole issue with this is not that we should take NO action, it&#x27;s that for any action taken we should either:<p>a. Speak honestly about the actual efforts required to make it happen and then take that action (e.g. start the substation upgrade, start installing the chargers),\nb. Take more practical action that requires less drastic work.<p>The option being touted is:<p>c. Ban non-electric cars by 2030 and hybrids by 2035, say absolutely nothing about the VAST Â£100&#x27;s of billions required investment to make that feasible, feel good and move on.<p>Do you think option c is more or less likely to result in anything changing? I think this requirement is likely to just get rolled back and ignored.<p>&quot;translate into pressure on all governments globally to build credible plans for decarbonisation&quot;<p>I actually agree with this, but I don&#x27;t think unrealistic plans that ignore actual costs are any kind of solution.<p>I absolutely do NOT advocate putting off addressing climate issues. I personally believe in taking as much of a global approach as possible (if China refuse to stop using dirty coal plants everywhere, economically divest from them for example), correctly counting the CO2 cost of e.g. electric cars&#x2F;renewable energy from raw material to functional capacity, not just discounting all CO2&#x2F;other nasty climate gases from production and taking as practical an approach as we can.<p>I am also a realist and realise that if a country was to go all in on what many deem necessary and suffers a colossal economic impact that&#x27;ll likely discourage any other country from taking that or probably much action at all.<p>It&#x27;s a hard problem that feels like it needs drastic immediate action but the problem is made harder from the fact that that is simply not possible, I&#x27;m sorry.<p>Those who truly are worried about this should be being as practical as possible in order to get as much change into the world as they can.')
