Number of GitHub contributions, lines of code, number of commits - these don&#x27;t actually tell people anything. I know to a recruiter doing a cursory glance, these things may be important, but it&#x27;s just frustrating. I&#x27;d so much rather see one high-quality, ideally squashed PR&#x2F;commit per week.')
