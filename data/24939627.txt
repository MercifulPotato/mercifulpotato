It is during those periods I start looking up all of the excel functions and features.<p>However, if I am only occasionally looking at data and&#x2F;or repeating the same operations than code + csv (or database) makes a lot more sense and gives me flexibility to deal with edge cases. I still end up opening it in excel but mostly because I already have it installed.<p>To be honest, I would sort of like a more primitive fast csv data viewer for times when I am feeling rusty on excel and bullish on small scripts. When you are doing the data manipulation elsewhere excel is overkill.<p>But every now and then it is a lifesaver')
