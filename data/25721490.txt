If the event is processed asynchronously w.r.t. other events which can modify the selection, you can get buggy behaviour.<p>I don&#x27;t find such a design that surprising. If you like simplicity, you would be tempted to go for it, because it doesn&#x27;t involve duplicating data (namely, the selected filepath) between the main GUI state and the event handler for opening the selected file. If you&#x27;re writing in a memory-managing language like C, it&#x27;s even more tempting - by not copying data, you don&#x27;t risk forgetting to free it later.')
