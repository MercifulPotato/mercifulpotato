Item(by='myself248', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602959048, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24811909, text='Yeah, I work in advanced safety systems, and I&#x27;m pretty comfortable with most of those things. They have their limitations, and there are times when they should be turned off, but on the whole I appreciate them. Blind-spot warning in particular, but that&#x27;s pretty old now. (Incidentally, the auto braking likely would&#x27;ve kicked in if you hadn&#x27;t reacted on your own, but it&#x27;s set to not touch anything until it&#x27;s at the panic-stop point. This is partly to keep drivers from getting lazy and relying on it.)<p>What bugged me about the Tesla was the controls more than anything. There&#x27;s no &quot;off&quot;. There&#x27;s no manual anything, and the overrides are buried so deep in the touchscreen, heaven help you if you forget where one is located. The car knows when it should be on, and when it should lock and unlock, and if you have different ideas about those things (heaven forbid you want to leave it unlocked while it&#x27;s parked in a garage), you&#x27;re going to have a bad time.<p>I gotta call those folks up and ask for my deposit back, I&#x27;m never gonna use it.')
