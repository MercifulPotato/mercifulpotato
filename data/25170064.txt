In my opinion most work relationship are pretty shallow and not meaningful long-term. When you leave a company, your entire social circle is going to be up-ended.<p>&gt; Why should where I spend the majority of my waking hours, the majority of my life in practical terms, not also be my primary source of socialization?<p>I think because the primary goal is to work. Socialization is a plus, but it will never be your main focus, as mentioned above you will not build meaningful relationships (I mean, not entire impossible, just not as likely).<p>&gt; Relying on your few off hours to satisfy your innate human need for socialization places an unhealthy demand on your off hours, not to mention an unfair demand on your friends and family.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an unfair demand to want to spend time with friends and family (that is the point of them). Anyone that is thinking that is probably not someone you want to be spending time with...<p>&gt; Humans were never intended to spend so much time alone, weâ€™re social animals.<p>I think this is what wife&#x2F;kids are for. I can&#x27;t speak for others, but it works for me! 99.9% of my time out of work is with them, and have never felt lonely. Not everyone is in that position I suppose, but then friends would have to fill that gap.')
