TFA&#x27;s thesis is that Trump (and thus his supporters) are a symptom of the media&#x27;s rejection of neutrality (and indeed, the pursuit of truth). I would go farther and argue that it&#x27;s not just the media but epistemological institutions in general. Presumably if someone&#x27;s viewpoint isn&#x27;t represented in a debate, but rather outright maligned, then that person isn&#x27;t going to trust the moderator and is going to feel free to find his own moderator. If rejecting neutrality is the cause, then it stands to reason that we can cure the problem in part or in full by embracing neutrality again.<p>Of course, Trumpism isn&#x27;t the only ideology that has prospered in this post-truth landscape, so embracing neutrality is probably a pretty threatening prospect for a lot of people.')
