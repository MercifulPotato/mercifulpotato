If you&#x27;d change the way you&#x27;d build up and zone things it would be possible.<p>The YouTube channel &quot;Not Just Bikes&quot; goes into this in various videos. I couldn&#x27;t find the exact video that explained the zoning laws, did find another: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ul_xzyCDT98" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ul_xzyCDT98</a> (kids in Netherlands go to school on their own).<p>Despite Netherlands being considered great for cyclists there&#x27;s loads to improve. The channel goes into that detail as well, e.g. that major roads are being closed. See e.g. this video of a big road being closed in Utrecht: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=fePpwYCs_JM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=fePpwYCs_JM</a> (different channel)')
