Full stop. The rest of your scenario is irrelevant.<p>How can you possibly say that with a straight face?<p>There will be situations where a car is going a perfectly fine speed for the situation and then the situation changes in a way the car cannot have seen, known about, or anticipated resulting in a crash.  This happens all the time with human drivers.  It will happen with AI drivers too.<p>Furthermore, we don&#x27;t subject anything else that moves to this burden, why would we do so for cars (AI or otherwise)?')
