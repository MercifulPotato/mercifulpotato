I would argue that if you have been so-called independent minded for long enough most PG&#x27;s articles would feel clich√©.<p>Nonetheless, if you deeply values independent mindfulness and happen to enjoy PG&#x27;s writings, you will find the article to be extremely powerful because these words can computationally touch something deep inside you. And that is nice.<p>This is pratically a piece you can meditate with.')
