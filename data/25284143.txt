Item(by='nobody9999', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606958904, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25283896, text='As someone who attended one of the schools mentioned (in the non-paywalled portion of the article), it&#x27;s absolutely true that there were (when I attended, and as I understand it, continues to be) few black and hispanic students.  Which is certainly not representative of the locality.<p>That said, it seems to me that the problem isn&#x27;t that the schools are selective (via a standardized test).  In fact, that&#x27;s kind of the point of such schools.<p>Do we just put everyone in honors classes at every school?  No.  Why not?  Obviously that&#x27;s discriminatory right?  Of course not.<p>There are a variety of reasons why fewer black and hispanic kids end up in these schools.  They include, but are not limited to:<p>1.  Schools in poorer areas have fewer resources;<p>2.  Schools in poorer areas are less likely to groom kids for more selective high schools;<p>3.  Schools in poorer areas tend to be dumping grounds for less effective teachers;<p>4.  Poorer families have fewer resources to spend on expensive prep courses&#x2F;tutoring;<p>5.  Schools in poorer areas tend to have less parental involvement and less pressure to improve teaching and the level of expectation for students -- leading to a fewer kids in those schools being encouraged to even attempt to go to more selective high schools;<p>There are many other reasons as well.<p>The solution, to my mind, is to improve the quality of education, level of expectation, resources to prepare for the entry examinations and encouragement from teachers and school staff to strive for such outcomes.<p>Better teachers would be a good idea as well.<p>Improving the performance of <i>all</i> students should be the goal, with a side benefit of more students being accepted to to more selective schools.<p>IMHO, there is absolutely an ethnic&#x2F;socioeconomic bias issue here.  However, that issue lies in the quality of elementary and middle school education, not the selectivity of <i>selective</i> high schools.')
