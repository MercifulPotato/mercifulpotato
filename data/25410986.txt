I&#x27;ve done some work in the past in some video games, and used to get paid through a Paypal registered under a pseudonym.<p>But since now Paypal requires your name, DOB, SSN, banking info, to simply transfer money out, the money is stuck.<p>I can&#x27;t use the money to pay for things, because they require you to link banking info DESPITE the fact that I have cash balance. So basically, I had cash that I couldn&#x27;t take out or use.<p>Now finally, they are figuring out how to steal that money.')
