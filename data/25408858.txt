Of course that didn&#x27;t stop him from manufacturing in china himself. The guy talks the talk but rarely walks the walk.<p>&gt; He didnâ€™t do anything that actually slowed the loss of our manufacturing base while president.<p>And that&#x27;s why he lost. But boy did he make israel safe. How many arab states did he force into recognizing israel? 4 or 5?<p>Trump&#x27;s achievements were making israel great again and forcing mexico to extend intellectual property rights by a few years so that he can selling his &quot;Trump&quot; name in mexico for a few more years? Not that things are going to get any better with biden.<p>But then again, it&#x27;s naive to think the president hold any true power. The power are held by those behind the scenes. Politicians nowadays are entertainers to keep the populace distracted. Presidents come and go, but the powerful remain.')
