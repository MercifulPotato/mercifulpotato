(Again, I did R&amp;D tax credits for 4 years for a media company; I had line-item access to expenses and the reasons for every expense.) Macs cost more than Windows PCs of the same or better performance, are more expensive to replace (since usually the entire device must be replaced), and generally cannot be upgraded. Moreover, the fact that Macs may last years longer is irrelevant to a business, since the &quot;useful life&quot; for computer equipment for financial purposes and actual use is 5 years <i>or less</i> (emphasis on the &quot;or less&quot;; we replaced machines at least every other year with newer equipment).<p><i>An M1 Mac mini starts at $699, so there&#x27;s no excessive cost.</i><p>So what? An M1 Mac mini can&#x27;t run any of the software that you would be running in a video production environment, let alone one requiring real-time editing capabilities for a live broadcast.<p><i>Of course, FinalCut Pro (and the rest of Apple&#x27;s suite) is good to go; DaVinci Resolve (editing 4k, 6k and 8k RAW video) is also looking pretty great: </i><p>Final Cut Pro has not been industry standard since before I started at my old job. Apple did a great job of screwing the pooch on that one. As for DaVinci Resolve, it runs <i>even better</i> on Windows, especially since you can put as much RAM as you want, and multiple GPUs, and whatever cooling system you want, and make the machine literally run laps around the top-of-the-line Mac.')
