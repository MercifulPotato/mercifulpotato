The only way to get what we&#x27;re seeing from a point source is for it to spread out in straight lines in all directions from the source point (as radio waves do, just like light), then somehow change direction towards us to converge back together here, appearing to come from multiple directions.  That doesn&#x27;t happen.  (Gravitational lensing can change light&#x27;s direction in some circumstances, but astronomers know all about that, so they&#x27;d give us that explanation if it made sense for this.)<p>For example, imagine looking across a dark room at a single LED, a point source.  You see a point.  But the LED is sending light straight in all directions, not just at your eye.  The light going in other directions doesn&#x27;t reach us, so we don&#x27;t see that &quot;area&quot;.<p>Imagine it&#x27;s a white computer screen, an area source not a single point, and you can see the rectangular area.  Every point on the screen is sending light spreading out straight in all directions, but for every point on the screen one of those directions reaches our eye, so we see the area.  The light is coming to our eye from multiple directions, from the different parts of the screen, making the area.')
