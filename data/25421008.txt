Linux applications virtualized on M1, running on a Pi 4, and Graviton2 are going to be binary-compatible with each other, and although you&#x27;ll get the extra atomic performance out of the M1, they won&#x27;t be massively different other than just scaling up. Cross compiling after some testing to ensure the right atomic order was used should be fine cross-arch.<p>If one were to add more ARM extensions and actually push them for third-party usage, that might change though.')
