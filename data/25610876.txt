Item(by='eredengrin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609568718, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25602589, text='Calling it lack of support is probably a bit misleading, in reality they are actively undermining the competitive scene by things like shutting down tournaments&#x2F;streams, preventing outside orgs (eg evo, mlg) from picking up smash, etc. Some of the other commenters gave links which have more details on this.<p>Given the recent events in context of the past 2 decades of nintendo&#x27;s behaviour, the smash scene would love for nintendo to not be involved at all. There is no entitlement whatsoever for nintendo&#x27;s support (unless &quot;support&quot; literally just means allowing us to run events with no help of any kind from nintendo other than not shutting it down, in which case it really doesn&#x27;t strike me as too unreasonable).')
