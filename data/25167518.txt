Item(by='darkerside', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605926802, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25163227, text='&gt; Sure there is -- one option is a terrifically expensive and dangerous dead end.<p>You say this with such certainty... but all of your citations are about renewable and solar. What is your background that gives you the confidence to make such a statement when billions are being spent on nuclear power research by, what I presume you would consider to be, idiots?<p>I&#x27;ll stop there because ad hominem arguments are insufficient anyway. The only argument that really matters here is, capitalism will decide the path forward, and not you (fortunately, imo). And the way it does that is that people, none of whom can predict the future with perfect clarity, make intelligent bets about what technologies will produce the most value. As the research and development pans out, the winners become evident, and either way, consumers win.<p>There&#x27;s no need to try to strangle the nuclear baby in the crib. If it doesn&#x27;t work, let it die in development. But, really, how can you make such a confident assertion about the prospects of nuclear? It boggles the mind.')
