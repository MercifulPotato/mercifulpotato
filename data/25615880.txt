When the stock market was down 30% in Q2 and personal income was _up_, nobody was writing breathless articles about how investors were getting screwed while the common man was fine.<p>It&#x27;s pretty shocking how unserious coverage of the stock market is, from picking dishonest time windows (&quot;stock market up 10% during pandemic! [counting from after the 30% crash]&quot;) to selectively ignoring the difference in time horizons between equity prices and snapshot economic statistics.<p>A good rule of thumb is that reading mainstream articles harrumphing about the stock market is a waste of one&#x27;s time, unless you&#x27;re looking for a cable-news style dose of misinformed outrage for recreational reasons.')
