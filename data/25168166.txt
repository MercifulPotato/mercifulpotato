They have far more than one function -- aside from making steamed rice, you can make rice porridge, congee, steam other foods, and some can even be used to bake cakes. Not to mention you can time-delay the cooking to specify <i>when you want the rice to be ready</i> (which means it also has a clock). These are just the features my middle-of-the-road rice cooker can do -- more expensive models have even more features.<p>So the buttons are serving a purpose, the question is whether it&#x27;s better to have more buttons or more touch-screens or other &quot;less crammed&quot; designs. Aesthetic concerns aside (personally I&#x27;ve gradually grown more fond of the &quot;crammed&quot; designs as having their own aesthetic), buttons are also practically better because they always do exactly one thing -- meaning it&#x27;s easier to learn and use for most people (including older and vision-impaired users). If the cost of having less buttons is that users have to learn how to navigate a set of menus for each appliance they own (many of which will have rubbish UIs) then I&#x27;ll take the extra buttons. I also like that my rice cooker beeps when it&#x27;s done -- it reminds me to go fluff the rice (or acts as a signal that it&#x27;s time to have dinner).<p>Cars are possibly the best argument for physical-button-based designs -- because <i>you usually operate them without looking at them</i>! Touch-screens or any other complicated but &quot;less cluttered&quot; design just means that you can&#x27;t use them in that setting. I get anxiety looking at the Tesla dashboard -- maybe the reason they&#x27;re developing self-driving cars is so that you can operate the dashboard without crashing?')
