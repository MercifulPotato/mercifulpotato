You therefore cannot release yourself from preferred form even if you required a copyright assignment, otherwise you will get stuck in the case any further published modifications to your work, not only for the contributions, but any part those modifications that interact so much so that they are inseparable, even by the original licensor, may become illegal overnight. As GPL does not state &quot;the form deemed preferred for modifications by the licensor(s)&quot;, but &quot; preferred form ... for modifications&quot;, you need to apply that objective definition I stated above. It would be nice if they explicitly stated that way though, relieving a lot of load from judges in resolving a possible dispute on which forms are preferrable for modification and which are not.')
