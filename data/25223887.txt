Of the notable projects, only Nemo Mobile and Manjaro Lomiri are missing.\nAlso, with JumpDrive (the tool you need to install to eMMC), it&#x27;s really worth keeping it around on an SD card.<p>(Really don&#x27;t run this in &#x27;production&#x27; and don&#x27;t judge the state of a project from this â€” a different kernel leads to different issues the original project can&#x27;t help you with.)')
