Pedantically, you could even go as far as saying that you could count the Linux kernel, the processor being used and the like as dependencies, but that&#x27;s a bit out of scope for this.<p>What&#x27;s the point of such nitpicking? You don&#x27;t need git to use V, and the point of the no dependency claim is that bootstrapping V is as simple as `cc v.c` and the V compiler produces single file binaries, that are easy to deploy, without any dependencies on an interpreter&#x2F;environment&#x2F;libs etc.<p>I&#x27;m actually going to write a post debunking all of the claims in these articles, since I see them mentioned quite often (including measuring the compilation speed by using an unoptimized debug build + running vfmt + rebuilding the standard library with each compilation + using a 2x slower backend).')
