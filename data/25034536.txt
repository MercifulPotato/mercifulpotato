There is a big difference in taste. What we should keep in mind though is that organic is difficult&#x2F;expensive to scale. I doubt that it will be possible to feed the entire global population with 100% organic food. So that tasteless tomato that you buy at the store might not be the best but it does feed you.<p>The argument that it doesn&#x27;t scale negates the majority of Agriculture&#x27;s 10K+ year history. This modern system of chemically driven commodification of food is rather new (post WWII). Granted the World&#x27;s population is larger than what it was back then, which introduces challenges, but the truth is we are facing disease due to the over-consumption of the &#x27;abundance&#x27; more than anything else in the West, and the East is following as well.<p>While I agree the current monetary incentives are not aligned for its success, and the business model that had proven profitable for small scale, local and often organic farms working for the past ~15 years has been essentially curtailed due to COVID, as so many restaurants are limited in capacity or shut down altogether, it is not beyond the realm of possibility to transition how we view Agriculture and Food as a whole. I think this re-calibration is necessary for the challneges we face as Species on Earth moving forward and sincerely believe COVID may be the the disruption we needed to question the &#x27;business as usual&#x27; model.<p>There is a great deal of efficacy to the theory&#x2F;practice that soil remediation to be an effective deterrent in reducing atmospheric CO2 levels; at its core the way Biodynamics has operated since its inception when it was introduced to the nobility in Austria since WWI is nothing more than a distillation of viable practices that follow sound microbiology methods. It may be attached to a great deal esoteric &#x27;woo&#x27; but once you see past what is essentially Marketing what you have is the collective synthesis of 10,000+ of trial and error in Man&#x27;s relationship and the Stewardship we&#x27;ve had with the Nature. That much cannot be disputed.<p>People not entirely obsessed with this topic forget that a food supply not dependent on inputs like artificial fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides aren&#x27;t that old and that some countries never adopted it due to the costs associated.<p>Explaining the significance of this topic without a great deal of context is entirely daunting but, large concentrated populations in former Empires didn&#x27;t suffer because their wasn&#x27;t enough BT corn to feed its cattle, and we would be remiss to forget that much.<p>Detroit&#x27;s story with urban farming and the culture it brought back with it is a really amazing story that proves that something deemed not &#x27;commercially viable&#x27; is not as important as the resilience of a community and a People if the will exists.<p>&gt; So that tasteless tomato that you buy at the store might not be the best but it does feed you.<p>&#x27;Feed&#x27; is questionable, but what it clearly does is introduces a myriad of chemicals into your body that can and has cause(d) other health issues, all while still disappointing your palate.')
