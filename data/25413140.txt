Item(by='redis_mlc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607915779, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25412273, text='1) I was involved in improving the security scanning of SignalFX agents about a year ago (if there&#x27;s a changelog, then you can figure out the month.) So SignalFX has at least basic processes in place now based, on results from our scanning. You will have to upgrade if you&#x27;re using older packages and want the benefits of the new release processes.<p>Note they were initially bewildered, until I pointed out that their entire client list could be pwned. Then they got on top of it.<p>2) Note that if you use multiple agents, it&#x27;s possible to have up to 5 GB RAM used for agents. That means if you&#x27;re using 8GB RAM containers&#x2F;VMs in production to run java applications, they are starting with less than 2 GB RAM for application and heap. You might want to check on that.<p>Upvote to thank me for the time invested in improving their agent packages.')
