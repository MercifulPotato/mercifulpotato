I’ve been routinely installing the snap instead because it’s a quick and easy way to deploy the service at the latest version.<p>The only other alternative to suggest is to request the Certbot project deploys custom deb repos or similar. But can we expect that of every project? Perhaps we need a new standard to replace snap, if so the only folks I can see large enough to promote it would be GitHub...<p>Since that’s unlikely to happen, maybe just noting the auto-update “feature” more prominently in their is all they should need to do?')
