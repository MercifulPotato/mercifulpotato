The SC doesn&#x27;t decide <i>right</i> and <i>wrong</i>.    The SC decides what the MO of the government will be, until Congress or a future SC changes it.  It&#x27;s a statement of position, a very powerful one, but <i>not</i> a statement of correctness.  The history of the SC makes clear that treating what they say as &quot;right&quot; and everyone else as &quot;wrong&quot; won&#x27;t lead to any consistent sense of right or wrong.<p>It&#x27;s a fundamental principle of the US that people can hold opinions that differ from the current law of the land.')
