Itâ€™s such a nightmare and I went through so many of those dumb proprietary nuts that strip so easily. \nBikes like the Cannondale Bad Boy have got me thinking, what if the single fork was at the rear? Then you could have an internal hub and change the tube without the extra suffering. Yes, the loading at the read would be significantly greater, but if it were possible it would make internal hubs much better.')
