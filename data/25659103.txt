Meaning while you may be particularly skilled, learning one more discipline, stack, technique, or language probably won&#x27;t let you get a particular job done any better or faster than the next engineer.<p>Many engineers move to management at this point, which requires that you can mentor and grow a team of engineers, set goals, drive projects to completion, and manage your team through performance reviews.<p>Folks who stick to the technical path need to become an indispensable piece of technical glue across N teams, keeping them all building in the right direction and not crushing each other.  This job requires deep technical knowledge but often doesn&#x27;t involve a ton of coding e.g. Linus Torvalds.<p>If a junior engineer showed up with the behavioral qualifications of Torvalds and the technical skill of a junior engineer - they would still be a junior engineer and unable to build trust, guide a team effort, or other activities.')
