They&#x27;ve had roughly 7 years to work on adopting the standard plug and are only just starting to make upgrade kits to use CCS plugs with pass through adapters. They&#x27;re still not able to use all of the power of the CCS connectors though. In the US they still don&#x27;t have a single charger with a CCS connector on it.<p>I realize USB-C didn&#x27;t exist when they made Lightning. It still doesn&#x27;t make sense why they have not migrated to USB-C either, other than continued vendor lock-in&#x2F;control over the accessory market. With practically all MacBooks and many iPads being on USB-C, it makes less and less sense to have Lightning and USB-C at the same time. There&#x27;s a standard out there they&#x27;ve halfway adopted, but they <i>choose</i> to not commit to it. All of their portable devices could charge off USB-C, and sell small USB-C to Lightning tips for the brief transition.<p>I agree, Tesla is in somewhat the same situation. They could start producing CCS compatible cars in the US, they could retrofit ends on their chargers with J1772&#x2F;CCS plugs, but instead they continue to build proprietary stations and proprietary cars.<p>You&#x27;re right both companies are in the same boat and do a similar thing in relation to connector standards. This doesn&#x27;t make these actions good though.')
