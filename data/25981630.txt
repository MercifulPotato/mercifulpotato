I&#x27;m passionate about cooking, but only for myself and the occasional guest. I&#x27;m also passionate about the website I live from, but I don&#x27;t worry much about its growth.<p>I like to build stuff, but I don&#x27;t want an audience or its recognition. I don&#x27;t want users nor money. I just do it because it&#x27;s nice.')
