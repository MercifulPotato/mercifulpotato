If no one is trying to censor what you are doing, avoid blockchains. I believe torrents have shown their censorship resistance.<p>So if it&#x27;s not for discovery or censorship resistance, what could it be for? Efficiency? Vertical integration of hard drives into the highest density 4u space is already open source. For instance 60 drives in 4u: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.backblaze.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;open-source-data-storage-server&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.backblaze.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;open-source-data-storage-serv...</a><p>Backblaze and others also use vertical integration to get better prices from all vendors for the drives, connectivity, and they even use fancy parity systems to get redundancy across machines with minimal overhead. Distributed (horizontal) scaling loses to vertical integration.<p>So what are you left with? Yet another token, with a proof of storage instead of proof of hashing or proof of memory hard hashing, or proof of time locking (caveat, I founded a cryptocurrency based on that last one, for inflation only, consensus is still vanilla POW.) At least one or two &quot;usuable&quot; things came out of the billions wasted of 2017 ICO money... I guess.')
