If the security architecture of your IT system can be compromised by stupid mistakes in some selection of hundreds to thousands of dependencies and that selection was not audited then the security architecture can not protect from simple attacks which, almost definitionally, means the security process is largely useless as attackers do not care to attack only where the systems are strong. If auditing dependencies is viewed as &quot;too hard&quot; or &quot;too expensive&quot; I do not see how that has any bearing on the security of the system. It merely demonstrates that improving the security is not worth the cost tradeoff, it does not somehow magically improve the objective security of the system.<p>The objective evaluation of a comprehensive security architecture depends on its holistic effectiveness, not merely the effectiveness of the parts the designers thought about. By that metric, I am not aware of any commercial IT system that even meets the low bar of protecting against an attack with a mere $10M in funding, let alone the billions a state actor has access to. So, a question for you, are you aware of any commercial IT system in the entire world that you think would survive a $10M open bounty let alone $1B? If so, what objective, empirical evidence do you have to justify that claim? Hopefully one day I might get a convincing response to this question.')
