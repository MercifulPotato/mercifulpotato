Another few things to add to this if you are going for more broadcast quality rather than just Zoom calls:<p>- The lens you use if crucial. A nice and fast prime portrait lens (20-50mm f1.4 or something) will make a huge difference with indoor light and give you nice bokeh&#x2F;blurred background.<p>- Good quality lighting is essential. El Gato have a good, but again expensive, key light you can use as your primary source of light, but you might need side-lights and back-lights too.')
