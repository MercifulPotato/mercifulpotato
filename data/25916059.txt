It&#x27;s not really practical to expect someone to configure dozens or even hundreds of optional libraries in a configuration file. It would be a major hassle to have to get a config file correct rather than config detecting as much as possible. ffmpeg is an extreme case, but it&#x27;s proportionally not that uncommon; many of the things people most want to compile by hand are naturally the things with a ton of optional libraries. The easy cases with 0 or a handful of options are handled by your package manager and you don&#x27;t care, because there aren&#x27;t any &quot;options&quot; for you to disagree with.')
