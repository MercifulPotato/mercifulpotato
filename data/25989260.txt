Simply compare the carbon footprint of a US inhabitant vs a Vietnamese.<p>We could be a handful of billions more on Earth and reduce the global footprint, so the size of the population not the issue but how we live (big house, big SUV, lots of meat, etc).<p>And of course, if the world&#x27;s power continue to promote the American Way of Life as the way to go, all countries will look like the US and we&#x27;ll destroy our habitat. But that&#x27;s not a population problem but one of culture.')
