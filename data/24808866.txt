We use both Jira and Confluence, and while they have their issues, we&#x27;ve got many integrations that make life <i>significantly</i> better that will be work-intensive to convert to their cloud offering, if it&#x27;s even possible.<p>Our biggest complaint about Atlassian has always been the constantly rising price while value does not follow, and this might finally make them too expensive that we would be better served by alternatives, especially considering all the re-integration we would have to do in any case.')
