The more economic activity there is, the more people feel confident about their future, the more they spend.<p>They may at some point become &quot;too confident&quot; and start feeling that the &#x27;party&#x27; may never end. So they go out and spend more and more: on new clothes, on renovations, or second (or third) houses, on new cars, boats, etc.<p>However, there&#x27;s only so much capacity for (say) manufacturing: only so many cars can be built, and if you <i>really</i> want one, then you&#x27;ll be will to pay $40K to get the new shiny instead of trying to haggle down to $37K. There&#x27;s only so many housing builders and lumber that is available: and if you want more square footage, they&#x27;ll be setting the price that you have to pay.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how old you are, but in the 2006-2007 timeframe there was a lot of &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; before people over-extended themselves.<p>The movie <i>The Big Short</i> is an entertaining and fairly accurate take.')
