I can&#x27;t believe in 2020 there&#x27;s not some kind of library I can call that will give me my backend resources as JSON and transparently handle all the caching, pagination, error handling (translate error responses to exceptions), etc and people have to do all this by hand when calling something like Axios.<p>If you look at 20 REST API&#x27;s you&#x27;ll probably see 30 different patterns for pagination, search&#x2F;sort, error responses, etc.  There have been a couple attempts to standardize REST such as OData but I think it&#x27;s safe to say that they haven&#x27;t been very successful.  It&#x27;s kind of challenging to build standard reusable front end tools when everyone builds back ends differently.')
