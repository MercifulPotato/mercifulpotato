In fact, it is much more the problem here â€“ an abundance of surveillance technology projects like this one will only result in <i>more</i> surveillance, not less. The average Joe doesn&#x27;t care about the technology stack the surveillance camera[0] on the subway is running on. Instead, the mere presence of the camera will cause him to have a feeling of being watched and, thus, to behave differently.<p>The solution can only be a political one: Restrict the usage of AI in surveillance technology.<p>[0]: aka &quot;security cameras&quot;, as they euphemistically called by their manufacturers.')
