But what if I said there&#x27;s a way to learn that&#x27;s evidence-based and fun? What if I said there&#x27;s a memory card game you can play, for 20 minutes a day, to store anything you choose into long-term memory, forever?<p>A mistake I made when I first started experimenting with spaced repetition was treating it as a learning tool, as described above, rather than as a memorization tool. \nI&#x27;d create a bunch of cards with facts that I wanted to learn on them, then review my cards each day and hope that spaced repetition would help me learn what was on them. In reality, I learned very little.<p>What I&#x27;ve since discovered works much better for me is to separate studying and memorizing, and only create cards with facts that I already know on them. You might say &quot;but why would I make a card with something I already know on it?&quot;, and this question reveals the mistake that most people make when it comes to remembering -- that just because they know something, it will be in their head forever.<p>I often still make this mistake whenever I learn something new. The important thing is to remind myself that without reviewing that information again at a later date, I will forget it. I&#x27;ve lost count of the amount of times I&#x27;ve figured out a problem and thought &quot;great, I know this now!&quot; only to run into the same problem a month later and forget what the solution was.')
