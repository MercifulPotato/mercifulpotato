The coldest I&#x27;ve ever felt is Auckland and Sydney (probably Sydney slightly colder). Sydney houses are so poorly insulated, there&#x27;s cm-wide gaps under some doors and windows and the only heaters are typically a small plugin resistive heater. Auckland was typically a bit better, except that the heaters were indoor gas heaters with a LPG bottle (welcome to dampness and condensation on all windows).<p>During the day in Sydney winter it is often 18-22 degrees, so you can walk around in t-shirt quite comfortably, but as soon as the sun goes down it drops down to 8-12 and it&#x27;s as cold inside as outside. Try to work on a computer when it&#x27;s 12 degrees in your room (or maybe 15 if you have your electric heater on full blast).<p>Melbourne gets much colder and insulation is only marginally better. However, apartments&#x2F;houses typically have some sort of proper heating (heat-pump or centralised gas heater). You still largely heat the outside though (one of our houses was so badly insulated, that when it was windstill the house could be easily heated to ~20 deg even with ~1 deg outside, when windy that indoor temperature dropped to &gt;10.<p>Now in Sweden, I can easily sit in t-shirt and be comfortable. In fact my office can be heated just using my moderate desktop PC (~450 W power supply), because you don&#x27;t loose the heat to the outside immediately.')
