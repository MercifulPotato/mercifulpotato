All of your family and friends are on there, as well as social organizations, your employer, your pictures, and your messages. The network effect generated by this is irresistibly strong and difficult to run from. Now, you were saying that a company that has such a huge hand in the lives of everyone around you doesn&#x27;t have to respect its users&#x27; accounts and data? That just sounds tone-deaf and irresponsible to me, and has over and over been shown to have damaging consequences for users&#x27; lives and endeavors.')
