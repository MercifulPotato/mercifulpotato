I think it&#x27;s wiser to admit and use these properties instead of ignoring them.<p>Ignoring maths that underlie computation when writing software is like ignoring math that underlies mechanics when building houses: for some time you can get by, but bigger houses will tend to constantly fall or stand a bit askew, and the first woodpecker to fly by would ruin the civilization, just as the saying goes.<p>Uniqueness types were a nice idea indeed. I suspect linear types (or their derivative in Rust) do a very similar thing: data are shared XOR mutable.')
