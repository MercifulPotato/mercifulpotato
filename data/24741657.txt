What happened to it? These days no one talks about AJAX. There was material design a few years later but that was just the looks.<p>Is AJAX now replaced with React.js? or a combination of other stuff (like HTML5 and modern-JS and React.js and stuff)?<p>edit: I just looked up Angular and apparently it was rewritten in Typescript, a strict superset of JS. This doesn&#x27;t make sense. JS is known for massive amounts of cruft. An improvement would&#x27;ve been a scripting language that compiles to &quot;JS: the good parts&quot;, i.e., a subset of JS. But now we should have &quot;Typescript: the good parts&quot; because TS inherited all the bad parts of JS?<p>edit 2: It turns out, there is valid JS that is invalid TS [0]. And yet, TS is described on wikipedia as &quot;a strict superset of JS&quot; [1]. (invalid TS == non-error-free TS).<p>edit 3: Further confirmation about error-free TS not being a strict superset of JS [2]. Such a lie can only be expected from a company like micro$hit.<p>edit 5: even with-error TS is not a superset of JS (the behavior is different) [3].<p>edit 6: Typescript is an opinionated-yet-spineless Javascript!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;TypeScript&#x2F;issues&#x2F;38546" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;TypeScript&#x2F;issues&#x2F;38546</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;TypeScript" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;TypeScript</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;53698835" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;53698835</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18942886" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18942886</a>')
