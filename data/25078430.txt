Our entire system is build on similarly flimsy &quot;identity&quot; from banking, to medical records, and even getting copies of a birth certificate&#x2F;driver&#x27;s license.<p>I would say though that &quot;scale matters.&quot; If an electronic voting system is compromised the &quot;scale&quot; could be the entire state, and millions of votes, but each time a mail ballot is stolen via identity theft, you&#x27;re risking it being detected&#x2F;getting caught, so it ultimately scales to fewer than thousands of potentially problematic votes (which is bad, but not democracy breakingly so, like electronic&#x2F;computer voting insecurity).')
