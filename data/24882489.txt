Item(by='Silhouette', descendants=None, kids=[24883217], score=None, time=1603579415, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24882235, text='<i>An unlocked software architecture and untrusted code leaves people at the mercy of hackers, it doesn&#x27;t empower the average user.</i><p>There are other solutions to this problem that do not involve surrendering control over everything that matters to corporate interests that may coincidentally align with your own sometimes.<p>For example, do we really think a corporation primarily motivated by making its profits is going to be habitually careful about software security? We know this is not often the case, because the quality of so much software produced by big businesses today is terrible in terms of security. What is more telling is that it continues to be terrible even though we are well aware of methods to mitigate many of those vulnerabilities. But those methods usually require more skill and&#x2F;or more time to get right, and typically that means greater up-front costs, and since it turns out that Joe User will often put up with junk security and pay good money for the software anyway, the profit incentive does not have the outcome we would like.<p>Note that this doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean Joe <i>likes</i> the poor security. He might be willing to use the tech anyway because he values what he gets from it more than he believes the dangers are costing him, or because he believes the dangers are inherent in the tech and unavoidable, or because he just doesn&#x27;t realise the dangers are there in the first place.<p>This can be solved in a number of ways, but most of them come down to showing people that it&#x27;s possible to do better by writing software that actually does better, and given the lack of commercial incentives coming from above, the most likely place we&#x27;ll see that is in community efforts. Those efforts don&#x27;t even have to result in some sort of openly developed software that dominates its market to succeed here, just to make it obvious to enough normal people that they don&#x27;t need to accept substandard junk and they should demand better in return for their money.<p>Much the same argument can be applied to issues like privacy, repairable and upgradeable hardware, open standards for data portability, freely programmable devices, and no doubt many more. If competition in the commercial markets isn&#x27;t getting the job done, yet we know doing the job is possible, it&#x27;s up to those of us with the knowledge and skills to push things forward for now. That could mean directly creating better hardware and software, educating our less skilled and experienced peers to improve standards in the industry and make hiring better people less expensive, or simply educating users and pushing for higher standards from the customer&#x27;s side.')
