Item(by='doikor', descendants=None, kids=[25006352], score=None, time=1604647184, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25005370, text='&gt; People do suffer, even die, waiting in line for public treatment<p>Never heard of anyone dying waiting for public treatment here in Finland. If you have some life threatening issue you will get treatment right away.<p>I would say the only one coming anywhere close to that here is the somewhat bad access to mental healthcare that can end up in suicide if left untreated. But based on the amount of homeless people with severe mental illness on the streets of America I don&#x27;t think things are better there (though beating USA in health care is a really low bar)<p>Yes if you have some non-urgent problem you might have to wait a few months in the public health care (if you have the money&#x2F;insurance you can go to the private sector)')
