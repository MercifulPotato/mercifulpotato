Modern databases don&#x27;t need T+2 to achieve consistency.<p>The problem is, you have lots and lots of databases-- there&#x27;s not one central ledger of every position.  Settlement is effectively an atomic commitment protocol, so that if you are selling a stock you expect to receive from one firm to another, and someone else fails to deliver, you need to be able to unwind the downstream trades-- but also need all transactions to eventually become final.<p>The T+1, T+2, T+3 periods are convenient in human units, because sometimes it&#x27;s desirable to have a human in the loop when unexpected things happen.')
