So you could be eating for 200 days and then blow up your account and this does seem to happen to traders.<p>but I am thinking what if you were writing LEAPS. We&#x27;ve been in the longest bull run in history since 2009, so you could&#x27;ve made a lot of money selling LEAPS until maybe 2020 where you would blow up your account and end up owing more than your balance.<p>Also another area that I could never find an answer on: i was told most traders never excersie their options. so if you sell puts and they never exercise you don&#x27;t have to deliver the stocks right? you just end up paying what the options market price is on the day the reputable stock dips?')
