But then again I am a bit confused by this text in the report on digital euro[0], which was recently posted on HN.<p>“While the Eurosystem would always retain control over the issuance of a digital euro, supervised private intermediaries would be best placed to provide ancillary, user-facing services and to build new business models on its core back-end functionality. A model whereby access to the digital euro is intermediated by the private sector is therefore preferable.“<p>That sounds like a bank to me. But I guess it must be so that the relationship between the central bank and intermediary will be different.<p>I struggle to find the defining features of these CBDCs so that it is more than empty branding. I guess you might sum it up as “bringing the central bank and currency-users closer thanks to modern technologies”?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ecb.europa.eu&#x2F;euro&#x2F;html&#x2F;digitaleuro-report.en.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ecb.europa.eu&#x2F;euro&#x2F;html&#x2F;digitaleuro-report.en.ht...</a>')
