This laptop had quite a bit of overheating issues to the point you can&#x27;t even drive all the monitors it says it supports on the spec sheet off the iGPU anywhere close to comfortably.<p>The 13&quot; models which I&#x27;m more interested in are more dated and more behind in terms of weight although the performance makes up for that.  What truly stunned me a few years back was comparing a 13&quot; MBA to a T480s and seeing Macs just get tied or crushed in pretty much any area that wasn&#x27;t related to speaker quality or the trackpad.  This laptop had an extra inch of screen space and an extra 2 cores and better input overall and higher memory support and way more ports and about the same battery life and the same weight and all this for substantially less money especially if you bought memory aftermarket.  It was nothing short of a humiliation - and this wasn&#x27;t even Lenovo&#x27;s top product - Apple wasn&#x27;t even competing with second rate products.  I seriously wondered how Apple had fallen so far from the heyday of the MBPr and if it was just going to let the MacBooks decay into irrelevance.<p>I also would compare Apple to the X1 line, not the cheaper XPS line with a 32gb memory limit just because it&#x27;s popular.  I could compare Apple to Inspiron which is even more popular and Apple would be even further ahead.  Hopefully Dell can make some good laptops one day.')
