The ones you hear about are typically due to healthcare providers not providing sufficient justification for the healthcare or medications they are prescribing, which can easily cost tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars.<p>The “insurers” are many times not even the payer.  In many cases, the government hires insurers to adjudicate healthcare according to the government’s rules, which will specify under what scenario and documentation they will pay for certain treatments.<p>Surely, there are mistakes made, but there is no standard operating procedure at insurance companies to deny healthcare.  They employ teams of doctors and pharmacists to review cases and determine what is evidence based medicine and what conforms to the payers’ guidelines.')
