The article talks about nothing that will stop the abuse. There are indeed a <i>lot</i> of RFEs that are being given out if you don&#x27;t have a CS degree and apply for a Software Developer position already.<p>The Pay structure that the article mentions is NOT true anymore. Take a look at the links[1], it&#x27;s withdrawn and the rule is not valid.<p>How is hiring folks with a CS degree for an SWE position a solution to H1b abuse?<p>The rule published here specifically talks about three things(Yes, I read it line by line just so that I can do my due diligence before I comment here)[2]:<p>1&#x2F; Change the meaning of &quot;Speciality Occupation&quot; and tie this to the College degree that the person has.<p>2&#x2F; If you are part of these &quot;body shops&quot; and you are working as a contractor, your visa will only be extended for 1 year.<p>3&#x2F; Some general statements about Site Visits.<p>4&#x2F; No comment on increasing the wage.<p>The first child comment that we see below is an anecdotal evidence about seeing a house with dozen(?) folks in a 3 BHK flat? What does it do with H1B visa abuse? How is sending money home AFTER taxes H1B abuse?<p>Still debating how we went from thoroughly researched and thought provoking comments to these.<p>I don&#x27;t debate that there is H1B abuse.<p>- Programmers are paid very less when compared to prevailing wage.<p>- Programmers cannot leave their employers so employers hold them by their balls and get work done overtime.<p>- Programmers stay away from their family, contribute to taxes AND to social security.  KNOWING that they may never see a day to collect Social security.<p>All of this is H1B Abuse. There is no evidence that folks on H1B visa compete with a US Citizen&#x27;s job. (I&#x27;m taking about H1B, not offshoring).<p>Literally NONE of the changes that this administration is doing is addressing ANY of these concerns for both the US Economy and the H1B individual. Comments like these are dangerous since they give an illusion that the administration is doing something to improve the economy, but they are just party tricks.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reginfo.gov&#x2F;public&#x2F;do&#x2F;eoDetails?rrid=131148" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reginfo.gov&#x2F;public&#x2F;do&#x2F;eoDetails?rrid=131148</a><p>[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;public-inspection.federalregister.gov&#x2F;2020-22347.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;public-inspection.federalregister.gov&#x2F;2020-22347.pdf</a>')
