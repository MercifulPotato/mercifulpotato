I had to keep in mind that I am matching each node with each other. It&#x27;s important to know how to deal with the registry that&#x27;s why I tried to keep siblings&#x2F;parent&#x2F;children as sK&#x2F;pK&#x2F;chK and I thought it&#x27;s easier to be remembered this way.<p>&gt; Node api &amp; DocumentFragment<p>The main idea here is owning the nodes to be manipulated as an object. In node API you can get the node and traverse up&#x2F;down. While following DFlex approach you can traverse through the whole DOM tree including siblings at no cost.<p>Why? because basically, you read the node only when &quot;it&#x27;s mounted&quot; then you can deal with Web API by doing write-only. Your browser won&#x27;t repaint or do any extra steps to get the nodes. This leads to the next part: letting the app interact with nodes by animation. It won&#x27;t hurt the user experience and let the app change the DOM node smoothly.')
