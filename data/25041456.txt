I get that you&#x27;re unhappy about your purchase, but buying a different widget wouldn&#x27;t have helped if someone was stealing packages on delivery day.<p>If it was a item specific shipping problem, like Amazon packed it in such a way that it arrived broken and could be expected to arrive broken, that&#x27;s somewhat useful, although it probably applies to the whole product category (btw, don&#x27;t buy hard drives from amazon if you don&#x27;t want them to be packed in a big box with like 3 air pillows and banging back and forth for the whole drive).<p>If a fork lift smashed into the package at the warehouse, that&#x27;s just bad luck, not a product issue; contact customer service.')
