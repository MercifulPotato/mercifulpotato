Get professional help.  A combination of COVID-19, a high paying&#x2F;high stress consulting job, and a history OCD related stress &amp; paranoia pushed me into a VERY bad place.  I was considering suicide. I didn&#x27;t go outside for weeks if I could avoid it.  I&#x27;d go 3-4 days w&#x2F;o a shower (out of character for me).  I started subconsciously punishing myself via starvation (Shitty Life Pro-Tip - drink a lot of water &amp; you won&#x27;t feel hungry!  Eating disorders FTW!) because I wasn&#x27;t hungry &amp; didn&#x27;t need to eat because I wasn&#x27;t really doing anything all day.  I cut off from people who reached out to me.<p>I was fortunate to be well off financially after 5 months to walk away from the consulting job.  My wife didn&#x27;t see it because I hid it from her.  I reached a braking point when I walked way from the consulting &amp; was well supported by the engagement manager.  I took two months off, I started seeing a counselor (virtually, thanks COVID-19), and I started on Prozac.  I&#x27;m not &quot;done&quot; yet, but I&#x27;m an order of magnitude closer to who I was before all this happened.  I&#x27;ve started to gain weight back.  Suicide no longer holds its appeal.  I can consider the idea that there might be a world after the year 2020, and that I should be a part of it.<p>Sorry - I know this is rambling.  Let me pull back to my point: getting help is the only thing that would help.  If you could change yourself, by yourself, you would have by now.  It takes the push of someone else&#x27;s perspective to move you, because you simply can&#x27;t move yourself.  Your best bet is a professional - you have your own bias and trust issues with friends &amp; family, no matter how much they mean to you.  Hang in there.  No matter how bad life gets, don&#x27;t let anyone, let alone you, tell you that you don&#x27;t deserve to be a part of it.')
