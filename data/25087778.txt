They&#x27;re charged with misleading investors, over just how successful it was.<p>Having opened fake accounts, charging fees for them, and potentially damaging consumers&#x27; credit... that produces no charge. The company paid fines, but the executives who knowingly messed with customers suffered nothing. It&#x27;s only because they messed with investors that they&#x27;re finally being charged with a crime.')
