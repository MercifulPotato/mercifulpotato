Completing after 75% doesn&#x27;t mean completing after 75%. It means the developers had to estimate the time taken for 2 subtasks (e.g. uploading and committing via an API request) and said that uploading was likely 75% and the commit step 25%. What happens is likely that the final 25% was so fast it seemed instant.<p>The options are: 1) don&#x27;t show progress.  Show a marquee, as to not lie. This is <i>terrible</i>. Please don&#x27;t do this. 2) Show two phases. E.g. the first phase progress runs slowly from 0-100 and the second one runs instantly from 0-100. 3) Guess better. Such as do it adaptively. The expected time for phase N is estimated from data (e.g. last time for commit phase, or from a bandwidth estimate from last upload times the file size). 5) Add a minimum phase time so that instantaneous completion takes e.g. 50ms, so people get time to see the completion at 100%. 4) Do nothing. No one expects progress bars to run linearly.<p>There are so many good options that are better than &quot;don&#x27;t show progress, only show activity&quot;. Even the do nothing&#x2F;status quo alternative is much better than no progress bar.')
