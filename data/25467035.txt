As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s just a web component framework. Google took a very unique approach in inventing web components. Most people who invent web frameworks just put them out there as their own arbitrary unilateral design like Django, React, etc. and if enough people sign on board it&#x27;s a thing. Web components was the one time when someone who wanted a new framework, actually put the time and effort into attracting the involvement of the browser authors and web consortium and standards bodies. That&#x27;s a real long road and it&#x27;s incredibly hard. Google did that. It&#x27;s something worth respecting, even if web components don&#x27;t feel all the great to code.<p>Beyond being a web component framework, I have no idea who the hell these AMP people are, and why they&#x27;re forming consensus committees acting like they&#x27;re steering the future of the Internet. We can see how quickly that fell apart into public metadrama the moment they lost their big stick SEO, since IIRC Google recently stopped explicitly favoring AMP results.<p>If Google was smart, they would have invented an algorithm that can tell &quot;your website is a slow bloated popup laden piece of crap&quot; and we&#x27;re going to officially demote your SEO because of that. If Google actually did that, rather than granting favoritism to the slow popup laden websites like NYTimes, then the mobile web would instantly transform itself overnight. And then they could say, hey, if you&#x27;re not sure how to make web pages that don&#x27;t suck, use AMP, which is guideline for the confused on how to achieve a mobile friendly ui that isn&#x27;t downranked.<p>&gt; Googleâ€™s thesis is that the mobile-web is dying and people prefer to use apps<p>And I&#x27;m still sitting here spending most of my time in a terminal. What is dead may never die. If the mobile web dies then Google only has its own stewardship to blame. Google once understood that its interests were tied with the success of the open web and I&#x27;m sorry but they surely didn&#x27;t think that a horse which died due to their policies would come back to life if they moved its corpse out of the barnyard and into a closed barn? Since that&#x27;s basically how all this comes across.')
