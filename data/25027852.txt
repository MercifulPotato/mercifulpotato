Issue everyone a cryptographic signature card with a private key on it.<p>2. This card has a pin and allows the user to digitally sign any document with a private key associated with that citizen&#x2F;resident.<p>3. This private key never leaves the card. Overall, this is fairly similar to how hardware wallets for blockchains work.<p>4. For voting, you can either download your ballot online, or go in person to a voting booth.<p>5. You fill out your digital ballot, then sign it with your private key &#x2F; card (again, either on your own computer or a ballot box machine does this for you), and your signed ballot is uploaded to a central repository. This central repository is not a blockchain, it is merely a place that has each users public key. When you need to count the votes, you validate  everyone&#x27;s ballots with public keys and tally them in a second.<p>6. As proof you have voted, the machine you uploaded your ballot to in turn sends you a payload which has been signed with your public key, and therefore can only be decrypted again using your private key card. This is how you know your vote will be counted.<p>The added benefit of this is that the card also becomes your new identity provider for basically every authentication you need (getting a bank account, signing a document, etc) and is much, much superior to the current status quo where the validation is either a digital (handwriting) signature or  &quot;what is your address and SSN?&quot;.')
