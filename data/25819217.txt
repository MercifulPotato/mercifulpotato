Item(by='axaxs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610955297, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25819161, text='This doesn&#x27;t make sense to me as it has the opposite effect.  If I want to buy an item, I&#x27;m pretty dead set on buying it.  Now it&#x27;s just to figure out which company&#x27;s to buy.  If I can&#x27;t rely on reviews and get a terrible unit, I will return it and no longer trust Amazon for that item and turn elsewhere.  Ultimately, Amazon lost some money, I lost some time, and Amazon lost the sale.')
