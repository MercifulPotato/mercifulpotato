This happen with Johnson in the UK wherein there was an &#x27;issue election&#x27; called and people were well aware of the issues.<p>This was actually a pretty strong and democratic process: Johnson had not been elected, so he went to the polls and people had material, meaningful input.<p>In proportional representation systems, leaders can change without elections as well (see: Sweden, Finland etc.) and it&#x27;s not exactly perfect but it works well enough.<p>The &#x27;good&#x27; European nations have pretty good democracy at the national level.<p>It&#x27;s at the EU level that it&#x27;s all Byzantine. Pun intended.')
