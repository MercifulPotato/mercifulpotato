SocialScape, our cloud-based data and analytics platform, delivers insight around who is exposed to social risk, what that social risk is and the impact it has to your healthcare enterprise.<p>We are currently looking for full stack developers to help us scale our ingestion and data platforms in AWS. If you&#x27;re interested in building blue-green deployments and scaling API’s we should talk. Small but growing team, lots of ownership opportunities.<p>Tech Stack: Python, Node, TypeScript, React, Serverless, Posgresql, Spark, AWS, Docker&#x2F;ECS, GeoServer, PostGIS. Go is slowly sneaking into the mix for some of our API&#x27;s.<p>If this sounds interesting, email me at michaelhans at sociallydetermined.com (include &quot;HN&quot; in the subject). I&#x27;m happy to talk about our open roles and Socially Determined’s mission.')
