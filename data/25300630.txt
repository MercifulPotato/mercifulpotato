The web may now be a platform to lock-in and enslave users; just isn&#x27;t anymore a recommendable place for sharing documents, reach out, and inspiration. We didn&#x27;t need that; we had plenty of app platforms already.<p>Edit: you can still serve Google-commissioned fonts directly from your domain of course, and CDNs were always a bit fishy')
