Still big! But manageable. And some of the lightweight specialty parts (like computers) could still be imported from earth, further reducing the size.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it won&#x27;t still be big. You basically need community in Low earth orbit, low lunar orbit, or on the moon. But it could well be worth it; depending on the demand for hardware in earth orbit to begin with.<p>If you get moon launch costs low enough (and they&#x27;d be low!) you might start competing with some traditional industries on earth.')
