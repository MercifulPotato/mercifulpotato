Item(by='gruez', descendants=None, kids=[25204299, 25204314], score=None, time=1606260320, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25204109, text='&gt; I believe OP is saying when they can&#x27;t cover orders, they pull the plug on the market rather than be overexposed.<p>I still have trouble picturing how this conspiracy would work. I assume it involves coinbase pumping bitcoin prices with money that they don&#x27;t have. They pump it all the way up, realize &quot;oh shit we don&#x27;t have enough real money to cover the fake money&quot;, and then pull the plug to stop the bleed? Can&#x27;t they decide ahead of time how much money they can safely spend and stop accordingly? Why do they need to halt trading? If they stop pumping, and the price continues to rise, that doesn&#x27;t cause them to lose any more money, because it&#x27;s just other people trading with other people.<p>&gt;As far as server load goes up, by how much does it need to increase to cause a problem? Are the numbers feasable, eg 100x volumes?<p>It&#x27;s kind of hard to tell just by looking at the charts. Just because trade volume is low doesn&#x27;t mean load on the order matching engine is low. If you spam the trading engine with tons of non-marketable orders, nothing will get executed (no volume), but the order matching engine will still have to wade through those orders.')
