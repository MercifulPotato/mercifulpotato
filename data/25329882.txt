What other option do customers have than to accept the delay and just buy the game later? Games are being delayed all the time, it&#x27;s not like everybody suddenly loses interest in a game they would like to play and are waiting for once it fails to arrive at its initial release date.<p>Also, it&#x27;s not an indie studio that needs sales money right now to keep existing. They can easily afford much bigger delays. They prefer to put their employees at severe health risk instead so they can maximize profits.')
