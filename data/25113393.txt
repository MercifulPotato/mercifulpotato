Everyone I know who has gotten covid - several neighbors (and their households), most of my wife&#x27;s hometown (400 people) - including her parents (in their 70s) and two of her siblings and all their children (15 people) all had it.  For everyone it was somewhere between nothing and a bad cold.  Nobody has any lingering issues.  We don&#x27;t want to paint our picture of the situation using only extremes. How about we include the &quot;average&quot; anecdata too?')
