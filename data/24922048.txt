Xorg needs to become a community project again. The current maintainers are almost without exception full time paid employees and act solely in the interest of their employers and NOT in the interest of the FOSS community. Their employers have decided to sabotage the ecosystem by breaking established community standards. Maintaining backwards compatibility is the most important thing to keep any ecosystem alive. This means the community should abandon their software (e.g. Wayland) and put people in charge of X11 that start acting in their interest.')
