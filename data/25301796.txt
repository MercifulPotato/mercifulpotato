Too many corporate customers and governments use it, email holds up in court these days as official communications.  Larger users of that have it on-prem.<p>Think if you run IT for a large (&gt;5000 people) company, what benefit would there be for a project to change your entire email stack?  A new provider would have to check off all those compliance, governance, security, etc. check-boxes and then some.  That is what Slack would be up against to get into that market.<p>In a way, they are killing email.  A lot of communication across 3 or more people used to only be via email. Now it happens in Slack (or MS Teams I suppose)')
