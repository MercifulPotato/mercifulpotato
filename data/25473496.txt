E.g. if you tear your rotator cuff, the healing of sewn up region will  adhere not only to the cuff but other parts of your shoulder, preventing it from moving.  The only fix is to (painfully) move the shoulder as it heals to tear those adhesions and form some scar tissue.<p>Experiments in animals showed that they would recover full motion in their joints with no apparent discomfort.<p>But when we interviewed doctors we discovered that they knew this was a terrible problem but blamed it on the techniques of other doctors.  &quot;When it&#x27;s my turn on call I get these calls from patients, some in terrible pain.  I am very careful and my patients never have this problem.  This sounds like a great idea though I&#x27;d never use it myself.&quot;  Of course we sometimes talked to multiple doctors in the same physician&#x27;s group and they would say this about each other.<p>We ended up using the technology in a different (medical) application.')
