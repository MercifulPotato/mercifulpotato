That distinction is important.<p>Language modeling in the context of machine learning typically means NLP methods. Genetics is nothing like natural language.<p>Auto-regression is using (typically time series) information to predict the next codon. This makes very little sense in the context of genetics since, again, the genetic code is not an information carrying medium in the same sense as human language. Being able to predict the next codon tells you zilch in terms of useable information.<p>&quot;Depth of understanding by the network&quot; ... what does that even mean???<p>The above sentence is a bunch of popular technical jargon from an unrelated field thrown together in a nonsensical way.
