To call these people selfish is way off the mark.<p>Why isn&#x27;t this selfish? They put not only themselves, but also their families at risk.<p>Perhaps you&#x27;ll say they&#x27;re being &quot;foolish&quot; instead of &quot;selfish&quot; - perhaps they have been mislead to ignore or disbelieve the truth of how potent the virus is, or how miserable a way to die it is.
