Startups used to be a good trick around them but there are plenty of rats in startups these days too. I strongly suggest accepting rats as a part of work, and learning to deal with them, just the way you deal with risk of crime or pandemics. To be clear, you shouldn&#x27;t be stoic and ignore it, but you should join the pointless attrition wars and try to win. Robert Greene&#x27;s books have excellent advice and patterns for politics. In the book Mastery, he even adds it as a phase for career advancement, e.g. Benjamin Franklin getting screwed many times by his ambition and focus on work, until he wised up and learned to manage the office politics.<p>The most unpopular advice I&#x27;d offer is work smart <i>and</i> work hard. Very few people are willing to do both and it will set you up well. Unintuitively, it&#x27;s also the easiest path, especially when you make it a part of your character and not as something you just slog through until financial freedom. You should always hide how hard you work as the envy attracts bad things.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of competition for spots where you do little work and make a lot of money, and little competition for the ones where you do a lot of work, and make good money. Thus, the latter will also give you more power and flexibility.')
