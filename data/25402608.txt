Item(by='buserror', descendants=None, kids=[25402657, 25402703], score=None, time=1607813938, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25396745, text='You don&#x27;t risk &quot;overexposing&quot; (as the article says) anything with film&#x2F;paper; basically you reach the &quot;reciprocity failure&quot; where the rule of exposure fails, and you can pretty much ignore the exposure time &#x2F;completely&#x2F; at that point. Double it? fine. 4 times? still fine :-)<p>I&#x27;ve done many 30 minutes+ exposures on both pinhole and large format cameras. On the later, it captures an insane amount of tonalities from what you are imaging, almost like &quot;HDR&quot; but well, with just a piece of carboard for shutter and a watch to time how long your patience lasts :-)')
