I understand why businesses don&#x27;t focus on this market, but the hurdles imposed on simply getting into embedded programming are absurd.  Yes, you have things like Arduino that can target multiple platforms.  On the other hand, all of the hand-holding with libraries and hardware modules doesn&#x27;t exactly encourage diving deeply into the subject.  Then there is the stuff that simply isn&#x27;t accessible, such as attaching to debuggers.<p>That said, there are some promising projects out there.
