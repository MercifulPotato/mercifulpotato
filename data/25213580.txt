Item(by='thaumasiotes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606334300, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25211948, text='&gt; Germ theory also covers stuff like non-airborne transmission (food&#x2F;water&#x2F;bodily fluids).<p>First, that&#x27;s not correct; the germ theory of disease is simply the statement that diseases are caused by germs as opposed to being caused in some other way. Transmission is not a part of it.<p>Second, if you believe that small creatures too small to see can make you sick if you inhale them, it&#x27;s not really a stretch to think that those creatures can make you sick if they get into your body by any other means.<p>(Note that not all apparent diseases are caused by germs; some are caused by genetic conditions, some are caused by dietary deficiencies, some are caused by inorganic poisons, and some are caused by creatures which are easily large enough to see with the naked eye. Does this make the &quot;germ theory of disease&quot; incorrect?)')
