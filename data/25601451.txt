It&#x27;s still negative, and it still hurts the employee in question, even if they still get to draw a paycheck for a time.  It&#x27;s just a... different... kind of bias than the kind I mentioned.<p>&gt; </i>So we should not automatically assume, as the person I was replying to suggested, that someone will be biased against because of their race or gender for affirming work boundaries.*<p>My original comment didn&#x27;t suggest that we should automatically assume that, just that it was a possibility.  And I&#x27;d still expect my possibility to be more likely and pervasive than the scenario you described.')
