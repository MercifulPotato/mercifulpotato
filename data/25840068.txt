Item(by='Bakary', descendants=None, kids=[25841037], score=None, time=1611096925, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25837891, text='This is a misunderstanding of the argument I&#x27;m making here. To break it down in more direct terms:<p>Premise A: For something to be democratic, the population has to wield power directly or indirectly by electing representatives.\nPremise B: we cannot let just any type of speech or information propagate, because certain types of information are liable to make the population do bad things and harm democracy.<p>The premise B immediately runs into problems with A for a number of reasons:<p>1. We are implicitly agreeing that there is a caste of people that knows better than the population at large, and we count ourselves within that group when arguing about the topic (the &quot;I&#x27;m stuck in traffic&quot; instead of &quot;I am the traffic&quot; conclusion)<p>2. The flow of information and speech must be controlled so that the population is only exposed to certain things.<p>If the information or speech flow the population is exposed to must be controlled lest they do the wrong things, and that this control must be exercised by some vaguely defined group of reasonable people that includes the arguer, then in this scenario the population cannot be said to actually wield power and the arguer cannot be said to actually believe in democracy but presumably in some form of technocracy.<p>You end up with a paradox in which people claim to want democracy while arguing that a control and screening of the population is absolutely necessary for democracy.<p>To be clear, I am in general agreement with you that unfettered lies pose an existential risk. But it is not in any way a democratic sentiment: it is a technocratic one since in this case you do not trust the population to wield supreme political power on its own, without guidance.')
