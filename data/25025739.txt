Most of the time, radio buttons are mutually exclusive and you can only choose one. Check boxes on the other hand are, <i>most of the time</i>, cumulative.<p>i.e: if you want to signify you can select multiple items, you use check boxes. If you want to signify you can select only one item, you use a radio button.<p>I&#x27;m a simple person conditioned by years of this pattern, but I think you&#x27;d find the same sentiment if you search for &quot;checkbox vs radio button&quot;.')
