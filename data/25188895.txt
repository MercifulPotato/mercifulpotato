Nobody thrives under veganism or carnivorism. Human beings can barely subsist on an industrialized vegan diet as it is.<p>&gt;  but rather, “What diet is most compassionate.”<p>No sane person who was &quot;compassionate&quot; would choose a vegan diet. A bowl of salad has more dead animal parts than a plate of steak. In order of compassion, the most compassionate diet is the hunter gatherer diet. You take from nature what nature provides. The second most compassionate is the homestead diet. Raise and eat what you grow. The third compassionate diet is the modern industrialized omnivore diet. The the most cruel and absolutely worst diet is the vegan diet. Not only is it unnatural to humans, a vegan diet requires globalization and the destruction of fertile rich biodiverse lands to grow plants for human consumption. Not only that, you still require processed pills to supplement the unnatural vegan diet.<p>Not only is the vegan diet cruel to animals, it&#x27;s cruel to the environment and cruel to humans. You can&#x27;t grow avocados, almonds, bananas, etc in south dakota.<p>If we hated a nation of peoples and wanted to them suffer and die off, we&#x27;d encourage them to adopt a vegan diet. That&#x27;s how horrible of a diet veganism is. Nowhere on earth can a human being survive on locally sourced vegan diet. It&#x27;s why no human society is vegan.<p>What vegans are pathetic people who want to feel superior. It&#x27;s the new form of white supremacy. It&#x27;s what privileged people who want to feel better than others virtue signal about. What is veganism? It&#x27;s just another way for social media addicts to get a &quot;like&quot;.<p>If vegans truly cared about animals, environment, etc they wouldn&#x27;t be vegans, they&#x27;d be hunter gatherers. But that&#x27;s too much work for these lazy bastards.<p>Rather than &quot;What diet is most compassionate.”, veganism is about &quot;What diet will give me the most &quot;likes&quot;&quot;. What diet can I leverage for the most virtue signal points.<p>Edit: Also, so many vegans own pets. Pets that require meat. So it&#x27;s not compassion, it must be something else.')
