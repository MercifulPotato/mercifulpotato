Depends whether you&#x27;re talking about (a) &quot;free speech, the legally-protected institution&quot; or (b) &quot;free speech, your right to be awful and not suffer consequences&quot;. The xkcd is saying that people saying &quot;but my free speech!&quot; are defending (b) by describing it as (a), which it&#x27;s not. That&#x27;s basically true. Afaik the part xkcd definitely gets wrong is the part about &quot;can&#x27;t arrest you for what you say&quot;, which isn&#x27;t really how it works (for instance <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.popehat.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;06&#x2F;11&#x2F;hello-youve-been-referred-here-because-youre-wrong-about-the-first-amendment&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.popehat.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;06&#x2F;11&#x2F;hello-youve-been-referred...</a> discusses the case of how it enters into civil suits).<p>Of course _philosophically_, yeah, the people who included (a) in the constitution were interested in (b). Everyone&#x27;s on board with free speech as a concept here. But at some point if someone is yelling Nazi stuff, I&#x27;m gonna punch them for it. It&#x27;s not a legal question at all; my actions aren&#x27;t governed by laws, just what I feel is right to do. That is the same point xkcd was making. I don&#x27;t know enough to say whether AWS or whoever has the same right because they are operating in a legal system. But as a _person_, yeah, I can do whatever I want to you, including &#x27;show you the door&#x27;, if you&#x27;re awful.')
