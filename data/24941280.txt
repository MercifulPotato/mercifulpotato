Item(by='tgb', descendants=None, kids=[24941705, 24941294], score=None, time=1604059018, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24940316, text='I was wondering, what&#x27;s the &quot;right&quot; way to run a Factorio-like simulation, algorithmic ally speaking? I.e. You have conveyor belts bringing items to&#x2F;from producer&#x2F;consumer objects. A conveyor can only move its item forward if the next conveyor tile is empty (or is moving its current item off). Can you do this in a single pass over conveyor tiles and&#x2F;or items?<p>It feels like there should be an elegant solution.')
