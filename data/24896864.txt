This is not a fact of nature, it’s a willful decision. For example, the US used to be a leader in education. The thing that changed since then is one party started defunding education and moving that money to private prisons and defense.<p>If we as a people collectively agreed that we are as smart as other countries, there’s no reason we can’t have a functional government that can handle public education and vaccine efforts and keep us safe and maintain our infrastructure and everything else we expect our government to do for us.')
