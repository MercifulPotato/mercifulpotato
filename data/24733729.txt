If you can&#x27;t function without a school teacher and aren&#x27;t ready for the &quot;adult world,&quot; you can nonetheless get a Twitter or Facebook account just like anybody else, and interact with the adults, and maybe even fool some of them. It takes a while to sort out who&#x27;s an insane asshole. The only way to tell is by listening for a while to what&#x27;s coming out of their megaphone that unfortunately millions of other people can also hear. Finally you decide they&#x27;re a metaphorical non-adult and, I guess, block or unfriend them, but meanwhile millions of other non-adults are like &quot;Yesss, finally someone said what my lizard brain has been thinking all along!!&quot; That&#x27;s not what happens with the guy on the sidewalk holding the sign.')
