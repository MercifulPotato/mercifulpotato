Knowing what needs to be done is much easier than actually doing it.<p>Example: giving feedback is notoriously hard, even if it&#x27;s really clear what the issues are. Promotion is also hard (you have to choose who to promote and who to not promote), and most of the time you do know the right choice but you might not be able to call it for personal reasons.<p>So yes, if you happen to manage people, spend a LOT of effort on self-reflection. Go to a coach, therapist, go to courses where they let you practice and where you get feedback. Whatever works for you, just keep investing. Also, don&#x27;t worry if the coach, course, therapist is imperfect.')
