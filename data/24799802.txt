I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s happened in software in less sophisticated, but maybe more understandable ways.  Lane-keeping &amp; auto-braking software - which loads of cars have - is absolutely terrifying to think about, and I&#x27;d be fascinated to see these attacked from a research POV.<p>My old Celica tried to murder me on the M62 and Toyota denied the problem for years (the gas pedals got stuck under the floor mats).  And that was just a really obvious (in retrospect) design flaw - for how long could a car maker  viably deny safety problems in their software?')
