He will be missed.<p>In 2001, he wanted the VC firm he was a young partner at to invest in my way-early &amp; mispositioned P2P startup, Bitzi. His partners gave good feedback, but passed, probably for the right reasons. Dan wrote a personal check, no paperwork, that helped keep the servers on for another year or so.<p>During the 2001-2003 dotcom winter, I put Dan in touch with the founders of both Friendster &amp; Tribe, which he also angel-invested in. Still no financial return, as far as I know â€“ and maybe some investor acrimony in those early social-networking rivalries? But he expressed his deep appreciation to me for those adventures for other reasons.<p>There&#x27;s still a Fitbit on my wrist, after hearing his early raves about them a decade ago.<p>He really loved lower Manhattan, &amp; it was a vicarious thrill to observe Dan raising his children there. (As someone whose parents fled 1970s Manhattan with young me, there&#x27;s still a deep limbic &quot;You can do that?!&quot; wonder when people pull that off.)<p>Thanks, Dan. My heart goes out to his family.')
