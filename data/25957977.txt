Physicians rely heavily on pharmacists to call the shots on treatment plans now more than ever.<p>We built our own in house solution to this exact problem, but its maintained by our own clinical staff, it costs us north of $300k a year to maintain it! This only works of course because we have over 150 specialty pharmacies in our &#x27;network&#x27; so we have volume to help keep up with costs.<p>I could honestly see us leveraging a solution like this at some point in the future, and probably anybody running fewer than 10 specialty pharmacies <i>needs</i> a solution like this.<p>Good luck to you guys!')
