For anyone interested in experimenting with it without setting up a server, I&#x27;ve been working on a simple Gemini site builder that works over HTTP and serves the content via Gemini and HTTP proxy:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flounder.online&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flounder.online&#x2F;</a><p>In my view, Gemini&#x27;s bare-bones text format is its killer feature. Non-technical users have been able to easily write Gemtext based on a few examples and a bit of experimentation. This gets users away from WSIWYG without forcing them to learn something as complex as HTML. And unlike Markdown, it is clearly-specified, universal, and doesn&#x27;t compile to anything else.<p>Many people criticize Gemini for lacking this or that feature, and being basically useless for &quot;practical&quot; applications. I wrote an blog post about this:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.flounder.online&#x2F;gemlog&#x2F;2021-01-08-useless.gmi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alex.flounder.online&#x2F;gemlog&#x2F;2021-01-08-useless.gmi</a>')
