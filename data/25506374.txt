Refusing to have conversations with klan members does not prevent me from understanding and analyzing racism in america. In fact, I&#x27;m going to get a <i>much better</i> understanding by speaking to historians than klan members, since klan members aren&#x27;t exactly incentivized to provide a dispassionate analysis of their ideology.<p>People aren&#x27;t scared of coming into contact with bad ideas.
