Save for the particularly one sided conflicts.<p>That&#x27;s because the nazis lost. If they had won, as Robert McNamara said, we&#x27;d be called murderers and criminals and our leaders would have been hanged for crimes against humanity.<p>Not only did the british call the revolutionaries murderers, they also called them terrorists since the revolutionaries were attacking and terrorizing the loyalists. Ironic huh? One man&#x27;s freedom fighter is another man&#x27;s terrorist.<p>As strange as it sounds, in an alternate universe where the brits won, the history books probably describe the revolutionaries as murderers and terrorists. Can you imagine how odd it would be to view Benedict Arnold as a hero and George Washington as the villain?<p>&gt; there was no ambiguity that the revolutionary war was a bloody conflict.<p>And there certainly was no ambuigity about who were the good guys and who were the bad guys.<p>History is just one part of nation building propaganda. The people in charge ( usually the winners ) get to write it. Fundamentally, there are no good guys or bad guys, just winners and losers in history.')
