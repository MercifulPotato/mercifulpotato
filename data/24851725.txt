The accuracy of this statement is frightening.<p>I&#x27;m annoyed with YT pushing major media orgs&#x27; content out because the only reason I watch it is for the smaller creators. But the reality is the ads are annoying.<p>And it&#x27;s worth paying for just to be able to listen to the app with the screen turned off. I&#x27;ve also warmed up quite a bit to YT Music even if the UI feels a bit rough around the edges (browser; mobile is OK).<p>But the ads? Yeah, that&#x27;s a big reason.')
