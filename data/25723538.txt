And setting it up doesn&#x27;t require following a wiki, using the commandline and&#x2F;or having to edit obscure config files or messing around with weird GUI settings apps.<p>I have nothing against KDE by any means (I love it, and also really appreciate their initatives like KDEnlive, etc.), but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever gotten Japanese&#x2F;Chinese input to work in it before. Maybe once, but then I gave up on finding a sane way to easily cycle between the different input types (eg, WinKey+Space).')
