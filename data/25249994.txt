Item(by='ksk', descendants=None, kids=[25251817], score=None, time=1606701127, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25248131, text='&gt;Why provide any education at all then? As a society it is our responsibility to skill the next generation with the skills they need to operate in our society. I believe critical thinking skills is one of these required skills.<p>There are several views on education. It used to be that you went to school&#x2F;college to be educated, but lately it seems like the schools are just places where you get trained so that you can get a job. Would parents send their kids to school if primary goal was education, and getting a job was just incidental?<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t think critical thinking skills can be taught in a school via a curriculum en-masse. It requires a personal approach tailored to each individual&#x27;s needs based on their upbringing and cultural context.<p>&gt;We really are fucked then aren&#x27;t we. I kind of like living in a liberal democracy. If we throw our current system out due to ignorance I am very confident what comes next will not be superior. I&#x27;m not willing to accept that as path we take.<p>Yes, we might very well be fucked in the near-term. But I&#x27;m not saying we throw everything out, I&#x27;m saying we have to trust people more than systems. How many people are willing to earnestly engage with the other side? We have to do our part to foster safe-zones where people can express any and all ideas without fear of being ridiculed or shamed. We&#x27;re all responsible in some way for the decline in public trust in several pillars of democracy - especially the news media. To make it personal, several of my family members are Trump voters, and I do not think they&#x27;re racist or evil. I understand them, and they hold varying beliefs with varying degrees of certitude but they feel trapped where they cannot even express an opinion without being shouted down and ridiculed.')
