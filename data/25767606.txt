Item(by='INTPenis', descendants=None, kids=[25767766], score=None, time=1610570076, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25767475, text='They would be old, which is a perfect time to come forwards.<p>Anyways, I&#x27;m not saying I can identify which natural phenomenon it is, I&#x27;m just using the process of elimination.<p>Because let&#x27;s assume this was a sentient thing, at least sentient enough to know that these aircraft posed a danger to it.<p>Well that&#x27;s where the paradox starts because this thing apparently has the ability to disable the instrumentation of a fighter jet with such precision that it does not damage the aircraft, it does not damage the aviators and it can be restored after leaving its sphere of influence.<p>So one must ask, why would an object with such power be afraid of these aircraft?<p>So you might say, &quot;it&#x27;s merely an effect of being near the object, not a deployed capability against these aircraft&quot;.<p>Ok fine but that&#x27;s a very specific non-conscious effect to be flying around inside Iranian airspace with. If this particular object has that effect then why don&#x27;t all UFOs disable all instrumentation in a sphere around them all the time?<p>How come only these particular planes that were heading towards it, like in a movie or a novel.')
