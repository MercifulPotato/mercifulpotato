You&#x27;re constantly paying attention to what it&#x27;s doing but you can rely on it to keep its lane and distance from other cars. I appreciate it immensely on longer drives since I don&#x27;t get as tired &#x2F; exhausted from constantly having to be giving micro-inputs. It allows me to drive for hours and keep my head feeling fresh for much longer than when I drive other cars with no asststance features.')
