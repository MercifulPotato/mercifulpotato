However, there are various alternatives to probability which can be more appropriate for certain applications. For instance, with degrees of surprise (or ranks as they are called) you do not need to know exact probabilities, although the price you pay is that the scale is more coarse grained. If you reason about events that are either very probable or very improbable, then degrees of surprise are easier to work with than probabilities.<p>There&#x27;s also a computational benefit. Execution of a ranked program is done much like a non-deterministic program where choice points execute &quot;least surprising first&quot;. Compare that with the sampling techniques necessary in probabilistic programming that do not even provide exact results.')
