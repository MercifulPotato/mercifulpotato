All the states are only a few % away from net neutral when it comes to federal money in vs out.  Pretty much any state could go it alone from a monetary perspective.  Trade agreements would be the hard part.<p>Also, I think you&#x27;re greatly mis-judging how a deal to the tune of &quot;be 5% poorer but do 100% listening to what the people on the costs have to say&quot; sounds to e.g. the midwest.  You say that like it&#x27;s an obvious bad deal.  I don&#x27;t think all of them would agree with you on that though.')
