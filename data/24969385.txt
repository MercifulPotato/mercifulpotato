There is literally none that conserved the doctrine of worldwide proletarian revolution. The closest was Trotsky in the USSR, but he never came close to power. It was all &quot;socialism in one country&quot;. Therefore the accusation that they are openly imperialist states angling for world conquest is simply counterfactual, literally all socialist states decided that they were happy trying out socialism in their own territory and didn&#x27;t pursue a worldwide socialist revolution.<p>Much less one under their own control, as they were historically mostly fine with leaving other socialist state do their affairs alone.<p>Not only that, but forceful revolution wasn&#x27;t even something that was promoted unless absolutely necessary. For example, Marx, when corresponding with British communists, spoke about the possibility to install socialism through electoral means. This is obviously not possible everywhere, as in general if you called yourself a socialist in many &quot;democratic&quot; countries you&#x27;d be beat or killed, even if you wanted to do via democratic means.<p>It&#x27;s easy to accuse everyone else of arguing a good faith when you don&#x27;t even know what you are arguing against. If you want to make a cogent argument against socialism, and that is certainly possible, I&#x27;d suggest actually knowing what you are arguing against, because so far you&#x27;ve mostly been arguing against a strawman.')
