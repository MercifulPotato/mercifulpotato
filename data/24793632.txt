The moment he knew what he had, he didn&#x27;t start taking any kind of notes?<p>&gt; Throughout the interview, Mac Isaac switched back and forth from saying he reached out to law enforcement after viewing the files in the laptop to saying that it was actually the Federal Bureau of Investigation that contacted him. At one point, Mac Isaac claimed that he was emailing someone from the FBI about the laptop. At another point he claimed a special agent from the Baltimore office had contacted him after he alerted the FBI to the device’s existence. At another point, he said the FBI reached out to him for “help accessing his drive.”<p>How does he not remember who contacted who regarding the device? Also, how would the FBI know that he had to device to reach out to him first? This inconsistency is absolutely damning.<p>&gt; Social media postings indicate that Mac Isaac is an avid Trump supporter and voted for him in the 2016 election.<p>&gt; Mac Isaac refused to answer specific questions about whether he had been in contact with Rudy Giuliani before the laptop drop-off or at any other time before the Post article’s publication. Pressed on his relationship with Giuliani, he replied: “When you’re afraid and you don’t know anything about the depth of the waters that you’re in, you want to find a lifeguard.”<p>Seeming to realize he’d said too much, he added: “Ah, shit.”<p>So Rudy was your lifeguard? the reporters asked. “No comment,” he replied.<p>He wasn&#x27;t comfortable admitting he had been in contact with Giuliani, even though it&#x27;s pretty obvious at this point that he was? That doesn&#x27;t sound like a citizen fulfilling their civic duty if he was in contact with a political operative.<p>This story absolutely stinks to high heaven.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedailybeast.com&#x2F;man-who-reportedly-gave-hunters-laptop-to-rudy-speaks-out-in-bizarre-interview" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedailybeast.com&#x2F;man-who-reportedly-gave-hunter...</a>')
