Mine (B&amp;W laser) is over 7 years old now, does automatic duplex printing, and is on its second toner&#x2F;drum cartridge. Still trucking along just like it did when it was new. It cost like $120 to buy and only a couple of cents per page.<p>Of course, their value and longevity means all of these reviews are years out of date so I have no idea if the current models are as good. I hope they are, though.')
