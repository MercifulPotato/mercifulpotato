Years ago, before I had a printer, my girlfriend gave me her old aeropress, but had lost the cap.  So I 3d printed one at the makerspace (our makerspace was full of Lulzbot printers, because they are just down the road from us).<p>It worked great maybe 10 or 15 times, until it violently failed during the press.  Let me tell you, that makes an amazing mess!  Luckily it was at the breakroom at the office.  ;-D<p>The bltouch upgrade took me something like 30 hours to get the software right (because I had no idea how it looked when it worked, everyone seems to cut that out of their videos).  But since then, that has really made printing trouble-free.  I have almost no print failures since that.')
