Has any investigation happened? Are the media reporting on how they chased down leads to confirm or deny the report? What about the claims of &quot;misinformation from a foreign nation&quot;, have journalists gotten to the bottom of that beyond just repeating what the &quot;intelligence services&quot; have said?<p>So far, the &quot;investigation&quot; by the media sources who suppressed the story literally seems to be to not even ask if the evidence is real from those who it&#x27;s targeting, and to just run with the idea that there&#x27;s plausible deniability so it must be false. As if there&#x27;d be anything other than plausible deniability in a real corruption scandal.<p>Your world makes sense, but only if &quot;cannot verify&quot; means &quot;tried and failed&quot; not &quot;didn&#x27;t try and suppressed based upon the assumption it was invalid&quot;, as is the <i>publicly stated</i> methodology taken by the Washington Post.')
