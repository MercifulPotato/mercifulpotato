Item(by='ghaff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611597113, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25905601, text='&gt;At $300k TC, most people in the United States could pay off their mortgage and retire after only 3-5 years of working.<p>I was saying it was a very good (I used the term solid) salary by retirement age which I think is true. Maybe it&#x27;s even exceptionally good.<p>I think your quoted statement is only kinda sorta true though. Assume they have $1m in the bank with no debt at age 30 now that they&#x27;ve retired after about 5 years and bought a $200K or so house with cash. They now have a low-risk income stream of about $50K (less than the US median income) which has to cover property taxes, maintenance, health insurance, etc. Or maybe they want nothing more than to be a ski bum or a river guide etc. for the next X decades. It&#x27;s certainly possible although I doubt it&#x27;s what most people able to earn that kind of money aspire to.<p>(If you expand it to 10 years, I&#x27;d more generally agree. If retirement from corporate life is someone&#x27;s goal, that&#x27;s eminently practical at that point without being at all spartan.)')
