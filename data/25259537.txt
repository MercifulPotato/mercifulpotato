If they aren&#x27;t detected, they&#x27;ll be out of your rating in no time, like in 2 or 3 wins. This reduces the chance you&#x27;ll encounter cheaters, because if a cheater plays 100 games but only 2 of them are in your rating bracket, you&#x27;re unlikely to ever match against them anyways.<p>If only this applied to Counter-Strike or other FPS. While those that are trying to hack discretely rise to Global fast, there are a lot of cheaters that aim to stay in high Silver or low Nova. Add this to the fact that many cheaters suck at cheating, they can absolutely get stuck in lower ranks because they tactically cannot outplay better opponents without blatantly cheating.<p>This is a bit different from cheating in Chess and Starcraft where mechanical skill and the design of the game makes cheats less impactful. Like, cheating in Dota is really just wider POV, complete map awareness and spell casting macros. But those are just a few aspects of the game. In FPS games, the mechanical skill weighs so heavy that you will have a bad time at any rank against any cheater.')
