They are complexity that gives us overwhelming returns by having a stable political system that, as you note, prevents outright descent into tyranny.<p>But there&#x27;s layers of bloat built around this system, from power brokers to marketing firms to talk show radio.<p>Ultimately I doubt the bloat of our political system is that great, if anything I&#x27;d be more concerned about the bloat from our military system. If I ask myself how many people do I know building a career off military dollars, versus a career off political dollars, the former camp is much larger.')
