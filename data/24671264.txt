It won&#x27;t baste, mist, sense, probe, convect, or take your food for a horsy ride. It doesn&#x27;t care to know if you&#x27;re cooking pork or potatoes, or if something&#x27;s thawed or frozen, solid or liquid, or 1 lb. or 5. It doesn&#x27;t issue odd advice (&quot;Stand and Cover&quot;! &quot;Pull Apart&quot;!). You can&#x27;t use it as a nightlight. It won&#x27;t tell you the time. It won&#x27;t match your decor. It won&#x27;t even cook anything for more than 6 minutes at a time. There&#x27;s nothing to choose, nothing to alter, nothing to select, nothing to enter. All it&#x27;s got is a big, smooth 1950&#x27;s style dial that does a backwards countdown, with an accompanying red light marking the time as it goes. A great appliance that hardly does anything at all. Highly recommend.</i><p>I see you&#x27;re in love.')
