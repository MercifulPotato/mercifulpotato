For future reference, if you&#x27;re on that much of a time constraint, you&#x27;ll run into issues with a lot of American cities even in the Northeast if you try to cut it close via train (my experiences have been with NYC Penn -- YMMV). For the sake of argument, I am pretty sure natives would have given you the ol&#x27; caveat emptor and told you to just take a car&#x2F;taxi, and I think that&#x27;s usually your strongest option in that situation.<p>Otherwise, you&#x27;re relying on a dependency chain that&#x27;s out of your control -- ticket machines, multiple trains having both availability and uptime. I get a little confused when you get to the part about Greyhounds and the Megabus. Why not rent a car or take an uber at that point? Sure, it&#x27;s expensive, but at a certain point, it&#x27;s worth considering how much your peace of mind is worth.')
