Item(by='taftster', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603382947, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24859280, text='I think you&#x27;re right, but that&#x27;s maybe not giving credit to the overall concept presented. The patent description text, even surrounded with the illustrations, still stands on its own. Yes, a picture paints a thousand words, but it would be nice if software engineers would write their descriptions or documentation as precise as that simple paragraph.<p>So don&#x27;t miss the point of the article simply because maybe the patent illustration doesn&#x27;t strictly hold. I&#x27;m personally tired of seeing lazy data structures that offer great amount of ambiguity in their use and type. This article hits on a great point that software folks can really stand to improve on.')
