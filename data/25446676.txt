You can purchase a 7-8 yo mass market vehicle for 2-6k that will run alright.<p>Having used cars older than that as a daily driver, the cost of repairs&#x2F;downtime outstrip the cost of replacing the vehicle more often than not.  Not driving isn’t really an option in the US, and driving a clunker will raise some flags to coworkers&#x2F;other parents in the parking lot.<p>The other cash poor option is to grab a lease with good incentives, it’s a terrible deal - but it’s the best if you need to conserve cash flow month to month ( particularly if you can’t afford fixing a breakdown )<p>Which is all to say, if your poor - driving a half broken down car would be a terrible investment.')
