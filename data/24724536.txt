People usually ask questions or give feedback.<p>I cannot reply to all of them right away. I may be able to reply nightly with a major reduction in productivity.<p>I know the &quot;seen&quot; is a real issue. Most of the time I need to think about it.<p>And me personally, I&#x27;m offended if someone &quot;sees&quot; my message and doesn&#x27;t respond. I&#x27;m sure others do too, even if I respond within 1 week.<p>The internet is not IRL. I manage more relationships than would be possible.')
