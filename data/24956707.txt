You may not look at another student&#x27;s solution, even if you have completed your own, nor may you knowingly give your solution to another student or leave your solution where another student can see it<p>I don’t see why Schools are so against this. 80% of my learning came from comparing notes and solutions with my friends. Many times I’d learn something I never thought of and vice versa. I get the “don’t copy things you don’t understand”. Imagine a world where you couldn’t review your peers PRs and learn&#x2F;give feedback.<p>In many subjects the assignments were so disconnected from the actual lecture notes. It was much efficient to learn from each other.')
