Outside of a city, good luck getting the police to come to your house. Where I used to live they would take at least 20 minutes and it wasn&#x27;t particularly rural. If you&#x27;re in actual middle of nowhere I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s even worse.<p>Hunting + fun.<p>Freedom, I&#x27;d say our gun culture is engrained in individualism and property rights. Seems like a celebration of that. (Unlike somewhere like Switzerland where it might come for a sense of collectivism)<p>And obviously to scare the govt into behaving.<p>American gun culture is definitely a complicated beast though! If you&#x27;re interested generally ppl are friendly and helpful, regardless of stereotypes.')
