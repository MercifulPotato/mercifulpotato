If that guy had to sit and learn proper paradigms and server administration and a bunch of other stuff, he would have just gone out and done something else instead.<p>Yeah, PHP lets you write shitty code (though it also lets you write _good_ code...). But in lowering the barrier to entry as it does, it also lets people who don&#x27;t know how to write great code turn their ideas into reality. Unlike the suggestion of another comment, I&#x27;ve got a great deal of experience with &quot;saner&quot; languages, but despite PHP getting a bad rap because of its low barrier to entry I still admire PHP as a great equalizer.')
