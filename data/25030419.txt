Item(by='musicale', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604882609, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25027907, text='&gt; a Mac without macOS is just an overpriced PC, and Netflix without its excellent browsing and playback software is just cloud storage media stocked with MP4 files<p>Netflix is a production studio and on-demand broadcaster - more like HBO (though internet only) or Hulu or Apple TV+. For my use case, their browsing software is poor - I would prefer a simple and complete catalog interface rather than endlessly cycling through the same few dozen bad &quot;recommendations.&quot;<p>Whether Macs running Windows or Linux are nothing more than overpriced PCs is an argument that tends to be resolved in the opposite direction depending on whom you talk to; historically many Mac (and iPhone) models have compared favorably to some competitors (notably high-end competitors) in terms of design and functionality and poorly to other competitors (notably vs. some enthusiast&#x2F;gaming PCs and lower-end competitors) in terms of purchase price.<p>The author is correct though that the software often adds a lot of value to the hardware - part of that is due to Apple&#x27;s vertical integration, design sensibility, and ecosystem. Apple&#x27;s support infrastructure also helps.')
