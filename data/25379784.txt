Also, that you equate the existence of the porn industry with a virus such as small pox, and claim that it is equally  impossible to get rid of. I don&#x27;t think either of these is true. Why do you think it is?<p>You also paint the picture of a new porn-DEA. I don&#x27;t know what to say to that, except that I don&#x27;t favour Sharia Law.<p>I posit that the ever expanding scope of liberalism with regards to intra-sex dynamics is the (or, at one of the) causes of much despair and grief, because they inhibit pair-bonding, family formation and are deeply non-lindy for various reasons. We see this in the number of older women taking anti-depressives, we see this in levels of male celibacy unprecedent since the middle ages, and collapsing populations all over the western world. None of these questions and dilemmas are new, they are as old as time. The idea that the rules have suddenly become invalid is naive at best, and destructive at worst. This will be non-obvious if you approach this from the viewpoint of enlightenment philosophy. It will become quite obvious if take the historical perspective on human behaviour and how societies function.')
