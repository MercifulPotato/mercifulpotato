Math has a rich history of conjectures appearing true for the first n dimensions, the first k inputs, the first z partial&#x2F;tangential proofs, etc. The evidence for RH isn&#x27;t any stronger than that for a plethora of eventually-proven-false conjectures.<p>Do you know if anyone has tabulated stats on conjecture proofs? That could be a fun dataset to examine.')
