Item(by='PaulDavisThe1st', descendants=None, kids=[25694820, 25694879, 25694389], score=None, time=1610153646, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25692923, text='Had we known each other, I&#x27;d have been one of those friends who might have said &quot;gun them all down&quot;.<p>But ... to whatever extent I really meant that (and I really don&#x27;t know what that extent is, though I do know that the sight of the confederate flag inside the US Capitol made my blood boil) ... I didn&#x27;t do that. I didn&#x27;t order anyone to do that. I didn&#x27;t encourage anyone to do that. I didn&#x27;t even go on social media and suggest it.<p>Meanwhile, while I was feeling whatever I was feeling, two pipe bombs were carried into the Capitol building. Windows were smashed, offices ramsacked, and there may (just may for now) have been much more serious intent on the part of some of those who got in (reports about plans to abduct various members of congress, not sufficiently confirmed yet).<p>So please, let&#x27;s stop with the whataboutisms and the both-sides-do-it nonsense. Yes, there&#x27;s blame for most things in this country to be distributed across both political parties. But equating some of our angry, privately voiced feelings about a violent attack on the US Capitol with ... a violent attack on the US Capitol ... just seems nonsensical to me.')
