And GRRM knows perfectly well that parts of the community are anal and take things like this far to serious, while being blind for the obvious.<p>GRRM seems to ask fans to over-analyze Tolkien for &quot;bad aspects&quot; and also immediately jumps from taxes to orc genocide. The whole thing looks like an attempt to smear a business rival, an attempt to describe himself as the better author for having a more &quot;cyncial&#x2F;realisic&quot; style.<p><i>(look at the original interview, the question was about power and his characters wielding power badly - and GRRM goes &quot;whatabout aragon&quot;)</i>')
