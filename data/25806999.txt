It&#x27;s slightly obscure, but I can imagine what an exploit looks like.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;curl.se&#x2F;docs&#x2F;CVE-2018-1000120.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;curl.se&#x2F;docs&#x2F;CVE-2018-1000120.html</a> is a memory bug that lets you write a single null byte out of bounds. That&#x27;s a security issue, but exploiting it seems less straightforward. (Though maybe it is more dangerous than the other one on net? I don&#x27;t know enough about these issues to say.)<p>It could be that Rust would prevent half the vulnerabilities yet prevent much less than half the danger caused by vulnerabilities.')
