People are also unnecessarily harsh about OO, as if somehow the entire industry is operating orders of magnitude less efficiently then they would be if they just magically changed paradigm. FP has its own tradeoffs. Nothing is less trustworthy than a zealot who claims their religion is the one true answer.<p>Logic and software are fundamentally complex. Djikstra said that software is “radical novelty.” It exists at a scale beyond anything the human race has ever built before, that’s fairly inarguable. He was also very fond of imperative programming, and was able to formally verify his imperative programs. Check out his book, A Discipline of Programming, where he goes over the mathematical theory of a simple imperative language.<p>There’s nothing more “mathematically correct” about the lambda calculus vs. Turing machines. Both are equivalent models. Whether or not state is implicit or explicit, state and time are a part of computation.')
