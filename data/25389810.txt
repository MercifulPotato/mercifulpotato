At the very least sticking closely to most upvoted stories is a step in that direction... is this a unique claim to fame here?<p>Personally I can&#x27;t justify the investment in creating this vs. other responsibilities in life, not without the financial support in place to help reduce some of those other responsibilities. Perhaps repping alternatives is slightly frowned on in a Show HN, but I&#x27;d personally appreciate pointers to similar audio resources out there. In my case I often suffer from FOMO if I don&#x27;t spend a big chunk of time on HN, so even something as lengthy as this podcast saves me some time.')
