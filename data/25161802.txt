It’s poor form to shrug off that effort into others when your participation in this specific discussion on HN suggests you are both familiar enough and capable enough to attempt to look it up yourself. That you attempted to do so and couldn’t find the answer would have been relevant to mention in your comment, and knowing that now, I’m happy to retract my reply.<p>(However, regardless, I do not consider researching your line of reasoning to be a valuable use of the time I have available for this discussion, so I will not be doing so. It’s not personal at all, though I imagine that’s of no comfort. Perhaps someone else will do so; I see someone trying in another branch.)')
