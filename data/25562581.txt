Unfortunately, the iPhone screen reader is not optimized for reading Wikipedia:<p>- It reads footnote links (&quot;one&quot;, &quot;fourteen&quot;, etc)<p>- It reads years like numbers (&quot;One thousand, seven hundred and fifty six&quot; instead of &quot;seventeen fifty six&quot;).<p>- It reads introductory metadata, warnings, etc.<p>- It reads tables.<p>- It read image captions.<p>Ideally it wouldn&#x27;t do any of these things. Basically, it  reads the screen from top to bottom,  which isn&#x27;t what a human would do if you asked somebody to read a Wikipedia article to you. If anyone knows a good way to synthesize Wikipedia to speech, that would be so nice!<p>EDIT: I wonder if Apple would reject such an app from the App Store because it would compete with ebooks.')
