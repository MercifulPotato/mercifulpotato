To me, it&#x27;s a bit clear that unless you also control the underlying OS (even when you do apparently), they are doing whatever they need to get what can be considered basic UX needs of a VC app. Contrary to popular belief in places like HN, the average Joe isn&#x27;t a dipshit, they really don&#x27;t care about these lapses from Zoom and will very happily make these concessions evenn if they&#x27;re fully educated on everything to know about security. I&#x27;m not a technotard and mostly know everything and I make the concession.<p>It&#x27;s not even clear to me they&#x27;re being genuinely unscrupulous anyway. This is like not trusting the government when they do mass surveillance but more benign. The majority of the population has decided they are not worried about it, right or wrong, they just want to get on with their life.<p>Keep complaining for sure, we need dissent, but don&#x27;t argue that Zoom isn&#x27;t good at what it does, the only argument might be that it&#x27;s practices aren&#x27;t ethical. You choose to use the web application it&#x27;s your choice not theirs.')
