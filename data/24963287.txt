I&#x27;ll try to improve. Thank you for letting me know.<p>&gt; Not accurate accurate<p>True. But it would be overkill to use complex equations for 1 dimensional motion. The degree of error is negligible in that context.<p>&gt; markets tend to be lenient of initial conditions post PMF<p>That&#x27;s a very fascinating point, you bring up. But I&#x27;m not sure how one can separate initial conditions from PMF. PMF takes initial market conditions into account by definition. At least, if we&#x27;re going by Don Valentine or Andy Rachleff&#x27;s definition.<p>&gt; shallow, inaccurate analogy<p>I&#x27;m not sure how to respond to that.<p>&gt; not sure why this is &quot;out of whack&quot;<p>Perhaps I didn&#x27;t express myself well enough. I was referring to fully negating any utility data might have and solely relying on intuition. My point was that there&#x27;s a middle ground but it&#x27;s further toward intuition than most people think in our data driven world.<p>I&#x27;m sorry you didn&#x27;t enjoy the essay. I do appreciate you reading it as well as the time you took to give me feedback. I&#x27;ll try to use it in order to improve future work.<p>Thank you.')
