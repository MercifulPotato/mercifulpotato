There are third-party implementations for a lot of languages, but using one of these brings up a lot of problems:<p>1. Are you sure the implementation doesn&#x27;t have any bugs?   AFAIK, the BLAKE3 team has only created C and Rust implementations, so anything else likely hasn&#x27;t received the same level of care.<p>2. How are you going to notified of bugs or vulnerabilities in the implementation? For your language&#x27;s standard library, it&#x27;s usually easy to get notified of any bugs or vulnerabilities, but you&#x27;re probably not going to get that from some random implementation on Github.<p>3. Pulling in the dependency can be an attack vector in itself. For example, if you use the Javascript implementation on NPM, you&#x27;re now going to have worry about the NPM author having their account compromised and the package replaced with malicious code.')
