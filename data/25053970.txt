As social norms have changed -- such that casual relationships and sex outside of marriage have become more acceptable while women are more able to establish an earned income -- we still tend to default to men paying for dates in hopes of getting laid.<p>So dating has something of a tendency to be a polite form of prostitution where men spend money in a gamble in hopes it leads to sex. If men can legally spend money and state up front they are expecting X, Y or Z and get it, why &quot;date&quot;?<p>Though when the OP says they are <i>dating</i> an online sex worker, I assume they mean they are in a relationship to this person. The word &quot;dating&quot; gets used rather sloppily to mean a variety of things -- which isn&#x27;t all bad, mind you, but sometimes interferes with clear communication.')
