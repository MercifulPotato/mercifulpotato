I also wouldn&#x27;t consider the idea of online social repo systems to be synonymous with git.<p>Git is a source control tool, &quot;Git news&quot; would suggest to me either news about the development of git or a news platform somehow operated through git.<p>This next opinion might be more controversial, but I think it needs to be said: the conflation of git with github is exactly what Microsoft wants because it leads young developers towards github and a sleak online experience.
