I was thrown a product spec drafted with all the Notion bells and whistles, and the details I needed were sprinkled throughout these tiny sub pages. It was a bit ridiculous to navigate as a reader, going back to re-read something was next to impossible. Just put all relevant content in the same place! I somewhat blame Notion for encouraging this, but really it’s up to the author to communicate efficiently.')
