Further, they shouldn&#x27;t care about them because anyone who doesn&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s going on deserves to get whatever happens to them. Stock trading is high risk, high reward, and that should be clear to everyone.<p>The problem is that hedge funds constantly benefit from a much lower risk due to market structures designed to stabilize the market. Many of the WSB people are willing to risk a big large loss in order to reveal this flaw of the system. Many of them will not be fine, and, if they&#x27;re successful, some hedge funds will be bankrupt and all of them will be scared moving forward.')
