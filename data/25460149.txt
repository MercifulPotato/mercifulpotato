(competitors&#x2F;griefers can easily abuse this).<p>In this case it&#x27;s quite reasonable to expect prompt, visible action.  The grefier problem is easily solved with a modicum of due diligence by Amazon.  All it has to do is conduct an investigation to confirm the complaint, which is as easy as ordering the item in question and confirming it contains the offer reported by a single customer.<p>If it&#x27;s too onerous for Amazon to spend $20 our of its billions to conduct and investigation, it could even write in terms to its contracts saying it reserves the right to inspect any seller inventory for compliance.')
