In a normal mortgage the bank cannot take your house if you make payments. With margin they can force you to sell if your account becomes too risky (usually happens because your positions lost value, but could also happen in cases like these where an investment is deemed to have a high probability of losing value). They can do this even if you are paying the interest on your margin on time.')
