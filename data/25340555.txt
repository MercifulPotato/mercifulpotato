For example if I did [x=6, x=7], then the outcome of those ops is very different if I did it in the opposite order [x=7, x=6].  Easiest way to do this sequencing is to have a unique leader who will impose the unique order.  Strict sequencing is not really serializability, but linearizability.  For example, Cassandra doesn&#x27;t by default have the concept of a leader and hence can&#x27;t provide linearizability.  Of course, there is a problem on how you decide who is the leader and what happens if two nodes think they are the leader at the same time.  That&#x27;s where the genius of Multi-Paxos&#x2F;Raft comes in.
