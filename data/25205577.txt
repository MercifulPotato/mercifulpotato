Apple has said they&#x27;ve prototyped touch screen Macs and from a UI&#x2F;UX perspective, it doesn&#x27;t really work. They&#x27;ve recently downplayed touchscreen Mac talk recently [1].<p>What Apple has shown is iPadOS becoming more like macOS, supporting a keyboard and a mouse instead of the other way around.<p>I have a 2-in-1 Surface on loan and it&#x27;s not particularly good at being a laptop or a tablet because of the design tradeoffs that have to be made. Apple is unlikely to make such a device unless there&#x27;s some kind of UI&#x2F;UX breakthrough.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;9to5mac.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;12&#x2F;apple-touchscreen-mac-interview&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;9to5mac.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;12&#x2F;apple-touchscreen-mac-intervi...</a>')
