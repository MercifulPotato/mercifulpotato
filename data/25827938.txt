You are responding to a made up argument using words I never even said.<p>There is a huge difference between <i>fait accompli</i> past events and future planning.  Feeding and supporting and loving children who exist does not at all preclude planning to reduce the percentage of future children born into unfavorable circumstances.<p>There are <i>ample</i> means to avoid having kids until one is ready, at every stage of the process.  We kind of know what causes childbirth by now.  It is wantonly irresponsible for a couple to choose to have children, or for people to engage in activities that produce them, without taking measures to prevent the creation of more children before they are ready to support them.<p>If everyone just decides to sleep around without availing themselves of the means to avoid pregnancy and thus have unfed children, where is the food going to come from?  Has society completely given up on the ideas of family planning and personal responsibility?')
