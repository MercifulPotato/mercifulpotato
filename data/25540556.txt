Japan) or qualitatively different (actual novelty checks performed vs. only cursory inspection) and thus vary from verging on legally dubious (more like &quot;option to expend lawyers on creating problems for competitors in the future&quot; than actual patent) to total lockdown.<p>It&#x27;s a mess. Mostly it only keeps patent lawyers in business. We need to get rid of it.')
