Item(by='wvenable', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612053496, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25973961, text='&gt; it sounds like you&#x27;re adamant they have no moral requirement to serve ginger people<p>I&#x27;m not sure how you get <i>adamant</i> from my comment.  I went out of my way to claim that this description was not perfect.  One could argue that ginger falls under &quot;race&quot;.  I personally don&#x27;t believe you should deny someone service because of there genetic appearance.  I&#x27;d go all in on appearance but then you might might have to serve naked people!  Everything is grey.<p>Religion is a grey area too; in some cases it&#x27;s more equivalent to political believes and in other cases it&#x27;s more like race.  People also mistake appearance and religion all the time.<p>&gt; Do you agree that excluding Muslims is wrong but excluding (nonviolent) Islamists is a right?<p>No I don&#x27;t.  People like to claim their persecuted because of who they are rather than <i>what they do</i> and how that impacts others.<p>Lets be clear, we are talking about Facebook blocking content (actively posted material) that they deem unacceptable.  You made this about the <i>who</i> rather than the <i>what</i> and I don&#x27;t think that applies in this case at all.  So we&#x27;ve really gone down this rabbit hole for nothing.')
