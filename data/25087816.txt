Once again, no one seems to be willing to resist the beginnings and consider the end.<p>The beginnings go by the name COVID-19 and include lockdowns, closure of national borders, obligatory mask-or-starve-to-death, social distancing, temp checks, QR codes assigned to people in order to leave home, and other totalitarian bullcrap that would be considered absolutely insane and unacceptable as little as a year ago. Everyone is trembling with terror at dying from the single virus and the single disease as if no millions of other viruses and diseases existed. Everyone is so scared for their dear asses that all critical thinking is blocked, because, to cite the original text of the article, &#x27;there is so much going on around&#x27;, and so they turn a blind eye to all the manipulation and brainwash backed by absurd amounts of money. All they want is that the great wise men in power come and save them. And the end is clearly a one-world medicine-mediated techno-fascism even Hitler and his creators couldn&#x27;t dream about.<p>But instead of thinking, what will my bright contemporaries do now? They&#x27;ll engage their downvote machineguns and flag me the hell out of existence. And HN will help them by counting their pro-covid downvotes as 3 to 5 regular ones. Start your timers, gentlemen, if any still remain here, and watch this post disappear in no time.<p>But always mind the end, dear downvoters.')
