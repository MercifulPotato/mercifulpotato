So the top of the hierarchy is just folders named &#x27;2019&#x27;, &#x27;2020&#x27;, etc.<p>This means that every year we get to recategorize the stuff underneath it and we learn as we go. Most of the sub-folders have stayed the same year to year, but some are different. It lets people see what works and what doesn&#x27;t, and it prevents the cruft of ages to accumulate. Sometimes work bleeds from one year into the next, but if you&#x27;re starting something new, create it in this year&#x27;s folder.<p>Having been the victim of lots of shared folder catastrophes in the past, this simple rule has really worked out well for my team so far.')
