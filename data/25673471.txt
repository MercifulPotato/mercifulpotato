What you see coming up was already baked in.<p>I dare say, so are the natural counter reactions to it.<p>If it’s unclear, remember the quaint days of the Fox News effect. America was pulling away for a long time, and the right was the first one to realize the political advantage of it.<p>Frankly I doubt America, especially the American right, can currently sit down and figure out how it got here.<p>This isn’t an unfair criticism mind you, you can simply see how the right has gone from the river boat (?) days to the tea party to the Trump days of today, to track how hyper partisan it’s become internally.<p>The media structures at play, such as Fox News, are determined to sell a partisan story.<p>The Republican Party is so unable to work with the dems that they even rejected “Obama care” - which was built around a Republican program -Romneycare.<p>This is simply one example, to highlight that what you are seeing is <i>momentum</i> at play.<p>The machines that spin it up - namely the political:media structures, are fully active.<p>Plus it’s been frightfully effective for the right.<p>When Obama came to power, the right had suffered a massive demoralizing loss. They had nothing and were demoralized.<p>Instead they got together and found strength in sheer force of will and used the term “one term president” to invigorate themselves and fight Obama at every turn.<p>This dogged will to fight at all costs is impressive, and it resulted in styling Obama, and even gave them Trump.<p>The Trump years have been amazing for the Republicans and so many core Republican goals have been fulfilled, especially the Supreme Court judges.<p>The republicans approach simply works. Why wouldn’t the left pick up that lesson?<p>You’ll even see that the rise of the left in the democrats is a mirror of the same process on the right.<p>TLDR: sorry man, bipartisanship is long dead in your country.<p>What should worry you even more - these processes aren’t unique to America. Fully expect to see this same break down around the world.')
