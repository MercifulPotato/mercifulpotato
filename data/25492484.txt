Anything more than that is a presumption. You may think &quot;well, I <i>actually</i> like this wine!&quot; but I think that&#x27;s largely programmed - we even have a phrase for this, &quot;acquired taste&quot;.<p>You don&#x27;t think tastes can be programmed purely textually? Advertising seems to suggest otherwise.<p>The problem with GPT[n] as an AGI is that (as I understand it) it doesn&#x27;t have a continuous retraining process the same way that human brains do. Neurons aren&#x27;t being repotentiated with each interaction, so there&#x27;s no short-term memory. But that seems a technical point; it&#x27;s not hard to imagine this as a feature of GPT50.')
