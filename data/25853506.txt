Yes, it has improved over the years, but it still breaks a lot. The thing with RHEL is that you really need to be paying for the support to get any value out of it. With CentOS or this beggar subscription level, you are better off using Debian or Ubuntu, because when shit breaks, all you&#x27;ll do is create a bug report in any OS. With Debian or Ubuntu, you have a slightly better chance at recovery. RHEL has a strict demarcation between support levels, features, release timelines, etc. So if you report a bug to RHEL, they may not backport the fix even if it fixed upstream. And then you are just stuck.')
