I have plenty of games from publishers who went off Steam, unsupported titles taken off the store, games no longer sold due to expired music licenses, etc. -- and they&#x27;re all in my Steam library to this day.<p>AFAIK most game platforms resort to just delisting and respecting purchases, with the notable exception of P.T. becoming unavailable for redownload even if you already claimed it[1]. (Except it was a free mini-game and not a purchase) The system isn&#x27;t even meant to remove owned content to the point that P.T. is still in people&#x27;s redownload lists, but the download itself results in HTTP 404.<p>And with Steam, there&#x27;s always the &quot;option&quot; of downloading your entire library and archiving that. IIRC Steam&#x27;s DRM is notoriously easy to crack (simple DLL replacement) and things like first-time-setup (additional registry keys, redistributables, etc.) are stored per-game in simple JSON-like files. That wouldn&#x27;t cover game-specific DRM but it at least covers Steam itself.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;P.T._(video_game)#Removal_and_remakes" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;P.T._(video_game)#Removal_and_...</a>')
