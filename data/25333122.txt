Manual memory management is extremely error prone.<p>C++ has memory management simplification: reference couting via shared_ptr&#x2F;unique_ptr. The trade-offs are different, but in C++ manually managing memory is not necessary unless you have a good reason.<p>&gt; C++ is notorious for its slow compilation time. Significantly slower than Java, not as bad as Scala.<p>That depends on what you use and how you use it. However, this is tricky to figure out what slows down the compilation.<p>&gt; In C++, all references are nullable.<p>Looks like this guy really needs to read up on C++.\nReferences can point to null, but not so easily.\nI think he means pointers.<p>&gt; Catching&#x2F;throwing errors is the preferred error handling mechanism.<p>I think he should really watch Herb Sutters Video[see 1] on the improvements of exception handling that are in the pipeline.\nHerb also discusses the alternatives to exception handling.<p>C#<p>&gt; Multi-paradigm?<p>C# has Pattern matching since 8.0 [see 2]<p>Python<p>&gt; Python is dynamically typed, there’s not much more to say about the type system.<p>Dynamically but strongly typed one could say.<p>&gt; In comparison, NPM in JavaScript is the only tool you’ll ever need.<p>JS has Yarn as well...<p>&gt; I don’t recommend using Python for large projects, the language was not built with serious software engineering in mind.<p>no arguments provided...\nand in fact there are very large python projects out there in the wild.<p>Also, pytest is one of the best test frameworks that i have seen.<p>Rust<p>&gt; Rust was designed from the ground up to be fast. Compilation of Rust programs takes longer than compilation of Go programs.<p>i don&#x27;t understand why he bashes C++ for slow compilation times and not rust. According to [see 3] rust is twice as slow on some benchmarks...<p>&gt; Rust is the only modern language on our list with no garbage collection.\n&gt; This forces the developers to think about low-level memory management, and makes developer productivity suffer.<p>No mention of the borrow checker etc, I find extremely disappointing.<p>&gt; Rust has no built-in support for immutable data structures.\nDiscussions like [4] should be referenced - i think when discussing this topic.<p>JS<p>&gt; JavaScript has good libraries for working with immutable data (like Rambda&#x2F;Immutable.js).<p>Weird that he doesn&#x27;t mention the library efforts in C++ [5] and Rust [6] and Python for immutable data-structures [7][8]<p>----<p>[1] CppCon 2019: Herb Sutter “De-fragmenting C++: Making Exceptions and RTTI More Affordable and Usable” <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ARYP83yNAWk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ARYP83yNAWk</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;archive&#x2F;msdn-magazine&#x2F;2019&#x2F;may&#x2F;csharp-8-0-pattern-matching-in-csharp-8-0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;archive&#x2F;msdn-magazine&#x2F;2019&#x2F;...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;users.rust-lang.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;are-there-any-compilation-time-benchmarks-of-rust-vs-g-vs-clang&#x2F;4895" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;users.rust-lang.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;are-there-any-compilation-time...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;users.rust-lang.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;persistent-data-structure-support&#x2F;31732" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;users.rust-lang.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;persistent-data-structure-supp...</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;arximboldi&#x2F;immer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;arximboldi&#x2F;immer</a><p>[6] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;orium&#x2F;rpds" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;orium&#x2F;rpds</a><p>[7] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MagicStack&#x2F;immutables" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MagicStack&#x2F;immutables</a><p>[8] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tobgu&#x2F;pyrsistent" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tobgu&#x2F;pyrsistent</a>')
