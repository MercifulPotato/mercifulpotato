It has an awesome community, lots of gems (libraries) for web stuff. An opinionated way of doing frontend and backend. No waste of time taking decisions about what state management to use, how to organize stuff, etc. Just focus on stable, accepted, well maintained conventions and focus on your business problems instead.<p>It might be harder to find people interested in working with it depending where you are, but I guarantee you that you will need a lot less people to build the same thing with lower level tools (SPAs, Go, Erlang, Rust, whatever...).<p>I would also say Django, but the problem with it is that it just solves the backend side of things. You will still have to find an answer for how to do the frontend as it has no opinions there (and the templating and forms stuff it has built in falls really short in my experience).<p>I&#x27;ve heard good things about php&#x2F;symfony, but never used it myself.')
