Not quite the 70s, but.. at least the 90s. But believing something is possible and knowing how to do it are different:<p>1989 - injected rna maybe goes into cells<p>1990 - proof injected rna creates proteins<p>1994 - proof injected rna creates immune responses<p>Then:<p>“2005 they published a joint paper that solved one of the key technical barriers by using modified nucleosides to get mRNA inside human cells without setting off the body&#x27;s defense system”<p>That kicked off a ton of research, but:<p>“Up until 2020, these mRNA biotech companies had poor results testing mRNA drugs for cardiovascular, metabolic and renal diseases; selected targets for cancer; and rare diseases like Crigler–Najjar syndrome”<p>But why did they spend from 2005 to 2020 working on mRNA drugs and not vaccines? Capitalism. Vaccines are not generally profitable (take once, you’re done) - so vaccines are not an appealing target for a startup with investors wanting big returns.
