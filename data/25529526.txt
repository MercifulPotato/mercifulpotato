And lin-manuel miranda in general.  As much as hip-hop is fundamentally a &quot;telling&quot; art form, I feel like Miranda&#x27;s text is far far on the &quot;show don&#x27;t tell&quot; spectrum in terms of it&#x27;s emotional content, say, compared to 90s west coast hip hop.  (See also moana, the lyrics in that are very tell-not-show).  For a more intelligent fictionalisation of that era, I recommend Burr, by Gore Vidal.')
