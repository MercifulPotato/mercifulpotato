In any case, that could indicate a file drawer problem publication bias or simply that the funding disappeared or a researcher decided not to proceed.<p>How do you move from very spotty preregistration to compulsory preregistration? It would probably take a coordinated push from all the major funders. And they haven&#x27;t successfully moved to fully open access publication in over a decade of trying, despite the obvious financial gain to the non-publisher world of winning at <i>that</i> coordination game.<p>How do you handle work on the margins of registerability? Not all scientific work is testing hypotheses, some is exploratory. Should a quantitative description be ruled out if it wasn&#x27;t registered? If so, how are reasonable hypotheses for future work established? If not, you have to be extra vigilant to stop people smuggling phrases that imply confirmation into nominally exploratory work.<p>And the other problem with the replication crisis is that even decently-planned, pre-registered, straightforward studies can not replicate. Sometimes for reasonable reasons (significance was actually by chance, some unanticipated confounder interfered) and sometimes for thoroughly blameworthy ones (rather than p-hacking you can just fudge the data, or make &#x27;accidental&#x27; programming errors).<p>So I&#x27;m all in favour of pre-registration, but it&#x27;s not a magic bullet.')
