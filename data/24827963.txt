Time passed and we, the general public, are no longer part of the conversation about who should be default-trusted.<p>What if the browsers (and OS) didn&#x27;t default-trust anyone? The various CA companies would have to include the general public in their public relations. We&#x27;d see CAs advertising for users to trust their roots. If a CA ever screwed up, they would feel it.<p>Another part of the rot is that TLS certs can only have one root CA. If I decided I don&#x27;t trust DigiCert, I would effectively cut myself off from Hacker News, because a site can only have one root CA. If a site could have multiple CAs, I would still be able to connect so long as I trusted one.')
