Then if you&#x27;re smart, you&#x27;ll have a layered architecture (which the 80% layer rests upon) that allows the other 20% to learn about how the sausage is made in order to do their complex tasks.<p>A good example of this approach is MSBuild + Nuke [1]. You can have as much complexity as you want in your Nuke build script (which is plain C# in a normal, debuggable C# project), but MSBuild has to exist to bootstrap the Nuke build script.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nuke.build&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nuke.build&#x2F;</a>')
