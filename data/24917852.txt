One market to consider is automotive scopes- since it already can interface with a phone, putting different connectors on there and with a case would suffice for most uses. Compare to a Pico scope for the market leader in this segment. It definitely doesn&#x27;t need to be a 100% finished consumer product (that&#x27;s already covered), you wouldn&#x27;t be selling to hackers but the mechanics who use a scope are by and large the technically sophisticated ones. Just a thought, it looks like a great product, I&#x27;m buying one just to hack into a portable scope so I don&#x27;t have to deal with getting out my rigol for basic auto work.<p>Edit: it certainly doesn&#x27;t need to be battery powered either, conveniently cars have 12v battery power avaliable (although it is quite dirty, so input protection is required). I&#x27;m on my phone RN, otherwise I&#x27;d pull up the schematics, it might already have adequate input protection.')
