I don&#x27;t want to start up a full linux VM, that sounds like a lot of overhead and I&#x27;m more likely to not bother at all. WSL is much lighter than that (we&#x27;re not talking virtualbox here), if I open windows terminal its up and running, there&#x27;s almost-zero start up cost.<p>With VSCode I can switch between working in WSL and windows easily, without needing a desktop GUI to write code in. There&#x27;s no startup cost, I&#x27;m immediately in the correct environment for that project. I&#x27;ve found it very useful since it came out.')
