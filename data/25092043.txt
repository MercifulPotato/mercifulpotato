I&#x27;ve been choosing my words fairly carefully - I want some sort of justification of the idea that the government or anyone in it is somehow accountable for anything.<p>If accountability means everyone sort of shrugged and moves on over the single worst barrage of decisions I&#x27;ve observed in US politics in the last 30 years then either it isn&#x27;t accountable or being accountable is irrelevant. I&#x27;m pretty sure the government is unaccountable by design - it does whatever the polity wants that day, and then there aren&#x27;t any meaningful consequences if the idea worked out or not. Democracy represents the best thing we have, but I don&#x27;t accept that it represents accountability. Good people can get voted out and replaced by better people, for example. Or term limits kick in. They represent the electorate changing its mind on what approach to try in a no-fault-implied manner.<p>Corporations actually have a built in accountability - if they don&#x27;t have customers onboard with the idea that they are providing goods and services effectively then they disappear and their owners get hit right in the financials. I can see that in the companies I deal with - they do what I want quickly and with no fuss by and large. They are accountable to me - if I don&#x27;t like the service I go elsewhere and that is their loss. I can&#x27;t see it in government, and I&#x27;m not seeing anyone in this thread who has managed to lay it out for me. Most of the politicians representing me I would dearly like to replace for their many and obvious failings. They certainly aren&#x27;t accountable to me, and I don&#x27;t know anyone who they are accountable to or I&#x27;d spend more time trying to argue my views to that person.')
