In the broader context of his values and beliefs, I think this &quot;rule&quot; is about focus.<p>Buffett (and Bill Gates) have cited focus as the single most important factor in their success.<p>See also Buffett&#x27;s 25&#x2F;5 rule (he did not give it this name).<p>Basically, Buffett&#x27;s belief is that by not having extreme focus, you dilute your most important asset, time, to a degree that you are unable to accomplish something meaningful in any one area.<p>His views on time and focus are pretty well captured by the snowball metaphor (with apologies to those who have never lived in colder climates):<p>&quot;Life is like a snowball. The important thing is finding wet snow and a really long hill.&quot;<p>In other words, w.r.t. this discussion, it doesn&#x27;t work to be changing hills with any frequency.')
