For example, I recently set up a new smart TV and Google Home sound system for my parents.  There had to have been 8 separate legal agreements, each very long, just to get to the point where we had a picture and sound came out the speakers.  They are sense blobs of legalese, and most people assume they know what they say, but they don&#x27;t.<p>It is ridiculous to ask people to either retain a personal lawyer or pursue their own education in law, just so they can understand and agree to the Terms and Conditions, EULA, and privacy agreements for all their apps.<p>Is it specifically Uber&#x27;s fault the vast majority of users don&#x27;t actually understand what they&#x27;ve agreed to?  No.  But it&#x27;s reality, and we can&#x27;t just ignore it.')
