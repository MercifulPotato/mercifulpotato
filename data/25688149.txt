That&#x27;s bad, but the real problem is this:  <i>You</i> can be wrong.  You can be wrong when you&#x27;re absolutely sure that you&#x27;re right, and you can be wrong on things that really matter.  Be <i>very</i> careful about blocking &quot;wrong&quot; viewpoints, because <i>you</i> can be wrong about what&#x27;s &quot;wrong&quot;.<p>Note well:  I am not at all saying that Trump supporters are right.  I am saying that you are not omniscient enough to be qualified to decide what should be blocked.  Nobody is.')
