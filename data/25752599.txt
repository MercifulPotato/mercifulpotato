Calibers to consider due to their prevalence:<p>1. .22lr - Doesn&#x27;t pack too much punch but it&#x27;s good for hunting small game. It&#x27;s very easy to stock &gt;10,000 rounds of this ammunition.<p>2. 9mm - Most common handgun caliber in the world and has a high enough muzzle energy to be useful over longer distances with a rifle or carbine length barrel.<p>3. .308 - Most common hunting cartridge and packs a huge punch. It&#x27;s effective range is 800m and can drop a moose.<p>4. 12 Gauge Shells - Any engagement under 100m is where 00 buckshot shines. Shotguns are absolutely gruesome close up and much more effective than many other options. Super cheap as well.<p>5. 5.56 &#x2F; .223 - This is the cartridge used by most AR15 pattern rifles in the hands of both the military and law enforcement.<p>Note: Buying ammo is super difficult&#x2F;expensive right now since the start of covid and the protests in June. It&#x27;d be best to stick to .22lr and 12 gauge if you don&#x27;t already have a supply..')
