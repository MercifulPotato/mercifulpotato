They&#x27;re quieter, they produce less emissions over their life cycle, they have a lower TCO (total cost of ownership), they&#x27;re faster, and frankly, every electric vehicle I&#x27;ve ever driven is just plain more fun to drive (granted I&#x27;ve only ever driven three, but still...).<p>Our shipping is moving away from oil and to natural gas, because shipping is an enormous contributor to CO2 emissions.<p>So oil&#x27;s value is going to be dropping precipitously in the next 100 years.')
