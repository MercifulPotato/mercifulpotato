But I personally do not want to (and currently do not) work for a company that trusts me so little that it needs to spy on every activity I do on the hardware they give me to do my job.<p>I get that some people are fine with that, and that&#x27;s ok, but I&#x27;m not, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m alone in this.')
