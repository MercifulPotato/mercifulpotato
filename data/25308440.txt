Item(by='whelming_wave', descendants=None, kids=[25308671], score=None, time=1607117933, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25305948, text='I know you&#x27;re talking about how it&#x27;s repeated three times, but something else here really bothers me.<p>I understand if they&#x27;re deprecating it because they plan to replace it with something else, but if they don&#x27;t then I&#x27;ll be pretty disappointed. From their docs, it looks like some of their other subcommands have shorthands which conflict with `-h&#x27;? Fine, I guess, but that just means when `-h&#x27; does work it&#x27;ll shoot people in the foot with that other behavior.<p>Software that clearly knows what I want, but refuses to, annoys me so much. For example,<p><pre><code>    $ python3\n    Python 3.9.0 (default, Dec  2 2020, 10:34:08) \n    [Clang 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.27)] on darwin\n    Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; quit\n    Use quit() or Ctrl-D (i.e. EOF) to exit\n</code></pre>\nbecause they added `quit&#x27; as a top level variable with a `__str__&#x27; defined which returns that string. Do anything else! Make the `__str__&#x27; definition quit the program or something, test if it&#x27;s being run at the top level in the CLI and quit, special case the CLI input so if only `quit&#x27; is entered, it quits. Heck, maybe just prefill the `quit()&#x27; on the next line so I just have to hit return. Do anything but instruct me to do what you should have done in the first place.')
