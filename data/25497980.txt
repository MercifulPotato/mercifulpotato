Python also has method_missing in __getattr__. Arguably python tends to use these less often then ruby but I&#x27;ve definitely used both reflection and __getattr__. I&#x27;ve also once had to debug a really hairy multiple inheritance issue(in a test framework that used base classes to test different hardware features where you might want to have both you&#x27;d need to use multiple inheritance and then make sure they were initialized in the right order, multiple inheritance can get really annoying)')
