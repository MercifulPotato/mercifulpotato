It doesn&#x27;t stream 4k like it would on apple devices, but it works fine.<p>- As for iCloud, their Windows client is a little lackluster. For example, the only way they can sync your iCloud calendar on Windows is by creating an Outlook plugin. So the only place I can view my iCloud calendar on my Windows computer is on the Outlook app.<p>- As for Music, the web player is completely fine. Not any less optimized than the Apple device versions. Would actually go further and say it looks MORE optimized than the mess of iTunes&#x2F;&quot;Music&quot; on the Mac. Apple&#x27;s native music app on the Mac has never been good.<p>- As for Maps, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen a web based version of it. Haven&#x27;t seen a windows app variant either.<p>Edit: made it easier to read')
