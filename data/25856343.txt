I&#x27;m mildly disappointed that there wasn&#x27;t a &quot;handy&quot; in any of the videos so far, but at least there was a footy, which I guess is close enough.<p>Minor UI comment: the profile picture on the right side doesn&#x27;t change the mouse cursor to show it as clickable, so that was a bit confusing. Also, up-down arrows instead of right-left to navigate was also slightly unintuitive. (I guess both of these come from mainly targeting mobile interfaces?)    \nYou might want to add a meta description for the search engines, since the site itself doesn&#x27;t have text for them to pick up on. (Though, just showing &quot;Handy&quot; as the description text does make it stand out a bit among other results!)')
