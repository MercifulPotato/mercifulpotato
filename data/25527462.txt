It&#x27;s fine if you are installing things with a package manager, but I found it took some trail-and-error to figure out how to do this for my own lbraries, or for things built manually from source.<p>Also with c&#x2F;c++ style system dependencies, I feel like there are a lot of issues with things like version conflicts which are solved much more simply by a package manager like cargo.<p>I agree that it&#x27;s <i>functional</i>, but to say relatively easy I think is a bit of a stretch.')
