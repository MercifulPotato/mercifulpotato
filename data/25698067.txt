DOOM might suggest me to RIP AND TEAR, but there is a quite obvious disconnect from reality. The closest game that I can think of in this case is Hatred. But even then, it is so ridiculously over the top (both in terms of writing and the angle at which the game is played) that you&#x27;re disconnected from it.<p>Compare that to Parler, where you usually join because &quot;hey, those people are conservatives, like me&quot;. Neonazis have gotten pretty damn good at slowly steering people to what they want. Hiding your power level and all. Suddenly, in a place where you feel safe, some people start telling you that, say, it&#x27;s all because of antifas. You might not believe it at first. But through repeated exposure, in a place where you feel safe, slowly but surely it seeps in. There are studies on how much more easily the brain is affected when you feel in a safe place.<p>Going to Parler for most people isn&#x27;t to see what the white supremacists are about these days. Just hop on &#x2F;Pol&#x2F; for that, or Stormfront for actual Nazis and you&#x27;ll see it.')
