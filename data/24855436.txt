It answers to no physical law. Monstrosities have been built and are still built which should not exist. More complexity != improvement. Also, 15M lines consists of drivers. The core of an OS is way, way smaller.<p>And actually yes, physicists know all of physics pretty well. Not deep expert level no, but it&#x27;s not like they don&#x27;t even know whole fields exist which definitely happens in computing.<p>There are definitely engineers that know how to build a full car. What makes you think it is impossible? You don&#x27;t know all the details by heart no, but you know where to look, you can have a pretty deep broad understanding of things.<p>Let&#x27;s not kid ourselves into complacency, throwing our hands in the air saying &quot;it&#x27;s complex&quot;.')
