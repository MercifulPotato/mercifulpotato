In my mind, it is pretty clear that programming is a technique, that can be applied in any field. There is of course the field of programming programming languages, which does tend to require mathematical knowledge. Statistics is also an extremely broadly applicable mathematical tool, used today in almost any field.<p>But in general, knowledge of biology or sociology is about as likely to be useful in your programming career as knowledge of mathematics is - domain-specific knowledge of the domain you are programming for is the real key. If you&#x27;re programming a biology or sociology tool, those will be more useful than maths. If you&#x27;re programming a mathematical tool, of course maths is extremely important. If you&#x27;re programming a library of base algorithms, algorithm knowledge is important.')
