I’ve met rent control advocates, talked to them, and read their detailed explanations of why they think there should be rent control. They often believe exactly what I said, and always have some principled explanation for why it’s not fair that the rent is high; despite that one guy in New York, I’ve never actually met anyone who argues for rent control on the grounds of pure self-interest.')
