Instead they are explicitly not providing a path forward for the community to take ownership.<p>There are better frameworks out there now for new projects, but there is a massive install base, particularly in the enterprise, that has no need or desire to shift to a new framework. There is no path forward for those applications in Googles model- it is pretty much a rewrite or nothing.<p>Now, I’m sure there will be some fork of angularJS that goes on to provide even longer term support and&#x2F;or paid patching, but this still wasn’t managed as well as it could be in my opinion.<p>Like the rest of the OP site, it’s another indicator that Google doesn’t care to support  long lived systems, and you should be cautious of taking dependencies on them if you do.')
