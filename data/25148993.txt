The web ate the net, the browser is the new OS. It&#x27;s silly, it&#x27;s lazy, it&#x27;s inefficient, it&#x27;s everything I dislike about software engineering but at this point it feels like preaching in the wind. I just try to ignore it, keep writing low level code and if someday I can&#x27;t find a programming job outside of web technologies anymore I&#x27;ll just become a shepherd in the mountains or something. I&#x27;ll make cheese.')
