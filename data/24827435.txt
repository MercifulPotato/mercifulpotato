One thing - allow me to select a time zone and see game schedules in my local timezone...<p>I&#x27;m currently playing in a group that&#x27;s transferred from in-person to videochat - as we&#x27;re several players that have moved to different cities (same timezone) and a GM who&#x27;s emigrated to Canada (we&#x27;re on GMT+1&#x2F;2 depending on DST). It can work - but please make it easier to figure out - avoiding the need to calculate offset :)<p>I used to work nights a few years back, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d love to be able to join games after work (before the weekend) - say 8 am local time...<p>Other than that, maybe a bit more information for potential GMs?')
