In fact, give me the list, your employment rolls, and I&#x27;ll fix this for you for free in a couple of hours at max.<p>Government workers are particularly vulnerable to this sort of failure mode: assuming everything is hard. This is not that hard. It&#x27;s <i>pretty</i> easy. But big company workers are also usually susceptible to this. They don&#x27;t get things done very fast so they&#x27;re used to things taking a long time to do and assume that even trivialities must take a couple of days.<p>But that&#x27;s why companies like Tesla and SpaceX succeed to these peoples&#x27; surprise. They look at these companies and say &quot;They can&#x27;t do that. This is <i>hard</i>. It takes maybe a <i>half century</i> of engineering.&quot;<p>Turns out lots of things, even if they&#x27;re hard, can be done pretty fast. But not by those who&#x27;ve been damaged by their own slowness not being punished.')
