I found the solution investigating terminal logs and did a 5 point write up &quot;How to setup on Ubuntu&quot;.<p>Readme pull request got denied because &quot;only one point applies to Ubuntu&quot; (others were applicable to other distributions, too). Somebody even commented few months later that he found my pull request and it helped him make it work on his machine.<p>This mostly made me stop contributing to other projects.')
