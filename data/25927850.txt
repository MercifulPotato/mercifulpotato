It&#x27;s actually a bubble caused by overexposed shorters who are forced to buy at any price due to their own doings. Of course noone likes when the small man makes money at the expense of big wall street firms, but it takes some mental gymnastics to view simply buying and then not selling as a more nefarious financial instrument than shorting.')
