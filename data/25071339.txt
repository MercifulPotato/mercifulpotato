Item(by='Matthias1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605197616, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25069216, text='Dark (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;darklang.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;darklang.com</a>) is a very cool platform for building serverless backend APIs.<p>The Dark language itself is not what you’re looking for, and I don’t know if I would trust it in production (it’s still in beta). But the platform makes it extremely quick to get a POC backend working.')
