They also apparently don&#x27;t have priority for gates at airports, as I&#x27;ve had to wait for over half an hour for a gate to clear after landing on a OAK-LAS flight (a &lt;90 minute flight).<p>This may have changed, but they also didn&#x27;t do precheck a few years ago.<p>Oh, and expect to hear about their credit card offer during the flight. You can get a spirit points voucher for applying today, and can leave the application with your flight attendant as you leave the plane.<p>That being said, they do get you from point A to B relatively cheaply, as long as you&#x27;re willing to live with the constraints of a low cost carrier.')
