Why do you think we talk about clock speed in computer science?  I&#x27;m honestly not sure what other definition you would even use in this context.  And certainly, given that these &quot;frequency generators&quot; synchronize, divide time into repeating windows of roughly the same length, and are used to schedule and regulate biological processes, it is a bit bizarre for you to say that they somehow have nothing to do with timing.')
