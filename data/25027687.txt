Item(by='zjs', descendants=None, kids=[25033251], score=None, time=1604860114, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25025900, text='&gt; That doesn&#x27;t mean he&#x27;s some secret conspiratorial white supremacist talking in code.<p>&gt; ...<p>&gt;  But it&#x27;s equally reprehensible to have a crowd on the sidelines chomping at the bit to exaggerate, fabricate or concoct stories, simply because they don&#x27;t like someone.<p>I&#x27;m confused. Where in this comment chain does what you describe seem to be happening? The closest I can find is the great-great-great-great grandparent, which states “The guy had armies of white supremacist supporters and advisers. He told right-wing extremists to “stand by” on national TV.”<p>From my perspective, the key here is that right-wing extremists interpreted his words as code — and he refused to correct that interpretation. From the point of view of the extremists, it was intentional, and that&#x27;s enough to embolden them.<p>Even though it was likely the result of a mistake and stubbornness, it was damaging to the country and the impacts are worth acknowledging.<p>At this risk of taking a bit of a tangent: it&#x27;s not as if this is the only time his carelessness with his words and stubbornness to correct the way they were interpreted caused problems. In those cases too, we need to acknowledge both the cause and the effect. Accidentally causing damage and intentionally causing damage are distinct problems, but they&#x27;re both problems — especially when you&#x27;re the leader of a country.')
