Even though the fuel is free, in order to make the economics work you have to project power prices out 50 years. Usually when we scope power plants the proformas only go out 15 years.<p>And by &quot;make the economics work&quot; I&#x27;m not talking about excessive returns. I&#x27;m talking about a &lt;10% rate of return, getting the investment back in 10-14 years.')
