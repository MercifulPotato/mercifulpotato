Call this &quot;culture&quot;. Culture can change, but often only slowly. Successful survival strategies are passed down via culture. Since culture is mostly preserved, but may change gradually, it experiences evolution in exactly the same way species do.<p>The result is that we are empowered with cultural knowledge that is far greater than we could ever devise in a single lifetime. It&#x27;s allowed humans to inhabit almost everywhere on earth. A human <i>without</i> local, cultural knowledge would not survive, regardless of where on earth you place them.<p>These aren&#x27;t my thoughts.
