But as I’ve read about the approaches currently available, all of which require manually opting in per component, I’ve had two thoughts:<p>1. Manually marking a component for hydration likely means shipping the whole structure below as JS, which may hit diminishing returns fairly quickly.<p>2. At least if you’re using TypeScript, enough is known (or could&#x2F;should be) to determine which components are truly static. Next.js already has a rudimentary version of this. That kind of analysis could be a huge DX improvement.')
