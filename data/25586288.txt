Pricing is not my forte. My thought process was basically this:<p>- In general, people are probably only planning a single trip at a time (an exception might be if travel agents were to be interested)<p>- Based on that assumption, it came down to what resolution of access people would want. With the current model, 6 months of editing access comes down to $35. I could, equivalently, just charge $35 for 6mo of access, but in my head, I thought people would be more likely to actually give it a shot if the barrier to entry were cheaper (in this case $10).<p>So it could be that my actual price is just too high (i.e. $35&#x2F;6mo of editing access is too much). I haven&#x27;t gotten much feedback one way or another on this (though one could argue that the lack of purchases could be seen as pretty clear feedback). I&#x27;ve just read that founders tend to underprice their SaaS services, so I was wary of starting too low.')
