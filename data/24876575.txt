As wind energy capacity increases under the DOEâ€™s mandate (a six-fold increase from current levels), statistical models predict that mean bird deaths resulting in collisions with turbines could reach 1.4 million birds&#x2F;year.<p>Though the issue isn&#x27;t so much the number of birds, but the type:<p>&gt;...Although fatality rates for raptors may be lower compared to passerines, raptors are especially vulnerable to collisions due to their flight behaviors. Given the life history traits of raptors (i.e., long-lived and low reproductive rates) their populations are more at risk of decline from the number of different sources of impacts that affect these species on a daily basis.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fws.gov&#x2F;birds&#x2F;bird-enthusiasts&#x2F;threats-to-birds&#x2F;collisions&#x2F;wind-turbines.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fws.gov&#x2F;birds&#x2F;bird-enthusiasts&#x2F;threats-to-birds&#x2F;...</a><p>This isn&#x27;t to say that means we should drop wind, but we shouldn&#x27;t hand wave away the issue and pretend it is not an issue.<p>&gt;...that can be reduced 70% by painting one blade black<p>A lot of different techniques have been used to try and limit bird deaths and painting blades a different color is one of them, but it doesn&#x27;t reduce deaths by 70%.')
