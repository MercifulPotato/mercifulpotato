I&#x27;m incredibly biased (this problem is why I built Chartio), but I think these tools end up being quite bulky, expensive and a non-agile way to do analytics on your product.  I feel these products are best suited for later stage companies trying with great tracking detail to improve a funnel or engagement metric, not simply monitor usage.<p>The majority of the important things for a startup are usually already being tracked with timestamps in the database (new signups, new users, churned users, new todo items, etc).  If a key metric is not directly tracked, there&#x27;s usually a good enough proxy available somewhere in the database.  A Busineess Intelligence product, or a SQL to chart tool is much more applicable and affordable in the startup stage.<p>There are likely going to be responses here &quot;But what about...&quot; and I&#x27;ll premptively respond to those with the question: Could that be answered&#x2F;solved almost just as well with a query to the database, without sacrificing the agility, extra setup and data collection time, and expense overhead?  Those are all very costly things for a startup.')
