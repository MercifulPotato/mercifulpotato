You type &quot;auto my_var_name = func_call()&quot; or you type &quot;let my_var_name = func_call()&quot;. In both cases you get an inferred type for a variable.<p>Mutability is very different in C++ though - const is quite a complex topic, and isn&#x27;t as simple as &quot;this variable binding is&#x2F;isn&#x27;t mutable&quot;.')
