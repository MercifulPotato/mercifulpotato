During the two-year span of developing this solution (which went over due to non-3D-in-the-browser-related issues), the various technologies we were working with went from &quot;we really need to do everything except for the final rendering of the (simplified) object on the client&quot; to &quot;it&#x27;s less code&#x2F;moving parts to do most of it on the client-side ... and <i>moar textures</i>&quot;.  I believe the customer did just that a year later.<p>[0] 3D Accelerated and it works in <i>Linux</i> on the desktop ... in Firefox ... brilliantly.  It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m surprised Firefox works -- it&#x27;s always been fine for me on Windows.  It&#x27;s the combination of <i>Linux</i> and <i>Firefox</i> on nvidia hardware that usually results in odd tearing&#x2F;performance issues in FF for me.  Since recent updates and enabling experimental acceleration, it&#x27;s buttery smooth.')
