There are people I message with Hangouts pretty regularly and it’s never told me it’s deprecated or suggested anything else to use instead (except for just now, to switch to the dedicated Voice app for Voice, which… fine, but no suggestion to do my chatting elsewhere).<p>So is Hangouts deprecated? I have no idea. If it is, does that mean chatting with my Gmail contacts is deprecated?<p>I wouldn’t say it’s a straw man to call it confusing. Maybe the product lineup is less confusing if you’re on Android? But from where I’m sat… yep, confusing!')
