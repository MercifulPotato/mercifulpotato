Yeah, you can sue people for illegally redistributing copyrighted works. However, I am skeptical that you can do the same for people using YouTube-dl to consume copyrighted works. You are downloading the file from someone who has a license to redistribute it, you are just using a CLI utility instead of the page itself. You can&#x27;t <i>view</i> something without downloading it in some capacity.<p>I&#x27;m not saying there&#x27;s no possibility this is &quot;illicit,&quot; I am saying this is not the same as illegally downloading music off of Kazaa.')
