Low B12 has become a favorite hypothesis among the alternate medicine crowd, so online information about B12 supplementation has become corrupted with pseudoscience.<p>I’ll admit that I fell for the idea that B12 deficiency was rampant due to modern diets. Then I got a blood test and discovered that my B12 levels were toward the upper end of the reference range already.<p>On the bright side, B12 absorption is very nonlinear. A megadose might only cause slightly more absorption than what you find in a regular multivitamin. Most of the megadose is simply not absorbed.')
