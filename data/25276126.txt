We have one AMD Threadripper box and one Mini for builds and some other various machines for testing, and we&#x27;ve had to screw with one of them maybe once a year.<p>Modern machines are less finicky than older hardware. Spinning disk is almost dead, and if you avoid it you&#x27;ve eliminated most of your moving parts that fail often. Fans are the only other thing. Solid state hardware can hum away for years and years.<p>This is for small scale of course. If you try to run a larger scale DC it gets to be a pain since even with rare failures they will now happen often if you have tens or hundreds of machines. I wouldn&#x27;t try to run a DC these days unless there was a compelling reason or a huge cost saving.')
