Ikea really seems like a bit of unicorn in this space to my mind too. In the world of products that are affordable they tend to also be ugly or lacking consideration. Ikea offsets this by over-valuing considered design compared to nearly everyone and then making novel manufacturing concepts.<p>There really is something about a company that provides incredibly cheap products with a LONG return policy and good design to the masses. Plus their products might use a lot of wood, but they also offset it with renewable initiatives and by putting a lot of time into efficient shipping.')
