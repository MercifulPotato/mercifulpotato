Item(by='krosaen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611307555, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25867693, text='It seems Reflow falls in this category:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;grailbio&#x2F;reflow" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;grailbio&#x2F;reflow</a><p>&gt; Reflow thus allows scientists and engineers to write straightforward programs and then have them transparently executed in a cloud environment. Programs are automatically parallelized and distributed across multiple machines, and redundant computations (even across runs and users) are eliminated by its memoization cache. Reflow evaluates its programs incrementally: whenever the input data or program changes, only those outputs that depend on the changed data or code are recomputed.')
