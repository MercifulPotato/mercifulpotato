If you just use HTML and CSS, you can also have really bad Lighthouse scores. For example, vanilla `&lt;img&gt;` will ship the same image to every device, regardless of viewport size. Vanilla `&lt;img&gt;` doesn&#x27;t enforce setting `width` and `height`, which makes your layouts shift. Slow-loading images and layout shifts are the very things that will downgrade the &quot;100&quot; score he&#x27;s currently proud of.<p>Frontend performance is basically an iceberg[1]. We tend to look at the top and that&#x27;s where the fashionable &quot;silver bullet&quot; currently is (whether Rust+wasm or HTML+CSS or a JS framework). Then we find deeper in the iceberg that even a `box-shadow` property[2] can ruin our day, and let alone images, YouTube and Twitter embeds, and all the things that make the web more interesting and powerful than a black page with white text.<p>Oh and it gets even more fun! A Lighthouse score in itself is an over-simplification.
