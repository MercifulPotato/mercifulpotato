I feel like to be able to listen to and or be with someone while they do whatever and have no judgement, criticism, or suggestion requires you to have a very high level of Zen.  I would probably want to correct or assist or do something in most situations.  He&#x27;s operating on the level of a therapist.  But it&#x27;s hard for people to admit sometimes that they need a therapist.  There is a stigma and a feeling like there is something wrong with you that you have to get over just to ask for a therapist.  This guy skips over all of that resistance by having, by all appearances, no ego at all.  He&#x27;s saying &#x27;I don&#x27;t have any skills so I can&#x27;t possibly criticize you&#x27;.  But having no skills doesn&#x27;t stop most people from making suggestions or being critical.  He is providing high value assistance to people and presenting himself in such a humble way that it&#x27;s easy to ask for his help.')
