I&#x27;d still put my money on some sort of lift. Though TBH if we&#x27;re stipulating a level of science fiction that allows routine human suborbital flight, getting people out to a launch platform comfortably and safely is not a hard problem by comparison.<p>&gt;However, a bigger issue is how calm the weather needs to be before their going to launch rockets, though that means people arenâ€™t going to go out to the launch platform in bad weather.<p>I&#x27;m honestly not sure why you wouldn&#x27;t just use helicopters. They&#x27;re not that unsafe if flown in good weather. VIPs fly in them all the time.')
