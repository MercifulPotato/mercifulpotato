What you might consider is that many ideas can be abstracted out and applied to aspects of life that, on the surface, aren&#x27;t closely related.<p>For instance, <i>Range</i>, one of the books that Gates recommends, isn&#x27;t specific to any occupation, but can inform one&#x27;s general perspective on the hazards (or benefits) of taking a software job that is more specialized, and whether it&#x27;s the best thing for your career in the long-term.<p>Relatedly, I can&#x27;t tell you exactly what genre the <i>You&#x27;re Not So Smart</i> or <i>Freakonomics</i> podcasts fit into, but like a lot of good books, each fleshes out all sorts of high-level ideas that can relate to day-to-day life.<p>I really enjoy learning about behavioral psychology&#x2F;economics-type stuff.')
