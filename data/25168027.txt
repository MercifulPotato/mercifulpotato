Lean being committed to UIP already rules out many kinds of mathematics. Furthermore, the kind of automation possible in Lean is also possible in univalent theorem provers with the right implementation (e-graphs). They are actually easier in cubical than in Lean (see the 2 pager by Bas Spitters and his masters student).<p>The difference is that no cubical proof assistant has been implemented by Leo de Moura. Get Leo de Moura to implement cubical, and you will have a proof assistant more powerful than you could ever imagine, built on extremely satisfying foundations.')
