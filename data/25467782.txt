It is useful to read about stuff to get more of a feel for what&#x27;s out there, but you won&#x27;t get a good understanding of anything you will need to actively engage with it, and it a setting that practically matters to you. From personal experience: it&#x27;s easy to trick oneself into a superficial sense of knowing something and coming up short when called upon to either implement it or use it to solve a real problem. So my number one advice would be don&#x27;t fall into this trap; do (hard for you) things in a way you can&#x27;t cheat yourself (and get them working first before you make them pretty).<p>So give it a try, the winter break should be long enough to get it done, and if you find it&#x27;s beyond you at the moment, you can always scale back your ambitions and tackle it once you&#x27;ve grown in ability.')
