A lot of NIMBY&#x27;ism drives these types of regulations and policies. Younger generations will have think way outside the box at a very locally-granular scale if they choose to live within those constraints.<p>Generally, the younger generations are completely screwed if they try to fit within the SFH model. To just survive, they&#x27;ll probably need to start thinking in terms like &quot;individual&#x2F;single-family model of living is monetizing my distrust of peers&quot;, finding like-minded to group together and re-capture cost-efficiencies of scale for themselves.<p>I&#x27;ve long wanted to find a tract of 16 ha &#x2F; 40 acre to experiment with integrating a number of ideas I&#x27;ve seen floating around the net. Lstiburek-grade building envelopes, combined package&#x2F;people PRT, centralized laundry and food services, on-site food forest production, waste stream co-generation, <i>etc.</i> All to work out the details of answering the question, &quot;what is the absolute minimum number of people, minimum de-centralized organization, minimum processes and minimum automated tech tree needed to replace 80-90% of what we normally pay retail for, with wholesale&#x2F;distributor costs?&quot;<p>I&#x27;d like to see for example, what would happen if people with less financially-remunerative prospects but with a good work ethic were made a contractual promise: you put in your time helping those with better financially-remunerative prospects with tasks that we can&#x27;t automate yet, like housekeeping and grounds maintenance, and you&#x27;ll get treated with respect and dignity, have the same educational and medical services for your children as theirs, won&#x27;t get taxed out of your living quarters in your old age, and be cared for within the same community in your old age (mixing it up with the toddlers and kids at first, then receiving hospice care for example by trained teenagers in later stages when warranted).<p>In general, I&#x27;ve long thought it really weird that the incentive structures nominally put in place and heavily promoted to us drive us apart where we&#x27;re easy financial pickings for large, organized institutions, instead of driving us together and funnel compounding interest valuations of the group&#x27;s network effects into the group&#x27;s benefit instead of shipping it outside of the group. I strongly suspect dominant cultural factors obscure the recognition of those emergent network effects, and the drive to assign monetary valuations upon many factors is leading to bad abstractions from lossy information transfer. But realistically, maybe I&#x27;m just doomed to figure out via defeat in detail why <i>homo sapiens sapiens</i> in general cannot be trusted, as this is all too hand-wavy at this time for my taste.')
