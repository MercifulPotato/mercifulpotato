The angle of the cutting blades, etc; The cutting of the nail was inspected in slow motion video capture, and an Excel sheet of how far the nail flies, how neat the cut was, etc; was filled and a Winner was arrived at. I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it and I watched all 30 minutes of that program! It was a fascinating demonstration of what I believe is called &quot;kaizen&quot;. I really like the attention given to everyday objects in Japanese design.')
