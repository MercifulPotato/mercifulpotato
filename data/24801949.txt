I expect Facebook&#x27;s goal to be to maximize shareholder value within the bounds of regulations.<p>I do not expect an entity such as Facebook to behave in any other way.<p>From Facebook&#x27;s perspective, the current value system is possibly distorted, for example, because of a lack of competition. Suppose another social platform would enter the picture, and users would flock to that platform because it has a greater social responsibility. In that case, it might become Facebook&#x27;s best interest to be more socially responsible as well.<p>However, that has not happened yet. It is making me believe that the burden to solve this issue is with regulators, not Facebook.')
