Item(by='PragmaticPulp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609337789, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25581417, text='This 2007 blog post neatly captures the anti-corporate, pro-startup hubris of the early stage tech community in the 2000s. We all believed that big, incumbent tech companies were antiquated dinosaurs surviving on momentum alone, and that it was only a matter of time before agile startups swooped in and stole all of the new business with their nimble methods and superior technology.<p>This sort of hubris is common in startup and VC circles, where it&#x27;s a necessary part of the narrative required to convince people that a scrappy startup has a chance at upending an established industry player. There is obviously some truth in it, as we routinely see new startups come out of nowhere to capture significant market share. However, these narratives can also be a trap that leads startups to underestimate the power and abilities of their multi-billion or even trillion dollar market cap competitors.<p>Keep in mind that the 2000s were a different era in the tech industry. If you had a tech product or service to sell, there weren&#x27;t nearly as many tech-centric peer companies to sell to as there are in 2020. The big money focus was on enterprise sales, not scrappy SaaS startups with &lt;$100 monthly pricing plans on their generic website pricing page. It was easy to feel that big companies like Microsoft just didn&#x27;t get it, and that they were going to miss out on the new era of tech.<p>As it turns out, there&#x27;s a lot more to being successful than simply building the best technology faster than your competitors. Companies like Microsoft were slower to catch up, but their distribution channels and finely-honed sales processes were harder to compete with than us startup people wanted to admit. It also turns out that with hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue to work with, big companies really can overcome their inefficiencies through brute force to deliver quality products.<p>This was also before the 2010 lawsuits against Silicon Valley companies for colluding to keep engineer wages down. Microsoft wasn&#x27;t part of that lawsuit, but high engineering salaries in general weren&#x27;t as easy to come by in the 2000s as they are in 2020. When this was written, working for a startup didn&#x27;t necessarily mean you were going to earn less than working for a big company. Funding rounds were also smaller and fewer (less dilution) and engineering teams were generally smaller, meaning your odds of having worthwhile equity in a startup were better than they are today. The modern era of ultra-high FAANG compensation has been very effective at funneling top engineers into big companies and away from all but the most overfunded startups.')
