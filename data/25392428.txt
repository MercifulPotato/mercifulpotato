BT earbuds quality was shockingly low before. It might well have been the classic Apple Timing phenomenon, when they release a product at the exact right time a technology is mature enough to work (e.g. large modern touchscreens etc), but they undeniably scored with what where, otherwise, pretty mediocre earbuds. They generally know what they are doing.<p>This said, $500+ for earbuds of any kind is too much, for my values, particularly this year when people and countries are literally starving. It&#x27;s bad taste.')
