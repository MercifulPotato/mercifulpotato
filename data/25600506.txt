Just because it&#x27;s cute doesn&#x27;t make something non-violent. See Tom and Jerry cartoons.<p>Mario throws fire at enemies and burns them alive. How is that not violent? He stomps on their heads and squishes them into juice. He knocks them into lava and watches them melt. And let&#x27;s not forget that most video game characters, including Miyamoto&#x27;s loot and steal anything they can. Link walks into a building and empties every container he can.<p>&gt; I also resist the idea that itâ€™s O.K. to simply kill all monsters. Even monsters have a motive, and a reason for why they are the way they are.<p>He designed Zelda and Mario where all you do is kill every monster.<p>I love all those games but they aren&#x27;t non-violent. They&#x27;re just violence disguised in cute clothing.<p>Non-violent might include Animal Crossing, Pilotwings but certainly not ARMS where all you do is punch other people.')
