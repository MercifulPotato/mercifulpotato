Item(by='jhhh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603763574, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24903735, text='I&#x27;ve been using org mode since 2015 and for a majority of that time I didn&#x27;t really customize anything besides some more TODO labels. I&#x27;ve changed my layout several times too as I&#x27;ve changed projects or roles. Since it&#x27;s just text I&#x27;d just start with using headings+folding and todos. Even just that is better than a text file. You can pick up more things as you find some friction in your organization process and wonder if there&#x27;s a different way to do something. I eventually found that tags didn&#x27;t work much for me but properties were very useful along with a handful of capture templates.')
