Steven Levy has a funny bit about it in his excellent book Facebook: The Inside Story. When someone offers you 19 billion to violate your principles, you have to wonder what you can do with that money and maybe you can do more good than you could with whatsapp.<p>Plus housing in Palo Alto is expensive: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dirt.com&#x2F;moguls&#x2F;tech&#x2F;brian-acton-house-palo-alto-1203229747&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dirt.com&#x2F;moguls&#x2F;tech&#x2F;brian-acton-house-palo-alto...</a><p>I wrote an overly long feudal allegory about this based on pillars of the earth (I know, but it was fun to write): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zalberico.com&#x2F;essay&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;14&#x2F;the-serfs-of-facebook.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zalberico.com&#x2F;essay&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;14&#x2F;the-serfs-of-facebook...</a><p>His last tweet still stands: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;brianacton&#x2F;status&#x2F;976231995846963201?s=20" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;brianacton&#x2F;status&#x2F;976231995846963201?s=2...</a><p>###<p>“Do no knights strike out on their own?”<p>Philip was quiet for a moment. He pointed across a vast vista to a large castle in the distance adjacent to that of their own Earl Zuckerberg’s. “That is the castle of Sir Brian Acton of the former Earldom of WhatsApp. Sir Acton was an idealistic farmer who rejected the ways of our earl. He promised the serfs he would take no part of their data harvest they produced from the land he provided them, and instead the serfs even paid him a small cash fee for his protection. He had no knights to watch and report on his people and no heralds spreading pronouncements.”<p>“What happened?”<p>“He was too successful. Earl Zuckerberg saw many of his serfs begin to leave his lands to work the lands of Sir Acton (at the time he was known as Farmer Acton). This was a risk to the power of Zuckerberg’s earldom, since an earl without serfs to tend to the data fields has no harvest to interest others. In the end he offered Sir Acton a knightship and such enormous wealth that he could not refuse. It’s said he now lives in that vast castle alone, is rarely seen, and rarely speaks. The serfs that were in agreement with him now belong to Earl Zuckerberg as they had before, their deal was broken, and once again they tend to our earl’s data harvest.”<p>“Are there no others?”<p>“Sir Acton was just the most noble, and his fall the most tragic. Others like Sir Chris Coyne of the former Earldom of Keybase promised their serfs protection and then cruelly sold them to the Earldom of Zoom, which is closely tied to the Eastern Kingdom, a hostile land ruled by a tyrant king where the earls are weak and only serve to do the king’s bidding. There the serfs are forced to grow only what the king has allowed and serfs that refuse are dealt with swiftly and harshly. While in our kingdom farmers can choose to try to strike out on their own (though most choose not to), in the Earldoms of Zoom or TikTok, nothing can happen without the blessing of their king.”')
