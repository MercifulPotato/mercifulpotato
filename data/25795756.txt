Amazon is not inventing and open sourcing DBs. For the last 15 years, we&#x27;ve relied on independent companies to advance the state of the art for _all of us_. Amazon has no reason to build a compelling database and release it to the community. When the giant tech companies do open source they&#x27;re work, it&#x27;s usually an attempt to improve their existing market at the expensive of another company: Kubernetes, OpenDistro, Firecracker, and most of the CNCF projects follow this pattern.<p>A fork is a natural response to an OSS project license change. But when the company that _forces_ the license change also creates the fork, it&#x27;s gross.')
