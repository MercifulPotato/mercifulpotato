Item(by='gravitas', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603999026, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24934014, text='&gt; Itâ€™s crazy that their lawyers think that merely referring to a privacy policy via a decal on the door is adequate acceptance of this kind of intrusion<p>Very abstractly, legal precedent exists for the general implementation. Texas has what&#x27;s called &quot;the 30.07 sign&quot; codified in the penal code (30.06 concealed, 30.07 open carry)[1] which prohibits firearm carry on that property with nothing more than a proper&#x2F;legal sign. The responsibility lies on the entrant to notice and comply with the sign prior to entering the establishment, no explicit acknowledgement is required by that place of business for it to be enforced.<p>(not saying I agree with what&#x27;s going on here, only that I can see lawyers using laws like this to support the action in the face of no laws saying it <i>can&#x27;t</i> be done like this - a judge may throw the argument out, but it could be made as a good faith argument? My mind is thinking about how in the 90s &quot;shrink wrap acceptance&quot; was just a given - you opened he box so you accepted the license, but in 2020 many new laws have been developed to curtail that design and now require explicit acceptance by the end-user.)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;statutes.capitol.texas.gov&#x2F;Docs&#x2F;PE&#x2F;htm&#x2F;PE.30.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;statutes.capitol.texas.gov&#x2F;Docs&#x2F;PE&#x2F;htm&#x2F;PE.30.htm</a>')
