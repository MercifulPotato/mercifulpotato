I guess this makes me think that if you do more high-quality reading, your brain will naturally adapt.<p>My problem is I tried to increase my retention, which for me meant stopping and thinking about what I&#x27;d read.  This obviously slowed down my words-per-minute -- but I do feel like I developed good recall.  Maybe the trick is learning not to sacrifice one for the other.<p>About limiting distractions:  I switched from reading on my Kindle to books.   Having one dedicated hard copy of a single work which I&#x27;m committed to reading sort of &quot;re-frames&quot; the activity.  Sometimes (before the pandemic) I&#x27;d go off someplace peaceful where there were trees and empty spaces, and then break out my book.<p>I also decided it was more important that I enjoy the act of reading every page than to focus on how many books I finished.  Maybe another approach to your problem would be to re-visit your original question.  I&#x27;m hope I&#x27;m not being dismissive here, but what is it that you&#x27;re trying to accomplish with a higher WPM?  (It seems like at least some of that could be accomplished by, for example, freeing up more time for reading, even at slower speeds.)')
