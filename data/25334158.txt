I think this points to the multi-factor aspect of asthma. There&#x27;s also the fact that asthma is triggered by many things -- dust in the ventilation that only gets circulated in the winter when the heat gets turned on, for example.<p>As an aside -- it&#x27;s important to keep in mind that the article does not say &quot;gas stoves cause asthma, rip them from your homes immediately or be prepared to curse your infant with respiratory illness.&quot; It says, &quot;there&#x27;s a link here, and we should do something about that link.&quot; The author goes to great pains to use words <i>other</i> than cause: &quot;connection&quot; &quot;link&quot; etc.')
