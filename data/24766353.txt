Prior to this pandemic 97% of dwellings in San Francisco were physically occupied by actual living people. Nobody is parking money in empty SF condos.<p>It&#x27;s true that investors are attracted to Bay Area real estate, because the government has dedicated itself to making real property have outrageous risk-free returns, but putting &quot;foreign&quot; in front of &quot;investors&quot; is just baseless. Go look at the press release from when Dinerstein bought several large apartment buildings in Berkeley a year ago. Why did they do it? Quoting the buyer, they wanted to be &quot;in a market that has historically had a very high barrier to entry.‚Äù In other words, in a market where the government is too stupid to build houses. This has nothing to do with money laundering.')
