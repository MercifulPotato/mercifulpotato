It doesn&#x27;t work and will be defeated. When you download a song, or movie, or ebook that has been stripped of its DRM you aren&#x27;t tied to anything. Why introduce unnecessary annoyances for paying customers which often drives them to pirate copies that aren&#x27;t crippled by DRM? As long as something works like they want it to, most people wont care what platform they use to get it.')
