That&#x27;s true --- IBKR Pro is I think the only online retail brokerage that doesn&#x27;t do that.<p>To my understanding, the only meaningful benefit to &quot;no PFOF&quot; is  potentially better price improvement. Which is to say, if you place orders with Ameritrade, which is doing PFOF, you&#x27;re going to get price improvement over NBBO, but with IBKR Pro, which doesn&#x27;t, you might get even better price improvement.<p>In the IBKR Pro case, that&#x27;s true: according to their advertised price improvement stats, you will get 1&#x2F;3c of improved price improvement per share as a consequence of trading through them compared to the industry average. Your call whether a third of a penny is meaningful to you.<p>But in the general case, it might <i>not</i> necessarily be true that &quot;no PFOF&quot; is a benefit; it&#x27;s all a question of the fees you pay and the price improvement you get with a given brokerage&#x27;s routing, right?<p>Am I off here? My sort of baseline belief is that firms like Citadel and Virtu are in fact <i>very good</i> at executing retail orders, and that it&#x27;d be weird to have a goal of making sure your dumb retail orders were routed around them.')
