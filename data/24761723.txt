Everybody takes and nobody gives. We&#x27;ve regressed from the 90&#x27;s&#x2F;00&#x27;s.<p>These platforms only care about lock-in. Spotify doesn&#x27;t really add anything. The only convenience over Winamp is social sharing.<p>All of the platforms are catered to mass audiences anyway and suck for power users. They only want to extract money and are doing it the easiest way possible. Customers that don&#x27;t complain about lack of features.<p>I posit that nobody in any of these orgs deeply cares about music.')
