I think this site tends towards more reasoned arguments. Can you please articulate in what ways you see Obama (or Clinton) as having had a presidency that was worse for America as compared with Bush or Trump’s legacies. Clinton maybe fucked up the free trade agreement a bit and hurt some important constituencies within the Democratic Party that were pretty important? Sure. Is that bad for the Democratic Party? Sure. Was it bad for America overall, long term? I don’t know. Obama misspoke (or potentially even lied) a few times about the implications of the bill? Sure. Is America better off with the ACA? By all accounts very much so. Was Obama more of a war hawk with drones than I might have liked? Sure. Was he as measured as he could have been? Maybe not. You ask others they’ll say he was too measured. Pretty difficult spot to navigate.<p>Trump and Bush? Two major wars, 1 recession, 1 near major depression. And that’s just what Bush accomplished.')
