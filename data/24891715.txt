Just checking that we&#x27;re in total agreement here.<p>This is exactly why I&#x27;ve long said that the only course that should be required of every college major (or ideally every high school graduate) is basic accounting. The number of things in a system is the cumulative result of all inflows and outflows. The population of a city can fall without any kind of change in the outflow process. By the way population flows are both domestic and international. If you stop foreign in-migration but you don&#x27;t touch domestic out-migration then the population will decline.<p>By the way SF&#x27;s population also declined 2000-2009 and sequentially in each of 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005. So unless you have real data showing SF population already fell more than 4%, I also question &quot;unseen in decades&quot;.')
