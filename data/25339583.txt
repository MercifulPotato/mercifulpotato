Everything rooted in the real world is constrained. Why don&#x27;t we each take a private jet to work everyday? Because we&#x27;re constrained on money. If we&#x27;re not constrained on money, we&#x27;re constrained on time. If it&#x27;s not that, we&#x27;re constrained by the amount of carbon we can release and still have a reasonably favorable environment for humans.<p>One of the reasons the Space Shuttle became somewhat of a boondoggle was because of this. They had a constrained budget but had to meet the demands of multiple, often competing, stakeholders. Musk knows this; he knows that NASA has constraints he doesn&#x27;t. He doesn&#x27;t have to spread his facilities across multiple States to help ensure support from as many Congress people as possible. He doesn&#x27;t have to expose himself to the same level of political risk that can change every four years. He can optimize under a different set of constraints, but it would be a mistake to assume he&#x27;s unconstrained.')
