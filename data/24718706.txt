Here is an example:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;htmx.org&#x2F;examples&#x2F;inline-validation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;htmx.org&#x2F;examples&#x2F;inline-validation&#x2F;</a><p>It&#x27;s the normal web 1.0 thing: validate your data server side and render an error message&#x2F;flagged input which is returned as html.<p>The latest dev version plugs into the HTML5 validation API so that client side validations are respected, but that doesn&#x27;t require any scripting.<p>Htmx does fire a lot of events that you can hook into if you wish, and hyperscript is an experimental mechanism for doing so, but neither are the focus or a requirement for using htmx.<p>From experience, yes, it is much simpler than the javascript-framework based approach, at least for many use cases.')
