Organizations are in the midst of more drastic adaptations and H1B appears as relevant as the DVD in a world of video streaming. My understanding is that it allowed organizations that were more comfortable doing things the &quot;traditional way&quot;, show up to work every day and sit in a cubicle, a way to spend money and energy to bring people over, so that they would do just that. Covid-19 forced them into a reality they dreaded and they survived and are adapting. Now that remote is becoming a norm, the new edge will be to do it across wide regions and time zones, which in my opinion is an even easier adaptation than the previous.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m mistaken, but I fail to see the point of H1B in that reality. How did remote-first or remote-only organizations used H1B before March?')
