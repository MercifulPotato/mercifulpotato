That makes the difference in:<p>- Developer compensation<p>- Training and career development<p>- Staffing properly i.e. not under-staffing<p>- Giving devs proper slack time between tasks and not over-burdening them with projects<p>- Letting developers own the stack not just in name only but <i>truly</i> own the technical decisions made in the stack without micro-management, including choice of language, platform, etc.<p>Without all those factors, it&#x27;s a red herring to point to the code quality. The code quality is just the <i>final</i> output of all of the above decisions.')
