If all of the evidence is available, the only surviving narrative is <i>most likely</i> the truest representation of an event.<p>At the time, I didn&#x27;t appreciate what he meant by that, these days however it seems &quot;obvious&quot; to me. When you are reading a story that says something is now &quot;twice as likely&quot; but doesn&#x27;t tell you how likely it was before and how likely it is now, that is a missing piece of information that would help you evaluate the overall presentation. That it is missing, may be an indication that the presentation is less compelling if it were present. And it is <i>that</i> which changes something from &quot;information&quot; to a &quot;narrative&quot; in my opinion.<p>One used to be able to read multiple sources, which is touted these days as &quot;meta journalism&quot;, in order to pull the evidence from a number of different narratives in order to arrive at something closer to the truth, but with the consolidation of media that becomes harder to do.')
