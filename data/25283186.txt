I have visited the PRC a few times.  On one of those times, my wife and I visited a cousin of hers in Beijing.  This cousin had a factory and was well connected.  He wanted us to do something for him, so he invited us to drinks and dinner at a fine restaurant (in a private banquet room).  Turns out that one of his buddies was the Chief of Police and he was there too.  We had fun trying to drink each other under the table, and as the evening came to a close I slipped downstairs so that I could pay for everything.  (I didn&#x27;t want to be obligated to any of these people.)  When I approached the restaurant staff and expressed my intention to pay, they were horror stricken.  Apparently the Police Chief was sponsoring the meal, which means the restaurant was giving it to him and everyone else for &quot;free&quot;.  I had not truly realized the extent of corruption in China until that moment.')
