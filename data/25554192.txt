They are old as in out of market since ~2010<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.whathifi.com&#x2F;panasonic&#x2F;dmr-ex99v&#x2F;review" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.whathifi.com&#x2F;panasonic&#x2F;dmr-ex99v&#x2F;review</a> And it was still 400â‚¬ but almost in pristine condition. Anyways it makes perfect VHS rips. It has a HDMI out so you can play directly on pretty much all TVs. Unfortunately there is no access to the files directly (DRM I guess) so copying to PC is a bit slow cause you have to burn it to DVD first (but it&#x27;s not reencoding the rip so there is no quality loss after the first recording). That&#x27;s the smallest problem. I wish there was a jailbreak or something cause there is a USB port on the device but afaik that&#x27;s only for some kind of software based troubleshooting by the Panasonic service.<p>Also one of the reason I bought that it has a time base correction chip so no desync issue with old VHS tapes. Perfect sound and don&#x27;t have to reedit them.')
