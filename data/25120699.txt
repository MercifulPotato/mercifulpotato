They handle all the heavy lifting from a tax perspective.<p>They help you get your company set up (with e-residence) and then hook into either Transferwise or LHV for banking (and stripe, etc flows into that).<p>Very friendly as well, I&#x27;m in Estonia currently and I dropped into their office yesterday to say hi.')
