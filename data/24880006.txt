As months ticked on, I didn&#x27;t see any news about full flights getting infected in the way I would expect. I&#x27;ve seen countless stories of &quot;x people went to event and 90% got Covid a week later&quot; but as far as I could discern, almost nothing like that had come from  flying. I chose to fly with a carrier (Delta) that I felt was handling the situation more responsibly by blocking middle seats. I&#x27;ll say that the whole experience felt pretty fine. Airlines and airports have taken reasonable precautions at every step of the experience and I&#x27;ll say I felt substantially more comfortable flying (except for wearing a mask for ~10 hours) than I&#x27;ve felt doing other risky activities like dining outside or going for a run&#x2F;bike ride on a crowded trail in the park.')
