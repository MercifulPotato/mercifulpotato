The names and descriptions for the various controls are written in proper language, and there are loads of graphs and stats for the nerds. My only gripes are that the interface relies too much on JavaScript (you get sent back to the login when you refresh the page...) and that, at least on my model, there is no way to perform a factory reset without plugging in a phone handset (who has one of those these days!).<p>Of course, OpenWRT still kills it in terms of support for standards. FRITZboxes have their own stupid mesh protocol that&#x27;s only compatible with other FRITZboxes, not implementing e.g. 802.11s.')
