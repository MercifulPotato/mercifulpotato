So far Covid has killed many more - at least 50,000.<p>But this is using an inclusive definition for &quot;killed by flu&quot; that will include many people, and it&#x27;s using a restrictive definition for &quot;killed by covid&quot; that will undercount deaths.<p>To give an idea of how flu in the UK is counted you can look at this report: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.publishing.service.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;system&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;attachment_data&#x2F;file&#x2F;526405&#x2F;Flu_Annual_Report_2015_2016.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.publishing.service.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;...</a>')
