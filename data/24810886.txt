And there are companies and organisations that are still hiring: you just need to be sure that you&#x27;re stepping onto a firm footing in your new position. If you&#x27;re moving into a position with the government or an NGO you&#x27;re probably as safe as you are anywhere, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t be taking a position as a web developer for (say) a fast fashion retailer right now, or anything at all in the entertainment and hospitality sectors outside the BBC, Netflix, etc.<p>Still, unless it&#x27;s <i>really</i> dreadful where you are, I&#x27;d stay put.')
