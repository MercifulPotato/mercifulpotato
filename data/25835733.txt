They receive funding from taxes and their own revenue streams: merchandizing, advertising, syndication, and so on.<p>It works. That is, it works until it doesn&#x27;t.<p>The CBC is entirely &quot;free&quot; to every Canadian who wants to use it, and it is <i>fantastic</i>. I wish it were expanded in scope.<p>But there is an opposition that wants it dismantled and moved from government funding at all costs. Usually, the opposition is purely along political lines which is disappointing.<p>So, I suppose the argument against it being tax-funded is that it become yet another chip in the political game. An argument for tax-funded is that there are no additional fees awaiting those who cannot afford them.<p>Seems like something of a tossup or...yet to be determined.<p>The added separation from political influence is big points, but it&#x27;s rather moot when one group who&#x27;ve already made their mind up will just shout &quot;conspiracy&quot; and then the facts don&#x27;t matter anyway. That happens here in Canada, to be sure.')
