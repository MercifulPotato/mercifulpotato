If you do it the wrong way, you end up with functions becoming layer upon layer of indirection that feels like a rabbit hole you need to dive further and further into to understand what is actually going on. But if instead you keep the core control flow in the original function, but move sensibly named chunks of into into helper functions - that way the original function ends up reading like pseudo-code, and you don&#x27;t really need to actually look at any of the helper functions to understand what is going on.')
