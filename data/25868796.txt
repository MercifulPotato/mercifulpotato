Free is free, you could always argue that there is &quot;a spirit to open source&quot;; but as with everything there&#x27;s always going to be people exploiting and using it, that comes with the free.<p>To me it boils down to if you think that it&#x27;s worth it: whenever I put MIT or Apache 2.0 on my public Github projects, I don&#x27;t mind anyone going out making millions on them. Other side of the coin; if I make millions on some obscure library I found on Github with an MIT license, I do not expect them to be outraged about it.<p>If you do not think it&#x27;s worth it, as you said there are a range of other licenses out there. I love the notion of human knowledge being free and available to all to the fullest extent, I think it will drive (and has driven) immense value for humankind.')
