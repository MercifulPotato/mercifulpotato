They also horribly misused their email and phone number database which, in my opinion, should get them drastically fined--I sure as hell didn&#x27;t give them permission to use my email&#x2F;phone number to be lobbied to.<p>3) This was combining with the fact that due to Covid a lot of people are getting zero assistance and, for them, the <i>only</i> money they may be making may be coming in from Uber&#x2F;Lyft.<p>This is pretty much a perfect storm for getting a bad proposition through.')
