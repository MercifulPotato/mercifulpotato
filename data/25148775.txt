But that doesn’t mean that we don’t know <i>anything</i> about possible long-term effects — in fact, that’s categorically false. We know quite a lot about the underlying biology of these vaccines, and we have extensive data from animal testing. We can’t exclude <i>all</i> long-term effects but we know that they’re rather unlikely — mostly because there’s no plausible biological mechanism to cause them.<p>In particular, based on our biological knowledge, we can categorically exclude claims from conspiracy theorists about the RNA likely being integrated into our genome: this just isn’t how any of this works, it’s fiction.')
