They&#x27;re mostly just my family and relatives. But I told them &quot;I&#x27;m quitting WhatsApp, if you need to message me, use Signal&quot;. And they all just downloaded Signal because it&#x27;s honestly not that big of a deal. It&#x27;s just another free chat app.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s not how the world works&quot;. Of course it is. Most people downloaded WhatsApp because someone told them to so they could message each other.')
