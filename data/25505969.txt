Item(by='neogodless', descendants=None, kids=[25506493], score=None, time=1608643366, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25505420, text='That last paragraph is indicative of terribly quality and quality control.<p>Fortunately that hasn&#x27;t been my experience with the recent Dell, Asus, Lenovo and HP laptops I&#x27;ve purchased. Each have been without any issues at all.<p>But my point here is that... it sounds like you&#x27;re arguing against consumer choice. You can have your Model T in any color as long as it is black. And this <i>is</i> Apple&#x27;s model. You can have your product in any configuration as long as it&#x27;s the one configuration Apple offers. Apple tried this, actually, for a long time. The iPhone started out with extremely limited configurations and only more recently branched out beyond 2. In a way, I agree with the confusion, because I know now I can&#x27;t just say &quot;Macbook&quot; because there is at least one Macbook without suffix, at least one Air, and the Macbook Pro has a myriad of configurations - different sizes, with or without touch bar, etc.<p>Why did Apple start offering more options? Because that&#x27;s what consumers want. Dell exists exactly because they were the first big PC manufacturer to accept configuration orders, and then (relatively) quickly manufacturer and deliver those custom configurations to users. Consumers want this. As Apple&#x27;s share of the market grows, they will have to meet the consumers where they are - or their market share will be limited by the limitations they place upon themselves.<p>Now, I agree that, for example, the variety of models between different geographic locations is - if nothing else - annoying. Especially when nicer options aren&#x27;t offered in your location! But I don&#x27;t agree with the offered example of getting bad replacements. Maybe buying one laptop a year isn&#x27;t enough to experience these issues.')
