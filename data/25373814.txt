A selective blur of a fully focused scene captured from a single viewpoint (i.e. a small lens) can only approximate this effect, because it simply doesn&#x27;t have access to the same information. Even with a perfect depth map, you still don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s <i>behind</i> occluded objects.')
