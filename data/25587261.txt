I started in the mid 90s with Linux and Win95 and you owned and could understand the whole computer. iOS and the trend of walled computing gardens were ostensibly done for security and user experience, but users have lost control of their devices. Not everyone needs that of course, but I t is a big reason I migrated to Linux this year after having an off again on again relationship with Linux on my primary computing device. macOS is good, but it used to be great. Way too many technologists are eating up things like M1 &#x2F; Apple silicon without asking if it’s a good thing. It performs great, but does it really matter? I’m pretty sure it doesn’t help me code or do things in emacs any more efficiently. After Apple hardware quality dropping a lot I just don’t feel the experience is good enough to justify it anymore. Maybe M1 will be a big evolutionary step that we simply can’t ignore, but I know I can do everything I need to for the next few years on my Linux laptop. I will evaluate again when it’s EOL. Mid-2015 Mac was the last great MacBook IMO. It’s been downhill from there. It’s been a slow incremental decline in quality of both the hardware and the OS. And I really loves my Mac and Apple ecosystem a lot, but the writing is on the wall for these walled gardens. iOS is still solid and my iPhone 12 is great... but it may be my last iPhone as well. Same with Windows, honestly. Win 7 was probably the last great windows operating system. Win10 has been very okay for me. All the forced reboots and telemetry in macOS and Windows... yuck.')
