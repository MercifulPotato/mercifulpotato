I&#x27;ve even been a part of workflows that halt all subsequent PRs until the CI tests pass, and I still don&#x27;t understand the situation this is designed to prevent.<p>Why not simply disallow the PR to merge unless CI passes? Why stop all integrations? There must be something I&#x27;m missing.<p>Edit: I think I get it. Normally PRs to Github.com non-enterprise go through as normal. 45 minutes later, after that merge, the 2 expensive Enterprise CI tests complete and that&#x27;s when the developer gets the 72 hour timer.  The dev has the option of reverting their change and trying again.')
