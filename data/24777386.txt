The Buddhist teaching is apathy to everything via lack of desire.<p>First, Buddhism is a term that includes a huge range of religions and practices <i>derived from</i> Buddha&#x27;s teachings.<p>Second, I don&#x27;t know what form of Buddhism you are talking about, but Buddha certainly didn&#x27;t teach apathy, in fact one of the biggest emphasis in his teaching was compassion, which is pretty much the opposite of apathy.<p>One of the problems, at least in English, in understanding Buddha&#x27;s teachings, is translation. The words he originally used to describe what he felt and what to do about it, have no direct translation into English.<p>In my case, before reading a book about Buddha&#x27;s teaching, I understood the goal of Buddhism as the &quot;cessation of suffering&quot;. But while reading the book and doing some meditation, I&#x27;ve come to understand it in slightly different terms that I can&#x27;t fully describe with words because it&#x27;s a range of feelings and reactions within me (body and mind) that now I interpret as the stated &quot;suffering&quot;, even though it is not really suffering.<p>&gt; Meditation is magic to HN.<p>I can&#x27;t speak for HN. Personally, meditation has helped me calm down and be aware of my mood changes. It took me years to take up the practice, trying different things on and off.<p>Also, be aware that &quot;meditation&quot; is a bit like saying &quot;exercise&quot;, there are thousands of different ways of doing it. Some you might like, other you might totally hate.<p>If you really want to know, I encourage you to dig deeper, there&#x27;s a lot to discover.')
