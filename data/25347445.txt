(At least we aren&#x27;t planning on licensing 10^5 systems on RHEL...). I imagine for those same companies, RHEL isn&#x27;t far behind it.<p>What&#x27;s even worse here is that at least for us there are some things that we pay for RHEL for. If we switch all of our other servers, those RHEL licenses won&#x27;t be continuing either.<p>Obvious, but stupid.')
