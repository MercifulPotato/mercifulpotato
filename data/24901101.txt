It is too easy to game &quot;what people are saying&quot; on social media<p>2. Loudest voices &#x2F; most extreme positions get picked up, amplified, and passed off as &quot;what people are saying&quot;<p>3. It is too easy &#x2F; predictable to game what kind of messages the media chooses to summarize<p>4. None of it <i>matters</i> (see my original post about what people say vs. what people do)<p>If an idea is worth discussing, it is worth discussing regardless of its source (social media or otherwise).  Conversely, and I know this is open for debate, but Twitter is not a great medium for discussing ideas.<p>Social media regularly reminds me of the Douglas Adams quote:<p><i>“The story so far:</i>\n<i>In the beginning the Universe was created.</i>\n<i>This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.”</i><p><i>That</i> is, on average, what people are saying on social media.  It is not worth summarizing and covering.')
