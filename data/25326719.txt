I already have an nVidia Shield. It works out of the box, it&#x27;s nice, and it already does everything I want. Even if I jailbroke my TV&#x27;s smartness, then said TV&#x27;s smartness probably still wouldn&#x27;t work as well as the Shield. And if the Shield ever messes with me, I can just replace it with a Roku or AppleTV or Chromecast or whatever.<p>There&#x27;s just no strong motivation to try to root my TV. I don&#x27;t like my smart TV but I don&#x27;t need to, because the smart parts can be &quot;replaced&quot; by any number of external devices. My point is that I suspect many would-be TV hackers are in the same happy situation.')
