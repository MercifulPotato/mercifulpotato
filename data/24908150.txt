However, if the analysis doesn&#x27;t provide enough nuance WRT revenue generation, how useful is that analysis, except as a primer on using those particular techniques in a novel fashion?<p>&gt;At the end of the day the argument boils down to &quot;drivers make more money when they can drive faster&quot;, which seems pretty indisputable.<p>Absolutely a fair point, although ignoring the time-based variations in the demand curve likely has a measurable effect on revenue generation.<p>To illustrate that point, during the pandemic, overall traffic volumes are down at least 50%, presumably allowing even day time drivers to drive faster.  However, some estimates of taxi driver revenue have it down 80+%.<p>Even more, traffic lights on one-way avenues (at least in Manhattan, where the bulk of medallion taxis operate) are generally set at slightly less than 25 miles&#x2F;hour (the citywide default speed limit), so &quot;driving faster = making more money&quot; isn&#x27;t really correct.  &quot;Driving faster than 12 miles per hour usually results in higher revenue&quot; is probably more accurate.<p>&gt;So if overall traffic speeds are slowing down, then in aggregate all drivers will suffer as well, although the daytime driver suffering through rush hour gridlock will be comparatively worse off than a driver who focuses on long airport rides in the middle of the night.<p>That absolutely applies to day time drivers, and night-time drivers can (and usually do) generate more revenue.  However, some of that difference is unrelated to speed.  Rather it&#x27;s related to demand.  Because people know that traffic is bad during the day makes them <i>less likely</i> to use a taxi during the day and more likely to do so at night.<p>However, your example of airport rides is flawed, as rides between airports&#x2F;Manhattan are a flat fare and not based on time and distance.<p>I don&#x27;t use Uber or other FHV services, mainly because I find their business model offensive, given the huge fees they charge are way out of proportion to the services they provide  -- and that&#x27;s fundamentally unfair to the <i>drivers</i>.<p>Which is also why I <i>always</i> pay cash when using a taxi, as there&#x27;s usually a fee of <i>at least</i> 5% on credit card transactions in the taxi, and drivers often don&#x27;t receive their money for days -- yet the fleet owners require up-front payment for leases, and the drivers must fill the gas tank before returning the car.')
