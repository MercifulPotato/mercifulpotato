Google Analytics is just not the solution because we don&#x27;t get data ownership. Then, these privacy analytics are coming. First, Fathom then some copies. But, all claims &quot;No consent needed. Track your users without letting them know&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s not how it should be. Analytics solutions should have built-in options to allow users to opt-out (precisely, an embeddable in-built opt-out banner).<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t like tracking my activities. I use tracker blockers to prevent that. Yet, these solutions are promotion custom domains (CNAME cloaking), which even Google Analytics does.<p>When will have the option to fully opt-out from tracking?<p>If a Chrome or Firefox dev reading this comment, what about introducing a tracking allowance API and allow users to opt-in and opt-out for tracking in the browser level. A really privacy-first analytics solution would be one that respects user&#x27;s browser tracking settings.<p>It&#x27;s my opinion.')
