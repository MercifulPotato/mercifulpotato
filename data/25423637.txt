Once a company gets above a couple of hundred employees, the majority of the new employees simply are not the sort of people who do &quot;long, undistracted stretches of work&quot;. You can&#x27;t carry on for ever hiring people who both have that sort of mentality and intellectual fortitude, and also want their job to completely dominate their day rather than just 9-5.')
