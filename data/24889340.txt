All of this works because the honeybees can vibrate themselves to a temperature just warmer than the hornets can tolerate, which is also just less than the bees can tolerate. Just one or two degrees celsius of tolerance is the difference.<p>Hopefully no Asian giant hornets ever evolve a slightly higher temperature tolerance!')
