Organisms are a side-effect, a result of the fact that cooperation often provides a competitive advantage [1].  But evolution neither knows nor cares about civilization.  It just so happens that, at the moment here on earth, genes that build brains that build civilizations reproduce better than genes that don&#x27;t.  But that has not always been the case, and there is no guarantee that it will continue to be the case.  It is entirely possible that this whole civilization thing is just a transient.<p>IMHO a prerequisite to the survival of civilization is the recognition that the interests of civilizations can be, and often are, <i>at odds</i> with the interests of genes, and so we are necessarily in active conflict with the genes that made us.  The best example of this is birth control, which is an obvious existential threat to the reproductive fitness of our genes.  So genes that build brains that have an instinctive revulsion to birth control will, all else being equal, reproduce better than genes that build brains that don&#x27;t have this revulsion.  In the absence of active intervention, the result will be overpopulation.<p>For a civilization to succeed long-term it has to recognize that it is necessarily in conflict with the genes that produced its individual members, because otherwise the genes will win.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Evolution_of_Cooperation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Evolution_of_Cooperation</a>')
