( i need to pay a small bill since that VISA is expired, which requires login)<p>I know my credentials and i can access my email.

Because that&#x27;s literally the issue.<p>Or any other advice? ( It&#x27;s a small account, but it will give me a lot of hassle and errors if i have to reconfigure every website&#x2F;webapp and approve every email again. Setting me back for &gt; 2-3 days)<p>Edit:<p>Thank you all!<p>I changed the default SMS app ( the default was the normal one for Android) and it showed me a lot of missed messages, including OTP ones from Amazon.')
