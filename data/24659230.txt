We have had the advantage of billions of years of evolution, they start the same journey from scratch.<p>Human brain is not smart in and of itself - it learns everything from the environment, including fundamental concepts and reasoning. We are not just surrounded by nature, with all its glorious detail, but also by the human society and culture. Our environment is very complex and rich.
