America in particular has an insane number of lawyers. The bar exam isn&#x27;t actually that hard to pass (look at the pass rates for native English speakers, they&#x27;re high) and there are 100s of law schools, so the market is flooded with bad lawyers looking to scratch a living. This results in a lot of bad lawsuits being filed, shoddy legal work that bears costs long into the future, and a general legalization of many aspects of business that probably often doesn&#x27;t need to happen.<p>In addition to the all of the bad legal work, the best lawyers also often go to the &quot;white shoe&quot; law firms. In America, these law firms hire out their legal capital to corporate world that engages in beating down consumers and competition, which is resulting in an increasingly monolithic and sclerotic economy.')
