If it doesn&#x27;t scale, it can only help a small number of people so the net welfare increase is negligible. Might as well not exist if it can&#x27;t scale. I&#x27;m not saying to everyone, I&#x27;m saying to <i>more than a single Costco</i>. As I said, Layer 2 doesn&#x27;t count because you can just as easily set up a fiat bank as an exchange, and with far less regulation in exchanges you take on way more risk. Fine, whatever, we won&#x27;t see eye to eye on that.<p>(2) Debit interchange in Europe is capped at 0.2% and has been since 2015 [1]<p>(3) Let&#x27;s walk through my proposal. Step 1: Sign up for TransferWise Borderless Account. Step 2: Receive EUR. There is no fee, and there is no step 3. If you don&#x27;t trust your local currency why wouldn&#x27;t you just hold EUR or USD or CAD or NZD? They&#x27;re <i>actually stable</i> and don&#x27;t drop 40% in a month.<p>Let&#x27;s walk through your proposal. Step 1: Convince someone in Europe to sign up for an exchange, verify their identities and whatnot. Make a SEPA transfer into the exchange, pay 1-2%. Wait 1-2 days. Buy a crypto. Transfer the crypto to you. Pay a fee. $15 for BTC right now. Step 4: Convert at whatever rate to your local currency, pay 1-2%. Deposit it into a <i>bank anyways</i> since nobody uses crypto. All the while taking on huge counterparty risk, a large bid-ask spread and exchange rate shift risk. Step 5: Commit tax fraud by not reporting your transaction. That sounds like (2+6=8% to 4+6=10%) to me for the Brazilian in your situation.<p>If that&#x27;s flying free, I&#x27;m ok on the ground.<p>How could you possibly believe the latter is better than the former?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adyen.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;all-you-need-to-know-about-the-eu-interchange-cap" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adyen.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;all-you-need-to-know-about-the-eu...</a>')
