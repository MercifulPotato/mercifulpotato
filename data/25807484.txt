It used to be all specialized chips like IBM Power.  It was when Intel was ascendant.  Now ARM is doing the same thing.<p>Arm is attacking Intel at the top and bottom and middle leaving less and less space for them to operate.<p>Intel lost embedded to arm first.  Then the lost mobile.  Then they lost the Apple laptops and later this year the Apple desktops.  They are starting to lose the super computers.  The nail in the coffin will come with the cloud servers if those vendors could get something close to Appleâ€™s custom Arm cpu performance.')
