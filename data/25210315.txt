If we can&#x27;t start with accepting the others&#x27; right to exist and be treated with respect, there&#x27;s no room to find common ground and actually build anything.<p>It&#x27;s why I find it so interesting (and concerning) how people respond to, say, college, or urban areas, coming from rural and more homogeneous ones. Some people find themselves realizing that those who are different than them...aren&#x27;t so different, and learn to accept and respect others despite those differences. Others resist, seeking out others like themselves, building a bubble to operate in, avoiding the &#x27;other&#x27;, and become even less tolerant than they were before (while also demonizing the &#x27;liberal brainwashing&#x27; happening in colleges and big cities and the like, that they saw happening around them).')
