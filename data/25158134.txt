It exists solely to leverage its official sounding name to constantly nudge people towards deceiving people into buying &quot;Bitcoin cash&quot; which is largely unrelated to bitcoin. When ever they&#x27;re called out for doing it too blatantly deceptively (e.g. spent months calling &quot;bitcoin cash&quot; the real bitcoin, and bitcoin &quot;bitcoin core&quot;), they just walk it back slight enough to not get outright banned on platforms.')
