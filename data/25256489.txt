I could be be wrong if it gets drastically cheaper to source lithium, nickel, and iron from mining operations versus concentrated ore in end of life cells. Doesnâ€™t seem likely based on mining costs and the demand curve (demand will increase as fast or faster than reserves can be sourced), as well as jurisdictions mandating manufacturers stand up recycling supply chains for the products they&#x27;re building and selling (California did this with solar PV, many others have done it for electronics recycling in general, for example).<p>I would be willing to make a Long Bet [1] on this point.
