I use zowie mice at 800 dpi and setting gui settings to 0.1 sensitivity (or 1 etc,c whatever is lowest) would result in several desktops worth of movement per mousepad (22 inches), really bad over all. i just wanted a single left-right corresponding with monitor edges which was never a problem across any os until recently which oddly started treating low dpi at 1000 hz really weird<p>i still got the patches somewhere and will post them soon. it basically let you set mouse speed scaling on a larger scale')
