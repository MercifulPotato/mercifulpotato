Yes, they can do some of it, but they can&#x27;t do it better or even close to that if you are serious at what you do.<p>I am a developer, I have been Linux user for years and photography is my hobby. I periodically try some Lightroom &quot;alternatives&quot; in hopes of finding something good, but they are still nowhere near of replacing it. And with the limited budget they will probably never be as good.<p>I know only one great open source software example in the arts field, and that software is Blender. Blender can probably do it because they have been receiving millions in donations from major game development companies in the recent years. Unless something similar happens in the field of photography, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll be able to get away from proprietary software soon.')
