Item(by='root_axis', descendants=None, kids=[25885232], score=None, time=1611427510, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25884723, text='&gt; <i>if I have instances A, B, C, D: B can decide (through whatever process it uses for such things) they don’t like A’s content and ban it without affecting users on C and D.</i><p>Yes, but this isn&#x27;t really analogous to the complaint being presented. In the Mastadon world this article would have been titled &quot;<i>A</i> Disabled My Account After I Criticized Them&quot;. The author is still free to use B, C, D etc, just like with http websites.<p>&gt; <i>Either way, the Mastodon model seems better because it allows policy to be specified at the “local” level rather than requiring a uniform policy across the network.</i><p>To be clear, I do think an ActivityPub-like architecture is preferable for social networking, but federation doesn&#x27;t obviate the concept of popularity, it only seems that way now because the fediverse isn&#x27;t popular, if it ever did become popular then we&#x27;d see the exact same complaints when people get banned from popular instances.')
