Only the Tor browser has strict enough settings with a large enough user base to overcome fingerprinting.<p>If you don’t want to use Tor, try these:<p>- uBlock Origin (which has a larger blacklist of fingerprinting scripts)<p>- Enable the privacy.resistFingerprinting setting in about:config to make your browser more similar to other users with that setting enabled (but not entirely non-unique)<p>- The nuclear option: arkenfox user.js [1]. It’s github repo also contains a lot of further information about fingerprinting.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;arkenfox&#x2F;user.js" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;arkenfox&#x2F;user.js</a>')
