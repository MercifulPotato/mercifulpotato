They have said its some type of nanoparticle lipid mixture that is able to get inside your cells, but they haven&#x27;t disclosed publicly or to the review panels what it actually is or how its made, since its proprietary tech. [0] Back in 2017, Moderna was taking a similar approach, wrapping the mRNA in lipid nanoparticles, but found that it had safety issues, and never made it to human trials. [1] Hopefully they have fixed their problems, but nothing I&#x27;ve seen has outright proven that its safe over the long term.<p>Personally, I can kind of understand this reasoning, I would prefer to know exactly what is going into my body and how its made, and that information should absolutely be made open. Something I also wonder is that moderna had a bunch of mRNA vaccines set to go to human trials, and I wonder where they went.
