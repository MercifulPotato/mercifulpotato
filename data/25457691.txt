GitHub continues to, somehow, surprise me.<p>One question I do have, however, is whether or not the new homepage[0] which shows where people are when they open a PR actually reveals their present location. In the few samples I checked it did not seem that the presence of the person indicated matched their bio&#x27;s location settings. If it is truly unmasking people&#x27;s location I think it should be opt-in only, since it is private information. An employer or state may have issues with someone opening a PR from a specific country at a specific time, for example.<p>[0] It may be required to open this in an incognito browser.')
