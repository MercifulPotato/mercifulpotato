It&#x27;s like saying that there are infinities bigger than other infinities (because we define bigger to mean &#x27;not able to be put into a correspondence&#x27;), or that the sum of natural numbers is -1&#x2F;12 or when we say that x^0 is 1 because that makes all kinds of things work so much better.  All this terminology is useful, but the way the article talks make it sound as if it is ordained by a higher power that it must be this way rather than simply contingent on what we find most useful.<p>To complain that someone is stupid because they&#x27;re using less useful or standard terminology is unfair, especially if they&#x27;re not playing the same game you&#x27;re playing - dividing cookies evenly is a totally different game to maths, and it&#x27;s reasonable to have different definitions.<p>As someone who has occasionally been able to make strong arguments that the &#x27;wrong&#x27; answer on a multiple choice question is more correct than the &#x27;right&#x27; answer, there&#x27;s also something pretty elitist about giving people so little room to explain themselves.  You can tell almost nothing about a person by whether they fit into one of four boxes you&#x27;ve chosen for them.')
