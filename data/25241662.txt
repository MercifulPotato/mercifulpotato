You are tossing out a mix of unrelated facts and lies in an attempt to prove that George Floyd&#x27;s murder was not racially motivated, or that he was actually dying from a fentanyl OD so the cop&#x27;s behavior would have been fine for a healthy person, or not even to prove anything but to paint him as a career criminal who deserved what he got to bias people against him.<p>Short of a written declaration from Derek Chauvin, stating that &quot;I killed George Floyd because he was black and I was having a bad day&quot;, there is nothing that will make you admit this murder was racially motivated, and I think it&#x27;s pretty obvious to most readers of this thread why that is.')
