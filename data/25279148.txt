You aren&#x27;t really trying to be like Instagram influenceres because of your &quot;selfish gene&quot;.  Your &quot;selfish gene&quot; would do better directing you toward fundamentalist communities where reproductive rates are higher.<p>No, you are being influenced by media, which convinces you that things are a proxy for happiness and good relationships.  It&#x27;s the materialism that fuels our economic progress so I am not against it.  But if you think you are in a rat race for money and success, it&#x27;s because of human nature, not genetic survival.')
