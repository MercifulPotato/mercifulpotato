Julia is very much a dynamic language. It also has the ability to add type hints, but, unlike for most optionally typed languages, these aren&#x27;t just type hints for human readers or an external type checker. They&#x27;re actually one of Julia&#x27;s more interesting features. Julia&#x27;s type declarations provide information that the compiler uses to generate faster code, and to support its multiple dispatch functionality.<p>When the notes say &quot;optional typing - currently not implemented&quot;, all they&#x27;re saying is that this syntax doesn&#x27;t allow you to tap into that feature, because a syntax for type declarations has not been provided.')
