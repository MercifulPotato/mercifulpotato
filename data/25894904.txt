The 50% renewables are not the cause of the extra 350g of CO2 in Germany.<p>The way you word this it sounds like renewables == bad, when in reality Germany is burning a boat load of coal which is causing the extra emissions, while France’s emissions are offset because they have lots of Nuclear power.<p>Nuclear power takes 20-50 years to come online- it’s too late to rely on it and burn fossil fuels in the mean time.
