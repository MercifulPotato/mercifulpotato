(not even taking into account that that would cause massive inflation etc). just giving a person $100 an hour doesn&#x27;t guarantee they won&#x27;t end up poor, as evidence by all the professional athletes that made millions and ended up bankrupt<p>another note, your link above gives massively different outcomes based on life situations (1 adult, 2 adult, 0-3+ kids etc). Do we need to make minimum wage such that it works for 1 adult with 5 kids who somehow got there with no skills whatsoever such that they are still working for minimum wage? Some people make poor choices in life, and we can&#x27;t just raise minimum wage to a point that makes up for that. It&#x27;s simply not possible.<p>Now, we can talk about other safety nets, such as a universal basic income, and universal healthcare, etc which I&#x27;m 100% for. The gov&#x27;t should help these people, they shouldn&#x27;t force small businesses to pay people more than the value they bring to the business. This is just picking winners, amazon will get bigger, and small businesses will get killed. Let the free market decide how much people are worth in the market to a business, and let gov&#x27;t help keep people out of poverty.')
