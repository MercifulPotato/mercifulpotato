It&#x27;s clear that the crux of the issue here is that you consider that at this very moment the American presidential race isn&#x27;t &quot;finished&quot; and that it&#x27;s partisan to say that it is. If you really believe that saying that Biden won the election is a partisan issue I don&#x27;t think anything I could say would sway you at this point.<p>I would just like to point out that in 2000 Bush won Florida by 537 votes, currently Biden is ahead by over 10k votes in all the contested states, and even if the projections were wrong for any single one of them he would <i>still</i> win the electoral college. I do think the news outlets learned from 2000, otherwise they&#x27;d have called the race as soon as Pennsylvania and Georgia flipped. The situation is really not comparable to 2000 where the news networks called Florida for Gore before the last polling stations had even closed in the state[1].<p>Now if it turns out that there was indeed fraud then of course it could overturn everything, but not having any conclusive evidence of anything it makes sense for news outlets to proceed as usual I think. I mean even Fox News called the race at this point...<p>But even if we ignore these current events I still maintain that it&#x27;s silly to expect the media (and all observers, including internationally) not to call the race when the numbers show that there&#x27;s a clear winner. Maybe sometimes they&#x27;ll get it wrong, but what&#x27;s the alternative? Pretend that there&#x27;s no winner for weeks waiting for the official count and you don&#x27;t see the writing on the wall and precluding all analysis of the results? That would be rather silly.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2000_United_States_presidential_election#Florida_recount" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2000_United_States_presidentia...</a>')
