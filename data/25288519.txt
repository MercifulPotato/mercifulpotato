The other hand fraud does happen and there was a big organic grain trader who was found to be substituting non-organic grain for grain and I think he was prosecuted for it but he got away with it for years. There are also local sustainable farmers who grow organically but can&#x27;t afford or can&#x27;t justify the cost of organic certification. So while it does mean something it isn&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t always mean what you might think it does.')
