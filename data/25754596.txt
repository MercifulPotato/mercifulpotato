A key clue for me, however, is the defection not just of Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Stripe, and other tech firms, but of Parler’s legal counsel, who would have to be an exceptionally stealth-mode startup to fit Greenwald’s, or other’s, “it’s the tech monopolists” narrative. I’ve tempered my degree of assurance and language (“plausible” rather than “probable”). Time will tell. <i>But a keen and critical mind such as Grenwald’s should at least be weighing the possibility.</i> He instead seems bent only on piking old sworn enemies, with less evidence or coherence than I offer.<p>This is the crux of Greenwald’s argument. It’s all he’s got:<p><i>On Thursday, Parler was the most popular app in the United States. By Monday, three of the four Silicon Valley monopolies united to destroy it.</i><p>I’m no friend of the tech monopolists myself. The power demonstrated here does concern me, greatly. I’ve long railed against Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple, among other tech monopolists. Largely because as monopolies they are power loci acting through their occupation of a common resource, outside common control, and not serving the common weal. Hell: Facebook, Google (YouTube), Reddit, and Twitter played a massive role in creating the current fascist insurrection in the US, along with even more enthusiastic aid and comfort from traditional media, across the spectrum. Damage that will take decades to repair, if ever.<p>But, if my hypothesis is correct, the alternative explanation would bet he opposite of this: the state asserting power over and through monopolies in the common interest, in support of democratic principles, for the common weal. And that I can support.<p>I don’t know that this is the case. I find it curious that I seem to be the only voice suggesting it. Time should tell.<p>And after this is over, yes, Silicon Valley, in its metonymic sense standing for the US and global tech industry, has to face its monopoly problem, its free speech problem (in both sincere and insincere senses), its surveillance problem (capitalist, state, criminal, rogue actor), its censorship problem, its propaganda problem (mass and computational), its targeted manipulation adtech problem, its trust problem, its identity problem, its truth and disinformation problems, its tax avoidance problem, its political influence problem.<p>Virtually all of which are inherent aspects of monopoly: “Propaganda, censorship, and surveillance are all attributes of monopoly” <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joindiaspora.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;7bfcf170eefc013863fa002590d8e506" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joindiaspora.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;7bfcf170eefc013863fa002590d8e...</a>\nHN discussion: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24771470" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24771470</a><p>But, speaking as a space alien cat myself, Greenwald is so far off base here he’s exited the Galaxy.')
