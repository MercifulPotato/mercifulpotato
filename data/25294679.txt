In earlier centuries, the life expectancy at birth (which is the metric that&#x27;s about 35 years for that period) is dominated by the relatively high childhood mortality, all the many babies dying within the first days or weeks, and is <i>very</i> different from the expected lifespan of adults.<p>For example, here&#x27;s a dataset on USA historical life expectancy <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.infoplease.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;health-statistics&#x2F;life-expectancy-age-1850-2011" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.infoplease.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;health-statistics&#x2F;life-expecta...</a> - if we look at the 1850 data, then the average life expectancy at birth is 38 years but that does <i>not</i> mean that people live until 38, as a the life expectancy for a random 20 year old man is 40 more years, so people (who didn&#x27;t die in early childhood) lived (on average) to the age of 60, not 38.<p>There&#x27;s data from Roman Empire where life expectancy was 25 years at birth, but life expectancy is average 53 years upon reaching age 25 - so the intuitive metric &quot;how long do adults live&quot; is twice as large as the technical life expectancy at birth.<p>Here&#x27;s an archived resource that goes into more detail <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20070713083310&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.plimoth.org&#x2F;discover&#x2F;myth&#x2F;dead-at-40.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20070713083310&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.plimot...</a>')
