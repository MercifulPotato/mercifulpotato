Several people asked, so here&#x27;s the reason I chose to go on his show: it&#x27;s because I love his work (frequent listener) and he&#x27;s a great person.  He asks good questions suitable to a wide audience and he&#x27;s fun to talk to.<p>If you don&#x27;t like his show or style, then you don&#x27;t have to listen to it.  :-)<p>-Chris')
