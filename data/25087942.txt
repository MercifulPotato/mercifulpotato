It removes whole classes of lint errors and adds semi-colons and doesn&#x27;t care how I format the code as I wrote it.<p>Far too much thought and angst goes into things that should not need to be a concern. I used to feel more dubious about such tools, but after gofmt I tried Prettier and always use it now.<p>It&#x27;s just one more bit of cognitive load that is gone. Indeed, if it doesn&#x27;t reformat my code as expected I know I&#x27;ve made an error, so it&#x27;s even quicker for me at noticing some bugs than ESLint messages which are already pretty excellent these days.')
