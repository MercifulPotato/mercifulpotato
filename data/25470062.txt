This comes down to Putin, and has two causes.<p>First, geopolitical.  Putin feels threatened by NATO.  I suspect he remembers World War II, how the Germans launched an invasion from the middle of Poland and nearly broke the USSR.  He fears NATO being nearer than that.  But he can&#x27;t seem to stop meddling in places like the Ukraine and Georgia, so many of the former Warsaw Pact (and even USSR) countries flee to NATO for protection.  This puts NATO closer to him, so he fears more and wants to meddle more to make the remaining non-NATO countries more closely tied to Russia.  And so it goes.<p>Second, political legitimacy.  Putin hates real democracy, anywhere.  I suspect that the issue is that parts of his population resent his sham democracy (the &quot;vertical of power&quot;) and want a real one (and a free, honest press).  Putin therefore wants to destroy or at least discredit democracy.  <i>That&#x27;s</i> the point of his disinformation campaign.  It&#x27;s not just to get Trump elected (though he&#x27;s in favor of people who are friendly to him).  Mainly he wants US democracy to look bad rather than like a shining example to the Russian people.')
