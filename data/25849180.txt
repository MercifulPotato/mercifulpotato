Probably also a Rails+phpBB SSO. They were meant to be short lived services and luckily they did. The reason is that in a mixed language &#x2F; framework environment it&#x27;s better to have some centralized authentication and authorization service and a standard API to access it. Having to write and maintain N adapters is going to take a toll on the development team. However I never self hosted a service like that so I don&#x27;t want to give any suggestions about what to use.')
