This came up with Giuliani a while ago and is well described here [1]. tldr: The statistics are quite misleading as cancer survival is measured in 5-year survival rates, and the US has aggressive (sometimes medically unjustified) early screening programs. Early detection of some kinds of cancer, such as prostate cancer, doesn&#x27;t change the mortality rate but it <i>does</i> change the 5-year survival rate as the disease is detected earlier.<p>If you have more data, or this isn&#x27;t what you were referring to, I&#x27;d love to read it!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.factcheck.org&#x2F;2007&#x2F;10&#x2F;a-bogus-cancer-statistic&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.factcheck.org&#x2F;2007&#x2F;10&#x2F;a-bogus-cancer-statistic&#x2F;</a>')
