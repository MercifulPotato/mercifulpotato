Item(by='DangitBobby', descendants=None, kids=[25406085], score=None, time=1607850289, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25405132, text='Well I will not pretend that I am the one to make a good case for it. I&#x27;m not going to spend a lot of time trying to debate you about it.<p>I never said it was equivalent to violence. However, if it leads to violence, speech is absolutely dangerous. See murder cases where people are convinced to kill others under false pretenses. Or they are just talked into doing it by a charismatic individual. This sort of speech is actually already illegal. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not difficult for you to imagine speech that leads slightly indirectly to violence. That isn&#x27;t necessarily the type of speech we are discussing here, I just thought I&#x27;d point out the extreme case where we already acknowledge the power of speech.<p>As you have heard said and I&#x27;m sure will disagree with, the internet has lowered the bar to attaining a widespread audience. It used to be that you would have to be eloquent enough and thoughtful enough to throw your ideas into a coherent book, show, essay, or whatever. And there would be people vetting your material for quality before deciding it should go before an audience.<p>Obviously, that doesn&#x27;t stop all the bullshit (and actually leads to other bullshit), but having a higher barrier to information exchange meant that content was much more likely to vetted by one or more people who had some critical thinking skills. As a publisher, you couldn&#x27;t just put out anything because it would cost you something. Now, any half baked idea you have you can put it out there, and similarly minded people who maybe formed the same sorts of half baked ideas or are just incapable of vetting the truth for themselves can find each other and form large groups of people who all now believe the same bullshit. This was always possible with word of mouth, but the internet is a much more effective medium for bullshit and allows it to be much more viral and widespread in nature.<p>The vast majority of widely available &quot;information&quot; out there is no longer authored by experts, thanks to the internet. It&#x27;s authored by people who mistake their layperson knowledge as expert knowledge, or believe that their &quot;common sense&quot; is enough to tell them how the world works. The audience can now choose what &quot;information&quot; to consume and doesn&#x27;t have to believe the unpleasant things experts say or the understand the complicated stuff if they don&#x27;t want to. They can just pick and choose whatever simple or comfortable truths they desire.<p>As for evidence, most hard social and political problems are impossible to agree on. That problem is exacerbated by the type of misinformation we&#x27;re talking about here, because it&#x27;s even harder to agree on what the facts are. For example, somehow we are still arguing about global warming despite mountains of evidence. The the same thing happened with smoking and lung cancer. I don&#x27;t have any evidence to share with you, but I&#x27;m sure that if I did you&#x27;d find a way to dismiss it with your own.<p>I&#x27;m confident that you have heard similar reasoning before.')
