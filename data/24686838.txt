Even more so in home solutions whether they are DIY or off the shelf.<p>Why? Because storing a single copy of your data on a single local RAID array doesn&#x27;t protect you from disasters such as fire, theft, accidental fluid spills, small children&#x2F;pets, a power surge after a lightning strike, flooding, and so on. Basically, a lot of the stuff you&#x27;d fine in your home insurance policy.<p>RAID doesn&#x27;t guarantee data integrity either. You lost data after an unintended deletion or corruption by some computer program? RAID won&#x27;t help you get your data back any more then a single disk scenario would. If the original file got overwritten and mirrored across the array, and all you had was that one copy, you won&#x27;t be able to go back to that original.<p>A more exceptional scenario would be a drive silently failing and RAID happily mirroring corrupted data across the entire array. Unless you use a filesystem that implements checksums - like ZFS - you wouldn&#x27;t notice this unless it was too late.

I think there&#x27;s merit in using RAID when it comes to convenience and availability. Like, your data remaining available when you experience a sudden disk failure, and not having to spend hours or days getting everything back on line again.<p>I&#x27;d say that RAID and backups are complementary.<p>So, what about backups then? The 3-2-1 backup strategy is a good start: 3 copies, 2 local, 1 physically remote. That could be as simple as copying your drives every week to a separate HD or SSD drive, and every month to another separate drive which is safely stored outside of your home, i.e. a family member, friend, or at the bank.<p>You could step it up a notch and choose to rsync your data across two connected drives, while rsync a third copy to specialized cloud storage service such as Borgbackup or Wasabi. Add in scripts that perform regular checksums control and reports the results daily and you&#x27;ve got a pretty solid solution.<p>The final step is looking at your data and differentiating between the stuff you absolutely can&#x27;t afford to lose (e.g. family albums) and the stuff you may afford to lose (e.g. software downloads). The goal here is to calculate the costs associated with required storage volume and bandwidth, and land on an appropriate backup solution that matches your budget and your needs.<p>Finally, that&#x27;s just safeguarding your data in the present and short term future. Neither RAID or backups are a long term preservation strategy. Which is a whole other can of worms, including such challenges as migrating obsolete data formats (Yeah, I have WordPerfect 5 and AutoCAD files in my own personal archive), or dealing with obsolete hardware I&#x2F;O (Yeah, I have a bunch of old IDE drives in a cardboard box for which I had to buy an I&#x2F;O converter).')
