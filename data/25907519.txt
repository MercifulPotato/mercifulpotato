The reason why everyone is talking about the C2s is that pretty much every other machine is crap. The forces pulling on these machines are substantive and concept managed to make a machine that held up over time, unlike the others. So I hope you guys made those things sturdy enough.</i><p>Robustness isn&#x27;t the only reason C2s are considered the best. Unlike all the cheap brands, Concept2 have very accurately measured the moment of inertia of their flywheel and have an exacting manufacturing process that ensures it stays true.<p>As a result, the power data you see on the screen is an accurate measure of the work you&#x27;re doing.<p>Most (not all) machines guesstimate it in comparison. You can just go with HR if you want, but don&#x27;t pretend you can compare any other figures sensibly with a C2.<p>Point of note: the &quot;distance&quot; figure on a C2 is based on what a coxless four would have covered under the same power.')
