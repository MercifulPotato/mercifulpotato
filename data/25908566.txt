I voted on a Dominion machine this year. It prints out a full size piece of paper on thick stock with big font saying who you&#x27;re voting for. You then have to carry that piece of paper to the ballot counting machine and stand in line for a minute before it&#x27;s your turn to put your vote in the counter. The piece of paper isn&#x27;t a receipt, it&#x27;s your actual ballot. In the case of the elections this year, all of those were manually hand counted as well as being electronically counted and the counts were identical.')
