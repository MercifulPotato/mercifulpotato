I&#x27;m not saying you are lying. I didn&#x27;t watch it properly so I may have missed it.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s a bit n√§ive to not see this as anti-government propaganda.<p>I don&#x27;t know what that means. Are you saying that something in the video is untrue or just that it contains facts that make the US government look bad? Would you describe a similar video criticizing an enemy of the US government (whether another government, terrorist organisation, or something else) in the same way?<p>&gt; Youtube&#x27;s goals is not the same as the authors<p>I think the problem here is if YouTube&#x27;s goal is to help the government who (according to the author) is Google&#x27;s customer. YouTube is under no obligation to do anything to help spread the author&#x27;s video, but they should definitely be criticised for working with an organisation committing horrible abuses and acts of violence.')
