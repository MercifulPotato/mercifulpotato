Whatever the paper is doing is not describing any kind of computational process. It&#x27;s a mille-feuille of semi-rigorous mathematical abstraction that sounds far more like a kind of liturgical incantation than a description of the software our universe is running.<p>That&#x27;s not to say it is definitely not useful! It could be that, for some bizarre reason, reading the mathematical tea leaves of our current incomplete (and incoherent) theories might well yield insight into post-quantum physics. I do doubt it though.')
