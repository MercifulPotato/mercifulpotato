It doesn’t help anyone. If Robinhood is engaged in fraud or lying to their customers they should be forced to admit guilt and all the consequences from this. All this is is a slap on the wrist and political theater and I’m sick of it. I want some real teeth even if it results in less fine being paid. Or have them pay a crippling fine, one that takes away most of their cash. Something with meaning, not a meaningless fine')
