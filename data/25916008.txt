Between these two types of transactions, there are participants that are constantly estimating the value of these share.   If the price of the share deviates too far from what the company <i>thinks</i> it&#x27;s worth, it will actually trigger one of those two events.<p>Options are just another more efficient mechanism to make these estimations on a specific timeframe.  They allow traders to have a very specific thesis on what is mispriced and place a trade on it.<p>Without these trades, the market would lack liquidity, and companies would see an increase in their cost of new capital - which is bad for everyone because it means companies wouldn&#x27;t invest in growth, equipment purchases, new jobs, etc...')
