Some items were able to be repaired without impacting the budget by subcontractors that were already coming in to do other things. Other things we didn&#x27;t care enough about to make a fuss over (like the roof line not matching up right on the back side of the house, where no one will ever notice). Some things we asked her to fix at her expense.<p>We were very aware that big projects, be they software or home construction, don&#x27;t ever go perfectly, so we made a conscious effort to stay calm and solution-oriented through the entire multi-year process. We came in very slightly under budget, and things that need to get addressed are getting addressed, whereas a lawsuit would have turned things adversarial very quickly.')
