With higher market share the malware will come.<p>&gt; No bullshit forced updates when the OS feels like it.<p>True, but that also means you&#x27;re going to end up with a lot more botnet nodes out there because people will never update. Or they&#x27;ll never update and still complain things are not working.<p>&gt; No phoning home with you being unable to launch an app when your manufacturer&#x27;s server is slow.<p>I hear you, but this doesn&#x27;t happen enough for anybody to care. People would be more fet up by Facebook downtime.<p>&gt; No shuffling about trying to install drivers for a thousand components before your computer is usable.<p>Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but Linux drivers still can require endless faffing about. The biggie is that distros won&#x27;t distribute nonfree drivers by default, for ideological reasons.
