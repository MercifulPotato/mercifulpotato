However, using external SDRAM increases the complexity of the hardware significantly, which takes away a bit of the elegance and simplicity of Wirth&#x27;s original RISC5 FPGA system. Wirth&#x27;s system used a Xilinx Spartan 3 board with 1 MB of 32 bit wide fast asynchronous SRAM (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;multicores.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;small-is-beautiful.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;multicores.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;small-is-beautiful.html</a>).<p>Unfortunately, FPGA boards with 32 bit wide SRAM are really hard to find nowadays, especially those supported by SymbiFlow...')
