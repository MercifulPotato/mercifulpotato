Back when dinosaurs walked the earth, I moved from one system language (Ada) to C and, in a couple of months, I was writing device drivers. I have struggled with Rust on hobby projects for a few years and have given it up 3 times -- this is despite having 18 years of C++ experience.<p>I would not say that you are wrong, just that this statement about the learning curve is not true for everyone.')
