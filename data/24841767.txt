The first novel is one of the true greats of the field, the kind where you can feel the existence of a deeper history and crave to know more. Only Tolkien did it better, and he only by being obsessive about it. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s really hard to actually fulfill the reader&#x27;s craving without disappointing them.<p>Friends have pushed me to read the rest of the Dune books, but I&#x27;m reluctant. Not because the story is unexpected -- that sounds promising, actually -- but because if it&#x27;s not well-written, it would feel like it taints them gem I already know.')
