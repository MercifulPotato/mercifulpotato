Potential &quot;yay&quot; and &quot;nay&quot; votes are both term-limited, so the &quot;inexperience&quot; should cancel out?<p>The fear of rocking the boat effects anyone that, well, will live longer. Whether you are looking for continued perks&#x2F;bribes in office, a cushy lobbying job after, or simply don&#x27;t want to make enemies before your political next move, the perverse incentives are still there.<p>Perhaps a better thing to do would be to let the populace force votes on a daily basis (with queuing &#x2F; anti DOS measures, of course), so the representatives have to go on the record one way or another, and can&#x27;t hide behind inaction.')
