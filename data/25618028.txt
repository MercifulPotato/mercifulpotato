The poster you originally replied to was only talking about the email case, so your response is contextualized in that case already.<p>If you original post had been &quot;Yeah, I agree. That would make sense as a CI rule that you run, not as a scanner someone else runs&quot; then you wouldn&#x27;t have gotten any pushback, but your post was strongly implying a position you apparently don&#x27;t hold.')
