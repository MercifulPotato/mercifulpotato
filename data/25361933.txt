Item(by='hiq', descendants=None, kids=[25362580, 25362606], score=None, time=1607538474, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25360043, text='&gt; In EM&#x27;s case, I suspect he spends more time business-traveling than at home anyway, so it would be pretty difficult to prove which of his houses he &quot;lives&quot; in.<p>I&#x27;m not sure about that. I think in these high profile cases tax authorities are more inclined to look into it given how much money there is in the balance. And it&#x27;s somewhat easier to track people like EM precisely because of their lifestyles: flights would be paid by his companies which would keep receipts for a few years, they would interact with other people from the company in certain location and have a shared calendar, including meeting locations.')
