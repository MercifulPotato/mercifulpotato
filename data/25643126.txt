It is inherent. Here is the example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MBnnXbOM5S4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MBnnXbOM5S4</a> — if you want to defeat QM, attack its wave-part.<p>It would be nice to have much better (deterministic, measurable) physics, but some properties just emerge from a fundamental level and you can’t do much about it (monster group etc). Nature and maths don’t care about our confusion and convenience.<p>&gt;should have refuted it and looked for something better instead<p>Afaik, the time when theories were driven by ideas is over. Today it’s petabytes of data that you can’t really argue with over a mailbox, only discuss. (I’m just a layman physicist with deep interest, but shallow understanding, so please don’t quote me on any of this)')
