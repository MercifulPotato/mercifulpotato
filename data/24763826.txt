It also has to have state.<p>Without state the whole argument falls apart.<p>&gt; But the notion is not far from the bone-headed simplicity of early AI and machine translation efforts.<p>As someone who studied Machine Learning 20 years ago, could you be a bit more respectful please?<p>First, pretty much nobody (working on serious ML) in that era thought they were going to build anything <i>actually</i> intelligent, conscious, or thinking.<p>Second, in this supposed era of boneheaded simplicity, a LOT of foundational stuff we use in today&#x27;s AI was discovered and written.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how familiar you are with AI history, to name an example, we already were working on neural nets and discovered error backpropagation in the 70s&#x2F;80s. Then came a <i>long</i> period during which neural nets somehow didn&#x27;t really perform very well, and ML was looking at completely different types of classification algorithms (what&#x27;s happening with SVMs today?).<p>If we had stopped there, you might have lumped in the early perceptron with the &quot;boneheaded simplicity&quot;.<p>But instead we developed batch normalisation and a bunch of other techniques, and now neural nets are state of the art.')
