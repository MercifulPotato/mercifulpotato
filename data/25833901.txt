What was the plan to establish the new government? Who was the leader? The guy with the horns? The ex-president who didn&#x27;t care less about the incident, and called for people going home?<p>And it was only deadly because in the US people are trigger happy, and even getting out of your car, unarmed, to a traffic cop, can be deadly. Even so, from what I read a guard was killed in an altercation with the mob, and a protestor was shot by police. A few others had &quot;medical emergencies&quot;.<p>Pearl clutching aside, I wouldn&#x27;t even call it a &quot;violent protest&quot;, much less a coup...')
