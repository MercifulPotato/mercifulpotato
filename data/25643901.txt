Sounds harsh but it&#x27;s true. This is a website that was built with no consideration of truly providing value to visitors.<p>The website is another run of the mill affiliate website built with the sole purpose of making the owner some money.<p>The same old rubbish &quot;here are 5-10 products that we&#x27;ve selected because we will make money.&quot; that other websites do - Where is the website actually helping or providing the visitors any value? It isn&#x27;t.<p>The only research they seem to do on products is 1) Will I get commission if I send customers to it 2) Is it cheap. 3) Do the reviews look fake&#x2F;real.<p>That&#x27;s not helping anyone and provides no value. Hence why Google removed it&#x27;s ranking. It provides literally no value or true content to visitors. Their product lists are all &quot;The Best X products&quot; - Best based on what? They&#x27;re not buying the products and actually checking their good, they&#x27;re just pulling products out of their backside from Amazon&#x2F;Bestbuy.<p>How can this website honest create hundreds of &quot;Best X products&quot;, without even using&#x2F;testing any of them and think they&#x27;ve providing value to customers? The owner is kidding himself.')
