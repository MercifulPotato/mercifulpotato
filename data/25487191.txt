I think the intent of the article is to highlight just how <i>much</i> we are distracting ourselves and in this we’re missing out on a very valuable facet of our lives which is our own thoughts. Taking a distracted, nonjudgmental view of our own thoughts can be powerful.<p>Distraction from time to time is fine but that’s not what we’re doing. We’re in a constant state of distraction. We’re missing out on one of the greatest resources available to us: our own minds.')
