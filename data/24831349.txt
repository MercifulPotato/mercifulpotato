No one asked me what high school I was attending&#x2F;had attended), but for post-college, no one ever asked me about high school.<p>As to getting into college, I had to take the SATs, same as everyone. I did better than most. I started at community college (which I believe everyone should do, both because financially it makes sense, and because it helps acclimate you to the realities involved. For home&#x2F;unschoolers, having deadlines and having to learn to &#x27;work the system&#x27; are both necessary), then went to university. Graduated highest honors.')
