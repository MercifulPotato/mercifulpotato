And the problem is, you apparently fall into the very category of: seeking truth isn&#x27;t important, believing what you want is.  Because you literally just fabricated a story to support Trump that&#x27;s easily disproven by the very link you&#x27;re commenting about.<p>Had you actually watched the videos: no, every single one of those people did not attempt to rush the stage, that happened exactly once.  And in that occurrence he didn&#x27;t even call for violence until the NEXT DAY, when a normal Presidential candidate would&#x27;ve had time to gather themselves and act like an adult...  No, every single one was not arrested by secret service.<p>He spent MONTHS telling his supporters that the election was &quot;stolen from them&quot; and that they need to &quot;fight like real patriots&quot;, but again, because you support him that&#x27;s not a call for violence.  Nevermind the end result: the violence he called for - you just don&#x27;t agree that&#x27;s what he wanted.  Which of course is why he refused to condemn it while it was happening, and took a full day to say anything meaningful after every one of his political allies condemned him.')
