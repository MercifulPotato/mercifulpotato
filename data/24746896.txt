Often a whole state, in bigger state sizable portion of it<p>- The idea of a small town - or a college - police having their own SWAT team is completely foreign<p>- Normal police is already much more intensively trained than in the US. SWAT adds to this. SWAT is treated as expensive specialists, not a part time duty a cop can do on the side<p>As an example, I studied in Aachen. Aachen has no SWAT team. When one was needed it would come from Cologne (usually) or Düsseldorf. Both an hour drive away.<p>Now there are many structural differences between the US and Germany that you can‘t lift-and-ship the German approach to policing to the US but it’s disingenuous to imply German police is as militarized as American police because it also have SWAT teams.')
