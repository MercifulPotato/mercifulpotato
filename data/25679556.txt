Reason is unreleased content, for example, the new iPhone commercial or a new Marvel movie that hasn&#x27;t been announced yet.<p>&gt; Did you have to audit all the vendor code? If so, how much time was spent on that?<p>Yes, from days to weeks. It was a separate department.<p>&gt; Do you think this kind of practices actually improve any security?<p>Yes, if your computers do not touch the internet and you do not have physical access to the device then you cannot easily leak content.<p>I am sure someone could take their phones outs and picture every screen of what they were working on.. but it is a bigger barrier.<p>&gt; If there is no internet, how do you search for a solution to an immediate problem or look up documentation?<p>We had a separate computer (a windows box served through guacamole) that we could search things.<p>&gt; How is the testing culture like in these orgs?<p>Nothing too different from others, the only real big difference is that you cannot reach to the internet from where you&#x27;re developing software.')
