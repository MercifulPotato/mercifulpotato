Sqlite is the posterchild of careful testing in a C codebase, and they had a serious CVE last year. Realistically, the vast majority of C and C++ projects have more bugs than that, even if they&#x27;re staffed by experts who take security seriously.<p>But I agree with you about the cost-benefit analysis. It&#x27;s not very often that security issues destroy an entire company, and trying to rewrite a large codebase might be existentially riskier more often than not.')
