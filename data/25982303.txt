Love the recent surge in people thinking deeply about data, so thank you for your efforts to date.<p>All of the topics in the TOC look... interesting? I guess.  But here&#x27;s some blunt feedback: why would I want to learn this?  Your language is all about changing the way you think - but that sounds like a LOT of work.  Why would I want to do that?  There&#x27;s a lot of description of steak here, very little sizzle.<p>I may be overindexing, but it feels like you&#x27;re falling into a hype trap.  When I&#x27;m learning something new, I don&#x27;t want to &quot;disrupt&quot; my mental models!  That is very painful, and has all kinds of knock-on consequences.  Will I have to throw away things I&#x27;m working on now?  Will I still be able to communicate with people doing things the old way?  Etc.<p>My point isn&#x27;t to get specific answers, it&#x27;s to express my emotional reaction to your leading copy.  Also, it hits my ego a bit because it implies how I&#x27;ve been thinking about things is <i>totally wrong</i>.<p>The tone also implies some very strong claims.  Even if I accept that your way is clearly superior, that assumes I can learn your models as well as I know my own.  Realistically, I maybe absorb 80% of a concept, even after deep study.<p>If I take 80% of a new mental model that requires me to throw away old ones, I would be very confused.  That makes me reluctant to try this, especially since it&#x27;s not clear yet that your models are even workable.  (Whereas my old ways of thinking, even if not &quot;modern&quot;, have yielded a pretty good career.)<p>My suggestion: focus on attaching new concepts to existing scaffolding, rather than asking users to throw away what they knew before.  That&#x27;s bold marketing copy, but sets up your content for failure.  Let&#x27;s build something off what I know, and eventually pull a Theseus&#x27; ship of knowledge, rather than burning my ships as soon as I reach your shores.<p>Sorry for the stream of consciousness.  Happy to chat more (after this week) if you want me to reach out.')
