Item(by='boudin', descendants=None, kids=[24885808, 24890705, 24886414, 24885840], score=None, time=1603627163, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24885512, text='Firefox native support is pretty much here already (I&#x27;ve been using it for quite a time now and it works really well). The only missing piece that is not merged yet is screen sharing unfortunately. It&#x27;s available on Fedora&#x27;s Firefox build.<p>All GTK3 apps runs well on Wayland too.\nQt apps runs well but it doesn&#x27;t feel as polished (I mainly have issues when I use 2 screen with different scaling).<p>The last big things are chromium and electron. Once those have ozone merged and enabled in stable, it&#x27;s gonna be a massive step forward. Those are the last apps I can&#x27;t run natively on wayland. Ozone is in the beta branches now so, hopefully, it will happen next year.<p>After, it&#x27;s not that much of a big deal to run those on xwayland as long there&#x27;s no scaling. As soon as you&#x27;re on a hidpi screen or just use scaling, it&#x27;s when it becomes blurry and is quite annoying.\nI personally still prefer wayland over x because the experience is just better. No flickering, it&#x27;s smooth and feels more snappy.')
