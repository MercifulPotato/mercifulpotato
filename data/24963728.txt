In other words, they are part of a separate infinite &quot;chain&quot; of numbers that &quot;looks like&quot; the integers (negative, zero, and positive), but is not the same as the chain of numbers that starts from zero and is the &quot;standard&quot; natural numbers. The first-order axioms of arithmetic cannot rule out the existence of such chains; those axioms imply that there is a chain that starts from zero (the &quot;standard&quot; natural numbers), but they cannot prove that it is the <i>only</i> chain that exists.')
