And almost 70% of those several hundreds who die in cycling accidents are over 65, people who are much more likely to lose their balance and are more sensitive to an impact, meaning a bit of protection would have gone a long way. That&#x27;s just fatalities, think of all the non-fatal accidents, and how may of the 6000 people hospitalized each year just for unilateral accidents (with bollards or lamp-posts) need an MRI because they bumped their head. The numbers don&#x27;t get better without adding protection because according to SWOV almost 80% of cycling accidents are unilateral or between cyclists.<p>But there&#x27;s a cultural opposition to helmets in many countries, chief among reasons being that &quot;helmets don&#x27;t look good&quot; and &quot;real cyclists don&#x27;t need one&quot;. If you didn&#x27;t wear one your whole life, you won&#x27;t start at 65.')
