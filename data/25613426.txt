At least at some point, absolutely no haskell based apps would run, since their stdlib used some syscall which WSL1 did not implement. Broke pandoc for me. Stopped bothering with WSL1 there and then.<p>Other issues which colleagues encountered include abysmal performance and broken python installations as PATHs and other environment details are wildly mixed inside WSL.<p>I just donâ€™t understand why some people were seemingly happy with WSL1, there were so many rough edges. WSL2 is much much better in my experience, on virtually all fronts.')
