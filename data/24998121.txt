If you can find a better way to communicate about the meeting topic than a meeting then suggest it. It&#x27;s everyone&#x27;s job to make sure meetings are as good as they can be. If you hate meetings, you&#x27;re probably in lots of meetings which are badly run, or don&#x27;t provide consistent and valuable outcomes. The solution isn&#x27;t to be in less meetings, it&#x27;s to make the meetings better.<p>Once you spend time making meetings as good as they can be, it becomes easy to figure out the ones where there&#x27;s a lot more input than outcome. At that point no one will mind if that meeting doesn&#x27;t happen or gets questioned.<p>If you find yourself in a lot of adhoc meetings, then it&#x27;s likely a symptom that some other communication forms aren&#x27;t providing high enough signal. Again, that&#x27;s a thing anyone can put energy into improving.<p>Agendas, goals, focus, and good time keeping are all things that can be done to improve the outcomes of a meeting. They just require a bit of effort.')
