Item(by='cthalupa', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605197465, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25068528, text='We can agree both things are bad.<p>People shouldn&#x27;t use jokes as a cover for racism, sexism, etc. We know people do this. We should do things to stop it. No one is saying you can&#x27;t make whatever jokes you like in private with people you know won&#x27;t be offended, but they are saying that those jokes can be harmful to people they want to have in their community, and that you can&#x27;t say them in that community. It&#x27;s their right to do so.<p>People also shouldn&#x27;t try to get others fired over things like people talking about dongles and forking, assuming they&#x27;re actually talking about dongles and forking. If someone approaches you and makes a joke about how they want to fork you with their dongle, well, it&#x27;s pretty obvious what they mean. If you overhear someone talking and hear the words fork and dongle, well, it&#x27;s not so obvious and we probably shouldn&#x27;t get them fired.<p>That being said, it sounds like the joke was at least in part actually a sexually charged joke about a &quot;big dongle&quot; - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=5398681" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=5398681</a> - though the forking seems to have not been intended to be sexually charged. This is perhaps another reason that people should consider their words - if you just made a joke about a &quot;big dongle&quot; and then immediately say &quot;I&#x27;d fork his repo,&quot; there&#x27;s a chance it&#x27;s going to be interpreted in a sexual manner because of the context.<p>Making a joke about &quot;big dongles&quot; in public is probably not something you should do. Someone being offended doesn&#x27;t automatically mean they&#x27;re right, but it&#x27;s also not a high bar to not make dick jokes around thousands of other people that you don&#x27;t know and don&#x27;t know how they&#x27;ll take it.')
