No thought, no effort, just use it.<p>If you want to go all crazy and start injecting values into your config in your unit tests, great to have that option, you should have that option. But you&#x27;re the one who should be scrabbling around writing tons of extra boilerplate code, not me.<p>But I just want to set a filepath, that&#x27;s probably never going to change, but might one day. Or an email address to send a weekly summary email to. Or some settings on paging that the client might change their mind about once and I don&#x27;t want to have to rebuild the project.<p>The vast majority of config settings are just cover your ass in case you need to one day change this value. They don&#x27;t need to be tested.<p>So it not the &quot;normal&quot; path to need to test config values. It&#x27;s not the path the vast majority of programmers need.')
