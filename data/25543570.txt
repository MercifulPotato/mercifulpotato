Palantir had CIA as the only client for years. Was “adopted” in Greece right after Pompeo’s visit. A coincidence? Maybe. The company and the CEO have a questionable reputation and ideas about things I value like “democracy”, it was given to the Greek state for “free” apparently and in 2020 we all know what “free” means. To top it all, Palantir has already being accused of selling public records data obtained by police departments in US states to private corporations. So for all we know they are just funneling data to the CIA and selling data to private corporations while providing trivial “big data” services to governments.<p>By the way, the EU is monitoring Palantir’s presence in Europe. There is feeling that Palantir’a services are “planted” rather than “requested”.<p>Before Snowden one could argue these are wild conspiracies, post-Snowden, I cannot think of a reason for a government to accept official spyware on its digital soil other than lack of sovereignty.<p>Would China and Russia accept Palantir as a big data analysis system to fight COVID?')
