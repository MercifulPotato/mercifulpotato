It&#x27;s just as dumb (if not dumber) than chrome, and serves no purpose whatsoever without addons.<p>I also don&#x27;t get the point of limiting addons to a vetted whitelist. I feared this would be the case since they introduced signing requirements, and that&#x27;s precisely what happened. I waited a bit, but I completely lost interest since the new mobile redesign which also destroyed the UI usability for me.<p>Mozilla will need to do a complete turn-around to get me back on mobile.')
