(FWIW, I would totally accept that I don&#x27;t need that on a bug tracker and I probably am actually happier without it, but I can at least see the premise being interesting... being able to see point changes or user votes or comments as they happen; I do appreciate the extent to which GitHub&#x27;s issue tracker automatically updates).')
