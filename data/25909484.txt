At least I do this if I don&#x27;t pay attention. By &quot;lock up&quot; I mean that the jaw is simultaneosly pulled down by muscles and pulled up by the masseter. Then at night, the downward pulling muscles relax, and the upward pulling muscles (masseter) wins, and the actual teeth grinding occurs.')
