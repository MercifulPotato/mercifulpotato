But that&#x27;s something the kinds of people who hang out on GitHub don&#x27;t seem to give two shits about.  Any time a project hosted on GitHub is cloned, chances are high that if you try to open the README, it&#x27;s going to be filled with line noise that effectively means you <i>must</i> use the rendered view.  It&#x27;s no wonder things like building native support for markdown rendering into apps like VSCode are so desirable.  Project authors are treating it like an intermediate form that no one is really ever supposed to look at unless they&#x27;re going into the markdown to add&#x2F;fix&#x2F;change something just before submitting a pull request.')
