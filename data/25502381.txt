They let math dictate &quot;reality&quot; instead of vice-versa.  And then they taught it in the schools as theory at first, and now seemingly as fact.<p>Tesla challenged the notion of &quot;curved spacetime&quot; as illogical.  People should have listened to him.<p>Edwin Hubble, who discovered redshift disparity, in his later life questioned expansion as the cause.  People should have listened to him.<p>Many &quot;alternative&quot; physicists over the years and still today deny expansion, dark, matter, dark energy, black holes, and other imaginary phenomena that were invented to patch mis-matches between observations and mathematical predictions.<p>But its like spitting in the wind against the force of inertia as everyone gets taught these fantasies in school as though they are fact.<p>Do yourself a favor and look into some alternative cosmology theories.  I&#x27;ve posted a list elsewhere in this thread.')
