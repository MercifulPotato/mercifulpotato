The North is warmer and the South colder, especially when you go to the South of the South island. New Zealand is extremely diverse in nature, you have everything from tropical jungles, to sand dunes, volcanoes, glaciers and amazing mountains. The North island is more populated than the South, but in comparison to the US or UK the whole of New Zealand is very sparsely populated. The country has more sheep than human and is geographically extremely isolated when you think that the closest neighbour is Australia which is a 4 hour flight and even Australia is extremely isolated when you compare it to an international melting pot like the UK. Like with everything in life this has pros and cons. Overall it&#x27;s a beautiful place to be, stable and good economy, great work&#x2F;life balance, amazing outdoor opportunities and a friendly culture. If New Zealand wasn&#x27;t so far away from everyone else then I&#x27;d consider moving there myself, but not being able to quickly jump on a two hour flight to see old friends and family is a huge problem, especially when people get older they seem to value their relationship to friends and family increasingly more.')
