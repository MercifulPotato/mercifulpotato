To the point that I was shocked upon going overseas and finding places <i>without</i> them. There’s numerous YouTube videos of foreigners showing it off when they visit Australia.<p>The beep comes from behind a steel panel just under the button for the lights too, so if you’re both blind and deaf you can put your finger on it to feel the pulses of the tone.<p>Fun fact: Billie Ellish sampled it for the chorus of “Bad Guy”. Trance DJ Giuseppe Ottaviani also made a track prominately featuring it, “Crossing Lights”.')
