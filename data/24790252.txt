Graphics processing works on GPUs because it&#x27;s a massively parallel task.  With audio, increasing buffer sizes for more parallel processing will inherently increase latency.  And if you&#x27;re not dealing with massive buffers, then you&#x27;re just shipping data over to the GPU for no good reason.')
