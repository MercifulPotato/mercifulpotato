It may be more accurate to think of a neuron as a small processor as opposed to a dumb electrical component for example.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quantamagazine.org&#x2F;neural-dendrites-reveal-their-computational-power-20200114&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quantamagazine.org&#x2F;neural-dendrites-reveal-their...</a><p>So in brief your argument is that despite not knowing enough about the brain to duplicate it we built a machine that is vastly simpler than it by accident and the only people that have caught on is layman on hacker news.')
