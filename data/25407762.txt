It&#x27;s shameful.<p><i>One of the &quot;sides&quot; here has been trying to &quot;cancel&quot; the votes of 80 million Americans to install a permanent autocratic government.</i><p>And the other side has spent 4 years trying to cancel a President they don&#x27;t like elected by people they don&#x27;t like.<p>See how we can both do that?<p>I think that&#x27;s a red herring attempt to drag the topic away from the original point of social and cultural persecution.<p>It&#x27;s extraordinary the way some people will do everything they can to deny the obvious - that the worst representatives of the left today are doing exactly the same as the right wing McCarthyites of yore.<p>It&#x27;s long past time for those of us on the left who genuinely claim liberal values to own it.')
