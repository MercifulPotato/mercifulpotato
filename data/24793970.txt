The rating system doesn&#x27;t mean the same thing to everyone, and it is easily faked.  Companies are incentivized to sell control over reviews to the parties being affected by the free crowd sourced reviews.  Think of yelp and the people who give a restaurant 2 stars because another patrons child was crying.  Or the onslaught of faked Amazon reviews.<p>At a previous company, we had someone whose entire job was to talk to coworkers about what they posted on social media, getting good reviews for the shit company online, etc.  The most shocking thing about this post to me is how many people actually valued the reviews on Glassdoor.  Not sure if I&#x27;m too pessimistic&#x2F;skeptical about this, or if others aren&#x27;t pessimistic&#x2F;skeptical enough.')
