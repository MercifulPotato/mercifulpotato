This comes with experience from times where Google Maps wasn&#x27;t so ubiquitous, and that insane Knowledge test.<p>However, everything else I dislike with black cabs. I mostly use Uber and when the main route is problematic, the driver focuses on his phone more than on the road, and that&#x27;s alright. At least they are polite and don&#x27;t try to rip me off like too many black cabs tried to.')
