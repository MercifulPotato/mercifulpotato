The people needing toilets aren&#x27;t particularly worried about using one. The root of the problem is sending a message that it won&#x27;t be enforced, so people literally have no reason not to do it.<p>Amazingly enough, I think last year or the year before, SF announced they wouldn&#x27;t enforce &quot;quality of life&quot; crimes, which include outside urination and defecation. Naturally this will be noticed by those doing it, and eventually it allows people outside to gather in large groups because they don&#x27;t have to worry about how to relieve themselves.<p>Finding a toilet isn&#x27;t impossible, but it does require holding yourself until you do find one. For people with no home, this is extra work, but we should all agree is extra work they should be forced to do, instead of treating them like animals with no agency of their own, and pretending somehow the problem doesn&#x27;t include their decisions and the authorities&#x27; incentives.')
