Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[25625441], score=None, time=1609707945, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25625116, text='No, the F22 has much better capabilities than the F35, and many of them are kept secret.<p>The F22 is designed to be the &#x27;Uber Alpha&#x27; of the Skies and to have no peer. It&#x27;s made in the USA and is not sold to allies.<p>The F35 is a &#x27;secondary 5th gen fighter. Cheaper, a little less stealthy, sometimes a little more purpose fit, designed to be exported to allies.<p>The packages on these planes are getting more and more powerful, and to some extent, they are mattering more and more to the point where the plane itself is less of what matters.<p>The need for supporting electronic warfare will only increase, even as the capability of individual units increases.<p>FYI - it&#x27;s really hard to tell how much more powerful the F22 is because it&#x27;s much more secret than F35, results are not always published, and they are full of assumptions about pretend scenarios.<p>For example, the stealth aspects are nebulous, small factors make a big difference, and radar systems are always improving.<p>Edit: missed the obvious and that is F22 is very specifically an early stage A2A focus role, not so much ground attack, whereas F35 will probably spend most of it&#x27;s life in those kinds of roles. F22 is &#x27;own the skies&#x27; F35 is then &#x27;use the sky&#x27;.')
