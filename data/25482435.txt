A worker depends on continually selling his labor-power to survive. He can&#x27;t do that if he gets sick or injured, if he gets laid off, if his area of expertise gets automated out of existence, etc. When an investor makes an investment all he risks is maybe eventually having to become a worker (only a real potential for small investors and small business owners).')
