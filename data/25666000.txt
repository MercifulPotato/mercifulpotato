For example, an update about the subject of this thread has articles from CNN, Reuters, and New York Post in those respective categories.  Looks like the &quot;top stories&quot; are presented with a &quot;headline roundup&quot;, presumably written by an AllSides person, which (judging from two examples) tends to say things like &quot;Left-rated outlets were more likely to highlight [...]; Right-rated outlets featured [...]&quot;.  There are also three general feeds of &quot;News from the (Left|Center|Right)&quot; in parallel at the bottom.<p>This seems at least like the type of experiment that would be worth trying.')
