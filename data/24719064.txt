We see feature stores doing much more than becoming just another silo for ML, but instead a way to get a real-time, centralized view of fragmented data that has to either be federated or put in a data lake to to be queried together. I share more of my thoughts in this blog post: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.molecula.com&#x2F;why-moleculas-feature-based-approach-to-big-data-access-is-the-future&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.molecula.com&#x2F;why-moleculas-feature-based-approac...</a>\nMolecula is based on the OSS platform Pilosa (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pilosa.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pilosa.com&#x2F;</a>) and both Pilosa and Molecula are transitioning to reposition as feature stores over the coming months. Doing machine-scale analytics and ML on the data itself will be a thing of the past.')
