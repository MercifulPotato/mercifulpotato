As an example I got my partner an iPhone SE in 2016 and it&#x27;s still working perfectly, it even still looks good. Not only is it still getting updates, it runs the latest iOS. The original pixel came out the same year and cost hundreds more, less support, and my experience has has been disappointing in regards of hardware quality.<p>Just look at the used market and compare Pixels and iPhones released at the same time and about the same price. iPhones sell for about 2x vs google phones.')
