Which would not make it a hard problem at all but it could be pretty pointless depending on how many containers go overboard in a typical &quot;lost container&quot; event.<p>Also, consider that from the point of view of the people loading the ship, it&#x27;s all insured.  And if you didn&#x27;t get the insurance then you understand the risk.  Why would they care?  They aren&#x27;t the insurance company.  What&#x27;s their incentive?')
