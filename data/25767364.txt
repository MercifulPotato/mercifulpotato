I switched out my trusty old Microtik AC router for a combination of a Unifi AP AC Pro and UniFi Security Gateway in order to get a bit more distance, and performance and reliability has been shoddy.<p>I eventually got a TP-Link WiFi 6 AX3000, and it&#x27;s been super solid, significantly faster, and required almost zero manual setup. The Unifi itself required a PoE adapter and a router, and of course needs the controller application to do anything.<p>(The controller app with its easily-corrupted and hard-to-upgrade MongoDB database is perhaps the worst part of it. My <i>two</i> devices occasionally required re-&quot;adopting&quot; for no discernible reason. I was unable to upgrade the controller at one point because apparently (?) they stopped bundling MongoDB, and the controller refused to use the version I installed manually. Of course, this breakage happened after the software updated, so the only way to fix it was by restoring the old version and database files from backups.)<p>Maybe Ubiquiti products make more sense when you need dozens of access points across a big building, but definitely not in a small city apartment.')
