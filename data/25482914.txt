People are expensive.<p>Except that you still need the people, because most of the labor isn&#x27;t putting the hardware in the rack, it&#x27;s managing the software which you have to do regardless of where the hardware is.<p>&gt; Besides that, procuring resources with your cloud provider is simply a matter of writing a yaml file.<p>That is no different than it is locally.<p>&gt; Not to mention the lack of an upfront investments and only paying for your resources you need instead of having hardware that you are spending money on because you have to have enough hardware to handle peak load.<p>But hardware is cheap, remember? And most companies don&#x27;t actually have large load variations.<p>&gt; But can you run a data center in multiple regions?<p>Obviously yes. Any company of non-trivial size would have multiple sites and could locate a host at more than one. This doesn&#x27;t even necessarily raise the price, because you already need enough machines to provide redundancy, so locating them at different sites doesn&#x27;t even require additional hardware, only locating some of the existing hardware at other sites.<p>This is also mostly overrated for companies smaller than that, because cloud providers have had company-wide outages at a frequency not all that much higher than site-wide outages for sites that have a reasonable level of redundancy.<p>&gt;  Besides that any cloud provider offers more than just a bunch of VMs. AWS alone has 260 services with an entire team of people keeping them patched and optimized.<p>This is only relevant if you&#x27;re using 260 different services and not just a bunch of VMs, and plenty of companies are using just a bunch of VMs.')
