I&#x27;ve been shipping software for over 30 years.<p>Shipping can be quite &quot;boring.&quot;<p>For example, I am about halfway through a social media app (90% of the way, if we include the backend).<p>The backend was written in PHP. I decided to do that, because it was an &quot;all-purpose&quot; open-source system, designed for low-budget orgs.<p>Also, I was already an experienced PHP programmer, and PHP is just fine as a server stack. It&#x27;s not crazy good, but it works great.<p>The frontend is being written in Swift, which some companies might consider &quot;edgy,&quot; but I&#x27;m using traditional UIKit, and storyboarding, which many folks would consider &quot;clunky&quot; (I&#x27;m supposed to use SwiftUI).<p>The thing is, is that SwiftUI is still trying on outfits, and the app is going to be very complex. I am not yet convinced that SwiftUI is &quot;ripe&quot; enough to do an app with the complexity I need.<p>That said, I want to learn SwiftUI this year, and explore its edges.')
