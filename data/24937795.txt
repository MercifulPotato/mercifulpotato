Item(by='mleo', descendants=None, kids=[24943807], score=None, time=1604017739, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24936564, text='Most consumers probably don&#x27;t know much about the transition to Apple Silicon.<p>However, this quarter included back-to-school timing and with kids still doing school from home, there were probably a larger number of parents that bought computers for kids.  Anecdotally, 2 of our kids used an 2013 11&quot; MacBook Air (old, low RAM) and 2015 15&quot; MacBook Pro (on-loan from employer) in the Spring.  When they weren&#x27;t going back to school, we were in a fortunate position to be able to purchase them 13&quot; MacBook Airs to continue school at home.  Other parents probably made due with what they had in the Spring and purchased something over the summer.  When I purchased at end of July, there was 2-3 week wait time to get them.<p>I knew that Apple Silicon was coming later this year, but the timing didn&#x27;t make sense to wait.  Back to my first point, most consumers probably are not aware that Apple Silicon is coming or why it matters and could not have made informed choice to buy now vs wait.<p>I predict next year&#x27;s sales will be flat or lower.')
