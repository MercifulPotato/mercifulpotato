They&#x27;re almost universally happier after their employer gives them a better tool with which to do the work. The jobs that automated&#x2F;AI equipment is replacing are <i>not good jobs.</i> Performing the same task for 90 minutes, much less an 8 hour shift, is awful on the body, and even worse on the mind. Humans don&#x27;t make great robots, and it&#x27;s not great to ask a human do a job that should be done by a robot.')
