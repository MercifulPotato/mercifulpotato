A lot of gotchas and surprising behavior. For example this:<p>&gt; To be more explicit: after calling zmq_send the socket may become readable (and vice versa) without triggering a read event on the file descriptor.<p>2. The library will assert internally without actually giving you any clues what did you do wrong as a user.<p>I would rather spend some extra time in development by using pure sockets rather than the stress of debugging problems, arising from the above, later.')
