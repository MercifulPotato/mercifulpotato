Item(by='Natsu', descendants=None, kids=[24844181], score=None, time=1603228325, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24839440, text='&gt; Who has copies of their text messages on their laptop?<p>Anyone with the My Phone app in Windows and a linked phone.<p>&gt; Who has PDF copies of emails?<p>Those look like they were created, e.g. with a PDF printer, from the originals.  They&#x27;ve now released Hunter&#x27;s signature on the repair form, as well, and claim to have phone calls from him calling about it.<p>So far the &quot;Russian disinfo&quot; campaign is without evidence of that, given that the ODNI says there&#x27;s no intelligence pointing to that and nothing but anonymous rumors thereof.  Doesn&#x27;t mean anything in these files is true, but some of the details match what we already know.<p>That said, we&#x27;ll have to wait and see.  I don&#x27;t think Steele&#x27;s primary Russian subsource is behind this one, though, but it could be like the original Dossier--a mix of salacious but unverifiable statements with true but innocuous statements.<p>Though I think Hunter with the meth pipe is already pretty damaging.  That aside, for the best for the public to know all about the future president &amp; his son&#x27;s Bursima dealings so that it cannot be used as blackmail in the future, no?')
