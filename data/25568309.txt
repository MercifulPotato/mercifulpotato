Specifically, all mainstream hardware has instructions that work the IEEE 754 way, so if you want to <i>not</i> propagate NaN, I believe you’ll need to either implement those operations manually, or check for NaN after every operation and convert it into an exception or panic or whatever. I’m not certain what the cost would be, being no compiler engineer or hand-coder of assembly, but I’m fairly confident that there is one. I suspect that cost may also be inordinate on various realistic workloads.<p>(Since you mention billion-dollar mistakes: you can remove null pointers from a language at no runtime cost, in a few different ways—e.g. require that types be explicitly nullable, or Rust-style Option&lt;T&gt; optimised to squeeze the None&#x2F;Some discriminant into any spare space in T, so that for sized T, &amp;T and Option&lt;&amp;T&gt; both take only one word.)')
