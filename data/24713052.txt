There aren&#x27;t that many Java APIs -- as the article says, it&#x27;s ~11k lines of definitions -- so Oracle is seeking ~$818k per line. Assuming Google&#x27;s lawyers predicted that there was some risk of a lawsuit like this, any engineering costs associated with redesigning the APIs would just be negligible compared to the legal risk.<p>One could argue that it is quite difficult to design a <i>good</i> API, but Java&#x27;s APIs are frankly full of mistakes: Date&#x2F;Calendar, immutable collections with no type safety, &quot;optional&quot; methods like Iterator.remove, etc. It wouldn&#x27;t take a team of world-class engineers to come up with something better with the benefit of hindsight.<p>On the other hand, developer familiarity and compatibility with existing Java libraries could have had a significant impact on Android&#x27;s adoption. I think that was what justified the legal risks.')
