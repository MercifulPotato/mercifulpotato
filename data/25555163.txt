It seems like not everyone would agree on what they are.<p>Otherwise it just seems like your position is essentially just a claim that because there is another country that you think is run better, there are some ideas that you don’t actually understand yourself, that could help.<p>Edit: you added a paragraph to your comment <i>after</i> I posted my reply.<p>Please don’t do this as it can look like you are trying to change the context of the reply, which would be a dishonest move.<p>You added &gt; I believe the size of New Zealand is not a reason to ridicule any comparison (zepto’s original answer “argued” that the size of NZ matters, which I feel is an evasion)<p>You say you ‘feel’ it’s an ‘evasion’ which is a way of dismissing this comment without addressing it.<p>If you think the comparison is valid then why not tell us what could California or the US adopt from NZ that would make things better?<p>If you don’t know, then what’s the point of the comparison, other than a kind of vague nationalism?<p>Edit 2: oh - I see you have changed a whole bunch of things about your earlier comments to make it look as though you made points that I failed to respond to.<p>You are <i>completely intellectually dishonest and as such have nothing to offer to political discourse about corruption.</i>')
