Long ago, I worked for an interesting company that insisted on running its entire business on Linux desktops, all the way back between 1999-2002.  Imagine running StarOffice&#x2F;OpenOffice, Thunderbird, Netscape Navigator, etc, for your entire business back in 2000, including your executive team, marketing teams, everyone, most of whom had never even heard of Linux before.<p>Anyway, this being Linux, everyone&#x27;s home directory was mounted on NFS.  All our builds were standardized with a tool called SystemImager, which we could use to push out updates to everyone&#x27;s desktop whenever we wanted.  If there was a new version of KDE, we could pretty easily push that change out.<p>Sometimes it was convenient for me to work on updates to these images by chrooting into a directory containing the &quot;image,&quot; which was really just an rsync tree.  And sometimes, when updating these images, it was convenient to mount our NFS home directories in this chroot environment, so I could access things like an archive I had just downloaded on my own desktop.<p>And eventually we had lots of different images, and the old ones were using up a lot of disk space, so I decide to clean up some space removing the old images.  And these are fairly large images, with lots of small files, and this was before SSDs were a thing, so it made sense that deleting them was taking a while, and I stepped out to grab something to eat.<p>As I was eating lunch, I started getting the tech support escalations.  But this wasn&#x27;t that unusual, our users routinely had problems with the environment we had provided.  They hated it, because it was in many ways terrible, and they made sure we knew it.  So I wasn&#x27;t terribly alarmed.  I didn&#x27;t think any major changes had been made, so I didn&#x27;t hurry back.<p>By the time I leisurely returned from lunch, half the NFS home directories for our users were gone, along with all their documents, emails, bookmarks, or whatever else.  Suddenly it hit me what had happened: at some point, perhaps months earlier, I had left our NFS home directories mounted within one of these image chroots.  And now I had sudo rm -rf&#x27;d it.<p>We had backups, but they were on tape, and it took several days to restore, with about a day of data loss.')
