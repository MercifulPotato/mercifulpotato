Which do you want?  I agree with raptoraver, that truth is what you should seek.<p>I suggest reading &quot;He Is There And He Is Not Silent&quot; by Francis Schaeffer.  He argues that what is really there is also what we really need as humans - a God who actually exists, not just as an idea or a philosophical construct, but one who is really there.  And this God is Someone, not just Something, so our human aspirations for being persons, not just machines, have a basis in what actually exists.<p>But don&#x27;t stop there.  Don&#x27;t stop with knowing the truth as an intellectual construct.  That&#x27;s not what you really need.  You need faith, not just knowledge.  You need truth rather than lies or wishful thinking, but then you need faith in that truth.<p>(&quot;You&quot; in this post is addressed to jelliclesfarm, even though I&#x27;m directly replying to raptoraver.)')
