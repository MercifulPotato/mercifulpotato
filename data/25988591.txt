Study the history.  Tanks are white elephants in areas dominated by mountains and rainfall (both are tank kryptonite).  Sure, US air power could dominate.  They can use the same flightpaths they used in Vietnam, to the same ends.  Myanmar is a country where light soldiers, guys with AKs and flipflops, are far more capable than a dozen tanks sinking into the mud.')
