Item(by='swebs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602613354, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24767378, text='&gt;4. iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini are splash, water, and dust resistant and were tested under controlled laboratory conditions with a rating of IP68 under IEC standard 60529 (maximum depth of 6 meters up to 30 minutes). Splash, water, and dust resistance are not permanent conditions and resistance might decrease as a result of normal wear. Do not attempt to charge a wet iPhone; refer to the user guide for cleaning and drying instructions. Liquid damage not covered under warranty.<p>Shame. I was hoping they would develop a completely washable phone due to corona.')
