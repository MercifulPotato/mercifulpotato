Item(by='liquidify', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604820560, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25020543, text='I have built multiple amps of different types and topologies.  Each one of them &#x27;sounds&#x27; completely different.  This is the reality of amplification.  There is no perfect distortionless amp at all frequencies for all speakers.  The interactions between the circuit and the impedance presented across all audible frequencies by any random speaker are infinitely variable.  The sound of an amp is the combination of all factors in the system, which includes physical interactions and their response to the variations in presented impedance.<p>So yes, an amplifier shouldn&#x27;t sound like anything, but they always do in reality.  Within that reality, we can make judgments about the general qualities of certain types of amplifiers.  If you want to comment on my question please do.  Otherwise, kindly go away, and keep your comments about your magical fairy tail land where all amplifiers are perfect to yourself.')
