I objected when my wife said it would be good for us.  I have sinus issues so I could not argue too much.  We purchased 2 twins since I knew we would never want the same setting, at the same time.  OMG I change the setting at least once a day, usually twice.  We use the kind with a motor.  When I get a sinus issue, it is so easy to prop my chest and head up.  Expensive but well worth it.')
