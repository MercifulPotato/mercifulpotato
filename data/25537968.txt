And especially  different than, &quot;Person is Y, therefore they are good&#x2F;bad at X&quot;.<p>The first statement is open ended, it keeps the door open to systemic factors outside of race that <i>might</i> correlate with race. It also doesn&#x27;t suggest that everyone of a particular group is better&#x2F;worse at something.<p>The second statement says that there&#x27;s something <i>intrinsic</i> to that everyone of that race. It sets up expectations for a group of people. Maybe you are an Asian who <i>isn&#x27;t</i> good at math? How does that make you feel? How will you be impacted by other people making assumptions about you?<p>The third statement is applying stereotypes to individuals, which is just never going to be a good idea.<p>The differences between the first and second statements are subtle, but important.')
