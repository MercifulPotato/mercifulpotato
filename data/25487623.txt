In a few years, it will be even more clear that Trump is a traitor and beholden to Putin.  It will take a decade to undo the damage if that&#x27;s even possible.  When Biden takes office, the US needs to bring the US&#x27;s full political weight down upon Putin and completely rethink how &quot;defense&quot; money is spent.  If the US doesn&#x27;t transition away from traditional defense and weapons to cyber-defense and cyber-weapons, the US is doomed. Russia isn&#x27;t the only one ahead of the US on this.  The US is an ostrich with it&#x27;s head in a hole.')
