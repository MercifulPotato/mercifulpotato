Remember the anti-poaching agreement.<p>Especially Tencent, Google and Cloudflare, they do work together, and they hide it bad.<p>Several of Google and Tencent&#x27;s moves have been anti-competitive, and they had a wink nudge.<p>And Google&#x2F;Cloudflare, don&#x27;t get me started lol. If investigators are serious, it is going to be fun.<p>But in seriousness, Google&#x2F;Cloudflare is similar to Google&#x2F;Facebook &quot;collab&quot;, and it&#x27;ll be bad when it comes out. But Cloudflare will be a trillion dollar company by then.')
