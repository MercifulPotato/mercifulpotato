It was sold to me under the auspices of drug testing, even though ADHD meds are out of your system in 48h.<p>FYI, they weren&#x27;t checking for your ADHD medication. They were likely checking for marijuana.<p>* Marijuana can introduce side effects that basically make it look like you have ADHD<p>* Most ADHD medications are stimulants, they have counter indications when taken with marijuana<p>* Stimulant prescriptions are under scrutiny right now, so places have been doing more diligence<p>&gt; A month later I received an explanation of benefits from my insurance company that said they received a 14k bill and had paid 4k of it, so I was on the hook for the other 10k. Furious I went to my psych. They casually said “we’ve taken care of it, you shouldn’t receive an actual bill”. Uh, that’s not the point? The point is why was it necessary to send my urine for 14k in testing in the first place?<p>The underlying problem is how a bunch of stuff gets billed. Basically your pysch and insurance company have a pre-negotiated rate for re-imbursement on this - it has little to no bearing on what you actually pay as a patient. It&#x27;s pretty much all BS because there&#x27;s a secondary system for resolving those bills.')
