The guards, the cameras, etc. And if he was the type to kill himself, wouldn&#x27;t he have done so the first time he got caught?<p>&gt; It&#x27;s much more of a stretch the imagine a vast conspiracy to kill him.<p>For normal people, but not a guy who had &quot;awful secrets&quot; that many people in power don&#x27;t want revealed.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m going to prefer the simplest explanation 9 of 10 times.<p>Except occam&#x27;s razor isn&#x27;t on your side here. The simplest answer here is a conspiracy. Not suicide. Occam&#x27;s razor says he was killed.<p>The guards not looking after him while he was on suicide watch. The cameras not working. Didn&#x27;t medical examinations also show trauma rather than suicide.')
