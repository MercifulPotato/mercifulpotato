It started with severe breathing difficulties, but I was never in the hospital, and it has basically been going up and down in waves since then. X-rays shows that my lungs have recovered, but I don&#x27;t feel good at all. I&#x27;m 37 and in great shape. I am so damn tired of the discussion being focused on deaths: If 2-5% of infected get long-term symptoms like me, it&#x27;s going to be an absolute onslaught on the health care systems in the coming years.')
