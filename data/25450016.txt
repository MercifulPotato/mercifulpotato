Courts have generally not been bothered when one corporation screws over other corporations if there’s no demonstrated harm to non-corporate entities in the marketplace. The Sherman Antitrust Act wasn’t intended to protect corporations from being <i>out competed</i>, and no corporation has a right to their business model being viable. Corporations screwing each other over so that they can provide the best possible experience for non-corporate members of the market is exactly the “competition” that the act was devised to encourage.')
