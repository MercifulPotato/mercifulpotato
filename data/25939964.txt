A memristor is basically a resistor that changes resistance when you run current through it. An FPGA is a clever layout of many thousands of logic gates that can be programmed to form arbitrarily complex digital logic circuits. It&#x27;s like comparing apples to skyscrapers because they&#x27;re both associated with New York.<p>Presumably, a memristor based neural network would have the advantage over an FPGA of requiring significantly less silicon area to achieve the same function. I imagine an FPGA based neural network would approximate analog signals digitally, perhaps using floating point &quot;half&#x27;s&quot; or something. Memristors would   directly operate on analog signals, encoding information as amplitudes or pulses of currents and voltages.<p>Notably, FPGAs and GPUs can&#x27;t really be directly compared to each other in terms of power consumption unless you specify specific use cases. You can&#x27;t build the equivalent of a mainstream GPU out of FPGAs without severely limiting the clock speed (because of how physically large it would be), and if you did anyway, it would use many orders of magnitude more power to function. So, a GPU is way more power efficient than an FPGA for rendering graphics. There are certainly problems that a GPU isn&#x27;t good at solving, and so there&#x27;s a good chance that an FPGA solution would be more power efficient.')
