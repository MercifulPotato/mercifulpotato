Constant freezing and dropouts.  It was extremely frustrating to try to participate in a meeting.  I could receive fine, but anytime I spoke out, I would drop out within minutes.<p>Speed tests showed plenty of bandwidth, but my modem statistics showed high upstream power levels, occasionally out of the allowed range, and lots of &quot;uncorrectable&quot; packets.<p>I finally got a Comcast technician in to look at it (yay for business-class support), and they replaced the cable from the pole all the way to the first splitter in the basement, and since then it&#x27;s been flawless.  100&#x2F;15 Megabit service has been totally adequate for our needs, so long as it&#x27;s reliable and the latency is low enough.<p>It kills me that our city isn&#x27;t putting in conduits or fiber while doing utility work, though.  The whole time that was happening, there were gas contractors opening the street and running new supply lines to every house, but not putting in any extra conduits or dark fiber.  The construction sounds were almost like being back in the office...')
