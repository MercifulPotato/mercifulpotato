Item(by='cambalache', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606372836, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25215289, text='&gt;  but it takes an extremely uncharitable reading of Harris to get support for the Iraq war out of that text.<p>I hate to get Goodwins-law on you, but that argument is nonsense for 2 reasons. The first one is that it is assuming the enemy would behave worse than you in your position (with no proof whatsoever) so it is extremely cynical in that regard. Using that template you could use Nazi Germany instead of the U.S and the argument would be exactly the same.The second reason is that even if assuming the enemy(let&#x27;s say Hussein) would be a monster against Americans if only he had the power, THAT DOES NOT JUSTIFY AT ALL to invade Iraq (A country that did nothing to the US and presented 0 actual threat) and kill hundreds of thousands of people, most of them civilians. To me Harris is a genocide apologist and no acrobatic sophistry will convince me of the contrary.')
