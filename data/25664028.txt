That&#x27;s their opinion and they have every right to protest. Regardless of what their opinion is though, everyone should agree that this particular behavior is unacceptable. Unfortunately, we could not come to an agreement on that just this summer, and this is the natural end result of a country where large swaths of the population are unwilling to call out political violence when &#x27;their side&#x27; are the ones committing it.<p>At this point, even Trump telling people to stop (which, to his credit, he has) will not help, in the same way that democrats telling Antifa to stop will not help (I mean Biden has asked them to stop for months now, and they&#x27;re still launching fireworks at the courthouse in Portland to the point the mayor is now begging for federal help).<p>Political violence has been normalized by the media (both social and not) to the point where, even popular politicians who disagree with the mob will become its victims.<p>The scary part is that some people perpetuated all this polarization and rage for money.')
