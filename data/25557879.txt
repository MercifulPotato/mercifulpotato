I also used Solr and Lucene before that. It&#x27;s an awesome product. The current version is much evolved from what it was in the early days but it still pretty much works the same way. But it&#x27;s gotten faster, more robust, more capable, etc. And of course it continues to have this great symbiotic relation with Apache Lucene; which continues to improve every release as well.<p>I think that&#x27;s actually the key to its success. Elasticsearch is still open source but it also has a few closed source components. However, Lucene is properly 100% open source and through that project, Elastic continues to be embedded in an open community of researchers and engineers working on that. That gets them a constant stream of new ideas and feedback that they can turn into new features and added value.<p>This is perhaps something where some other OSS companies struggle more because due to their code ownership (copyright assignment) they effectively end up employing, dominating, and monopolizing most of their respective communities. Elastic is also at risk of this but through Lucene they keep their connection to the outside.<p>IMHO open communities like this are essential to long term success of OSS software. E.g. databases like mysql&#x2F;mariadb and postgresql or the Linux kernel are good examples of projects that have thriving communities and continue to evolve regardless to what happens to companies working or depending on this. E.g. Mysql has had a colorful history of ownership changes, forks, competing vendors, etc. Some of those companies are long gone but the code lives on.')
