It seems clear to me that these are people who are unwilling to sacrifice some of the money they earn to follow their ideals and principles, so they are trying this instead.<p>There are very few perils of leaving Google - a top tier company in an industry that is continuously struggling to hire enough people. If you are an engineer at Google and can&#x27;t get a job somewhere else, I don&#x27;t know what to tell you.<p>Comparing Germany to USA is pointless, very different government, history, culture, business climate, etc.')
