The last time this came up, I know that I personally pulled the DKIM key to check and I never saw any journalist doing that, though several did repeat Donna Brazille&#x27;s claim that the email was fabricated--something proven directly false by the body hash parameter on the email claimed to be fake.<p>Oh, and the relevant DKIM key in that case came from Hillary&#x27;s DNS server, I know because I pulled it myself.  Maybe the Kremlin hacked that, but that would implicate a lot more reporting than just Donna&#x27;s claims.<p>So yes, I do want to see more journalism regarding this, but it also needs sufficient rigor.  I don&#x27;t just believe any random person who claims XYZ, whether or not I tend to agree with them, I want to see verifiable facts.<p>And yeah, those are in pretty short supply.  I&#x27;ve seen tons of anonymous rumors, various forms of citogenesis, etc. far more often than I&#x27;ve seen things that can be subjected to some kind of objective fact finding process.')
