You are in favour of systemic obfuscation and low quality support to discourage people who don&#x27;t have problems from taking up the time of support staff? Even though the barriers make life hell for people with legitimate problems like the guy whose $1.5m inventory was destroyed?<p>I&#x27;m never said I&#x27;m personally in favour of that approach, I just saw a lot of comments talking about how terrible it is without any consideration of why certain companies might not want to make support accessible.  As you said, an ideal solution would redirect people who don&#x27;t need customer support elsewhere, but I couldn&#x27;t imagine this is easy for an organisation the size of Amazon.  I hope they can work out a better balance in future.<p>&gt;If that&#x27;s an unrealistic expectation, could you provide more detail about how it is unavoidable to spend &quot;hours with mentally ill people&quot;?<p>Just to clarify, I&#x27;m not talking about garden-variety depression&#x2F;anxiety but people with serious issues that lead to them being completely isolated from regular society.<p>Honestly, we try to avoid dealing with them altogether.  If someone sends us 12 messages in a row at 4am asking for information about a product, we don&#x27;t respond in the morning.  I have done in the past and learned the hard way that it is a bad idea.\nOf course, this is not possible for a business like Amazon with tickets and phone support.')
