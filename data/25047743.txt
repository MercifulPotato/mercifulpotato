Item(by='munchbunny', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605025645, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25046352, text='&gt; The smart thing would be for MSFT&#x2F;o365 to give you the option to switch to a TOTP token and other authenticators with a better experience so people can switch organically.<p>It already does, both through an app notification using the Microsoft Authenticator TOTP app, as well as through the app-agnostic TOTP method. (Just checked my own settings.) It&#x27;s just not the easiest thing to find the settings page where you do it, because Microsoft helpfully hides it behind &quot;advanced security options&quot; instead of just putting it next to the &quot;change password&quot; UI like the other major sites do.<p>&gt; Most security people still don&#x27;t distinguish between authenticators and identities, as federation concepts like identity providers are still in the rarefied space of enterprise.<p>Who are you counting as &quot;security people&quot; in this case? I feel like the distinction for that kind of thing has been around for a long, long time, as evidenced by SSH public key configs and Active Directory certificate based login configuration both allowing multiple keys&#x2F;certs per user, or Github allowing multiple keys as access tokens, etc. If we&#x27;re talking about OTP keyrings issued by banks to consumers, again I don&#x27;t think those things have been equated to identity as much as being treated like a second key for a second lock on the same door.')
