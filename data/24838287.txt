I often wonder how they will survive all the free streaming that I love (Pluto TV, Peacock, Tubi...) that is popping up on my tv every day.  We cancelled long ago and don&#x27;t even miss it.  They have the monopoly on making crappy low production value Hallmark Channel or Lifetime quality series and movies that I don&#x27;t want to watch.  I might subscribe for a month when Stranger Things comes out again and then binge it and cancel again.<p>I like watching actual movies and documentaries and I already have Prime, which has much more of those.  Which raises a question about Amazon and antitrust...')
