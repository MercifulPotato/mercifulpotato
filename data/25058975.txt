Informally, obfuscation hides the implementation of a program while still allowing users to run it.[1] A candidate construction of IO with provable security under concrete hardness assumptions relating to multilinear maps was published in 2013.[2] However, the assumption used in this construction was later broken.[3] Later candidates, including the 2020 work of Aayush Jain, Huijia Lin, and Amit Sahai, rely on more standard assumptions.[3]&quot;<p>The paper linked in the title is the 2020 work by Jain, Lin and Sahai referenced above.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Indistinguishability_obfuscation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Indistinguishability_obfuscati...</a>')
