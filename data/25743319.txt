This makes me think that your infrastructure could be hosted for about $3k&#x2F;year, redundant, with bare metal and minimal downtime.<p>And that&#x27;s with renting bare metal.  Not even the cheaper option of owning your own.<p>There are lots of paths here, but I doubt you want to leave GCP, even though you&#x27;re now seeing the perils of:<p>1) Zero real support from places like AWS&#x2F;GCP&#x2F;etc<p>2) Zero real control, or ability to easily migrate, once you tie-in<p>That said, as you believe you can do nothing to move&#x2F;mitigate, I believe this is a logical appeal to GCP to &#x27;fix things&#x27;, by shaming them with this horrid bug, via this post.<p>And they should be shamed!  GCP, as AWS, is charging an insane premium for such services.<p>However, there isn&#x27;t much for us to do, accept agree that the entire scenario is absurd.  And my post serves that, as I hate to see so many young companies have all their runway eaten up by absurd, 100x to 1000x costs in the cloud, even outside of these bugs.<p>And bare metal is how you control your own destiny.  It&#x27;s also how you remain un-vendor locked into cloud &#x27;extras&#x27;.  You can also run your own &#x27;cloud&#x27; on bare metal too.<p>NOTE: my email is in my profile.
