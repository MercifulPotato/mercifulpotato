If you are just passing by on the street you can barely notice it is &quot;the cashew tree&quot;, for it is so huge it takes up what could be an entire lot. From walking around it, you could think it is several individual trees, because it&#x27;s branches bend downward, touch the soil, grow new smaller roots there, and then go up again.<p>Also, I was there around 10 years ago, so it may have changed, but back then tourists didn&#x27;t really go &quot;under&#x2F;inside&quot; the tree, they were mostly outside the lot, maybe to preserve the tree and avoid possible damage&#x2F;diseases.')
