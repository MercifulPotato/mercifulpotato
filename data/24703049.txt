American workers is a subset of the populace and no, they should not be prioritized over other competing groups. For example, American Business owners, American Retirees, American disabled folks...<p>It&#x27;s a lot less about the specifics of this article&#x2F;case and more about how the &quot;Jobs&quot; aim has become impossible to balance<p>EDIT: If you&#x27;re going to downvote then leave a rebuttal to the point. Why should Immigration laws (or any law for that matter) focus on a subset of Americans?')
