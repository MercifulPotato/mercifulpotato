People still decide to interrupt one another. FWIW, this problem also occurs in-person on a daily basis with most people.<p>&gt;With video chat you can read facial expressions<p>This is a double-edged sword. Some facial expressions are better off not read. Facial expressions are routinely misinterpreted. Worse, it creates an incentive to turn facial expressions into facial expression etiquette, which is both annoying to the person, and removes any reason to even use facial expressions.<p>I can accept video chat in small groups (sub-5) for a short time in professional settings. Anything other than that feels suffocating and limiting. There definitely <i>is</i> an obsession with video chat which has yet to be proven, by a majority who are trying to (poorly) mimic the workfloor.')
