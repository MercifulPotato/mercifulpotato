The difference in preferences between classes of investors can be be huge. Pension funds and the like have massive amounts of capital and a constant demand for cashflows but relative low manpower, so they are looking for very stable investments. Angel investors are almost the opposite as they have much more &quot;labor&quot; available relative to their capital, so they are looking for speculative stocks where they can contribute knowledge and connections to make a difference. There is a whole spectrum of investors between these two and it makes sense for stocks to slowly migrate to being owned by the &quot;boring&quot; end as the underlying company matures.')
