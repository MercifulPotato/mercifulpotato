It&#x27;s complicated and there was miscommunication but it forms part of the pattern.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure there&#x27;s been several different proposals for generics. And I seriously doubt anybody external to the go team submitting even an identical draft would be listened to. Lots of discussion documented at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;golang&#x2F;go&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ExperienceReports#generics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;golang&#x2F;go&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ExperienceReports#generics</a> e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1vrAy9gMpMoS3uaVphB32uVXX4pi-HnNjkMEgyAHX4N4&#x2F;edit#" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1vrAy9gMpMoS3uaVphB32uVXX...</a><p>Even the tracker issue at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;golang&#x2F;go&#x2F;issues&#x2F;15292" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;golang&#x2F;go&#x2F;issues&#x2F;15292</a> states &#x27;he intent is not to add generics to Go at this time, but rather to show people what a complete proposal would look like&#x27; - does that sound like they&#x27;re open to an external person proposing it?<p>I saw it even on a small scale back in 2011, back then I knew the generics thing would be solely implemented by the google guys.<p>There is clearly a &#x27;not invented here syndrome&#x27; going on which is entirely understandable actually for a programming language, I just wish there was more transparency on it.<p>The second a core language change actually involves a person external to google or the team drop the concept that that could happen I&#x27;ll withdraw my criticism.')
