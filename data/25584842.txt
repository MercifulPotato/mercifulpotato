It worked. It never didn&#x27;t work. Moving back to America after many years (born in US), I never knew about for-profit medicine. Fast-forward to now and I cannot believe we are the only country in the developed world without it, especially now.\nWhat would it take, realistically, to see this happen, and is it even possible with the people in office now (including incoming POTUS)? I think that the various medical lobbies are simply too strong, which is one reason why I would dearly love to see lobbying made illegal. Term limits would be nice, too. We need fresh blood often enough. I was very much hoping to see Bernie Sanders get the nomination, and I believe he was sabotaged because he represents the working man and woman and hated the corporate elitist system (I could be wrong). Am I naive here in wishing for this? Maybe a starting point could be no-cost healthcare for all children. As a parent, I cannot tell you how expensive children are, and their healthcare, too, and my children have some issues. I dread hospital visits. The bills come for donkey&#x27;s years, even after a single visit. Something has to give.<p>Edited for grammar.')
