Florida, like many retiree magnets, suffers from having retiree immigrants who vote against the interests of those who still need schools, roads, and other infrastructure. I half-joke that we should amend the state constitution to restrict the franchise to those with skin in the game.<p>Obviously there would be childless voters who would have the best interest of students in mind when choosing school board members. For example, couples planning on having children might want to be able to influence the election.<p>Of course, a board elected by those with children could also be allowed to appoint childless advocates as well.')
