I don&#x27;t know why these researchers have singled it out.<p>Probably because it&#x27;s what they were studying which led to the analysis? A drug doesn&#x27;t have to be unique to be important in understanding side effects...or off-label use if that&#x27;s how you want to think of it.<p>Getting funding to study all of them at once is more challenging, so it shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise that it&#x27;s constrained to one.')
