And latter is still easier than anything I&#x27;ve seen and has by far the biggest ecosystem. If I want to host some minimal app, I just push an SSG to netlify&#x2F;surge&#x2F;vercel, it&#x27;s not an integrated build step which makes my life easier.<p>&gt; just pop the executable in there<p>Otherwise you would just need one more line in your build file (npm install).<p>&gt; Then obviously for CLI tools, this is SUPER nice<p>Also, yes no, Deno &quot;binaries&quot; have huge file sizes compared to an npm install -g and rarely used CLI tools can be fired off with npx, so which problem is exactly solved? That I can offer CLI tools to folks who won&#x27;t have node installed? Then I rather write my CLI tool in Go and offer an appropriate package size.<p>I welcome competition and hence Deno but think this feature doesn&#x27;t fulfill any (relevant) use case. Only beginners who struggle with the build step (which can indeed get hairy) profit from this design decision but a bit more advanced users will miss the control they had before.')
