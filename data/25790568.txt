Plus they don&#x27;t show random shit like ads for a car or a TV or something. I don&#x27;t sit and browse Amazon (because the browsing experience on Amazon prime is dogshit), so I go straight to anything I want to watch on there. The only opportunity to discover new shows on there is usually from outside of Amazon, or their pre-roll ads.<p>Also, they should stop showing me ads for things I&#x27;ve watched.<p>They better not make them unskippable ever.')
