They use low-effort proxy signals to judge the quality and desirability of products.<p>Brand is a reasonably reliable proxy and most Apple stuff is pretty good. At the very least, its rarely terrible, which you can&#x27;t say about many other brands. If you know nothing about headphones but want a decent quality pair without looking into it too deeply, these are a rational option.')
