I&#x27;ll never buy a Laptop with an Nvidia GPU again so long as I run Linux or probably ever because they treat open source like crap.<p>In the interest of giving a fair review, I&#x27;ll explain why this laptop falls short with an Nvidia GPU (in my view), it might even explain why the sleep issues:<p>Basically the USB-C ports are hardwired directly to the Nvidia GPU, this is so the GPU drives external monitors. Which is fine, but what&#x27;s not fine is that the GPU must be on an enabled permanently to use an external monitor.<p>If I turn off the GPU, the external monitors can&#x27;t be used.<p>I can turn off the GPU by changing modes (dramatically improving battery time and life), but this means I need to go change my X configuration, login and log out. So either having good battery life, or working at my desk is a compromise, because it&#x27;s highly inconvenient to change settings and reboot.<p>It basically lets the entire machine down when it comes to functioning as a Laptop. Apparently there is talk the drivers might support the offloading behaviour one might expect in the future. To be able to drive external monitors just using the integrated graphics.<p>The HDMI port might not be hardwired, but I&#x27;m not really interested in using that as I like the USB-C port because I use my monitor as a USB Hub &#x2F; docking station.')
