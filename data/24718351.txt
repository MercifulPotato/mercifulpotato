Item(by='masklinn', descendants=None, kids=[24718454], score=None, time=1602158992, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24718287, text='&gt; The &quot;ore&quot; (called Tamahagane) is sandy&#x2F;rocky stone material which needs to be forged repeatedly to remove impurities and get a higher carbon content in the steel.<p>FWIW tamagahane is already a steel, made from processing ironsand. Tamahagane is not the raw material.<p>Ironsand is found throughout the world, but outside of the japanese few made actual iron (or steel) out of it historically, because there are usually better sources of iron available.<p>NZ is an other country which is very poor in iron ore but it has <i>a lot</i> of ironsand, some of its beaches are ironsand (which is genuinely dangerous: it heats up quickly and very high in the sun). While the japanese were largely the only historical users of ironsand, I think NZ is the only one which industrially smelts ironsand.')
