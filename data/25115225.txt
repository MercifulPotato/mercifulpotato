The top result had the restaurant name and looked like their site. Online ordering sent me to MealHi5, which didn&#x27;t seem to think there are any restaurants in our area. So I called, ordered, and asked about online order when I picked up the food. It turns out they have a different domain that is setup (I think, and&#x2F;or Google is good at recognizing restaurants) to show an &quot;Order Online&quot; button under the Google business summary. That takes me to a different online ordering site that isn&#x27;t MealHi5 that I&#x27;m assuming works.<p>I&#x27;m assuming either a service did the &quot;register a domain for all the local restaurants&quot; trick, or they switched restaurant hosting providers and the domain changed but not the top result in Google, or something else.')
