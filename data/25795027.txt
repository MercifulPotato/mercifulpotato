I get that that could go away with time, but I have no reason to believe that &quot;learning lua&quot; would actually bear any fruit.<p>Part of me is convinced that Lua is liked simply because it&#x27;s unpopular, and that if it was used in production more, people would hate it. Kinda like we hate javascript and c++. Maybe it&#x27;s that we hate our jobs, and blame the language, and then we go home and screw around in lua, we enjoy ourselves and blame the language.<p>EDIT:\nJust to piggy back on my comment here:<p>I&#x27;ve been optimistically looking at the wren scripting language. That seems like the &quot;correct&quot; way to make a scripting language, at least from the outside. I should make it clear that I am not speaking from a position of authority, but I am sharing my opinion of LUA as a pessimistic outsider, which I think is very common view.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wren.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wren.io&#x2F;</a>')
