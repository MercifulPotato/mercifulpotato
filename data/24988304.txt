And surely you need to tell the runtime what those types are in some way, even if that is simply by writing them to return appropriate values.<p>In theory, a statically typed language with ideal ergonomics would make that as easy to specify as a dynamic language, but would have the benefit of warning you of mistakes as early as possible.<p>Of course, many statically-typed languages trade-off some amount of ergonomics for other features.')
