I worked with a group (when we were a very small team at a startup) where we would say terrible things about each others code&#x2F;ideas more or less for fun, as we had a long-running relationship and understood that everyone respected everyone else.<p>Once we were in a bigger company, we had to stop talking like that (at least in venues where others could hear us) as the perception that we were &quot;ripping each other apart&quot; could be perceived as very threatening to people who <i>didn&#x27;t</i> have that rapport nor the understanding of the background. The perception would be that we were mean people who might turn on <i>them</i> at any moment.<p>The argument that &quot;oh, X can both dish it out and take it (with respect to criticism from Y)&quot; often ignores the fact that somewhere, &quot;Z&quot; is quietly watching this interaction and deciding that they don&#x27;t want to participate in this apparently hostile environment.')
