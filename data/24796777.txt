The fruitful attacks are on the channel and the endpoints. Watch metadata, compromise the endpoints, use the xkcd wrench, follow the money.<p>Why attack the front door when there is a picture window beside it? Don&#x27;t attack the tank, attack the fuel supply. The frontal attack is only there to pin the opposition while you compromise the flanks.<p>Backdoor encryption is security theater. Which raises the question &quot;What is the real goal?&quot;. Is the goal to say &quot;We don&#x27;t know what you did but you encrypted it so we can lock you up.&quot;? Then you can fake &quot;encrypted communication&quot; from anyone to anyone and lock up anyone you want until they provide &quot;the key&quot; they don&#x27;t know. Torture them for the key. Then try them in a show court and hang them.')
