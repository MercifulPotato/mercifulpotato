New companies can be started and old ones can go out of business. Resources are fungible; there isn&#x27;t a fixed pool of resources that are suitable for nuclear but not for renewables, or the reverse.<p>What determines where those resources get allocated are economic incentives. If the government puts its thumb on the scale and gives lots of incentives for renewables and lots of disincentives for nuclear--which is exactly what the US government has been doing for decades, and what the Green New Deal would mean doing even more of--then resources will be available for renewables but not for nuclear.')
