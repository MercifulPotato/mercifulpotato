You need to be able to start rendering jobs at the end of the day and have them ready for dailies on the morning. Jobs that take more than 4 hours risk clogging the queue and taking 2 days per iteration rather than 1, so people are motivated to keep it reasonable.<p>Another important difference between games and film is antialiasing techniques. Much of the difference in render time between them is in using fancier texture sampling and using lots more samples than games are willing to use or even need for decent quality.')
