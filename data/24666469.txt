I&#x27;m still trying to work out where I am going to go with this.<p>But there are local organizations that supposedly are doing economic development and I&#x27;m not actually seeing that happen. And I think it probably will not ever go anywhere.<p>I&#x27;m actually doing economic development, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to make it pay. I run r&#x2F;ClothingStartups and people are promoting their indie brands there, but being a moderator of Reddit doesn&#x27;t pay anything. I run a bunch of blogs with useful info, but a lot of it is aimed at helping homeless people and poor people.<p>And it&#x27;s very much needed and it&#x27;s very much effective, but it still pays me a pittance. I&#x27;m not sure how to sort that out.<p>I&#x27;m working on it.')
