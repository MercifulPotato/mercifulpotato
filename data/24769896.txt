Measuring the QM system is analogous to a Fourier transformation and has the same mathematical limitations arising from a Fourier transform from wave to discrete space. Depending on the question you ask (tied to the convolution function) you get either discrete particle answers or wavelike answers.  The probability wave does live in 3D space AFAICT, but the QM properties like spin, charge, momentum etc are tied into that 3D space and form a combined configuration space.<p>The really odd part to me is that at macro scales the probability waves collapse neatly into classic physics in 3D space, but still react in quantum fashion at small local atomic scales. As in the configuration spaces generally can only be determined for small subsystems but not a whole macro system without the “conversion” step.')
