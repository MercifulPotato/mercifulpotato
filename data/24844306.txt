Folks, those parts inside your computer are rated for anywhere from 85C to 200C depending on the part. What this means is that those parts can work at this temperature indefinitely. Perhaps the only part whose lifetime depends on the temperature a lot are electrolytic capacitors, but even they are routinely rated at 105C. Your CPU is likely rated to 105C die temperature, and even then it will only throttle, not die outright. Moreover, letting energy dense parts warm up to a decent temperature improves the efficiency of cooling, because thermal gradient is much steeper. That&#x27;s why Apple doesn&#x27;t cool things until they have to. DIYers are obsessed with getting to the point where their CPU runs at ridiculously low temps, but the CPU itself is designed to tolerate much more. GPUs begin to throttle at something like 83C, and NVIDIA deliberately lets them to get to that temperature before fans kick in in earnest.')
