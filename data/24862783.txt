I&#x27;d love to see Google broken up but I don&#x27;t think it will come out of this particular lawsuit.<p>Microsoft wasn&#x27;t broken up. Google, when they recently faced a similar (although not identical) lawsuit in EU about search defaults, ended up implementing a search engine choice screen on Android where the position and presence of other search engines were determined by an auction. So something that was previously free, even though inconvenient, was now bringing Google extra money. How&#x27;s that for antitrust. And as a bonus, DDG was outbid and not present on that choice screen at all, even though before that lawsuit they were the most popular non-Google option that people chose.<p>I think we need much better, tech-giant-aware antitrust laws before we can take on the likes of Google. Too bad the various levels of government right now are... well, you know.<p>Well, I guess we&#x27;ll see how this works out eventually. Speculation can only go so far.')
