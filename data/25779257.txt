It used to be legal to advertise cigarettes to children, and now it&#x27;s not.<p>If you want to argue that it will be difficult to write and pass legislation that actually accomplishes anything meaningful, I&#x27;d agree. But to say &quot;no laws are being broken so who cares?&quot; is just so unproductive. Something has to be done here, and I think I would rather have it be done at a government level so that I can at least feel like I had some say in it.')
