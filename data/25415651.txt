Most of us are so used to cotton shirts and synthetics that pick up odors and need to have the funk washed out all the time. A wool shirt can be aired out overnight, given a quick shake and be completely odor-free the next morning.<p>I&#x27;ve worn merino wool underpants on trips where - for various reasons - I took barely anything except the clothes I wore. Hanging the underpants in the steamy bathroom while taking a shower will almost completely refresh them. Heck, even keeping them on in circumstances where showers weren&#x27;t available didn&#x27;t seem to pick up any odors, at least for a couple of days.<p>Not that I would normally recommend regularly wearing underwear for several days or even a week, but wool is clearly superior to cotton or synthetic fabrics.')
