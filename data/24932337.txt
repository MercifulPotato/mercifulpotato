Unfortunately for both my network and I Brexit happened and as the UK wanted me to give one of my two passports up in exchange for a nice blue one from the UK, I decided to move to the mainland instead. Network blown, and have to interview in a second language. It&#x27;s harder for sure, but not impossible. I&#x27;m 50 and happily in a financial position where I can last a few years without a job.')
