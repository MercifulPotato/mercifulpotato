Maybe a better argument is that its been decades and nobody is meaningfully competing with facebook or Twitter in their respective categories even though there is tremendous economic incentive to do so.  Network effects are very difficult to break.  When the president is on Twitter nobody wants to be on Bob&#x27;s basement network.  Its locked in a feedback loop.<p>Follow up comment here because Ive apparently reached my limit for a while: I believe you.  I still think a Google half-ass is going to be a stronger effort than another start ups full out stab at it.  Facebook is the biggest &quot;country&quot; on earth almost by a factor of 2x with 2.7 billion people.  Its just other worldy large and difficult to compete with especially today.  But I get what you&#x27;re saying.')
