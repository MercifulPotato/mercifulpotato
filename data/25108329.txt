The radios might be talking to each other in both H and V polarities, 80MHz wide channel in both, at 2048QAM 5&#x2F;6 during a normal sunny day. In an extreme rain fade event they may go all the way down to QPSK 1&#x2F;2 and the link&#x27;s capacity in Mbps could be as poor as 40Mbps (from what is nominally a 900Mbps+ link), but the end to end latency will remain pretty much the same.<p>Latency as experienced by users might be much worse, however, if suddenly 300Mbps of traffic is trying to be shoved through a 40-75Mbps link, for a period of several minutes or more.')
