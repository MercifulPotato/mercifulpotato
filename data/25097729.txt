Item(by='AaronNewcomer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605407913, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25092118, text='I recently picked up the 1834-1842 issues of Journal Des Armes Spéciales which was a French technical journal about arms and armament. ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aaronnewcomer.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;journal-des-armes-speciales-and-the-battle-of-robert-vs-lefaucheux&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aaronnewcomer.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;journal-des-armes-special...</a> ). An article introducing it gives a pretty good reasoning for the importance of studying military history, translated:<p>“Let the lessons of history not be lost for us, that the progress of military art is marching in concert with those of the industrial arts. If we are richer and more enlightened, let us also be stronger and more valiant. Let us not let this sword rust in our hands that Brennus and Clovis left us, that Charlemagne and Napoleon walked all over Europe; then all the tyrants and all the barbarians of the earth will not prevail never against a nation that can present a compact mass of eight million men, ready to pay their blood for the defense of the fatherland. \nIt is for the purpose of contributing to such a glorious result that we are undertaking today the publication of the Journal Des Armes Spéciales. Happy if we can contribute to maintain among the French, the sacred fire, the taste for arms that have always distinguished our ancestors; if we can root out these alluring doctrines, but disastrous, which tend to effeminate one whose people will always be passionate about war, and who will always support or the terror of Europe. The more the sweets of peace take root in the heart of our statesmen, the more the taste for peaceful pleasures tends to spread, the more gold finally gains consideration among us, the more urgent it is to return the honors due to it to the iron. Then the French people, drenched by the revolution, will again travel fourteen centuries of existence; if he conquers, they will be peaceful: he will have allies, friends and no subjects; it will use force only to resist an unjust aggression, to defend its allies, to avenge the injury done to only one of its citizens, and if some reckless enemy were to challenge in combat the great people, one would see reappear the great army more numerous and more formidable than ever.”')
