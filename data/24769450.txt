It was graded on objective criteria not entirely unlike this: thesis, topic sentences, supporting sentences, etc.<p>I nearly failed it, and apparently I&#x27;m far from the only one[1]. If you didn&#x27;t follow the format, more like filling out a form than actual writing, then you didn&#x27;t get the full points, no matter how well it was written by more subjective standards.<p>That wasn&#x27;t the only problem, but it was certainly one. They ditched the test because a lot of people were failing it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;archive&#x2F;politics&#x2F;1986&#x2F;01&#x2F;23&#x2F;md-writing-tests-value-fairness-questioned&#x2F;6dacb779-0a7b-4f77-9ee2-11b584c382f9&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;archive&#x2F;politics&#x2F;1986&#x2F;01&#x2F;23&#x2F;m...</a>')
