It&#x27;s sad to see that there&#x27;s literally no baseline of quality measurements on NPM, and people give them stars far too quickly, without realizing that it&#x27;s literally a single line of code with megabytes of useless testing around it.<p>Most of the patterns in UI&#x2F;UX frameworks that come and go all the time are actually very very old paradigms that have been known in Computer Science since the 60s-70s. I always feel like no one reads a book about Software Engineering or Software Patterns anymore, let alone tries to find patterns in alternatives and makes a pro&#x2F;contra list of features to find out what they actually want.<p>All go hush hush and rush rush to put out their next starlet on GitHub, without actually thinking about a software architecture anymore. Those that do are somehow invisible to the masses; and can never gain really a traction behind their ideas, which leads to the abandoned code problem either way.')
