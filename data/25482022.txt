Scientific mysticism and &quot;metaphysics&quot; are very popular, just see the unfounded paranoia over &quot;GMO&quot;. Turning a skeptical eye to scary sounding articles that have very little research underpinning them shouldn&#x27;t be controversial.<p>However that appears to have emotionally triggered you as you&#x27;ve launched into a mocking trollish reply where you&#x27;ve respoken their comment, except turned it into one big condescending insult towards the OP.<p>Shame on you. Shame on lowering the level of discourse here. This is beneath you and this community.')
