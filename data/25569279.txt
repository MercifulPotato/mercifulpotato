That is, in Bangladesh, those with more than 500 USD assets tend to accumulate more assets, while those with less than 500 USD assets don&#x27;t.<p>As people in Silicon Valley have more than 500 USD assets (citation needed), I don&#x27;t see how this paper applies to Silicon Valley at all. There can be another such threshold, but the paper doesn&#x27;t provide any experimental support for one.')
