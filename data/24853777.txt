Reviewers aren&#x27;t some magical wise expert committee with infinite focus and they don&#x27;t do any kind of background &quot;auditing&quot;.<p>They get a stack of papers to review and don&#x27;t usually spend more than a few hours on each. Judging by the quality of some reviews I&#x27;ve seen, many grad students take even less than an hour to write a &quot;review&quot;.<p>I think the general public has a way overinflated idea of what peer review means in day to day practice.')
