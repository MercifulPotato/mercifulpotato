You can&#x27;t just preemptively assume that there are no real correlations.<p>You definitely want to use a smaller p threshold when you look for more things, but it&#x27;s quite possible to hit real correlations with a pile of plausible hypotheses.<p>As an example: Let&#x27;s say just 1&#x2F;150 of your hypotheses hit a real correlation, and you&#x27;re inappropriately using a p&lt;.05 test.  Tiny signal, huge noise.  But even in that pessimistic case, more than 10% of your positives are real.  Far from a guarantee.')
