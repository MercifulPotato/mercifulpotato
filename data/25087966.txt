These two steps are not so easily divorced from one another, though, especially when you&#x27;re dealing with multiple rounds of edits, so it doesn&#x27;t work too well to force these to be separate tools to deal with the task.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of competitors to the first step, in the vein of having multiple tools that are plain-text files but convert to rich-text output. However, most of these tools lack good, or even any, support for the fine-tuning capabilities. Where there is competition in the fine-tuning space, the relevant tools are largely based on WYSIWYG editors--which makes sense when you consider that it&#x27;s easier to fine-tune properties when you get immediate visual feedback on what the fine-tuning you&#x27;re doing does to the result. But these editors don&#x27;t provide an easy way to integrate in the workflows of the other tools, since the underlying formats don&#x27;t really support the fine-tuning capabilities.')
