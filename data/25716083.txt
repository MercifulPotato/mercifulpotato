Matrix is on the front page because it&#x27;s really the only open protocol that has a chance of gaining non-technical users.<p>I run a matrix server, which has been nothing but a constant pain. My friends that use it can also use my ircv3 server or xmpp server that I run that use no resources and take up none of my time with maintenance. They do not. The only thing I&#x27;ve run that they like better so far is mattermost. I don&#x27;t like the open core though. Matrix, xmpp and irc are backed by ldap which is impossible with mattermost.')
