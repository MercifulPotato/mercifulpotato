There is a large subculture of urban explorers on youtube, interesting stuff to watch.  Interesting to see them explore sites abandoned around the turn of the century, driveways &#x2F; roads and such are essentially impassible.<p>There are exceptions.  Youtube abandoned mine explorers visit sites abandoned a century ago out west and other than the occasional landslide desert roads can remain clear for a century or so.  Of course without massive fossil fuel burning, Vegas can&#x27;t exist, so great roads aren&#x27;t very useful without any population to travel them...  Similar problem with the deep south USA, before air conditioning the number of people living down there was low.')
