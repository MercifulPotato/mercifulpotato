It will still get rid of that person&#x27;s pain.<p>If I fracture my ankle, but I learn to compensate by constantly shifting my weight onto my good leg as I limp so that I can still do my job -- in that scenario, I still want my ankle fixed. I don&#x27;t want a doctor saying, &quot;ah, but you have the special limp, so a cast and crutches would only do you harm.&quot; I want the cast, because the cast is probably easier, more comfortable, and in the long term less dangerous than what I&#x27;m currently doing.<p>Why would pain be different? Should someone not be able to get relief from suffering just because they&#x27;ve gotten good at mentally focusing through it?<p>It seems like the result of approaching pain from the perspective you&#x27;re advocating for would just be to discourage people from trying to take any practical and&#x2F;or psychological steps to manage their own pain, because every minor success they have will make it harder for them to get any additional help.')
