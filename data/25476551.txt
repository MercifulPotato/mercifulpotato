The problem was twofold:<p>1. MCAS should have used inputs from both AOA sensors, rather than just one. MCAS had too much authority over the travel, and it should have deactivated itself if the pilots repeatedly countermanded it.<p>2. The pilots were not trained properly in emergency procedures with the stab trim. Boeing put out an Emergency Airworthiness Directive after the first crash with explicit instructions on how to deal with it, but the EA pilots did not follow those instructions.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theaircurrent.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;B737-MAX-AD-1107.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theaircurrent.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;B737-MA...</a>')
