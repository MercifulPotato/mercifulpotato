Item(by='karlicoss', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610064892, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25679488, text='I&#x27;ve been looking for a simple incremental client-side search for my personal wiki (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beepb00p.xyz&#x2F;exobrain" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beepb00p.xyz&#x2F;exobrain</a>), but didn&#x27;t find anything immediately suitable sadly. Basically I wanted the indexing &amp; search to be as simple as possible:<p>- take in the raw HTML files (so it&#x27;s agnostic to the site generator)<p>- indexing should be respectful of `id=` anchors, so you can jump directly to the occurence in the document text (instead of just the HTML). I looked at Stork, but it didn&#x27;t look like it was processing these. Do you think it would be a good idea?<p>- embed a simple search, lazily, so the index is only fetched when you focus the search field<p>- ideally, &lt;mark&gt; the matches in HTML, in a similarly generator-agnostic way (although it might be trickier)<p>I ended up implementing my own via a relatively script + lunr.js, but I think if someone nailed such setup and made it really simple. It&#x27;s a shame it&#x27;s so tedious to add incremental search to a static blog&#x2F;wiki.<p>P.S. demo on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stork-search.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stork-search.net&#x2F;</a> doesn&#x27;t work for me now, I&#x27;m getting CORS error on fetching <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;files.stork-search.net&#x2F;federalist.st" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;files.stork-search.net&#x2F;federalist.st</a>')
