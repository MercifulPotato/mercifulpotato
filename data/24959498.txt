The conclusions are invariably that even the most reliable indicators are violated occasionally (human intelligence is of course a multi-armed-bandit algorithm so this is exactly what you&#x27;d expect, and want). Whether the people making decisions agreed they were experimenting or not did not matter at all. They also weren&#x27;t able to explain this (and even when they did, they just provided the explanation one of the lawyers provided, which sounds fine, until you realize that of course <i>two</i> lawyers provided an explanation. So they are giving exactly the wrong information to understand the decision: judge chooses between &quot;A, because ...&quot; and &quot;B, because ...&quot;, and at that point your decision is about the difference between A and B, not about A or B themselves)<p>Whilst I have not seen a comparable study with doctors&#x27; decision making ... I have very little doubt it&#x27;s exactly the same. Doctor&#x27;s AREN&#x27;T reliable and <i>are</i> in fact, no matter how hard they deny it, are experimenting on patients and learning from it.<p>Of course, when you think about more than a single patient, this is what you want. With this I mean you want (ideally many small, some large) mistakes to happen as long as it isn&#x27;t you under the knife, but you&#x27;re expecting at some future time it&#x27;ll be you, because that way the doctors will maximally improve by then. Once you&#x27;re under the knife, I guess you don&#x27;t want to see experiments, but yeah, there&#x27;s a price for skill.<p>And there&#x27;s a price to be paid in mistakes for human skill as well. Even for doctors. Even for surgeons.')
