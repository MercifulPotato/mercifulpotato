Until I hear from it I don&#x27;t know its number. With a quorum based election, I only need to hear from n&#x2F;2+1 nodes. I don&#x27;t have to know anything about the nodes themselves, only the number needed to form a quorum. With random numbers, I&#x27;d need to hear from every member to know if I&#x27;ve reached consensus or not. That, or I&#x27;d need a perfectly partitioned network (i.e., A and B can talk, but neither can talk to C. If A can talk to B, and B can talk to C, but C can not talk to A, at least when trying to make a decision, no decision can be reached)')
