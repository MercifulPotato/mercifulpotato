CPU usage increases CPU usage.  That&#x27;s it.  Encoding usually happens on a GPU, and scene composition happens on the CPU, which is either a zero-copy routine or a very fast memcpy.<p>My point is that from what you&#x27;re saying, it seems clear to me that you are not aware of just how good WebRTC is at this kind of thing.')
