I worked with experts in the context of patent and trade secret litigation.  I pick people at the top of their field from prestigious universities with impeccable credentials.<p>If you ask them off the cuff questions they often are wrong.  But if they investigate and think about it, they&#x27;ll correct themselves.<p>Experts are also just as susceptible to bias, motivated reasoning, groupthink, etc. as anyone else.<p>This is why academic papers are supposed to be a back and forth discussion.  &quot;TRUST THE EXPERTS&quot; has a plural for reason, and should be understood to mean trust the experts after they&#x27;ve done a thoughtful analysis with the best available evidence and have considered dissenting expert views.')
