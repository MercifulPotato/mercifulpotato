What preparations would they make in the face of that sort of event?<p>You cannot retroactively alter a policy, for obviously good reasons. The main preparation policy-wise is that insurance companies do not knowingly write <i>new</i> policies in the affected area when disaster is ongoing or imminent. Reinsurers will also avoid writing new treaties (which is what a standard reinsurance policy is called) -- for these reasons the Florida cat reinsurance market is typically dominated by policies that incept on  June 1st and run to May 31st of the next year.<p>Internally, the companies will start modeling what they think their potential losses will be almost immediately, as investors expect a fairly quick turnaround on getting initial loss estimates out the door.<p>There&#x27;s a fairly new paper here, albeit not yet peer reviewed, on the promise of maximum entropy models in an actuarial setting.
