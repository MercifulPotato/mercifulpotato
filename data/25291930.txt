Whether you have 8 or 10 spaces makes no impact on the architecture, but deciding that users should be able to change video quality does. If you try to decide on an architecture first, you will often constrain the UX of your product. If you don&#x27;t realize that your product needs X feature, but your architecture doesn&#x27;t support X, you&#x27;re screwed.')
