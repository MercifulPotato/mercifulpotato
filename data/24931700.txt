Their recruiting and hiring practices are mostly geared to ensure “culture fit.” That’s code for young single male who will work 12 hrs&#x2F;day and think free beer and pizza makes it cool.<p>The exception being if you can come in as a CTO and _set_ some of that culture including making an effort to give everyone a bit more work&#x2F;life balance. I&#x27;ve been in this situation a few times with companies that are otherwise as you describe.')
