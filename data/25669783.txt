The GDPR authors knew what they were doing - or they were lucky although also other parts of GDPR suggest that they had some technical think-tank behind it.<p>Anyway, hashing doesn&#x27;t solve anything, whatever &quot;obfuscation&quot; is used&#x2F;invented, as long as information points to &quot;natural person&quot; it is considered personal data.')
