No one who really matters has their net worth tied up in crypto (yet) - the entire market can be vaporized with no meaningful political fallout. The government cannot abide some future where Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk or Goldman Sachs has a majority of their assets outside of fiat currency - this would represent an existential threat to the model of governance.')
