On moderate to better hardware 10 years ago it took ~5-10 seconds for me to open photoshop... today it&#x27;s still the same.  Windows took 10-30 seconds to load then and it&#x27;s about the same now (to go from power button to actually in Windows with the desktop loaded).  With the hardware being multiple times faster, why doesn&#x27;t software follow suit?  If you asked me 10 years ago, I would have been most looking forward to things loading in an instant, but we appear to be no better today.')
