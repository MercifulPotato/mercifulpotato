He caucuses with Democrats and his voter base is Democrats.<p>The Republicans have not been absurdly successful in an democratic support sense. over the past 25 yesrs, they&#x27;ve steadily increase their reliance on electoral college bias, voter suppression, and a Republican judiciary. When the party&#x27;s success depends on Supreme Court decisions made by a previous President they helped get installed by the Supreme Court overruling the voters, they are on very thin ice democratically.<p>Republicans haven&#x27;t won the popular vote for a non-incumbent since 1988, or 1980 if you consider VP GHW Bush as an incumbent.')
