Any recommendations would be welcome.<p>One thing I noticed from just skimming the tutorials is there is a lot of Unity editor specific creation of stuff. How much of that is the actual game programming? Maybe web dev is headed in that direction if we ever eventually map Figma to components, where you kind of define it via a GUI. Seeing that felt a little off putting since I’m used to working with a tight scaffold that’s mostly code.<p>Godot looked less GUI intensive so I was thinking about digging into that instead.<p>I guess another way to pose this question is, do I need to get over this and accept this is how games are made?')
