There was a moment when the body count started adding up and anyone with common sense can see it is his fault. It was Trump that caused this, he in effect killed those people at the capital.<p>Had it gone worse someone would have been killed or hung on live TV. All of that is on him.<p>Maybe all the platforms did all call each other, but there is a moment where you just have to take action. And that action was to stop him from killing more people. Stop him from destroying more things.<p>It is not free speech ... it is at a cost. Those lives. He is a monster and does not need a platform. This is not a slippery slope. He had to be stopped.<p>Maybe it leads to more choices and actions and discussions as to why he had a voice on those platforms at all. In either case the right choice was made. Stop him.')
