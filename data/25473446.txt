Debilitating to the point where I could not go anywhere that would require me to stand in line. The book Healing Back Pain by John Sarno, which is basically the talking therapy you mentioned, was hugely transformative for me. I was able to stop fixating on the pain and focus on strength training knowing that flare up were no big deal. I&#x27;m recovered now and regularly skateboarding and standing in line again.<p>Edit: I should mention I spent upwards of an hour each day for those years doing physical therapy rehab. I turned down recommendations of surgery during that time as well.')
