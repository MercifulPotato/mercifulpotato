When training and running &gt; 20 miles &#x2F; week, I could eat anything I wanted and still lose weight.  I usually stayed around 170&#x2F;lbs - about optimal for my frame.  It didn&#x27;t matter what I ate, and I&#x27;ve heard stories of people who just ate cheesecake or some such due to the calorie load.<p>Unfortunately I can no longer run and have since ballooned up to 200lbs.<p>You can definitely out-train a diet, it&#x27;s sustaining it that&#x27;s hard.')
