Item(by='grahamburger', descendants=None, kids=[25677841], score=None, time=1610053991, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25675688, text='I looked through some of what&#x27;s here. I don&#x27;t really have the vocabulary to understand if these items are significant or not. Some of them seem like they might be, some of them seem like they&#x27;re probably not significant, and some seem to point to evidence that claims of fraud are in actuality a farce.<p>I do have some trust in our institutions and our court system, though. The fact that there has been bi-partisan dismissal across the board of claims of election fraud - even from judges and officials who are on-the-record Trump supporters - leads me to believe that there is little here of substance. Why would Republican Trump supporters who are proud (perhaps to a fault) of defying the mainstream media suddenly fall in line? They didn&#x27;t fall in line with the other &#x27;fake news&#x27; events throughput the presidency, why this one? Imagine the credibility they&#x27;d gain if there <i>was</i> actually enough fraud to change the election, and they found it!<p>I&#x27;ve seen people point to the fact that many of the cases were dismissed by judges without actually hearing the evidence, due to clerical or timing problems. I am incredulous. In order to accept that, I have to believe that a Republican judge who supports Donald Trump and presumably wanted to see him back in the presidency looked at the lawsuit, understood the situation and it&#x27;s urgency, and shrugged his (or her) shoulders and said &#x27;sorry, you might be right, but I&#x27;m not gonna look at it.&#x27; I don&#x27;t buy it.')
