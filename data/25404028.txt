Norway&#x27;s system of timed speed cameras are particularly wonderful -- they simply photograph a car and then photograph it again many kilometers later.  If you get there too soon, then at some point, you must have been speeding.<p>These systems are safer for police and drivers as there are no traffic stops for speeding. Yes, the bill goes to the car owner, but if you&#x27;re loaning your car out to someone who speeds, at least some of the culpability falls on you.<p>Can speed cameras be used as a revenue source? Yes. It is reasonable to place requirements on the determination of speed-limits and camera-locations to prevent abuse. Beyond that, if you don&#x27;t want to get a fine, don&#x27;t speed.')
