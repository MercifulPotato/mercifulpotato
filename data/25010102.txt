Everyone seems very opposed.<p>It seems odd to me, because Kubernetes is so new, and there have been few attempts to manage things consistently &amp; well, under one umbrella, that have happened. Certainly none have gotten anywhere near this successful.<p>I think there&#x27;s a lot of value to trying to find core abstractions &amp; use them throughout. Managing each resource via totally separate tooling is how we&#x27;ve always done things from an ops perspective, but the coders have been trying to distill &amp; create enduring shareable value for a long time, find ways to share value. It&#x27;s weird to me how resistant, how much people think they know what their opinion is, how certain they are that only small specific tools can help them, and how convinced they are that bigger attempts are going to be hard to manage, or convinced that they won&#x27;t be able to see or understand breakage. I don&#x27;t think we have the experience to know, yet people seem deeply committed already.')
