Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m talking about.<p>My hypothetical expert, talking about non-pharmaceutical interventions to mitigate the spread of the pandemic, for example, would say something like the following.<p>&quot;Leaving aside all other concerns and taking into account available research, our conjecture is that social distancing and mask wearing should significantly impact the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.&quot;<p>Intelligent people, and for the sake of argument I&#x27;ll include politicians, would then hear the following.<p>&quot;There is no conclusive scientific proof regarding NPI&#x27;s. However, given the uncertainty of the situation and the educated guesses of scientists, based on what they have conclusive evidence for, regarding disease spread and the nature of this coronavirus, we have to consider the use of NPI&#x27;s. The use of NPI&#x27;s then needs to be informed by other considerations: namely, economic impact, and broader social impact, both of which will depend on the extent of NPI&#x27;s.&quot;<p>What I saw, instead, was &quot;science&quot; and &quot;scientists&quot; being conflated by one side, and the conjecture of scientists, based on incomplete information -- but incomplete information being evaluated by experienced practitioners -- being dismissed as entirely worthless by the other. Both sides did this by prioritizing either &quot;lives&quot; over &quot;jobs&quot; and vice-versa; in other words, by capitalizing on the legitimate fears of the populace.<p>The media, too, rather than examining and explaining the pronouncement of experts, and elucidating the moral issues, picked sides. And to top it off, the two sides each got their backs up over extreme, inflexible positions: either, &quot;masks everywhere&quot; and &quot;damn your pocketbook,&quot; or &quot;masks don&#x27;t work&quot; and &quot;anyway, it&#x27;s just the flu.&quot;<p>If you ask me, neither side has any claim to superiority.<p>So, let me reiterate my point. Experts make pronouncements with various levels of confidence and without commenting outside of their area of expertise; but their area of expertise is often just a small part of the larger problem. Trade-offs have to be considered. But we are not doing that. Our politicians (and media) pick sides, regarding the trade-offs, and then avoid acknowledging the legitimacy of the concerns they&#x27;re willing to trade off.<p>Expertise is not being applied correctly. That&#x27;s my point.')
