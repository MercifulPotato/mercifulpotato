People just aren&#x27;t looking to kill one another, generally, even the more polarizing people.<p>But message received -- Jack Ma probably would have a team of bodyguards, and the people who could get past that probably wouldn&#x27;t need to manipulate markets using his appearance on a conference call to make money.<p>I was wrong, I see that now!')
