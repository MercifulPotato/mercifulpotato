From McAfee, through Altera to (whatever that stupid company that had the drones was), Intel was desparately trying to leverage their monopoly to expand in to new markets. What I think is unique about Intel when compared to their rightful competitors (FAANG + M&#x2F;S + AMD + Nvidia) is that Intel don&#x27;t pay for talent. Intel have been cost orientated for atleast a decade now, when 14nm cost spiralled. The problem wasn&#x27;t that Intel was a monopoly so much as it&#x27;s just that Intel has been living it&#x27;s life in the world of real companies, not silicon valley. Intel is viewed&#x2F;valued&#x2F;run as a manufacturing company. So they need to hit the eternal treadmill of performance whlist spending like they&#x27;re just doing average work. It&#x27;s difficult to do that when Google is just going to 10x the salary of any of your 10x staff.')
