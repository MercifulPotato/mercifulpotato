Even the &#x27;things I miss&#x27; paragraph makes very little sense (&#x27;the fast browser&#x27;, like Safari is in a special class of its own compared to browsers on other systems)?<p>IMO I think there have been way too many of these &#x27;why I left Apple&#x27; posts, I don&#x27;t see the point, they rarely add anything meaningful for anyone who hasn&#x27;t already made up their mind and the discussion afterwards is always a repetition of the same tired anecdotes.<p>I&#x27;d guess anyone who doesn&#x27;t like or need macOS is already running something else, and for those of use who still like macOS but also use other systems like myself it is trivially easy to run things in a VM so you can have the &#x27;best of both worlds&#x27; (my opinion, YMMV).')
