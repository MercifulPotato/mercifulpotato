It&#x27;s modular, so you use what you use, and ignore the rest.<p>The CI they offer makes no assumptions about where your repos might live (git is git. Who cares who the host is), and offers the stuff you might need like secrets, ssh keys, etc. The images they supply for testing actually seem more extensive than the other players.<p>And if you really want to self-host it... Go ahead. The whole of sourcehut is open source and reasonably well documented. You can host your own build server with minimal fuss.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourcehut.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourcehut.org&#x2F;</a>')
