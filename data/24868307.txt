WHAT.<p>I actually laughed out loud when I got to that bit. It&#x27;s a bit... mental... if I&#x27;m honest.. that whomever wrote this up included that. After reading through I can see this can just be substituted for general thin metal sheets which you can pick up from pretty much any hardware store. I assume it blows the $30 price point up a bit but that&#x27;s far preferable than having that one, show-stoppingly esoteric essential item on the list.<p>This kind of thing is very cool weekend project fodder. I suspect it&#x27;ll take me a bit longer than the couple of hours they reckon.')
