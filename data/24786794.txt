I recently played through the Eye of The Beholder series (available on GOG) with as much enthusiasm as I had when playing a recent game. I&#x27;ve done the same in the past with beautiful SNES RPGs. I will play Battle Squadron on the Amiga for ever.<p>I also find that if I want a quick blast to clear my head, then a five minute game of Defender, R-Type, or a round of Bomberman does the trick far better than contemporary so-called casual games, which for reasons I can&#x27;t explain, often give me unpleasant mental sensations.<p>Then again I am a strange person. If something from the past was meaningful to me, then it is still the same when I revisit it. I sort of live in a &quot;long present&quot;, accumulating things of meaning and only setting them down when I&#x27;m finally done with them, whatever the vagaries of fashion.<p>(As an aside, if the author of the article wants a better Amiga racing game that hasn&#x27;t been ported to DOS, then check out Super Skidmarks. I used to carry my Amiga and TV set to my friends house to play this over a null modem link; its an amazing party game)')
