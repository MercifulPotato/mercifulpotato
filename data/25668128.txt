I am thankful we have freedom of speech in this country because CNN&#x2F;MSNBC&#x2F;FOX&#x2F;WaPo&#x2F;NPR all need to be put in place. They are constantly dousing fuel on the first and blatantly misleading the American people about current events. They have no opposition. They are practically State Sponsored Media.<p>OAN, RSBN, Megyn Kelly, No Agenda Podcast .. hell even Candice Owens .. Newsmax is actually ancient and is suddenly making a comeback out of nowhere because they actually report the news!<p>I think YouTube will be out of the game soon. It&#x27;s going to be a left echo chamber. I&#x27;m surprised they haven&#x27;t shut down Tim Pool yet.<p>We need more alternative outlets, websites and social media networks.')
