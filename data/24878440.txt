Data may be files or objects, tweets or 5TB videos, and you can access it via a phone, browser or FUSE filesystem.<p><i>Edit</i> Downvoted? I don&#x27;t understand. Perkeep contains the same functionality as the post, but much more, is much more mature, and is totally open source (not like the posted software, where the important core, the server, is closed source).')
