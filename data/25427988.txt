But then A-H dissolved, leaving Germany holding the bag. It didn&#x27;t help that Germany refused to negotiate a peace treaty earlier, and that they destroyed the Alsace region during their retreat.<p>But in the end, it would have taken an occupation to demonstrate that Germany actually lost, and that didn&#x27;t happen.<p>Hence the later Allied occupations of Germany and Japan in WW2.')
