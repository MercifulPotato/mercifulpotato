When I compare the cost of vet services with my friends in an urban setting relative to what we pay here in rural, small-town America, I&#x27;m shocked at the difference. We have a university about a two hour drive away with a noted vet hospital - even their services were priced better than those I&#x27;ve heard anecdotally on the other (more urbanized) side  of the state.')
