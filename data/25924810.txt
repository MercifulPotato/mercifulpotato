That&#x27;s pretty much the same thing that I have on the internet when using certain social media. It&#x27;s great since you don&#x27;t have spammers, and you don&#x27;t have to deal with racists or people who just turn up the temperature of a room. Maybe that&#x27;s the way it should be.<p>It&#x27;s also much more difficult to spread vitriolic meme since it has to infiltrate the various disparate communities.<p><i>Moderated communities are basically the HOA neighborhoods of the internet. There is nothing wrong with liking the high property values, but competition alone does not prevent their abuses [3].</i><p>OK. Pretty much any places that aren&#x27;t garbage have moderation of some sort. If nothing else to keep out spam.<p>And a community isn&#x27;t a HOA, which you are basically stuck with if you live in them.')
