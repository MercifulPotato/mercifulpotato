It is reported in English news as &#x27;protesters&#x27; getting their communication cut off. However, about two weeks ago the US president himself and any site or program where &#x27;protesters&#x27; also known as &#x27;rioters&#x27; or &#x27;mobs&#x27; were able to communicate had their communication cut off, even with access to the internet. Besides websites, social media, video hosting sites, web hosting providers, ISPs, domain holders, payment processors, all of the above used censorship in the U.S. The effect of cutting off communication was the same and even these protests are essentially the same reason people in the U.S. were &#x27;protesting.&#x27; So really it is how you define or even how a protest is depicted that determines whether people are for censorship resistant communication.')
