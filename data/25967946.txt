I used to get a lot of value in attending good ones: from the talks, the people I met and the opportunities that came my way off the back of them. When I first left London I didn&#x27;t realise how much I&#x27;d miss them, and still miss them 5 years on.<p>For the last few years finding other remote gigs hasn&#x27;t been a priority for me, but good ones weren&#x27;t the norm. Now there is more opportunity than ever, and I can happily say leaving London has meant a totally different (improved by almost every metric!) quality of life for me and my family.<p>I&#x27;m still looking to find good remote meet ups that give me what I found before, but if that is all I&#x27;m missing out on, then I&#x27;m pretty happy with tie move. I just hope great remote opportunities continue and remote working practices continue to improve.<p>On connections with colleagues, you need to work a little harder to make these stick, but if you put the effort in it can happen. There are work friends I still see socially remotely.')
