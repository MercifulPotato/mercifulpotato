I am a grown adult who can make informed decisions with my money, including sometimes buying frivolous or unnecessary things.<p>I hate these arguments that assume everyone is stupid except for the person making the argument.  It feels like there&#x27;s some weird savior complex at work.<p>People have free will and are allowed to spend their money as they wish, and I think YOU are the cynical one if you think otherwise..')
