Processors have had hardware support for ages. On the Intel side, at least from 2006, with the Core2Duo.<p>Any modern system(even on the low end) that you could conceivably want to trust important data to can handle encryption requirements with ease.<p>One problem if we are talking about Bitlocker specifically is that if the drive reports that it supports encryption, then Bitlocker offloads the responsibility to the drive. And the drive encryption might be badly implemented.')
