That&#x27;s it. There&#x27;s no clue about discrete graphics, NUMA, power budgets etc. It could be that that new mac pro is heading back towards the non-expandable trash-can style design. All they really know is that there&#x27;s going to be something in the mac pro space in 2022 and that&#x27;s the last direct replacement to Intel Macs Apple are making.')
