In the UK liability coverage seems to be intended to pay for the harm, so my last UK insurance had 12M GBP of cover if I remember correctly (and after that limits were removed I believe). In the US it is intended to cover your net worth so if you are sued you don&#x27;t lose anything so when I first moved here and opted for $1Mn they told me I was over insured.')
