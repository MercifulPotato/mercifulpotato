It is an example of marketing as a form of social conditioning, where our brains our conditioned to perform repetitive actions until they become unconscious. While this can be useful for some things (e.g. touch typing), when it is designed to sell you some kind of shitty cookie, phone, or whatever other focus-group-designed consumer product, it is disturbing to me. It&#x27;s training people to consume as a replacement for spiritual or other introspective, healthy rituals in order to make private companies profits. It just seems so soulless to me, to ritualize consumerism and monetary transactions in this way.<p>Can&#x27;t we just make useful things instead of creating new branches of pseudoscience in order to sell more shit that people don&#x27;t need? Imagine all of the brainpower that has gone into developing rituals for this stuff. In the future, I can imagine this kind of marketing morphing into a sort of consumer religion, where these rituals begin to take on a spiritual element.')
