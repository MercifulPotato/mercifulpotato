How much does that bigger vendor cost relative to UBNT?  For example. I needed about 20 48-port gigabit switches for a new building.  Aruba 2530s run about $2k each, so $40k total.  The UBNT equivalent is under $400 each.  I can buy 5 UBNT switches for the cost of 1 Aruba.  Even assuming that I buy 50% extra switches as spares to UBNT, I&#x27;m still only spending $12k for UBNT, a savings of over 65%.')
