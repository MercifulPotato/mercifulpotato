Armchair generals all over the planet kept prattling about them being useless because modern weaponry is awesome and all...<p>Then I went to look properly:<p>1. Kerak de Chevaliers, yes, that one crusader castle, was occupied during the Syrian  war, and gave a hard time to the enemy outside, the castle worked exactly as intended, even with modern weapons.<p>2. Ditto to a bunch of other castles in some past wars.<p>3. A fortified monastery gave enemies a hard time in WW2 in Italy, I forgot its name now.<p>4. Not exactly &quot;ancient castle&quot;, but a &quot;star fort&quot; in France was captured in the opening days of Battle of Verdun, in part because the french leadership believed castles to be outdated and didn&#x27;t garrisoned it properly... the result was that the attempts to retake the fort resulted in 100.000 casualties on the French side before they succeeded.<p>5. Also in Verdun there was a smaller fort, the commander of that fort was old and the military ordered him to retire for medical reasons, he refused and basically &quot;kept&quot; the fort as his own, with a small garrison, the old guy and his small garrison fought fiercely against the invading Germans and caused 3000 casualties to the Germans before they lost.')
