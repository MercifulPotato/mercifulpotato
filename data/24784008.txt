Information spreads in a fundamentally different way over print [1] versus social media. It spreads faster. It spreads more insidiously. And it mutates--not <i>per se</i>, but in the context attached to it.<p>There is also social media&#x27;s concentration. Before cable news, broadcast television was held to stringent standards. As competition emerged that went away. Facebook and Twitter are singular in their domains. Holding them to a higher standard <i>while an election is underway</i> seems reasonable.<p>[1] A newspaper on a website still behaves like print media. It has to be explicitly shared.')
