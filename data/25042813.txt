In fact, is quite vocal about not believing you.<p>- Takes your hard-won repro code (with &quot;a possible workaround, what do you think?&quot;) and is silent for months;<p>- Finally publishes a TR about that bug, along with your very own workaround code, verbatim and unattributed and you never even got an email acknowledging the issue.<p>... and after nearly a year of chasing the stupid thing down, as a last resort grants you a five minute phone audience with the chip designer. Sixty seconds into the problem description he says, &quot;Oh, I know what&#x27;s going on...&quot; and proceeds to fix <i>everything</i> by telling you what parts of the documentation are lies. Your workaround turns out to be how you have to do it. You feel a little ill.<p>An open source SOC would not necessarily be better understood by more people, but it probably couldn&#x27;t be worse.')
