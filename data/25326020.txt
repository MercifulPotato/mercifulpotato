Item(by='toast0', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607283512, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25325351, text='&gt; Only familiar with US building codes but stairway shafts in taller buildings are supposed to be built from thicker concrete, with fire-rated doors, so theoretically they should remain usable for some time (minutes) even if the floors they pass are engulfed.<p>It should be more than minutes. I&#x27;m not at all familiar with residential codes, but have passing awareness of office codes in buildings with a few floors, and those (generally) require a two-hour rating for the materials of a stairwell.<p>Of course, as you mention, if the doors are propped open, locked or blocked shut, or the walls are improperly built or modified, or covered in napalm, the rating doesn&#x27;t mean much. If a high rise building collapses, you&#x27;re pretty much SOL too, although a smaller building would likely have the stairwells stay up.<p>Shelter in place makes sense if the unit is properly fire resistant for long enough for the fire to be controlled or if the exits are unsafe. However, if you&#x27;re going to exit, you probably want to exit sooner than later. It&#x27;s one of those things that you can&#x27;t know the right answer without more information than you probably have.<p>If people panic on the exits, that&#x27;s a recipie for disaster as well.')
