They want their desktop on a phone. They want to use desktop GUI toolkits, desktop package managers and all the rest. Android also contains a mountain of anti features that are hard to remove. Its also missing a lot of critical features without the GApps so maintaining a fork of android is almost as much work as making GTK work on a phone.')
