Have been using it for quite a few years now as my desktop and love the rolling release paradigm.<p>That said, when setting up machines for others I pick the current LTS release of Kubuntu and install unattended-upgrades to ensure security updates get maintained. It provides a much better ongoing maintenance story for machines that are less &quot;pets&quot; and more &quot;tools&quot;.<p>ยง<p>Due to a disk crash, I recently had to reinstall Arch for the first time in quite a few years. IMO the install process has become more opaque. I seem to remember the wiki use to have a newbie install guide which was really helpful and explained a lot of things as you go, or at least what the common practices were or the pros and cons of different options. That seems to be gone and anything that may be an opinion seems to be excised from any install instructions, and you&#x27;re left to stumble around different pages a lot more, which is a bit of a shame.')
