For popular collections of packages, a pre-built apk.</i><p>FPM could probably generate APKs in addition to the source archive and package types that it already supports.<p>The conda-forge package CI flow is excellent. There&#x27;s a bot that sends a Pull Request to update the version number in the conda package <i>feedstock</i> meta.yml when it detects that e.g. there&#x27;s a new version of the source package on e.g. PyPI. When a PR is merged, conda-forge builds on Win&#x2F;Mac&#x2F;Lin and publishes the package to the conda-forge package channel (`conda install -y -c conda-forge jupyterlab pandas`)<p>The Fedora GitOps package workflow is great too, but bugzilla isn&#x27;t Markdown by default.<p>Keeping those APKs updated and rebuilt is work.')
