Lots of agreement on reboots, remote admin, where you put your disks (local SSD is just incredibly fast for pretty low cost relative to anything).<p>iDRAC enterprise licenses are $50 or much less on ebay. TinyPilot looks better though! This has ALWAYS been a pain point for me - I just hate the cable &#x2F; monitor &#x2F; keyboard dance.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about a home build recently - 1GBps to the house with redundent wireless ISP on roof has made this more appealing. I&#x27;m mostly pure AWS and wanting to try GCP, so just torn between doing the GCP experience buildout (more sensible) and the home server (more fun).')
