The FPGA is separate from the SSD controller, which is an off the shelf Samsung controller. A portion of the FPGA&#x27;s resources are used as a PCIe switch: the FPGA is connected to the host PCIe link and presents one PCIe endpoint for the FPGA and one for the SSD that is connected through the FPGA.<p>Other companies in the computational storage area are putting compute resources onto their SSD controller ASICs so that the compute doesn&#x27;t have a PCIe bottleneck between it and the NAND. But you won&#x27;t see that kind of design coming out of a Samsung&#x2F;Xilinx collaboration.')
