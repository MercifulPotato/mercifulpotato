Then trace through the program paths, using that assumption (which limits those paths).  If it loops back to the location with a different value in the variable or different value for the branch condition, broaden the assumption and update the trace.<p>A pessimistic analysis might initially assume the variable at a particular location could have any value because it hasn&#x27;t yet traced everywhere to find out the possibilities, or initially assume both directions at the branch could happen and include them both in the trace.  By the time it finishes tracing all paths and values, those assumptions may turn out pessimistic and it can start pruning away unused options.<p>These two strategies can yield different answers, and for some analyses the optimistic strategy gives more accurate results than the pessimistic strategy.<p>So which one is more &quot;real&quot;? :-)')
