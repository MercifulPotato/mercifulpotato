If my family was killed by a bombing attack I would want to get to the bottom of why it happened in the first place without just blaming an entire population and justifying their genocide.<p>When someone bombs your family you take the time to find out why they were bombed and try to understand the otherside before shutting down the otherside.<p>But when someone voices their own opinion. You just call their opinion disgusting and accuse them of genocide.<p>The man is obviously not supporting genocide. If the chinese are supporting genocide than the man obviously doesn&#x27;t know but an accusation of genocide needs extreme proof and right now there&#x27;s only rumors.<p>Maybe what&#x27;s really going on is you&#x27;re selectively applying your empathy to whatever suits your preconceived viewpoint.')
