LACNIC is a regional entity that controls the supply of blocks of ipv4&#x2F;ipv6 addresses, issued to ISPs.<p>The IP address is not &quot;registered&quot; to LACNIC, it comes <i>from</i> LACNIC and is issued to an ISP. As does any other IP address for an ISP with a business address in the LACNIC region.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lacnic.net&#x2F;631&#x2F;2&#x2F;lacnic&#x2F;coverage-area" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lacnic.net&#x2F;631&#x2F;2&#x2F;lacnic&#x2F;coverage-area</a><p>The IP you&#x27;ve posted belongs to a &#x2F;24 block issued to autonomous system AS262254, which does appear to be a Belize corporation with a mail.ru (russian version of free gmail&#x2F;yahoo webmail) contact address.<p>The fact that it&#x27;s a mail.ru address doesn&#x27;t really say anything, anymore than a person anywhere in the world can access a yahoo or gmail webmail address over https in a browser.<p>Take a look at global BGP tables for where the &#x2F;24 that contains that address is actually being announced from, and what other upstream transit&#x2F;peer ASes are adjacent to it.<p>The AS in question appears to have as its primary upstream AS57724, which does seem to represent itself as a Russian hosting&#x2F;DDoS filtering company.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ddos-guard.net&#x2F;en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ddos-guard.net&#x2F;en</a><p>aut-num:     AS262254\nowner:       DDOS-GUARD CORP.\nownerid:     BZ-DALT-LACNIC\nresponsible: Evgeniy Marchenko\naddress:     1&#x2F;2Miles Northern Highway, --, --\naddress:     -- - Belize - BZ\ncountry:     BZ\nphone:       +7 928 2797045\nowner-c:     HUN8\nrouting-c:   HUN8\nabuse-c:     HUN8\ncreated:     20121205\nchanged:     20170825\ninetnum:     190.115.16.0&#x2F;20\ninetnum:     2803:f900::&#x2F;32\ninetnum:     186.2.160.0&#x2F;20<p>nic-hdl:     HUN8\nperson:      Huan Nadas\ne-mail:      xengine@mail.ru\naddress:     Avenue Jorge Perez Concha, 712, -\naddress:     090511 - Guayaquil - \ncountry:     EC\nphone:       +7  9282797045 [0000]\ncreated:     20150320\nchanged:     20200923')
