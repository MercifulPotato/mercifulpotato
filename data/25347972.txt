Pretty much never happens, but it&#x27;s good to know the option is there. Most issues are with a specific software and not the OS, so I need to have a visual to help resolve, e.g. &quot;Where is my contact list in Viber?&quot; or &quot;Why do I see this page?&quot;.<p>Plus, I&#x27;m running Pi-Hole in docker and I ssh to upgrade it from time to time, (docker pull, docker-compose down&#x2F;up, etc.). I haven&#x27;t bothered automating this because some things change between releases and I still end up doing manual configuration changes.')
