I was applying for a senior dev role and if I couldn&#x27;t deliver a tiny web app, I wouldn&#x27;t hire me either. I could have just solved the task procedurally but I asked if they wanted to see a more OO solution to demo a bit more knowledge. I think back to that time and think how poor my env&#x2F;tooling was back 5 years ago compared to today. I&#x27;m way more powerful now. Version control. Docker up an entire server architecture now with separated proxy, web, db server, env configs, &amp; more. I routinely challenge myself to starting scratch projects to test myself because I rarely work on greenfield projects these days. When I encounter resistance in the workflow, I work to solve the roadblocks. I think this is an important dev exercise that brings alot of satisfaction. Constantly improve your tooling!')
