Even if I am a fan of Delphi&#x2F;Lazarus for what they deliver, native GUI programs that generally have no dependencies, I think some parts of the Pascal language were designed for ease of the compiler and less for the programmer.<p>Here are a few features that prevent Pascal from being my go-to language:<p>* Having all function variables declared in var clauses at the start, far away from where they are first used. It eventually gets littered by loop indices and other temporary variables.<p>* &quot;interface&quot; sections that can easily grow (C&#x2F;C++ header files are also somewhat similarly inconvenient).<p>But then again, these languages have been around when computers are not as powerful. And perhaps, keeping these rules is the price of not breaking what works.<p>Still, I doubt language design alone is enough to make compilation fast (i.e. why FPC is not as fast). There must have been a lot of sorcery in the Borland compilers that we will never know. Also they must have taken advantage of only supporting Windows (and only x86?) back then.')
