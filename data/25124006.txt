Demanding that Chinese-Australians (who were born in Australia) testify in front of parliament that they unconditionally condemn CCP.

Do a search for his name on any news site and see what else he&#x27;s said.<p>I can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t defend him. I&#x27;d note that your 3rd link was about how the other parties in parliament tried to get him to apologize and only failed along party lines.<p>I agree with your characterisation of Chinese&#x2F;Western relations. I&#x27;d note in addition that China clearly decide a couple of years back to take advantage of the US&#x27;s confused Asia policy and has been quite aggressive because they see a time window to act in.')
