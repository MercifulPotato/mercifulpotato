I&#x27;d look through to see what I wanted to watch, circle some things and then watch. No spying what-so-ever.<p>So, I like for example HN where AFAIK I&#x27;m not tracked so much and I choose what I want from the top of the list.<p>Conversely I mostly hate Amazon, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, Youtube, Twitter, Instagram, and all the ad services and any other service that uses some algorithm to decide what to put in my face.<p>It&#x27;s to the point that 3 out 4 time I&#x27;ll open videos in private windows so they don&#x27;t get added to my profile and used for recommendations.<p>I don&#x27;t mind going to a tech sight and seeing ads for tech or a car site and seeing ads for cars. Do mind visiting an apartment listing site and then going around the net and having every other sight shove ads for apartments in my face.')
