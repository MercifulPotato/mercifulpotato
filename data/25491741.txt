My family emigrated to the US as penniless refugees just ten years prior to me starting at this company. I went to NYC public schools and a state university. I got very lucky having parents with high expectations, some good teachers along the way, and a natural interest in computers and problem solving. I thank god every day for that mix of things and for our ability to come to the US. But &quot;privilege&quot; sounds like I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth that somehow allowed me to skate through life and have people pay for my shit. Frankly, it goes the other way. When I was in junior highschool, my &quot;privileged&quot; classmates were playing with Sega and Nintendo while I was trying to figure out how to get the TRS-80 that I found in the trash, to work. Ironically, that kind of &quot;play&quot; enabled me to get whatever I got down the road. Virtuous cycles are a thing but to call everything &quot;privileges&quot; misses our own agency.')
