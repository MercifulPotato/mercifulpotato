None.<p>But the theory is that b&#x2F;c we can&#x27;t properly differentiate between patients with Alzheimer&#x27;s Dementia and those with other forms of dementia (such as Vascular Dementia), that any clinical trial could be pointless if a statistically significant number of patients have some other dementia instead of Alzheimer&#x27;s Dementia. The coolest thing about a real quantitative test is the ability to vet patients in a clinical trial. In the last 20 years, literally HUNDREDS of interventions have gone to trial for Alzheimer&#x27;s, but none have passed. Imagine if one of those interventions already was the cure, but we didn&#x27;t know b&#x2F;c the data was skewed by other forms of dementia patients!!!<p>So the first step in getting a treatment for Alzheimer&#x27;s is to know if the patients has Alzheimer&#x27;s :)')
