Why don&#x27;t we?<p>For a large subsets of those categories, they already are. That&#x27;s why, if you mostly buy food that&#x27;s handled by automation (combines etc.) you can sustain yourself on a $50&#x2F;month food budget. Similarly for furniture, check out IKEA factory videos to see the degree of automation employed in making cheap furniture.\nElectronics are mostly also produced by machines, humans do the last stage assembly only (and it&#x27;s mostly because labor in Asia is just cheaper than sophisticated robots required to perform assembly).<p>Clothes are more difficult from a robotics standpoint (mostly because, unlike wood, cloth is not rigid&#x2F;does not retain shape, which makes it insanely tricky to manipulate), so we&#x27;re not there yet. But, on the other hand, making of the cloth itself, which previously required an insane amount of labor, has been fully automated for a long time.<p>Basically, once you own a place to live in, you can easily sustain yourself with a very part-time minimum wage job. Make the job pay more and you&#x27;d need to work maybe a month in year. Most people don&#x27;t do that because they want the comforts and pleasures brought by market enough to work extra hours for them (usually up to a full-time job).')
