Item(by='pfalcon', descendants=None, kids=[25624160], score=None, time=1609694344, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25622527, text='&gt; From what you&#x27;re saying, I believe you would complain about a foreign language simply because it doesn&#x27;t resemble your native language enough.<p>I assume you mean a natural language. No, I won&#x27;t complain about a real language used by people. I might criticize someone&#x27;s inventing their own natural language. The same as I do for programming languages. And I&#x27;m very well familiar with the &quot;we need to invent to move forward&quot; argument. I also assume that people taking that ungrateful task are aware that they will receive criticism for that.<p>&gt; just that it isn&#x27;t the syntax you&#x27;re used to.<p>Not just me, but many people. I specifically started to comment, seeing other people&#x27;s feedback resonates with my own sentiment about Zig.<p>&gt; certainly doesn&#x27;t excuse the hostility of your comments in this thread.<p>I don&#x27;t think there was particular &quot;hostility&quot;, but I indeed try to nail right at the spot of the issues. Ouch! Beyond that, I allowed me some sour comments regarding downvoting other peoples&#x27; and my comments where concerns were raised  with way Zig does some things. Such downvoting could be considered hostility, but I actually consider it funny ;-).')
