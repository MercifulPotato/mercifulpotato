Item(by='skissane', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609721027, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25622082, text='&gt; I wouldn&#x27;t call it a clone, anymore than I would call, say, Linux, a &quot;clone&quot; of Windows for needing to have a similar feature-set to appease newcomers. Much like linux vs windows, octave and matlab started life as completely different things, but octave being the &#x27;underdog&#x27; and having a similar enough syntax necessarily tried to match matlab&#x27;s syntax, to the extent that they pride on compatibility (and treat non-compatibility as &#x27;bugs&#x27;)<p>Nobody calls Linux a &quot;clone&quot; of Windows or vice versa, because even when they implement the same features, in the vast majority of cases the command syntax, APIs, etc, are radically different. There are a few commonalities, but when they exist, they are almost always because both have decided to implement some pre-existing standard. Even when Windows borrows features from Linux&#x2F;Unix, it normally changes the API in incompatible ways â€“ Windows 10 added pty support copied from Unix and Linux, but came up with an incompatible API to do it (CreatePseudoConsole)<p>It is the fact that Octave quite intentionally copied a lot of Matlab&#x27;s syntax which leads it to being called a &quot;clone&quot;. If they hadn&#x27;t done that, nobody would apply that term.<p>&gt; I think it&#x27;s safe to say that matlab has &#x27;borrowed&#x27; a lot of octave&#x27;s nicer features over the years too (though obviously it&#x27;s not something that can be publically admitted), like implicit broadcasting, command-line functions etc.<p>When Matlab &quot;borrows&quot; features from Octave, does it intentionally choose the same syntax, or does it implement the feature in an incompatible way? The former would constitute cloning, the later would not.')
