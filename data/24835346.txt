It just happens to be the case, that I ordered the wrong thing. Simple as that.<p>As I travel to the appropriate link, there is none such ability or option. I relay the appropriate message to their customer service. Fast forward a day later, they were unable to reply to my message in time, they have already processed the order, and are actually begging me to accept the purchase because as a small company they are incapable of managing their customer service department.<p>All in all, I felt bad that they would have lost a substantial amount on my cancellation or refund. But I can&#x27;t help but feel the entire situation could have been avoided if they had eschewed the &quot;benefit&quot; of &quot;automating&quot; their customer service.<p>I think a good reason Salesforce has been so successful is that they force users to abide by the one-reply system of following up on customers.')
