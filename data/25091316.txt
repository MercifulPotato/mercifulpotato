But it&#x27;s core i-based, so it needs some work regarding Intel ME etc.<p>The Linux support is amazing, the only thing with Thinkpads is the synaptics driver which needs a config file to make it work as you want it to.<p>The thinkwiki contains a lot of information about all models, including a list of known problems.

Sometimes there were OEM versions out there where the EFI vars could be deleted and then it&#x27;s bricked unless you flash coreboot or reflash the original BIOS on it with an adapter.<p>If you want to go full tinfoil and libre, why not switch to a pinebook?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thinkwiki.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Category:Models" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thinkwiki.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Category:Models</a>')
