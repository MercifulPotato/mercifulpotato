Any other stance can only be made in bad faith.<p>That is in itself an extremely bad faith statement.<p>&gt; Just look at relative harm numbers, the stats (especially at something like the EU level) are available publicly.<p>Yes, look at them. They do not support your statement because you are asserting that the corellation is basically linear, but I was talking about an (entirely hypothetical) scenario that is completely outside the data, namely full legalization.<p>No EU state has legalized heroin or cocaine. The poster boy for decriminalization is Portugal, but they haven&#x27;t even legalized <i>use</i>, let alone production or distribution. They have merely turned use into an administrative offense rather than a criminal one and are providing a lot of harm-reduction services.<p>There is a <i>huge</i> difference between that and full legalization where big business spends billions on advertising to market addictive substances - which is the situation we have with alcohol that leads to a lot of harm.')
