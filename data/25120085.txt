I think the attack on safe harbor is a way to make it easy for supranational unelected and unaccountable entities like Facebook to engage in censorship activities which will limit discourse to whatever the power brokers in Washington deem acceptable. The social media companies must be reigned in, but not by suppressing speech. Instead, I advocate for their nationalization so that way the 1st amendment will unambiguously apply to their activities.')
