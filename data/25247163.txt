First allocate sufficient objects in named pools by type and explicitly initialize and reclaim them. Second do not use Java expressions that allocate iterator objects such as for(String myString : myStrings). Local block scope objects are allocated efficiently from the stack.<p>In Java, a custom String pool can be created that allows == comparisons instead of equals() comparisons.<p>Java threads can be pinned to physical cores and spin locks used to waste CPU while awaiting requests. The local CPU cache stays hot and ready.')
