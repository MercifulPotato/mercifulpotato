This means text is highly visible - I treat posting with a certain long-term awareness.<p>I have parsed many old forums after a search engine sent me there - this has been my primary education tool for different things. Niche issues encountered by several strangers across the world can be resolved by someone who made a post one time so it can occupy some hardware storage, perhaps many times archived in several scattered drives depending on its contribution value, from where it can be served to anyone else who needs it in the future.<p>Web forum archive shuttering described by the author would limit information available for the search engine to parse. But the author&#x27;s solution is to reduce contribution effort because forums may disappear one day? [1]<p>I agree with you -  within a week of something posted  is when the &quot;work&quot; gets done (and idea transmitted out of internet into physical group of people who can relay the memory). Seeing a snapshot of a helpful interaction between people skilled in different domains sharing observations&#x2F;stories&#x2F;explanations is often inspiring to me and so I would want the creators of this content to put their best foot forward instead of treating it as disposable  communication  space.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nihilism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nihilism</a>')
