The joke stems from Greenlandic having very little polysemy when it comes to hunting, nature, practicalities and activities, while European languages is quite a bit more polysemic in nature.<p>I don&#x27;t know how well this joke translates into English but it works very well in Danish. Here it goes:<p>&gt; A Danish police officer gets called on the radio by a Greenlandic hunter who has been in an accident. The hunter tells that his partner have fallen into the water and have been pulled up again but might have died from the freezing water. The officer tells the hunter to &quot;make sure he is dead&quot;. Over the radio the officer hears a riffle shot and the hunter replies: &quot;There, he&#x27;s dead now for sure&quot;.<p>The design of Inuktitut and Greenlandic is very in tune with nature but I agree that it doesn&#x27;t mean you can absorb it&#x27;s qualities into other languages. That said, doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t learn anything from them, as the author fo the article claims.')
