Anyone can choose whatever combination of whatever they want and most people never touch the normal chain. This is the reality right now, there are lots of choices, people can use any or all of them. Why would transaction volumes change any of this?<p>It makes zero sense because I was trying to infer your argument. Let&#x27;s try again then: what does having multiple chains have to do with scalability?<p>&gt;That makes absolutely no sense at all. A full node for every crypto currency can be run on a $35 raspberry pi with a hard drive hooked up by anyone that can watch a youtube video. Your numbers are just a lie, the entire bitcoin chain is 1&#x2F;25th of an 8TB hard drive which can be bought new for $150 USD.<p>Those are with present numbers which have the 1MB limit in place. Clearly those assumptions won&#x27;t hold if we have much larger blocks.<p>&gt;Then it&#x27;s a good thing that isn&#x27;t true, since most people never touch it and those that do probably don&#x27;t have to spend anything at all.<p>Sounds like you&#x27;re not denying the anti-decentralization aspect at all, but rather arguing that it doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>&gt;These are lies, there is no truth to what you are saying and you know it.<p>Please follow the HN guidelines: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>. Specifically &quot;Assume good faith&quot;.<p>&gt; If there was any validity you would have a better explanation than made up numbers and nothing else.<p>I don&#x27;t get it which numbers are made up? The $90&#x2F;year figure came from a sibling comment that was discussing the hypothetical storage requirement for bitcoin if it processed half of visa&#x27;s transaction volume. That was surprisingly close to the annual electricity cost for the best selling refrigerator on bestbuy.com[1], so that&#x27;s what I assumed you were talking about when it comes to costs. If you don&#x27;t agree with these numbers, feel free to present your calculations.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bestbuy.com&#x2F;site&#x2F;samsung-26-5-cu-ft-large-capacity-3-door-french-door-refrigerator-with-family-hub-and-external-water-ice-dispenser-stainless-steel&#x2F;6401622.p?skuId=6401622" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bestbuy.com&#x2F;site&#x2F;samsung-26-5-cu-ft-large-capaci...</a>')
