Item(by='nullpilot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607468928, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25350071, text='&gt; How do you feel about a keyboard that woulld learn from your typing behaviour (Also adapting to your language preferences)?<p>Minuum does that to make sense of what you type on the tiny board. It gets better over time and I&#x27;ve ported my data over from the last phone. But, given how much has happened in ML over the last few years, I have no doubt it could be done much better now. I enjoy it on a per-language level, but my experience with mixing dictionaries has always been awful and more of a hindrance than anything else. I eventually gave up and switched to just swiping through languages. That has been second nature since, with basically no mental overhead.<p>I personally wouldn&#x27;t expect mixed-dictionary as a feature, and if it&#x27;s there it would have to be pretty much flawless to convince me to give up that control. Then again, this might have been a problem that particularly affects Minuum, and with no overlap between the space that letters occupy, maybe it&#x27;s much more manageable.<p>Either way, I&#x27;m excited for what you&#x27;re doing and appreciate the opportunity to geek out about this topic. Thanks for reading!')
