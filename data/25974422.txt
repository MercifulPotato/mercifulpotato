It is routinely prescribed. The problems are that it does seem for most people the effect is short lived (weeks) and psychosis is a thing (the poster below saying it’s never an issue even in pain setting is simply mistaken). The thing is that neither of these are uncommon problems for psych meds in general so ketamine shouldn’t be singled out for this, but it’s more complicated then some of the armchair docs here make it seem.<p>There is continuing research into regimens that might minimize the tachyphylaxis, but it’s an ongoing problem.')
