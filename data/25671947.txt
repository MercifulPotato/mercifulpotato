I&#x27;m simply drawing attention to the fact that things which you take to be obvious facts, aren&#x27;t. If you ask &quot;which things&quot;, my short answer is, as far as I can tell, pretty much anything you believe that isn&#x27;t based on something you saw with your own eyes or checked in detail yourself is questionable, because there are no reliable sources of information in our society. (That means <i>none</i>--on <i>any</i> side of any debate. That&#x27;s what makes the current situation so difficult.)<p><i>&gt; Did you also stop touching all surfaces&#x2F;disinfecting your phone, groceries, etc.?</i><p>No. We did wear gloves (medical grade vinyl or nitrile) when doing things like grocery shopping, and washed our hands after handling those items.<p><i>&gt; If not, you had no reason not to at the time</i><p>What drove our general actions was our own common sense and background knowledge about how viruses generally propagate. We were looking at whatever data was available, but we didn&#x27;t give it a lot of weight because we knew the virus was new and anything said about it was tentative, and also because of the general unreliability of information sources that I mentioned above.<p><i>&gt; Social distancing was highlighted very early on.</i><p>Not as early as we started doing it. It wasn&#x27;t until we had been doing it for several weeks that we saw it being emphasized in the media, and it wasn&#x27;t until a week or two after <i>that</i> that we saw it actually becoming common in our area. We also watched spring break happening in various places with no signs of precautions or social distancing, several weeks after we had started doing those things.')
