I think I have found out how to use gphoto2 and a direct usb link instead of the capture card, which may fix it, but that&#x27;ll have to run on my main computer, not my slow laptop.<p>I&#x27;d love to be able to tell the v4l driver for the usb capture card to just not offer the 640*480 resolution. That would fix it in a better way. Anyone have any ideas how to do that?')
