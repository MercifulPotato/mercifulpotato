Item(by='NovemberWhiskey', descendants=None, kids=[24921097], score=None, time=1603903210, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24920538, text='My car has the current-edition Toyota&#x2F;Lexus system. First of all, it&#x27;s worth saying there&#x27;re a whole slew of ancillary safety systems beyond the &#x27;nominal case driving&#x27; automation, like rear-crossing detection, collision brake assistance, blindspot warning and so on.<p>For the self-driving stuff, I really only use the radar cruise control. The car does have lane self-centering but it&#x27;s not great at detecting lane boundaries, especially when in bad weather or when there&#x27;s a lot of traffic.<p>I have that system turned to an advisory mode so it&#x27;ll beep if I start moving across a lane boundary without a turn signal on.<p>The radar cruise control is very solid. My only real complaint about it is that it leaves a large gap at low speed; even when in its tightest-follow mode. You can end up getting people merging in front of you, which then causes it to generate an even larger gap. It will take off from a stop, but if it&#x27;s a long stop it wants you to hit a resume button.<p>I understand how the systems work at this point, they don&#x27;t surprise me, and they help with fatigue. I&#x27;m generally an attentive driver (I know, we all say that) so I&#x27;m OK with the limitations. I don&#x27;t really want any more.<p>Very anecdotally, the last time I tried a lane-following system (an Audi rental about two years ago), it tried to kill me by following the off-ramp into a gas station at 65mph.')
