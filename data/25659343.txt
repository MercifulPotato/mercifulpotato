Keep in mind that creating a CTE doesn&#x27;t really materialize any of the resulting steps&#x27; data, it&#x27;s just a way to encapsulate logic. Chaining together complex CTEs is effectively the same as creating layers of views, which can also be a performance problem.<p>In the case of a temp table, you&#x27;re likely intelligently (manually) going through the process of whittling down the data to only what you need and in the most efficient ways possible. Maybe you&#x27;re filtering by date upfront, then by some other filter, removing as many rows as is possible as quickly as possible. With the CTE(s), it might be creating a list of many filters with a lot of joins in one step, and the optimizer may not understand which filters can remove the most rows the most easily.')
