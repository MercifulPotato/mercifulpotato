There are tools that make it less hard, but when NeXT was created, X was not what it is today, Wayland didn&#x27;t exist, and they didn&#x27;t need a network-transparent windowing system because the fashionable model of the day was client-server. More than that, by dropping most of X, the memory requirements were much lower and UI lag was minimal. These were probably the guiding principles for pretty much every decision they made.<p>Much like Microsoft, Apple doesn&#x27;t want macOS or iOS apps to run on anything other than their platform. For any OS, the winning strategy to gain market is encouraging porting to the platform and discouraging porting <i>away</i> from it.')
