Both Google and, especially, Apple have spent millions of dollars, hours, and effort to create their respective App Stores and the people and tools needed to run them. There&#x27;s a reason why there&#x27;s a difference, in the real world, between a Walmart and a Target or Sprouts. Likewise, there&#x27;s a difference between Apple, Google, or anyone else&#x27;s App Stores. The main difference being that Apple makes it easy and far less risky for customers to pay for what they&#x27;re getting.
