All I can find are references to CNBC where a journalist claims &quot;from what I understand&quot; Melvin is out of the stock.<p>The problem with this is that it&#x27;s easy for the CEO to later say &quot;the journalist misunderstood&quot; or &quot;I said we covered <i>some</i> of our position (1% is &#x27;some&#x27; right?)&quot; or many other things.<p>Is there a definitive statement from Melvin themselves anywhere?')
