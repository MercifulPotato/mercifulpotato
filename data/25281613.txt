I think the main other necessary data point is that this was an &quot;electronic&quot; lottery. There was a video somewhere (can&#x27;t find it) where the National Lottery supposedly explains why &quot;this isn&#x27;t unusual&quot;.<p>In the video they must have mentioned the phrase &quot;random number generator&quot; at least 5 times and never explained why the numbers aren&#x27;t unusual.<p>Brings to mind the people in the 2000s that built dice throwing machines and then piped the results to online random number services. Whatever was wrong with our classic lottery ball machine?<p>PJvZ')
