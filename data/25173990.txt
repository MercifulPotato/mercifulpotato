Obviously, that is adding a transaction cost, which is not desirable.<p>But let&#x27;s think of a more privacy secure way to create an easy pass like system.<p>The obvious problem of easypass systems is they track cars by license plates and thus create a massive database of which car went through when.<p>But it could be legally required to purge the license plate data of cars that paid.<p>You could get a signal when going through the tollway that indicates the amount to pay. You could send a transaction via a cryptocurrency with a signed message on the transaction and then a separate API call to the state tollway system telling them which license plate was just paid for by the transaction.<p>Then any vehicles that had paid would be converted into effectively cash records with the license plate number purged.<p>Thus, data is only retained on those who broke the law and didn&#x27;t pay.<p>While obviously this requires a government to see privacy as enough of a concern to adopt such data purge policies, it is totally possible.<p>If anyone else can think of a way to allow pay for road usage solutions that are more privacy secure, I&#x27;d love to hear them.')
