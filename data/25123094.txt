The argument “well this is a hard domain so tools will be complicated” I don’t buy at all.<p>The complexity is mostly accidental and down to poor UX choices and legacy.<p>As an example: why is the centralized binary storage system  (LFS) using http when git isn’t? The answer: because it’s not really part of git. Congratulations, you now have two sets of auth and network issues instead of one.<p>Git is design damage by Unix philosophy. It does one thing and lets programs interact via command line. The problem with that for a tool that humans use is people want consistent simple UX, not unchanging UX. Scripts want unchanging UX, don’t care about consistency or simplicity.<p>Git is simply too low level for most users. As an example, it doesn’t even know which repo is the central one! It’s so low level that repos are repos. Yet few of us would consider our local repo to be equivalent to the blessed central repository and it would certainly help with many operations.')
