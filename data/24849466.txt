I think this speaks more to the fundamental problems of market pressure than anything else.  Once Google became public they were beholden to shareholders to continue to grow and increase value.  It&#x27;s hard to do that without purchases, acquisitions, and defense of existing territory.<p>I do think Google, and other companies, need to be fundamentally broken up.  However, there seems to be some underlying problems in the public market way of life in America that almost forces companies down this path.<p>I also think we need some broad new antitrust laws.  Any market with fewer than 4 competitors is not a competitive market.  Any market where a single competitor has more than 50% of the share is not a competitive market.')
