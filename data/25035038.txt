It&#x27;s a nice idea conceptually, but the problem is psychological. People stop caring about tracing when 98% of all trace connections are false positives. If a person is infectious for a week and the r0 is around 1 then only 1 person of all the people they&#x27;ve been in contact with will actually contract the virus on average. The other 50+ people, assuming they can even be traced, get a false positive. Or to put it differently, people have to be called 50 times and get tested and self-isolate 50 times before they actually test positive. And for younger people 80% of cases are completely inconsequential. You might think 50 contacts is unrealistically high, but most people still go to work, to school, see friends, use public transportation, etc.<p>Covid19 would also be over if people with symptoms would just stay home. But that&#x27;s clearly not happening either. We&#x27;ve got to be realistic about how people behave in the real world.<p>Mutations aren&#x27;t a serious concern. Because when viruses mutate it&#x27;s the strains that are more infectious and less lethal that win out.')
