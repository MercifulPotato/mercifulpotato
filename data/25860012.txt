However in practical terms the reach of those messages is severely limited. Did you know the President has a weekly radio address?<p>Besides inauguration day, do you remember reading official documents on the whitehouse.gov website? I never have. Nor have I ever gone to AOC&#x27;s official house.gov site to read her messages. But I do know what she&#x27;s saying on Twitter.<p>Not to belabor the point but where the message is delivered is a huge factor in whether or not the message will even be noticed.')
