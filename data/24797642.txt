PETA? Antifa? Twitter&#x27;s executive board? Are they extremists?<p>I can find probably millions of people that would agree that they are in fact, extremists. In fact, the Nazis argued that Jews and Communists were evil. Of course, in Soviet Russia and China, the anti-communists were the extremists...and died by the tens of millions as a result.<p>To the extent that laws are actually broken, those crimes should be prosecuted.<p>Speech is a natural right and needs to be protected as such.<p>The U.S. went through the 40s all the while generally protecting the first amendment. The German Nazis went around torturing and bullying everyone who disagreed with them. Your proposal is closer to Nazism than anything I&#x27;ve heard of.')
