That body was renamed the Congress of the Confederation; but most Americans continued to call it the Continental Congress, since its organization remained the same</i><p>So basically we&#x27;re disagreeing over whether or not a 12 (or 8) year period between 1777 (or arguably, 1781) and 1789 represents a confederation in which the concepts of free movement of labor and capital existed in a way at least somewhat analogous to the way they do in the EEC&#x2F;EU.<p>I&#x27;d say they do not. Given that Wealth of Nations was only published in 1776, I&#x27;m not even sure that these concepts existed clearly in the minds of most of the people it would have to existed in in order for the post-AoC-pre-federal USA to be usefully said to be anything like the EU.')
