It says so right on the paper bill: &quot;This note is legal tender.&quot; Money only means something if people believe it means something. I can make up a new currency but if no one believes it has value, then it does not. Any and every economist you find will tell you the same.<p>With this sort of flexibility you are forced to abandon the zero-sum style of monetary policy, and you open up a lot of new possibilities for how to interact with the flows of monies. Republicans who shriek about the deficit know this, too, but keep their rhetoric the same because they and their friends benefit from the general public believing that the federal government works like &quot;a family at the kitchen table,&quot; because they can shut down any talk of federal spending by pointing to that boogeyman.')
