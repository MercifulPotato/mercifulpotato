The test coverage was enormous and gave us great confidence. The feature selection was done carefully. Big tasks, very little frustration.<p>Ever since the company started growing faster, everything we have achieved just seems to be turning into this huge mess. The number of systems goes through the roof. The overall management of these systems became very poor.<p>Passwords are found in source repositories, servers and processes appear to be not monitored in production, the feature selection became a democratic vote between business people, writing tests is skipped way too often, code is not cleaned up before committing, merge requests are incomplete and what not. The data science team even refuses to even talk about their practices. They just SSH&#x2F;RDP into their servers, install dozens random products, hack away some Python or R or whatnot, take a database dump here and there. No GIT, no docs, no tickets, no nothing.<p>In short: Many new hires in a short time frame brought a huge lack in good practice and craftsmanship into the company.<p>Should the &quot;Head of IT&quot; of roughly 50 people even bother with the all the many little details of the work produced? Do they usually work at higher levels of abstraction and simply hold the teams accountable if things to south? How might an IT supervisor actively prevent things from going south in the first place?<p>What are some traits of good IT&#x2F;tech-leads, that you worked with?<p>I would live to hear your wisdom and stories on this.')
