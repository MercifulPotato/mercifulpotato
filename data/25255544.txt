Each of them doesn&#x27;t take long - always under a minute. However, the annoying part was that I&#x27;d forget about what I was working on before - the cost of context-switching.<p>That is why we built a non-immersive calendar experience. An user would hit a shortcut to load up their calendar nearly instantly on the page itself. From there, Motion makes actions like creating events or sharing availability easier with better UX and built-in workflows. For example, to share your availabilities with someone, Motion automates that workflow (by using your personal preferences and running a logic on existing events to maximize maker&#x27;s time). Once you are done using the calendar, just hit escape to get rid of it. You haven&#x27;t left the page at all.<p>We are also working on a desktop app, as we&#x27;d love to use the calendar inside apps like Zoom and PyCharm.<p>We believe this kind of non-immersive approach can apply to all actions that take less than a minute - such as checking the email you just received or viewing a Jira ticket. For longer tasks that require deeper focus, an immersive experience is necessary - such as note-taking or coding. Here&#x27;s our vision: in the future, whenever you need to perform a quick action in another app, instead of switching over to that app, Motion would bring to you the only component you need (an input form, a message, a textbox...etc).<p>We&#x27;d love to hear your feedback, and let us know what other apps would benefit from this non-immersive approach.')
