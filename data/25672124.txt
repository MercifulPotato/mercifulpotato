There&#x27;s packages, with excellent software engineering structure, that are designed to include documentation and tests.<p>R has so much good software engineering, that clever people with no software engineering background can easily make their own packages!<p>And come on, the R language is a masterpiece. It&#x27;s not cobbled together like JavaScript or bash. It&#x27;s got impeccable functional programming language pedigree, you can even look at the AST directly of a function directly inside code.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how you came to any of your conclusions, other than not bothering to understand the language to start. It&#x27;s a beautiful language with a messy, user contributed set of stats code.')
