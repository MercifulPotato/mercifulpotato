It&#x27;s unfair that just because you have the right job you can get those benefits. I also think that Uber and the like, by passing prop 22, are trying to short circuit the system so they can profit from not having to give benefits to workers by having society pick up the costs of not providing benefits. They need to disrupt the benefits system too and figure out a way for workers to work and get what they need.<p>Prop 22 is the wrong way to do it. It should not pass.')
