Stop with the madness and made up crap... tell voters what you will do for them and the issues that matter!  Politics doesn&#x27;t need to be reality TV but that&#x27;s what it has become and not just because of only the reality tv star in office; again both sides feed this madness&#x2F;reality tv drama b.s.<p>The Atlantic ... is a joke just like the majority outlets feeding this reality tv narrative!  Which is just about each and everyone of them; most local news isnt as bad, though.')
