Although I wish that you and others affiliated with HN would just explicitly call out the racism and sexism that exists on this site, instead of telling me I’m just making things worse. I don’t mind doing the work for you. But I already know your team won’t. PG wouldn’t allow it anyway...<p>However, I don’t agree with you that it’s a small minority doing these things. I’ve been reading (and commenting) on HN daily since 2010 (under different accounts), so it’s very difficult for me to accept what you’re saying as fact.<p>Also, did you see my other comment about how I feel about the guidelines lol? (It might have been on a different article.) No offense, but I’ve seen your replies on other articles where you ask people to follow the guidelines and my immediate response is always something like “But why? What this person said makes sense.” For example, the whole “don’t tell people they didn’t read the article” rule...<p>I don’t mind being flamed by the “small minority” of racist and sexist commenters here. I’m used to it. I’m also used to people expecting me to “behave” myself.<p>Anyway, based on facts, Timnit Gebru is right. Jeff Dean lied (possibly unintentionally) through omission. Megan Kochalia should be fired.')
