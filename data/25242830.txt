Over the last two years, I collected all the things I liked which my new site should have and hour should look. I have made post about it here. \n <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bobbydreamer.com&#x2F;things-that-my-new-site-should-have" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bobbydreamer.com&#x2F;things-that-my-new-site-should-have</a><p>Later decided too stop all this and use a static site generator and make content and not worry about designs that was a bit hard thing to do for me. But reality is how many posts am I gonna write. I chose Gatsby for its speed. So went through all the Gatsby themes and picked one and started. As everybody, I made a post about &quot;how I made this site&quot; \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bobbydreamer.com&#x2F;how-i-made-this-site" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bobbydreamer.com&#x2F;how-i-made-this-site</a><p>I like colors, I am not good at picking them, but I like them and at the moment all the design I do is change the background color of my site.<p>I am following footsteps of other web developers like &quot;Flavio Copes&quot;, person writes 1 Post a day. I know I cannot be that consistent, so initially I started like one post a keep then it became month.<p>Basically what I am doing in my site is moving contents which I have saved in notepads, word documents and Posts all my learning into my site at the moment.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bobbydreamer.com&#x2F;blog" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bobbydreamer.com&#x2F;blog</a><p>The approach I am following currently is working for me.<p>I have seen many people from hn their blog doesn&#x27;t have more than 4 posts and one or two posts they written were excellent, I wished many times, it would have been good if they continued to make more content.')
