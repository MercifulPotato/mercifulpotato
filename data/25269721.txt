We just published a writeup on how we built the alignment (along with some simple tricks for estimating video similarity).<p>We used a bidirectional LSTM with CQT and chroma as input, and predicted the original beat for every cover beat as output. There&#x27;s a bunch of existing work on this from Furkan Yesiler, Dan Ellis and others, and we&#x27;re super grateful to them for advising.<p>Super open to feedback and critique here or in the post.')
