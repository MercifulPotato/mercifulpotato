I didn’t see the domain name when I clicked on the heading. I have dealt with frozen shoulder off and on for about 2 years. Fortunately I think I’m on the downside of the pain but it can be a mind####. I was otherwise healthy but I couldn’t raise my right arm over my shoulder. It can cause a spin out of worry which I’m sure makes it worse. Thanks Scott for sharing your story.')
