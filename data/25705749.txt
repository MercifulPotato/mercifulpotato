The late symphonies, the septet, Winterreise. All amazing works.<p>I listen to a lot of music, but some works I go back to more than others. The big C major quintet (the string quartet with an extra cello one) is in my opinion the greatest piece of chamber music ever written, and I don&#x27;t even like string music.<p>The recording with the Emerson quartet and Rostropovich is probably my favourite.<p>Another work I always return to are Petterssons 7th symphony, preferably the recording with the orchestra I work in. Norrk√∂pings Symphony orchestra together with Leif Segerstam. Way before my time, but wow what a symphony. I never understood why Pettersson is never mentioned among other Scandinavian composers such as Nielsen or Sibelius. His seventh symphony deserves to be played world wide.')
