The where clause itself is not decomposable. But if you made every where clause a single function  taking in multiple parameters than yes that function is composable but you&#x27;re taking extra steps to do a non-traditional coding style.<p>Not even sure if stored procedures are part of the sql standard.... these seem to me to be just specific syntax additions added on by specific databases.<p>I mean it works so why not. I could code all my SQL this way.')
