For me, PHP 7 was PHP 5 that was faster and had some nice little bits of new syntax. They started down the type system road but I avoided it then.<p>Now it seems like the basic type system is in place, great. This new stuff in the article I&#x27;ll probably start using it when 8.4 drops.<p>5 years is an exaggeration, but staying a version or two behind really helps you stay sane.<p>By the way I found Hack&#x2F;HHVM thoroughly disappointing. Tried running some fairly complex apps on it and it felt like they reimagined the legacy baggage. Seems like PHP itself borrowed a lot of ideas from it though.')
