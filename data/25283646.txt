The professor, this goofy Swedish guy Richard Ehrenborg, liked to give novelty lectures in the period following a big exam. He talked about how he started getting into juggling in grad school and eventually discovered some new juggling patterns via work with this notation and some abstract algebra. Honestly most of the math stuff went over my head, but he stood on the desk and juggled so it&#x27;s stuck in my memory.<p>Looks like one of the sources in that article was written by him and his wife (another math professor who I have also happened to have taken a course from): <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0012365X9683010X" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0012365X96...</a>')
