One of the hallmarks of good engineering is to add technical safeguards, rather than relying solely on Smart People.<p>It would be comical to hear, &quot;Hire better pilots&quot; as an alternative to building parachutes, or fly-by-wire systems.<p>Every one makes mistakes. This is why we have tests, linting, code review.  Our choice of tools that we use (or, in this case, create) reflect our engineering needs as well. The goal is not just to hire Smart People, but to make it _hard for people to make critical errors_.  At Google&#x27;s scale, I can completely understand why they might feel that developing a new tool was the best way to prevent a core set of problems.')
