I&#x27;ve only played Mindustry and it looks like the tick rate is slower there with all conveyor belt movement happening in discrete one-cell-at-a-time movements (animated to look smooth). I&#x27;m surprised to hear that Factorio might just ignore the problem (though typical conveyor belt graphs are probably loop-free and not so hard).<p>&gt; precompute a topological iteration order<p>So do you mean the a topological sorting as in [1]? That won&#x27;t be possible with cycles, of course, so I don&#x27;t think I know what you mean. I agree that I haven&#x27;t fully specified the desired specification, but I&#x27;d probably be satisfied with something that satisfies: &quot;chooses a movement such that it is impossible to move any additional items this tick&quot;. So maybe of two joined loops only one moves this tick, so long as its movement makes the other one impossible to move, but move both if possible. And any isolated loop always has to move.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Topological_sorting" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Topological_sorting</a>')
