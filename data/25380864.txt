At this point I just assume they&#x27;re justifying laziness because that&#x27;s what it is far more often than not.<p>Interestingly enough, you pretty much never see people who are self employed and could be booking billable hours instead of doing other things invoking the &quot;value of my time&quot; argument for doing or not doing things.')
