They are separate policies that seem to be conflated in these comments.<p>The reason why they are implementing an EV tax partially based on miles driven is because EVs cause wear and tear on roads, but contribute little to none to those maintenance costs through petrol taxes.  This is why plug in hybrids pay a lower tax rate in their policy (as presumably they&#x27;d pay at least some via the petrol tax).<p>I&#x27;m not going to argue about whether it would be better to push that all onto legacy ICE users, but something or other will need to be sorted out soonish as they plan to phase out sales of new ICE vehicles by 2030.  It will take a while to flush out the existing fleet, but it will increasingly be a problem of who pays for the roads?<p>Will it just be everyone who is too poor to upgrade?  It feels decoupled from the carbon usage to propel the vehicles so you can&#x27;t just jack the carbon tax without goofing everything else &amp; subsidizing drivers as the electricity is fungible.<p>Eventually it seems like it will need to just be a road tax &amp; be like registration + some miles &amp; weight &amp; whatever else driven calculation.  + then also carbon tax the ICE fuel and the EV juice at whatever it is.')
