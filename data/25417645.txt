Gave me a chuckle in context.<p>On topic: there&#x27;s probably more to it in humans, because animals don&#x27;t have cultural phenomena like shame about their sexual organs, making embarrassing noises or smelling bad.<p>I would say the parallel with defecating in private is valid, as it can lead to the same perceived loss of social status as &quot;not earning enough&quot; or &quot;having an unacceptable opinion&quot;.')
