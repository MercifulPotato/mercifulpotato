But if you want to purchase your next workstation with ECC support, be very careful: some motherboards manufacturers just say &#x27;ECC&#x27; in their specs but that doesn&#x27;t mean that they actually use ECC capabilities, that only means that you can plug ECC-RAM into it. Make sure the specs explicitly say something like &quot;Corrects single-bit errors and detects double-bit errors&quot; (you need both, some MBs support only single-bit correction).<p>I think ECC RAM and a good FS are complementary tools to achieve storage high reliability. One without another may not be that useful.')
