We set it up with a simple gorilla&#x2F;mux API in front and use the Nomad API to submit jobs from all our other applications and it works flawlessly.<p>With regards to 1.0&#x27;s features:<p>HCL2 is a welcome addition for us since we had a lot of repetition in our job files using artifacts for tasks.<p>Also the addition of the PostStop lifecycle couldn&#x27;t come at a better time, we were discussing workarounds for this recently.<p>One area of potential improvement would be the behaviour of file&#x2F;directory permissions through different task drivers, I know this is totally dependent of the different drivers we can use with Nomad but more than once we bumped into this while setting up our jobs (and others too [1][2])<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hashicorp&#x2F;nomad&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2625" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hashicorp&#x2F;nomad&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2625</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hashicorp&#x2F;nomad&#x2F;issues&#x2F;8892" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hashicorp&#x2F;nomad&#x2F;issues&#x2F;8892</a><p>Thanks for all the work your team did.
