And because the studios <i>and the crew</i> depend on filming for their economic survival, everyone involved is willing to do what it takes.<p>I have friends who work in Hollywood. They&#x27;re not allowed to socialize when they&#x27;re working on set, nor for the two week period <i>before</i> they start working on set. They can&#x27;t use public transportation. They can&#x27;t visit friends or families for Thanksgiving or Christmas. They must get tested multiple times a week: a rapid test nearly every day (or every day for some sets), and the regular test at least every two weeks. The stricter sets won&#x27;t even let crew go to the groceries when they&#x27;re off set; they must use Instacart or limit themselves to eating at the crew stations on set. When traveling, they must stay in lodging provided by the studios, usually AirBnbs because hotels are too risky.')
