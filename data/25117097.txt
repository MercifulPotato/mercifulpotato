Culture is not race.<p>Discrimination based on culture has other terms like xenophobia.<p>Discriminating against some culture may be justified. For instance, to some extent it is justified to discriminate against a culture that tolerates theft and vandalism.<p>If you assume that someone with a certain physical appearance automatically belongs some specific culture, and then discriminate against them based on that assumption, that is then racism.<p>The discriminating against that culture <i>per se</i> isn&#x27;t racism, and not even necessarily wrong; it depends on the culture.<p>Not all cultures are equally good.')
