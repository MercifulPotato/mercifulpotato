I don’t think most of them are frankly thinking about their property values because it’s just not super relevant, thanks to prop 13.<p>&gt; For another example, there is no incentive to renovate&#x2F;tear down&#x2F;rebuild bigger because now you will pay significantly higher property taxes. Single family homes don&#x27;t get turned into denser properties.<p>There is a <i>ton</i> of incentive to build more units: for one, you could sell them for a ton more in aggregate! But there is also a huge disincentive that is not prop 13: zoning laws that prevent basically any increase in density in some absurd fraction of California, especially absurd in central areas and inner ring suburbs.<p>Prop 13 is definitely an issue, but it’s not the dominant one for the effects you describe.')
