Honestly, reliability and cost are bigger drivers than raw performance. The scenario is a bit bad I can admit, and did admit.<p>But if we were in desperate times, I think the limits would matter and fab tech would be an important strategic asset for what it enables. The nature of it is that its easier to attack, but we hopefully have something to defend.<p>Intrinsically larger process nodes are better for analog and have uses even as new fabs come along. In 7nm your analog signals are not treated very nicely, but these are important for sensors. Also power electronics are not really on the newest nodes either. The microchips are old because they get the job done and I donâ€™t think we feel so threatened to push the limits.')
