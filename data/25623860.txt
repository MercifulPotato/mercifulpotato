Might not be a good idea to use something that can&#x27;t make the same claim, if your point is to learn Clojure.<p>I realize now that fleck (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chr15m&#x2F;flk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chr15m&#x2F;flk</a>) also doesn&#x27;t even do destructuring and more.
