Still the relation is rather remote.<p>&gt; How do you know we can produce quarks?<p>I personally don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m relying on hearsay from a buddy with a PhD in particle physics who worked at Los Alamos. I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s a liar so I&#x27;ll take him at his word about what&#x27;s possible in particle physics labs.<p>&gt; Also, where does astronomy fit into your taxonomy? Was Newton doing science or phenomenology when he came up with the inverse square law? Plate tectonics? What about (drum roll, please) biology?<p>Astronomy is a phenomenology on account of nobody has a lab big enough to create stars in, or run any other astronomical scale experiments. Newton was doing natural philosophy, which in his case had elements of both what we now call science and phenomenology. Plate tectonics would strictly speaking be a phenomenology. Biology is a bloody wet mess that&#x27;s mostly phenomenology, but there are disciplines in it which are mature science to the point of being engineering, like breeding domesticated plant and animal species.')
