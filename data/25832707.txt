Your best bet in that case might be to communicate it to the voters in some sort of news programme - taking us back to square one!<p>But in all seriousness I do accept that unbiased outlets basically don&#x27;t really exist and it is an impossibly high bar. The reason I talk about this in the way that I do is not as some kind of campaign against the BBC: on the contrary, I think public service broadcasting is in general a good thing and frequently produces higher quality content than the vast majority of privately owned outlets, at least in the UK, despite its biases.<p>It&#x27;s just that to me, everything has a bias, and it&#x27;s important to understand what any particular outlet&#x27;s biases are before you start accepting information from it. I&#x27;d say this is the one redeeming feature of our print media, despite how much crap they often produce, they are at least usually very open about their biases.<p>You can get a lot of good information out of the BBC news and politics programmes, but I&#x27;d say you do have to use a fairly critical lens to get the most out of it.')
