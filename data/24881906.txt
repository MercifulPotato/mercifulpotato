If the shows are available with each episode available on a separate tape (and each separate tape could be individually purchased), then yes, the VCR fair use justification evaporates. But generally VHS tapes include multiple episodes and individual episodes can not be individually purchased (other than a limited number of very special episodes), so there is still an argument to be made for fair use on the basis of each individual episode.<p><i>Furthermore according to parents logic VCRs shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to exist because they can record from both categories.</i><p>No, that&#x27;s not at all what I said. VCRs are just tools. Tools are subject to a different analysis post-DMCA: does the tool have a substantial non-infringing use or is it deliberately designed to violate copyright?<p>In determining whether a tool was deliberately designed to violate copyright, they look beyond just the mere function of the tool and examine <i>why</i> that functionality is present, and how the tool and that potentially-violating functionality is marketed.<p>On that note: DVRs generally no longer exist today as standalone goods (see, for example Tivo, etc). This is because the copyright owners introduced new time-shifting licenses a few years ago, and your cable company, Hulu, etc. pay the copyright owners for the right to let their viewers view content on a time-shifted basis. A standalone DVR would generally have the primary purpose of violating those (relatively new) rights, and thus wouldn&#x27;t pass muster today.<p>What about VCRs? They&#x27;re still okay. They make degraded, low-quality copies of broadcast transmissions for archival&#x2F;time-shifted uses by people who have TVs that still connect to VCRs. As those people generally wouldn&#x27;t be able to access the equivalent digital content on their TV, it&#x27;s clear that the primary use of VCRs is for fair uses purposes.')
