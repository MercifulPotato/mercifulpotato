Item(by='gnicholas', descendants=None, kids=[25397650], score=None, time=1607744901, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25395294, text='TLDR:<p>Apparently Robinhood doesn&#x27;t display warnings about risk&#x2F;volatility before customers purchase leveraged&#x2F;inverse ETFs, which is standard among competitors.<p>Also, Robinhood displays different information when buying or selling options, in a way that highlights the possibility of making money and downplays (or completely ignores) the possibility losing money.<p>Competitors show the same information whether you&#x27;re buying or selling. Robinhood shows a measure called &quot;to break even&quot; if you&#x27;re looking at buying a call option. If you&#x27;re looking to sell the same call option, they instead show you &quot;chance of profit&quot;. In both cases, they show no information about how likely you are to lose money, or how much.<p>Perhaps relatedly, Robinhood makes tons of money off option fees; in September, they made more than 2x as much from option fees than vanilla stock trades.')
