Item(by='tylerhou', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610399923, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25734126, text='&gt; This is a common error in reasoning by the way: looking to the way current law happens to be and inferring from that what the right thing to do is.<p>I understand this, and the understanding is implicit in the way I phrased: &quot;our society has agreed that we shouldn&#x27;t force people to change their religion.&quot; It&#x27;s also worth noting that &quot;religion&quot; here usually refers to practices and beliefs that don&#x27;t infringe on other people&#x27;s rights. To evaluate whether these practices infringe on someone&#x27;s rights, one should take into account their protected classes: i.e. you&#x27;re not allowed to discriminate against a person&#x27;s skin color even if your religion says that you should.<p>Our society has also agreed that certain beliefs are reprehensible and deserve no place in society: both major political sides think that advocating for violence is unacceptable, and therefore both the Democrats and the (centrist) Republicans cannot claim that private companies who refuse to host a platform that allows calls for violence are unjustly discriminating â€” if the politicians want to be logically consistent. (This is what I meant by &quot;When your political beliefs include inciting violence by spreading unfounded conspiracy theories, then private companies have a right to kick you off.&quot;) This is a positive statement, not a normative statement.<p>Normatively, alt-right beliefs should not be given the same protections as religions because they infringe on other people&#x27;s rights. For example, repeated, false allegations of voter fraud indirectly infringe on people&#x27;s right to vote because they effect court cases that call for legitimate voters to be disenfranchised.')
