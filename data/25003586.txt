A good faith case can be made that its not.<p>&gt; Nothing about these clips being shared on Twitter replaces the viewing experience of Cuties.<p>&quot;Replacing the viewing experience&quot; isn&#x27;t necessary to be outside of fair use, and the work at issue is probably the trailer itself, not <i>Cuties</i>. Which matters a lot when you look at the &quot;amount and substantiality&quot; prong of fair use analysis.<p>&gt; The tweets are definitely transformative and provide a critique of the film.<p>Sure, I don&#x27;t think anyone would argue that the <i>purpose</i> prong of fair use is in dispute.<p>&gt; Doesn&#x27;t copyright law explicitly permit this use of copyrighted works?<p>There is very little explicit about the &quot;fair use&quot; defense; even how the four prongs of the test interact isn&#x27;t explicit.')
