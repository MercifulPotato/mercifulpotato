It means all the people who think they&#x27;re leading culture around on a leash by pushing their articles in <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>The Atlantic</i>, <i>Mother Jones</i> etc. and so forth.<p>And that very much <i>is</i> a social class, or more accurately, its a specific subset of a social class. Another subset of the same social class are book editors at the major publishing houses. Look around on LinkedIn. You&#x27;ll find that easily 3 in 4 of them are female, went to a small-to-medium-sized liberal arts college, etc. They literally gatekeep both fiction and non-fiction, and its why self-publishing and alternative publishing outlets are on the rise.<p>There are likely other subsets of this same social class that I&#x27;m unfamiliar with, but I don&#x27;t generally give it much thought, because I don&#x27;t care and I don&#x27;t have to care.<p>EDIT: Sorry, I meant 3 out of 4 of them are female, not 1-in-4.')
