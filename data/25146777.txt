The repair is just a recovery strategy so that the compiler can work further in order to potentially uncover further errors.<p>This is what compilers do already, one such strategy is to unwind the state to before the error and skip over the erroneous part. This can be a bit problematic in certain situations, such as a syntax error in a variable definition and the following flood of &#x27;undefined variable&#x27; errors.<p>The repair strategy in the article is trying to optimise the quality of the attempted repair in order to provide better error messages to the user.')
