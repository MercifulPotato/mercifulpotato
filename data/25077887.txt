Item(by='AlchemistCamp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605231998, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25073970, text='&gt; &quot;Stripe is now charging 0.5% more for recurring charges&quot;, which apparently is misleading...<p>Stripe is indeed stating they&#x27;ll start charging me 0.5% more for a service they said would be free for me when I signed up. They&#x27;ve done this by renaming the service from subscriptions to billing and adding features to it that I&#x27;ve never used. According to others in this thread, the message they sent out two years ago was:<p>&gt; <i>&quot;Your account has been upgraded to Stripe Billing for free. No matter how much revenue you process on Stripe, you’ll get unlimited use of Billing’s Starter plan included in the price you currently pay for payments. All new features are available in your account now, no API version upgrade necessary.&quot;</i><p>This is what I remember as well.<p>I&#x27;d say a good title would be, &quot;YC-funded Stripe moves Subscription customers to Billing, increases their fees and breaks earlier promises&quot;. The original title isn&#x27;t as nuanced but is still more accurate than the current one, IMO.')
