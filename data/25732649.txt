If you just want a fixie or a frankenbike it&#x27;s okay but for anything else be prepared to wait and compromise. I just managed to order the last components I need for the bike I&#x27;m building this year. I had to compromise a bit, mix hubs drivetrain components \nfrom several Shimano lineups, past and current. The frame was preordered and paid in full in June, it should have arrived in August, finally got it in October.')
