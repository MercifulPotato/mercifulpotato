Item(by='izacus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606989195, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25286467, text='&gt; Yet another post blaming developers when it&#x27;s the product managers and business development people that decide the direction of the product.<p>Developers on this very site will happily deliver a slow running JS Electron turd if that means that they don&#x27;t have to learn a new tool or use the process that isn&#x27;t &quot;fun&quot; to them. Blaming just the business owners when the developers themselves refuse to do their job well is a bit strange.<p>Kinda reminds me of life in my socialist state - everyone did their minimum to tick the box they had to do and then just slacked off the rest of the time. Everything was kinda shit but it&#x27;s not like anyone got paid more to do a job well, amirite?')
