There may be several processes waiting on that lock. Even if they have a reliable crash detection mechanism, they&#x27;ll have to coordinate to decide who&#x27;s in charge of repairing the state. What if that process dies during the repair?<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s impossible, but you&#x27;re basically implementing a distributed, embedded version of the lock daemon. And as all distributed things, fault-tolerance is hard. It&#x27;s easier in a dedicated process or in the kernel because they&#x27;re centralized (and if the kernel panics all processes stop; that can be emulated in a daemon).')
