In practice they have a tighter schedule so that there&#x27;s a period between &quot;We are not meeting our self-imposed deadline&quot; and &quot;The Internet broke, oops&quot; in which staff can figure out the problem and fix it.<p>To do this they automatically generate and sign OCSP responses (the vast majority of which will just say the certificate is still good) on a periodic cycle, and then they deliver them in bulk to a CDN. The CDN is who your client (or server if you do OCSP stapling, which you ideally should) talks to when checking OCSP.<p>To generate those responses they need a way (hey, a database) to get the set of all certificates which have not yet expired and whether those certificates are revoked or not.')
