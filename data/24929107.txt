The CEO and CSO were recent PhD graduates. Even though both are obviously smart, and they had a large venture fund behind them (I was speaking to the fund about the opportunity) I just couldn&#x27;t shake the fact that two recent PhD grads were running the company. I was a &quot;recent PhD grad&quot; about a decade ago and I didn&#x27;t know shit about running a company as a CEO or CSO. Those jobs are so much more about leadership than technical chops. Maybe having the large venture co behind them would help, but the board wasn&#x27;t made up of a ton of leadership expertise either. I felt bad pointing that out. Like, &quot;yea, the tech is cool but I don&#x27;t have faith in such inexperienced leadership&quot;.<p>So this article I think should have one extra point--you should hire a CEO that you report to as the president or CSO of the company. That CEO doesn&#x27;t need to be fantastic, they just need to have been in leadership roles for sometime in industry. This way you get the organization and management expertise only gained through years of work, and you as president and scientific expert do the leg work around selling the science to potential investors and pushing the research forward.')
