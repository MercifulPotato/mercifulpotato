Organizations also want to automatically <i>de</i>activate of user accounts?<p>There&#x27;s something called SCIM, &quot;System for Cross-domain Identity Management&quot;, that does this, and which you can use together with OpenID Connect (OIDC).<p>SCIM can automatically deactivate a user account, if the person leaves the organization or moves to a different department. And can auto add and remove him&#x2F;her to&#x2F;from various user groups.<p>But with SAML, managers &#x2F; admins still need to micro manage the user accounts, e.g. place the user in the correct group, if s&#x2F;he gets a new job role. SAML only syncs user accounts upon login, from what I&#x27;ve understood. (So if the user stays logged in, then, with SAML, his&#x2F;her account permissions can get out-of-date?)<p>SCIM: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;azure&#x2F;active-directory&#x2F;app-provisioning&#x2F;user-provisioning" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;azure&#x2F;active-directory&#x2F;app-...</a><p>Azure AD uses this, and Okta, OneLogin, Github and some others too I suppose.<p>If anyone has tried SCIM it&#x27;d be interesting to hear what you think about it? (I&#x27;ve just read about it)')
