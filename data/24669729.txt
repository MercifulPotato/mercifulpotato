Item(by='ByteJockey', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601702375, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24669395, text='True, but &quot;potential deaths&quot; leads you down some pretty weird rabbit holes.<p>Also, you have to answer the question what&#x27;s the right timeline to optimize for then?<p>For example, centralizing power makes the federal government a more tempting target for authoritarians in the long term (next 100 years). Given the death statistics of previous authoritarian (from both internal violence and wars), you&#x27;re probably looking at millions of deaths.<p>Centralizing power is also what makes the modern social safety net and regulatory regime possible. Are the thousands of lives saved by those systems every year worth a low chance at a much larger number of deaths? (rhetorical question, there probably isn&#x27;t an objective answer to that)')
