You generally also want the mean to be associative, you want the function they call &#x27;g&#x27; to be invertible, and the harmonic mean and geometric mean have the simpler and more useful interpretation of taking the average of the reciprocal and logarithm respectively.<p>All this article is doing, in a somewhat confused fashion, is trying to replace addition with another abelian (but not associative) operator. Which is fun, but ultimately not <i>better</i> than just assuming the arithmetic mean is going to be any help (which at least has some strong theorems that tell you it&#x27;s going to converge to the expected value, usually).')
