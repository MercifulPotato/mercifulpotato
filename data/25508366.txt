They do this by posting illegal &#x2F; banned content themselves in the subreddit, then mass reporting it.<p>They also do this at a user level, including targeting mods of any subreddit they disagree with. If they get the mods of a subreddit banned, they can take it over with their own friendly mods - easily done as there are clearly Reddit employees with an activist agenda who will help them out.<p>Once they&#x27;ve done that they&#x27;re free to stifle debate, ban any users who speak out against their point of view and generally create a culture of fear.<p>This is why all the womens issues, feminist &amp; lesbian subreddits have trans (i.e. male) moderators. And why entire communities of women have left reddit forever.')
