Vertical farms lend themselves much more to standardization than conventional ones imo (many small machines instead of few big ones). If all the often-failing parts could be built in a way that they can be replaced automatically I can imagine a giant farm being run by a single guy who&#x27;s main task is receiving replacement parts and sometimes untangling messes the bots don&#x27;t know how to manage.<p>The other big benefit of being independent from environmental factors might also come in handy in space or as a cheaper alternative to fighting climate change.')
