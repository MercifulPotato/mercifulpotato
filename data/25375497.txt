Unlike with IG, it doesn&#x27;t even suggest your Facebook friends to be friends. If adding Facebook friends who joined Oculus was automatic, at least you can argue there was immediate utility, but as of right now it feels like they&#x27;re just signalling that FB will watch your every move and spy on you.')
