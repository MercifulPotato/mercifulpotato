They can contain some business logic, but that can be ‘no code’ as well (flow chart kind of stuff); these systems are usually not the nicest to use, however much (!) nicer than the systems the tables originally belong to. So see it as a small team&#x2F;person needs to enter certain type of data; they can learn to wade through miles of SAP menus, or someone clicks together a little crud (web) app that does exactly that and cannot do anything else. There are many 1000s of these cases, but they do not get popular as they stay inside the companies (departments) they are created in.')
