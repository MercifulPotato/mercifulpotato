No difference between gsort and sort, no version issues or whether someone is using brew or macports or anything else. No python environment problems or pip Vs pip3 or whatever other random crap you need to deal with when trying to do something simple with lots of varied setups people have.<p>I really don&#x27;t see how having to get Docker going is alleviating any of the above headaches but I&#x27;m far removed from these tools being &quot;new to me.&quot; Setting up virtualization to run a <i>process</i> on my local machine which I can run without virtualization or containerization the very same way seems crazy to me. It seems like an awful amount of complexity to push onto beginners for what is likely to be <i>zero</i> benefit and gives them only what they had at the start...<p>&gt; You are entirely free to not use docker.\n&gt;&gt; In order to use GNU&#x2F;Linux one must\n&gt; Nope. You can. You don&#x27;t have to.<p>Yeah that&#x27;s my point exactly... you don&#x27;t have to at all in fact, Docker offers most literally nothing but opaque complexity. I was saying you MUST have Linux if you want <i>containers</i> because containers are a Linux feature and DNE on MacOS but all them sweet utilities are already there save the weird csv tool. I don&#x27;t think the complexity of Docker is warranted for simply handling a CSV tool and I find it to be a disservice to anyone who is learning.<p>&#x2F;shrug')
