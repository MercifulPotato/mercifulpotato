The user contribute their tiny way by taking the effort to contribute a bug report instead of just ignoring what they could have found.\nAnd this guy ask them money just to fill a bug...<p>If he was asking money for investigating or fixing a specific bug I can understand, but here he just don&#x27;t even want to see it!<p>Seriously, for his little size project, what is the cost of just having a few seconds look at incoming bugs even if not replying to it&#x27;s author? He is probably missing some important info. Maybe someone was reporting that his crappy software was doing a &#x27;rm rf&#x27; in some cases...<p>From my point of view, I&#x27;m very grateful for the bug reports I receive. Sure a lot of them are not really bug or already fixed. But very often I got very valuable feedback about bugs, incomprehension of the projects, or things that could be improved for that.<p>So on one side you can also consider that you have users ready to do free QA for you! That is invaluable!<p>In the case of this guy, I think that he is not really an OSS maintainer in the &#x27;free software&#x27; movement but just the author of an abandonware with shared sources.')
