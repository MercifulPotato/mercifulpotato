Essentially, award seats are intended to be seats that the airline cannot sell to paying passengers. Since those seats would otherwise earn the airline nothing, accounting for them on a strictly &#x27;found-money&#x27; basis makes some sense.<p>This sometimes creates amusing situations when new loyalty program managers look at their margins and conclude massive sales make sense. For one example, see below - Garuda selling ~$20,000 first class tickets for ~$200 worth of points. On an internal accounting basis, this was still profitable for the program!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onemileatatime.com&#x2F;garuda-indonesia-first-class-award-ticket-discount&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onemileatatime.com&#x2F;garuda-indonesia-first-class-awar...</a>')
