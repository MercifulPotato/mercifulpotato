You sucked in high school. People could barely stand being around you. You weren&#x27;t fun to talk to, not fun at all.<p>You&#x27;re not even that much smarter than all those other kids. You just went all in on making your entire identity being smart. Predictably, no one liked it. Most of those other kids were smart enough to realize that being liked matters, and figured out how to be more liked.<p>It can take awhile, but other &quot;nerds&quot; figure it out eventually. I know plenty of extremely smart people that never had this problem, or figured it out as a young adult. It&#x27;s a bitter pill to swallow that it wasn&#x27;t how you are as a person, but the decisions you&#x27;ve made. This reads like someone that has never really had to come to terms with reality for whatever reason (likely just never had diverse social experiences).')
