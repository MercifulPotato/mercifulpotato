Honestly, I&#x27;m skeptical about your ability about any of the 3 frameworks, you teaching them to people doesn&#x27;t attest to your ability at all. Suggesting to use the least supported one - does.<p>I despise React, I suggest React to all the newcomers. Reason: larger market. They&#x27;ll get a job quicker. They&#x27;ll find resources to learn it at any corner.')
