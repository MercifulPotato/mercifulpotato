Existing contracts for eg soy beans already have to take these possibilities into account.<p>&gt; What happens when speculators drive prices up because they know the people that actually need&#x2F;want that water have to pay or risk losing their crops.<p>If current future prices are clearly higher than what I expect spot prices to be in the future, I&#x27;d sell future contracts and make a killing.<p>&gt; Water is important enough that it should be publicly owned and distributed. This is pretty much the only way it can be effectively managed and distributed, rather than hoarded and scalped as soon as the opportunity presents itself.<p>What makes you think that public ownership and distribution is so effective?  And what are the limits of these benefits, so that they only apply to important goods?  Why wouldn&#x27;t we want even goods of lesser importance enjoy these benefits?')
