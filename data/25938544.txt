The mechanism is peer reflexive candidates, wherein the server learns the address and port of the client based on the IP packet of the incoming ICE negotiation request. I have used this approach on production systems.<p>For peer to peer, you&#x27;d have a tough time avoiding STUN&#x2F;TURN anyhow.')
