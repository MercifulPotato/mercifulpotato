Coca-cola used to have cocaine in it, and so on.<p>In the past we were better off than today.  People were not shooting up in the streets, yet heroin was readily available.  The past is not the ideal path forward.  We can do better than the past, and we can certainly do better than today.<p>A middle ground needs to be found (a global maxima) between de-regulation and over-regulation.  I personally think having to take a test so you&#x27;re an informed consumer is an ideal amount of regulation, but others might disagree.')
