I&#x27;ve just tried (not for the first time, btw) your tech demo, which I think illustrates this perfectly. The rendering was lightning fast, but it&#x27;s not a full browser.<p>You state that your goals are &quot;to provide a high-performance, safe rendering engine for embedding in other applications.&quot;<p>Given that browsers are notoriously big software projects, do you think it will be an obstacle that servo is no longer tightly integrated with any sizeable browser project?<p>Of course, I&#x27;m asking because I&#x27;m really afraid that the amazing effort that is servo might dwindle into irrelevance simply because there is no &quot;killer app&quot; for it, and embedding it into several small&#x2F;niche products simply doesn&#x27;t generate the same involvement as a web browser.')
