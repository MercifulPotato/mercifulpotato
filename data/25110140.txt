Instead, x=1,t=1 , or x=-1,t=1 are closer (indeed, with distance zero). Generalizing to more dimensions this maps out what is called the &quot;lightcone&quot; as it&#x27;s a cone. So you can in some sense say that all points along the lightcone are &quot;the same&quot; or &quot;on top&quot; of the cone tip, at least as seen from your rules that depend on the distance. This difference in metric is what causes all the time dilations and other artifacts of Special Relativity. Light can be seen as a connection between points in the array that are already the &quot;same&quot; point.<p>You can go one step further and say that the lightcone originating from each array entry can tilt in 4D differently in each point. This is General Relativity and causes all the effects within, if you also postulate that the tilts originate from mass-energy in the region.')
