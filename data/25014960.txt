Yet, the blog posts have some valuable points (even though they attack the Weinsteins also personally).<p>Ok, if you claim sth, I just want to assess how much is true about it. In this case it&#x27;s quite some claim. I just wonder, where is the evidence?<p>If Eric Weinstein can provide it, great. I will believe him . If he cannot, I wonder why he would mention these topics in a public podcast. \nEven if they are true, if you cannot at least provide some kind of evidence for them, they sound to me like conspiracy theories.<p>This is also not a singular incident in terms of just claiming sth. and not being able to back it up (COVID, 9&#x2F;11 ... unity theory etc.). I mean he claims his family was kept from 3 nobel prices ... might well be, yet so far I find that far fetched. Just saying.<p>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof ... no?<p>I&#x27;m skeptical and like to hear&#x2F;see things for myself. The &quot;I don&#x27;t speak German&quot; podcast really makes some impressions I had more concrete (also the episode with Becca Lewis). It seems for me the Weinstein brothers are just utterly confused.')
