This can be verified by people partaking in a Signal message through the use of their safety numbers and through building the app from their published source that you can verify only ever sends your encrypted data to Signal servers. It&#x27;s true that we can never be sure what&#x27;s in Signal&#x27;s backend but we can also prove that anything we send to their backend can&#x27;t be read by them regardless of its design.')
