I was less than twenty years old.<p>Since then, I have built &amp; collapsed yet another life philosophy, and am now mostly just trying to keep floating on the raft I&#x27;ve built from whatever I figured out works.

All I can do is keep trying to hew toward preserving my health as much as I can stand.  It&#x27;s better to be able to be here than not, that&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve got.')
