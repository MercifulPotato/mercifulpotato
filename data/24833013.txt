The solution to this is, as Russ Ackoff put it, not to do the wrong thing right, which will only will have you end up in a situation that is even wronger, and not to solve problems, but to dissolve them by changing the environment in a way such that the problem does not exist any more.<p>In pratictal terms this means for California, reform zoning laws and actually build housing, build mass transit, create good jobs. Don&#x27;t build the UBI white collar welfare dystopia that the 10% of the state love who happen to own Uber stock.')
