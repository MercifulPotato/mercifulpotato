Someone implemented a OCI compatible image runner in bash using standard cgroups, with a bit of luck we&#x27;ll end up calling containers &#x27;containers&#x27; and images &#x27;images&#x27; instead of using docker&#x27;s brand name.<p>Also, I&#x27;m not saying that k8s is bad, or using k8s as a practical API definition of the platform to target when packaging and configuring applications; I was aiming at the &#x27;boo hoo k8s is too hard&#x27; tagline every &quot;simple&quot; version seems to hold on to.<p>One could also install standard K8S and remove the taint and run pods locally, same result.')
