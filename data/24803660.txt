That company&#x27;s about page has a blurb on contributing back to open source that seems to be on par with what Amazon does to contribute to open source, and the author is sponsoring 4 people on GitHub, but where are the loud proclamations that people are clamoring for in this thread?  Whose shoulders are being stood on there?  Is checklyhq.com really running a SaaS offering without benefiting from many, <i>many</i> more people than the outward stance suggests?<p>This whole thing is very reminiscent of the Occupy Wall Street movement.  People are very sensitive to the injustices they perceive themselves as having to endure especially in relation to those wealthier than them.  But where&#x27;s the willingness to jump out of local scope and apply the same principle globally (and reflexively)?  It seems to be absent.')
