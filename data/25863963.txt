Makes it pretty clear that adam is satoshi (i would say with a 99% certainty). Adam says completely different things about bitcoin today than satoshi did all those years ago. It&#x27;s not definite that he was compromised but him taking back control over the project with blockstream and the direction he steered it in makes it pretty clear to me.<p>On Gavin, that&#x27;s also explained pretty well in the video, also this reddit quote from gavin says more than enough for me (this was under a post named &quot;How Craig Wright probably tricked Gavin Andresen&quot;):\n&quot;I won&#x27;t violate people&#x27;s privacy or repeat things told to me under non-disclosure agreements, so I&#x27;m stuck-- I&#x27;m not going to say anything more, except I suspect someday the full story will come out (and it&#x27;ll be made into a movie).<p>Of course, everything I was told could be a lie, and even professional magicians can be fooled sometimes (ever seen Penn &amp; Teller&#x27;s Fool Us show ?).&quot;')
