I work on OptiX and this is the first time Iâ€™ve seen someone try this kind of thing. There are different kinds of out of core rendering, and not all of them would be guaranteed to finish without running out of memory. This one is, as long as all the individual meshes can fit in GPU memory.<p>Chris are you on HN? I am curious whether some savings might be possible here by <i>not</i> snapshotting the IASes and GASes. Instead you can snapshot only the raw geometry, and then rebuild the GASes and IASes before every launch. It may be faster to rebuild the BVHs than to copy them from CPU ram!<p>*Oh incidentally looking through the code I also noticed that the GASes could be compacted which will save a lot of memory and time&#x2F;bandwidth on the snapshot copies during rendering. Since you do compact the IAS, I am assuming it&#x27;s problematic to try and compact the GASes?<p>In any case, nice work!')
