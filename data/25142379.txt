Word-of-mouth means that people <i>will</i> know your EMR is a flaming piece of garbage, but (as you noted) companies would much rather cut up-front prices so they can milk an extended contract than improving product quality.

Good people don&#x27;t join the space because the culture sucks and the pay is bad, but those are because those with the talent and drive all self-selected out of it. I get it, health IT is a huge drag and not at all sexy. But just look at how often folks on HN ask about &quot;doing social good&quot; and how many complaints there are about healthcare delivery. Trying to run a &quot;disruptive&quot; VC-backed startup is IMO pretty crazy, but contributing to an OSS project is far less risky and more achievable.')
