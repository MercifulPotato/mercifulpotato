I was referring to the actual negative statements you made about the author:<p>&gt;Some people just want to find negativity in the world.<p>&gt;I&#x27;m going to take a wiiiiild guess here that the author&#x27;s personal peak was around 1996.<p>&gt;It&#x27;s just a reaction to &#x27;the kids&#x27; coming after him not being up to how good he (mis) remembers the past.<p>&gt;This negativity is a disappointing and growing trend among some grumpy old men in our field as that generation approach retirement.<p>That&#x27;s not &quot;calling out&quot; negativity. That&#x27;s a list of snark, broad insult, and generalizations with no supporting information. It&#x27;s rude, discriminatory, and serves only to diminish the overall quality of discussion.')
