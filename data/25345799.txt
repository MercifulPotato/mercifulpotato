DNS is one of the key areas where we voluntarily give away information on every single website we&#x27;re connecting to to a third party. This protocol certainly helps that--as long as the proxy and recursive resolver do not collude, neither will be able to associate the websites you&#x27;re looking up with your IP.<p>It does have its limitations; a MITM can still just as easily see which IP addresses you connect to and determine which websites are associated with those IPs. But ODoH isn&#x27;t really meant to fix that. A VPN would be better suited to fix that particular privacy concern.')
