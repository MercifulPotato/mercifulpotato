I&#x27;m building this using real breadboards and am at the part where I&#x27;m wiring up the LEDs to the 6522. \x10While I find the act of stripping wires deeply satisfying, I love how much quicker someone can get going using this, as well as how much more accessible you&#x27;ve made this - it&#x27;s a really nice intermediate step between just watching the videos and using the physical kit. Nicely done!')
