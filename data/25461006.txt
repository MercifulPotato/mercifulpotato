Item(by='munchbunny', descendants=None, kids=[25461067], score=None, time=1608242023, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25459701, text='I can&#x27;t speak for Github, but I can speak for my team in [tech giant]: if I wanted to do analytics on end users I&#x27;d have to go through a review to confirm that I would not be violating privacy laws. I literally couldn&#x27;t query them if I wanted to without jumping through technical hoops with audit processes and paper trails.<p>I do believe Github is legitimately trying not to use that data for analytics. But whether some PM in there is querying that data for analytics purposes: at that point we&#x27;re just speculating based on how cynical you or I want to be. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a meaningful point.<p>Also: I&#x27;m not saying I don&#x27;t think they do analytics. I&#x27;m saying I don&#x27;t think they are using users&#x27; personal data for analytics. That&#x27;s an important difference with respect to GDPR.')
