It&#x27;s a historical aberration. In the past, you&#x27;d offload some of your parenting to grandparents, aunts and neighbors in the village (and the latter would do the same, creating a sort of distributed parenting environment). For urban population in modern times, daycare and babysitters serve as a replacement.<p>Put another way, taking care of a young child is 16+ hours a day job, 7 days a week job. Even if there are two parents to share this load, at least one of them also has to have a <i>regular dayjob</i>. A small child puts a lot of physical and mental strain on the parents.')
