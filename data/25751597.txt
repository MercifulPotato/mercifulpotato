I said nothing about making a legal case in court and proving. Notice the word claim? Additionally, just because the law is in court doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s good or not dangerous. You still NEED a subjective proof to determine guilt. This means the law is inherently flawed because it will be used in a biased way and risks being used to attack certain individuals.')
