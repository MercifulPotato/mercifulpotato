Item(by='grishka', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611879013, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25951191, text='Back when di.fm was an actual online radio and gave you a stream URL to play in a player of your choice, it was dead simple. I don&#x27;t know what protocol it used, but there was no chunked encoding and no content-length, simply a 200 OK HTTP response and then an endless MP3 &quot;file&quot; with ID3 tags inserted every now and then. You could play it with Android&#x27;s MediaPlayer in like 3 lines of code.<p>Oh and by the way. For this exact purpose, ID3v2 has a flag called &quot;unsynchronized&quot; that means all 0xFF bytes in that field are replaced with 0xFF00, so that players won&#x27;t play the wrong thing. You&#x27;re supposed to replace them back when parsing the tag. A very hacky solution.')
