It took them nearly 20 years to get where they are today, and it&#x27;s not like that was 20 years of smooth sailing. From what I&#x27;ve read they came close to going under multiple times. Aren&#x27;t they the first major new US car company to start up and not go under since the early 20th century?<p>The situation for Apple is certainly different, given their size and the massive leaps in terms of EV tech compared to when Tesla started out, but let&#x27;s not trivialise the complexity of the task and the inherent financial expenditure and risk.')
