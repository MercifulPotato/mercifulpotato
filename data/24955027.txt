I thought we were having a conversation.<p>I don&#x27;t know who you&#x27;re arguing with, but it&#x27;s not with me or what I wrote.<p>But let&#x27;s address it: let&#x27;s say that someone raped another person. The rapist serves a prison sentence for his crime and he comes out of prison as a rehabilitated man. Are you saying he has to go to his victim to specifically make amends to them? And if he doesn&#x27;t, he&#x27;s still a rapist? That, in my opinion, is one of the most toxic parts of the 12 step process in the US, where you make your victims responsible for your penance by requiring them to accept your apology, which by its very nature involves bringing up that trauma _again_.<p>And what even does it mean to &#x27;undo harm&#x27;? What&#x27;s done is done, for better or worse.')
