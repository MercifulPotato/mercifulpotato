Railing that they aren’t supporting your vision lockstep is pretty freaking arrogant.<p>If you don&#x27;t like&#x2F;agree&#x2F;see value in this persons comment then why are you engaging with them? That&#x27;s how silly your position sounds.<p>Now back to the substance of your comment.<p>&gt;Or maybe different people have different needs and don’t care if every device is “open”.<p>How could &quot;not open&quot; be a need of someone?<p>&gt;These are tools. Does the tool do what I want with the least amount of friction? That’s what they care about.<p>How does an Apple engineer documenting the design add friction in any way to what you&#x27;re doing?<p>&gt; Indeed Apples existence and continually pushing computing in new areas has benefited everyone in the last 40 years - whether you use Apple or not.<p>Apple has helped popularize the smartphone as a consumer device to consume music&#x2F;media, do light business on (emails, IM, documents, etc) and do a few minor creative tasks digitally such as drawing, music, etc. They do get a lot of credit for that. They have also co-created an application platform for other businesses to sell software. But then they robbed 30% of their sales too - They get negative credit for being so greedy.<p>Your argument that they have &quot;continually pushed computing&quot; is a bit of a stretch. Give us your best argument&#x2F;examples&#x2F;facts.')
