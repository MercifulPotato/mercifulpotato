I was consulting from Houston, TX to NY, CA, AZ, Dallas (sometimes I would fly instead of drive), and CO, after a certain number of miles you basically are auto upgraded to first class every single flight, and then you scale your way up through the membership levels.<p>I had around 500k unused miles in my account because the last thing I wanted on vacation after flying back and forth each week to different places was to go fly somewhere.<p>My vacations were usually cross country road trips. My wife and I would rent a nice car, pile the trunk with luggage and just hit the road stopping whenever we wanted. It was the perfect vacation from an overly structured life.<p>Within a few months of me no longer consulting on the road like that, I was alerted that United was buying Continental, and I&#x27;m sure in that press release I didn&#x27;t read, it probably said something about all my miles, but I didn&#x27;t pay attention to it until about a year later when United told me my miles were expiring.<p>So I logged to trade those miles in for a couple tickets to somewhere far far away, and saw my 500k miles from Continental had be devalued to 50k miles at United. Worth at the time 2 domestic round trips if I paid $150 per ticket to redeem them before they expired.<p>So my miles that used to get me into lounges, and first class upgrades, and basically free flights to almost anywhere in the world got me about a 20% discount on 2 round trip tickets to Denver...<p>That was the last time I flew United unless it was the cheapest &quot;real&quot; option (I refuse Spirit and Allegiant).')
