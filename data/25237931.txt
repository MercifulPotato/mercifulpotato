But to continue above analogy,<p>The U.S. assassinated an Iranian major general in January claiming it was necessary to stop an imminent attack.<p>Israel has similar claims against Iran. That&#x27;s why they are also assassinating Iranian scientists that are linked to their nuclear program.<p>Iran has similar claims against MEK (Mujahedin-e-Khalq) organization in Paris. MEK was listed as a terrorist organization by the UN, EU, and the U.S. until a few years. Hence the failed attempt from Iran that you linked here.<p>I think assassination of a scientist like that isn&#x27;t justifiable, for the same reasons that Iran&#x27;s attempt to target MEK organization isn&#x27;t justifiable.')
