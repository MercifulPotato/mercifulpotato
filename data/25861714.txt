(You can&#x27;t be the successor of a country, you even more can&#x27;t be the <i>successor</i> of the present instant happening right now.)<p>It&#x27;s content-free, like a bad political speech. &quot;We are striving to forge our union with purpose.&quot; As opposed to striving to forge it accidentally?<p>It&#x27;s clich√©d: &quot;We close the divide because we know to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside.... while we have our eyes on the future, history has its eyes on us.&quot; Honestly, this reads like something GPT-3 might come up with.<p>It uses rhyme for cheap effect: &quot;We seek harm to none and harmony for all.&quot;<p>I expected something as bad as Maya Angelou (brutally reviewed by Paul Beatty at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2006&#x2F;01&#x2F;22&#x2F;books&#x2F;review&#x2F;black-humor.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2006&#x2F;01&#x2F;22&#x2F;books&#x2F;review&#x2F;black-humor....</a>). This is worse. It is a shame, when there are black poets like Derek Walcott out there. People get exposed to this kind of &quot;uplifting&quot; stuff and will think that&#x27;s all there is.')
