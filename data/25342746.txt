I&#x27;m happy to see it on Hacker News. A few years since I used it last. Didn&#x27;t know you had rewritten it but I see now the updates you&#x27;ve done, especially in interactivity. I&#x27;ll continue to use this as my main reference point for hex grids, especially now that I&#x27;ve picked up pace on my virtual tabletop project. Good work!! Thanks')
