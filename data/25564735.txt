It means while doing ML operations, the CPU core can&#x27;t go off and do other useful work.  It also forces all cores to require matching ML hardware (or have a <i>lot</i> of OS complexity as certain threads can only run on some cores).  The benefit is latency to get ML stuff done is lowered from microseconds to nanoseconds.<p>I suspect Apple probably messed up with that tradeoff...  Very few applications can&#x27;t wait a few microseconds for results of some ML computation...')
