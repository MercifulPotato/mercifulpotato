Learn how to wash and store a whole lettuce and make salad dressing in bulk.  With those staples in your fridge, you&#x27;ll be able to whip up a tasty salad with little preparation time and little effort.<p>However, I urge caution with this recommendation, which is against your main recommendation and in my experience is not helpful: &quot;Diet drinks and fat free yogurt are fine for those sweet-tooth cravings.&quot;<p>Fat free yogurt is full of sugar and should be strongly avoided.  Sugar is the biggest threat to weight loss because the calories from sugar go straight to fat, and the sudden increase in high glycemic index input triggers an insulin response, which makes you feel like a yo-yo merry-go-round of energy&#x2F;despair.<p>Diet drinks should also be avoided.  Whilst they don&#x27;t contain sugar, the artificial sweeteners are so unnaturally sweet they will cause your brain to habitually crave sweet things.  If you stick to water and natural foods you will lose these cravings after a few weeks and you won&#x27;t need to revisit them.')
