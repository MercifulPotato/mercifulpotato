We&#x27;re officially launching today!<p>As a student and researcher, I had become increasingly aware of how little I remembered after reading an article or completing a course. I was also frustrated with how hard it was to keep my thoughts, research, and projects organized. I needed a tool to streamline my thinking, connect ideas, and optimize my learning for the long term.<p>RemNote is that tool - an all-in-one workspace to take notes, organize thoughts, learn anything, and grow knowledge.<p>- Students &amp; learners use RemNote as a long-term learning platform, mastering content through note-taking, integrated spaced-repetition flashcards, PDF annotation, and knowledge-graphing.<p>- Creators &amp; writers use RemNote as an idea-generation platform, sparking ideas by leveraging references, [[backlinks]], portals, aliases, and graph views.<p>- Thinkers and organizers use RemNote as a second-brain, staying organized with fast search, templates, to-dos, tags, and other simple-but-powerful organizational features.<p>I personally find that RemNote works especially well for computer-science concepts; I can carefully piece-apart every component of the system I&#x27;m learning and then internalize it with spaced repetition.<p>You can use it completely offline with our desktop app, or use the synced version across web&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;desktop. We&#x27;re still rapidly building, and I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts!')
