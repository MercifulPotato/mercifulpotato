Scihub is a space without the negative effect of Elsevier gatekeeping, thus seeming to have a net positive effect.<p>Instead of doing anything at all with SciHub, we should instead fight Elsevier. First blow should be on the basis that Elsevier is anti-competitive, by the logic that if wasn&#x27;t there would be no reason for it to succeed at all.<p>Second blow should be a that any partially federal funded work would be required to be publicly available, or at least not derive any profit from discouraging public access.')
