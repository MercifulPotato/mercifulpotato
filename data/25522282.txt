Now, would you call firmware uploading via iOS&#x27;s DFU mode &quot;flashing&quot; too? Or do you believe that the DFU mode is end-user accessible, thus not low-level enough? Then, would you accept that uploading the firmware to the baseband processor (which I believe uses its own EEPROM) via DFU &quot;flashing&quot;?<p>The difference is that the recovery is almost a full blown operating system. It can mount filesystems, has various shell utilities installed, and there&#x27;s a user interface (through ADB and on-screen). This in contrast to fastboot which has noneof those things, and only allows you to flash&#x2F;erase partitions with the help of a computer.')
