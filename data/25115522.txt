Given how far into the digits pi you&#x27;d have to go to find the exact right sequence that matches, eg, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;google.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;google.com</a>, though, I suspect the resulting position number would be longer than the original url!<p>Also, conceptually, it seems like you&#x27;re not so much using pi as a database as you are using it as an encoding mechanism: turning &quot;abc.com&quot; into a string of numbers whose length is relative to the original string.  At that point you might as well pick an easier encoding, like base64.  :)')
