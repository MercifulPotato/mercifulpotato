She knew I was not when we met. Her views changed and she expected mine to change with hers.<p>I signalled as brightly as I could that my love for her was true, but that my convictions are not subject to my feelings.<p>When she told me about &quot;that guy from work&quot; I knew immediately that it was more than mere sympathy on her part, but according to my convictions I did not pull a macho man to persuade her to stay with me, figuring if she loved me like I loved her, I had nothing to fear. I would have forgiven her having an affair, sometimes attraction can be overpowering.<p>She apparently registered nothing of all this, cheated me and after finally telling me she now loved work guy, her last communication before blocking me was basically &quot;I&#x27;m happy and don&#x27;t care about the 10 years of us together any more&quot;. It took me a while to sort myself out after that, but the conclusion I arrived at: Fuck that bitch, good riddance. I already changed more about myself for her than she ever deserved.<p>I don&#x27;t blame Jordan Peterson.')
