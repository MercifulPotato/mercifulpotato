I read the entire manual. I would love to use Nix.<p>But it&#x27;s too complex.<p>I guess that&#x27;s the result of them trying to do everything an OS does using their new arcane Nix language. I don&#x27;t know how else this could be accomplished though -- but I hope there is another way.<p>I find it weird often I would find files written in the Nix language in minified&#x2F;unreadable way fashion in parts of the system.<p>It&#x27;s a sympton of the complexity of everything that for every weird error that I would find I would search the internet and not find a person with the same problem. It&#x27;s always something slightly different and then the solutions proposed to that person would made no sense to me at all or they would introduce much more complexity.')
