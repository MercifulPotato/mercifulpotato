They want a government that could enforce quarantines between different states, locking people into one state or another till the virus burns itself out. That&#x27;s the way it worked in China, but is legally impossible to do in the US.<p>The US can have minor quarantines (an apartment, a city block, etc.) but we can&#x27;t legally quarantine a whole city, much less states.')
