If you proceed, we will place your order by calling PHONE_NUMBER and pick up your order from ADDRESS&quot;. It should still be legal for the end users to have a service do chores for them including picking up food but only if there is no confusion on the side of the user what is happening here (incl. the fact the pizza may get cold through a no  fault of Moms and Pops Pizza).<p>Edit: oh, the law would also outlaw food picking apps from delivering from Walmart too (&quot;The code defines food facility [...] as an operation that stores, [...] or otherwise provides food [...] at the retail level.&quot;)')
