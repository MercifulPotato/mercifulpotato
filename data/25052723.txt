Maybe you object to my first sentence but I am trying to make sure my understanding is correct with the scanario I laid out at the end. Would that require 1 or 2 conflict resolutions? I actually tried to use Pijul directly to see what would happen but I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to do it with the 1.0 alpha. I thought I&#x27;d use branches or unrecord to simulate the scenario I laid out but I could only figure out how to create branches but not switch between them (the checkout command seems to have been removed) and unrecord seemed to not only not revert files to their former state but I could not reapply the patches later with pijul apply. Also all documentation is 404. The non-alpha version of Pijul was uninstallable through cargo and the snap version segfaulted when trying to record. I really have invested time into this to try to get a proper understanding.')
