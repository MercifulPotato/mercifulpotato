I&#x27;m sure there are other ways to monetize while keeping OSS actually free. But you won&#x27;t get there when your top decision makers treat the core user base with contempt. Now they&#x27;re yet another CI company I can ignore. I&#x27;ll be happy to learn another API (Github Actions) or even pay for CI. And it leaves the door open for other innovators (now that you have stopped innovating). Great job all around guys.')
