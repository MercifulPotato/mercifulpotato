We&#x27;ve taken every presidential debate in U.S. history, stuffed them into a git repository, and made it searchable. We&#x27;ve also built tooling so that other &quot;factsets&quot; besides the debates could be added in the future.<p>You can highlight any snippet of a fact, and post it to social media. We render the text of the snippet as the social preview, and if people click it, they can see the full context it came from.<p>I&#x27;m gonna be transcribing the 2020 debates live at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twitch.tv&#x2F;mytakedotorg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twitch.tv&#x2F;mytakedotorg</a><p>If you&#x27;re interested, we really need a designer!')
