In that context, the whole complex (bank settlement, chargebacks, insolvency) are a single thing.  There are always <i>reasons</i> for things being the way they are, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that things can&#x27;t change.<p>As the OP says, payments move bits around. There is no <i>fundamental</i> reason why this should represent such a big slice.<p>Besides technical challenges, and whether or not these can be overcome... I think the greater hurdle is entrenched structure and entrenched interests. Stripe is, at this point, a part of that. They have an overwhelming microeconomic interest in payments remaining a large &quot;tax.&quot;<p>Imagine an imports &quot;agent.&quot; Her job is to get your goods into country X and navigate the labyrinth of rules, chaos, fees and taxes on your behalf. The whole game costs Y. She earns a % of Y. She may have more, and more nuanced complaints about the labyrinth than anyone but... If Y becomes less, she will earn less.')
