We have quite a few smaller professional communities switching to our airsend (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airsend.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airsend.io&#x2F;</a>) exactly for the same reason. What we hear often from these users is that managing discord (tool) takes more time than the actual communication. It is ideal for large communities but if you want something simple discord is not the way to go.')
