Actually, destructors can be called on every line of C++ code because of exceptions. This complicates understanding code flow and makes almost impossible to write exception-safe C++ code, which properly releases resources at any exception.<p>While Go supports exception-like panics, they are mostly used for really exceptional cases, when the program cannot proceed further, such as out-of-range slice accces or nil pointer dereference. Almost all these cases are triggered by programming errors, which must be fixed after the panic occurs. Traditional error handling is performed explicitly in Go instead of relying on panics - the error is checked explicitly after function call. This simplifies code reading and makes easy to spot cases with missing or incorrect error handling.  These tasks are almost impossible with try&#x2F;catch error handling.')
