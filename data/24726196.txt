It just really depends on the vibe of the company.<p>Years ago, I&#x27;d done phone calls to companies, asking for a manager (shift, dept, store, regional, whatever), and <i>almost always</i> they were... somewhat agitated&#x2F;defensive.  I expect 99% of phone calls they get were people calling to complain.  I&#x27;d say something like &quot;I dealt with person XYZ the other day and... they were phenomenal.  This was some of the best service&#x2F;care&#x2F;etc I&#x27;ve had.  You keep that person and&#x2F;or get more people like them and you&#x27;ve got a customer for life&quot;.  That sort of thing.  In one case, the person said &quot;ok, thanks.&quot; and that was it.  In most other cases the person was generally pleasantly surprised to hear good news.  Looking back, I&#x27;m pretty sure a written letter or email would possibly have done more &#x27;good&#x27; for the person in some respects, but having a pleasant&#x2F;positive conversation with someone talking up good points about another person was, for me, a positive experience in itself.')
