If people started treating as <i>one</i> domain specific protocol that display servers use for drawing stuff on the screen and not &quot;everything a desktop app might want to do&quot; protocol there would be less conflict.<p>I&#x27;m glad they&#x27;re leaving all the &quot;desktop&quot; stuff out and letting desktops agree on dbus interfaces. I doubt people writing little CLI utilities want to have to create dummy Wayland surfaces to do interact with the display server which is how wl-clipboard works.')
