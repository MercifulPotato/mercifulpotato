You can see what worked well and what didn&#x27;t, and it enables effective refactorings. That also means when writing a client, you can quickly figure out from other client code how stuff is supposed to be used. All this makes code search such an effective tool in Google&#x27;s development environment (in the broader sense).<p>If anything like this were possible for open source (indexing code that depends on a library&#x2F;API, across subrepos in any version control system, in a way that gets near complete coverage), it would enable similar possibilities of systematic improvement.<p>Alas, it does not seem realistic except in a few niches where the number of clients is bounded and code owners are willing and able to follow a protocol (approve changes to their code that unblock such global improvements.)')
