The choices are &quot;make history interesting&#x2F;easily digestible&#x2F;accessible&quot; or &quot;not have people care&quot;, unfortunately &quot;make people care more about history&quot; doesn&#x27;t just happen. I&#x27;m sorry but I&#x27;m not motivated at all to pick through old&#x2F;inaccessible texts trying to pull out some historical significance but I&#x27;ll gladly watch a documentary&#x2F;YT series&#x2F;TV docuseries that does a good job of explaining events, painting a full picture, and puts events in context.<p>The type of approach you suggest feels like the arguments about how people should just learn the CLI or low-level computer operations. The &quot;We shouldn&#x27;t bother with GUI&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;s not important that we expose functionality with pretty UI&quot;, or &quot;if people cared they would learn the CLI and be happy about it&quot;.<p>Making history&#x2F;art&#x2F;computers&#x2F;etc more accessible is not a bad thing.')
