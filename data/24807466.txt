I don&#x27;t see anything becoming nearly as dominant as the old Church used to be - not if we have our pick of ideologically diverse reading material, supportive subcultures for every individual interest, and the lack of severe punishment by God or His earthly sheriffs upon divergence.<p>People were united by a monopoly on education and political power. It&#x27;s too bad that we&#x27;re losing that ubiquitous societal fabric, but in the face of the alternative, seriously, good riddance.<p>If spiritualism is your thing though, do drop by at a Unitarian Church close to you. It&#x27;s an interesting experience. Not for me, but still warmly recommended.')
