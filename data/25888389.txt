If it is not, I have to focus much more, and that adds up over the course of a day.<p>My brain can just recognize what&#x27;s happening in a small block of code if it has a particular shape and colors. I don&#x27;t know how to explain it better than that.<p>This is one reason I REALLY want to see editors save files as tokens rather than plain text, and see compilers ingest code as pre-parsed tokens rather than plain text. (Or have editors save the tokenized file alongside a plain text file for the compiler.)<p>If that ever happens, I will be able to view the code exactly as I like it, and so will everyone else, even when we each want to view it differently.<p>Compilers and diffing tools will need to report a token number rather than a line number for errors and differences, and I don&#x27;t see that as a big problem at all.')
