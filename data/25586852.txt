This is maybe a different aspect than what others have been trying to explain, but I found the socket-based example enlightening.<p><i>Type states</i> allow the state of the socket (unbound, bound, listening, closed) to be expressed as a part of the type (a type annotation, if you will) so the compiler can verify that you&#x27;re not reusing a closed socket, or try to send data over an unbound socket.<p><i>Linear types</i> then, allow to express in code how a type (annotation) changes over time (e.g., &quot;bind() takes an unbound socket and returns it an a bound state&quot;) so the compiler can statically check that it&#x27;s in a valid state for every operation.')
