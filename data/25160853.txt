I&#x27;m bookmarking it as an answer to the question, &quot;Why does development take so long&#x2F;cost so much?&quot;<p>As an outsider to games, it&#x27;s easy for me to naively think, &quot;After decades, getting stuff on screens should be a solved problem, right?&quot; It isn&#x27;t, of course. But there are so many good examples here of why. Visual improvements. Tooling improvements. Cleaning up old messes. And of course a bunch of &quot;we&#x27;re switching from thing X to thing Y&quot; and &quot;we have to keep up with the ever-shifting platforms we&#x27;re building on top of&quot;.<p>So you end up with an obviously great engineer spending 8 years on things that neither the audience nor your investors would necessarily notice. But those things clearly matter, and a mere 14 years later contribute to a $1b IPO.')
