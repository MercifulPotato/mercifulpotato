It took Mike Milley 5 days to realize he&#x27;d been lied to about the purpose of him following Trump? I could see this being political where he was hoping it would blow over quickly &amp; he wouldn&#x27;t be dragged in, but only apologizing when it didn&#x27;t. That&#x27;s politicking though &amp; I would hope that military generals, in an age of misinformation, are proactive about correcting the record. Another interpretation is that he was 100% on board with the President&#x27;s plan &amp; miscalculated the impact it would have on him.')
