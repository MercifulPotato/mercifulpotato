Have a careful look at the Desktop Environment, i.e., which one suits you. Doesn&#x27;t take long to figure out whether a distro is for you or not. If you don&#x27;t like it from trying coming from a Mac, then it won&#x27;t be good enough for the long haul.<p>I&#x27;ve tried so fedora, Pop!_OS, elementary, KDE Neon. As a long term Ubuntu &#x2F; Debian (server) user I was used to apt but would be open to other package managers. Based on my trials, I&#x27;m probably going to go ahead with KDE Neon, that is Ubuntu with KDE Plasma Desktop. This seems to be a nice cross-over between Windows 10 and MacOS with sane defaults but enough options to tailor it to my liking.')
