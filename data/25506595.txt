Thank you.<p>My wife&#x27;s father (my father-in-law) passed away just 2 days ago at 75 years old with severe dementia due to a series of mini-strokes in his brain over the last ~5-6 years. I can&#x27;t remember the medical term, but due to weakened and brittle blood vessels in the brain from plaque build-ups within the vessels.  Doctors said he was in perfect health other than this single reason. With each mini-stroke, you could see him get knocked down step by step.  He&#x27;d recover a little, but never back to baseline (which kept getting lower).<p>Seeing him go from the strong-handshaking, always smiling Minnesota corn farmer patriarch who regularly would outwork me when I&#x27;d be helping him with house projects....to seeing him take his last breath surrounded by his wife, 4 daughters, several granddaughters, and me...was heartbreaking.<p>...from the article, Jo was 40 years old.  I&#x27;m 47 as I type this and cannot comprehend that happening so early.')
