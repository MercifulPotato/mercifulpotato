It was also pushed heavily by car manufacturers as a stall to get around clean air mandates while avoiding developing electric vehicles (with their inherent threats to after-sales service revenues). Now individual, corporate and national egos are on the line and sunk costs are so huge that many players are politically incapable of backing out.<p>As an energy storage medium it&#x27;s terrible. It&#x27;s inefficient to produce, relatively inefficient to use, very difficult to store, and inconvenient to transport. There&#x27;s no reason to prefer it over lithium batteries except that it perpetuates the refinery -&gt; distributor -&gt; truck -&gt; fuel station-&gt; consumer model.')
