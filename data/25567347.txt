It’s symptom-based “maybe it’s endo but until we open you up and scope you, there’s no way to tell.”<p>And no idea what causes it, how to treat it, and what all does it affect. Does it cause infertility? Who knows. Maybe. Does it need to be removed? Maybe. Depends. Is there medication? Not exactly. Can you do anything to reduce the effects? Be healthier.<p>It is one of the most frustrating things to go through and it absolutely messes with the quality of life. It’s basically the “default:” or “Other” for all undiagnosable issues.')
