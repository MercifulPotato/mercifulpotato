I strongly recommend the early Wolfe, but the later Wolfe is a lesser author.<p>In that decade, Wolfe produced three large works (<i>The Fifth Head of Cerberus</i>, <i>Peace</i> and <i>The Book of the New Sun</i>) and a number of short stories where the prose was incredibly rich and beautiful, fully the equal of Proust or Nabokov. His reputation should rest on these.<p>But from the early 1980s, his prose became drab, lackluster. He still could impress readers with his plots that invariably featured unreliable narrators and ellipsis, but even this was gradually taken to the point of absurdity. By the turn of the millennium, he felt like a one-trick pony. His editors at Tor apparently accepted every manuscript he submitted, but the late flood of weak novels IMHO diluted his stature.')
