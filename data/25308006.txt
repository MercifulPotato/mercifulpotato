They didn&#x27;t invent the map or reduce functions, nor is the MapReduce system they published really about map or reduce functions.<p>The correct name is really MapShuffleReduce and the most important step is the shuffle, because it&#x27;s a distributed sort.  Of course, they didn&#x27;t invent distributed sort, but combining these three concepts together in a distributed fashion and running it as a production system is really what was important.')
