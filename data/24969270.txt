I am working at a small startup where we are developing a new way of controlled drug delivery. This will allow you to precisely control the timing and dose of your choice compounds. It will work for most well known nootropics (melatonin, L-theanine, caffeine etc). This is obviously great in situations where you want some predefined cue to trigger a drug release (Iâ€™ll let your imagination run wild here). As we are finalizing our hardware spec, we are really looking to talk to potential users to get a feel for what is valued. It would be most amazing to get your feedback and thoughts.
