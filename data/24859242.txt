We were lucky that COVID wasn&#x27;t more deadly than it was. I mean, 200k deaths and people still complain about wearing a little piece of cloth over their face. What happens when the hypothetical next &quot;COVID-21&quot; comes that&#x27;s 20X deadlier? Do we all just suck it up and die, because we won&#x27;t temporarily give up the freedom of eating at Olive Garden? Sorry, but I&#x27;m not willing to risk a double digit percentage chance of getting sick and possibly dying, just to retain the convenience of indoor shopping and getting my hair cut.')
