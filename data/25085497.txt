Mandated reuse of some component of a prior vehicle is, by definition, an extra constraint on the new design.  Extra constraints make design harder, not necessarily safer, and the use of old stuff in the new vehicle to some extent  kills the “flight proven-ness” of the old thing.<p>(Generally speaking.  Maybe some of this is less of a factor or more depending on the system...  point is you can’t say up front that old hardware is a good idea)')
