Making a user indistinguishable from a typical user from country X is just the VPN doing its job correctly.<p>It seems, however, that at least some VPN providers use their customers&#x27; bandwidth without their knowledge to route other customers through it. I&#x27;d say that qualifies as sketchy.<p>Although on an entirely personal level, I&#x27;m not a fan of stuff like going through VPN to use Disney+. I think people should ideally either not watch or pirate geoblocked content. Consuming geoblocked content through VPNs is basically letting such companies get away with discrimination and still get your money.')
