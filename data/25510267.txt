Y is going to destroy America! &lt;insert imagery of America being destroyed under Y&gt;<p>A political ad is substantially more than awareness (which I&#x27;m not denying as being a part, I&#x27;m saying it is a small part). But this ad, like most, are there to convince you. It is still an ad.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that there aren&#x27;t awareness based ads. There&#x27;s also shitty ads run by first year film students. But these aren&#x27;t what people are being bombarded with on prime time TV, in Times Square, or on popular websites. This isn&#x27;t a mathematical proof where a single counter example discredits an entire thesis, because we aren&#x27;t working in absolutes here. Acting like it does is arguing in bad faith. For what it is worth, the examples I gave for Coke and car commercials are taught in first year marketing courses as well as psychology courses.')
