I think it applies to other things too.<p>In my personal life is when I am working on a large scope project, I tend to try to anticipate every single thing that I will have to do up front. But I&#x27;ve found I always miss something or misunderstand a requirement. It&#x27;s way more efficient to just do things as they come up, and I&#x27;m trying to switch to that method more often.<p>I definitely relate to taking some kind of programming related course and they teach you about something you will never use, that people rarely use in real world scenarios, but there&#x27;s still a pressure to make sure I fully understand it.')
