In the original article, it states:<p>&quot;For the Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage I assumed average between upload&#x2F;download price because upload is two times cheaper then download.&quot;<p>In fact, uploads on B2 are free, and download bandwidth is cheaper than any other supplier I know of at 1 cent per GB, with a free daily allowance of 1GB.  Storage rates are 1&#x2F;2 cent per GB per month, of $5&#x2F;mo per TB, including redundancy.<p>The storage cost of 5TB for Backblaze B2 for 5 years would be $60&#x2F;year or $300 for 5 years, the upload cost is free, and if you downloaded your entire 5TB each month, it would cost less than $600 over 5 years because you&#x27;d also have the 1GB&#x2F;day free download allowance.  HashBackup (I&#x27;m the author) uses the free B2 daily allowance to pack older backup data, which sometimes requires an download and upload cycle.<p>I couldn&#x27;t find the upload&#x2F;download bandwidth assumptions, but these numbers are way off IMO.')
