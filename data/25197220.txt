When you pay your annual tax or go for the inspection, you either take a readout of the car&#x27;s consumption metrics from the OBC or have the shop&#x2F;DMV do it.<p>Then you charge tax based on the consumption. Thus, someone who used electric a lot gets charged less than someone who didn&#x27;t, which is what the incentives for PHEV&#x27;s are supposed to encourage anyway.')
