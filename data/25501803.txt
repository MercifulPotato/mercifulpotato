Item(by='centimeter', descendants=None, kids=[25501934, 25502031], score=None, time=1608599911, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25500671, text='This article is absolute garbage. It’s embarrassing that it got this high on the front page.<p>It has zero information. It’s a paean to smug, unconsidered mediocrity.<p>Not only is the premise of the tenuous analogy likely completely wrong (the preponderance of evidence suggests eating “mostly plants” is, in fact, anywhere from bad to terrible for you, depending on your choice of plants), but the way in which it’s presented is absurd as well; paying lip service to “incontrovertible scientific research” and then writing an article <i>completely free</i> of any references to such research.<p>The only thing of value I took away from this article is that the author posted it 3 times this week, and it only got popular on the 3rd try. So if you want to get something to the front page of HN, post it a bunch of times!')
