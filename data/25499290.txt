After you take hostages, then you decide what kind of ransom you want. It&#x27;s how every monopoly tends to behave, they push outward leveraging their position and try to put as many defensive moats into place as they can.<p>If speed was actually their concern, they happen to control a search monopoly that pretends to very much care about performance and speed. If any of that were really true, they can practically flip a switch and smash every slow site on the Web. Aggressively turn up the penalty on such terrible sites. In less than a year they&#x27;d all jump to and get in line, or they would die, banished from <i>all</i> search results (sorry, your site sucks so bad we&#x27;re not even going to index that garbage). Google is happy to banish sites for political-ideological reasons based on the bias of their employees, but they can&#x27;t be bothered for performance reasons? It reveals a lot as Google knows it would be easy to fix without AMP. Speed is not the primary agenda of AMP, control is; speed is an excellent cover story.')
