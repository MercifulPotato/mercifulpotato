It’s within the speed limit, and a smaller absolute speed differential between lowest and highest speed.<p>Similar arguments have been made against average speed cameras on UK motorways - “I’ll have to be entirely focused on the speedo the whole time!”. No, you just drive within the speed limit.<p>The speed limit is not a target.')
