And the point why it isn&#x27;t is because we pay now more attention to the target of racism than the perpetrator.<p>&gt; You need to look at if there was an intent or a conscious prejudice.<p>Or alternatively, you need to look at what happens to the people being subjected to racism. Practically no one wants to be seen as a racist anymore. Intent and conscious prejudice is now hidden.<p>In my eyes, that is progress. We move forward from assigning guilt to trying to improve the situation for people subjected to racism.<p>I kind of doubt, that it will mean, more people would be happy or neutral being called a racists.')
