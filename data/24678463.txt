Someone who can make this argument could well be a monarchist, fascist, or totalitarian at heart. The foundation of a democracy is the belief that the &quot;unwashed masses&quot; can hold informed views on politics, and at the very least should have the right to.<p>Also, the average person DOES care what a rational argument is. A significant amount of Trump&#x27;s 2016 voter base understood him to be a populist to the left of Hillary. His campaign rhetoric of isolationism and ending the wars spoke to large swaths of the population, which swept him into office.<p>Now, all the issues you point out are important, and must be tackled, but I don&#x27;t think the right way to tackle them is to label groups of people with a broad brush.<p>If we understand that people are capable of being informed, we should ask: &quot;how can people be informed&gt;&quot;, and &quot;what can we do to make sure that informing people in an unbiased way is possible?&quot;. I don&#x27;t think social media companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit have asked themselves these questions, at least not with any sincerity.<p>I think HN is a great example of the principles of (nearly) free speech in action.
