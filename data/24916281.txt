If you assume that the only thing which really matters is the quality of your own life, then sure. But if you consider that other people exist outside of your life, and that eventually we all die -- how objectively valuable is the amount of dopamine secreted by your brain over your lifetime?<p>And even if &quot;amount of dopamine secreted over your lifetime&quot; is the metric you measure life by, doing something to improve the state of the world will result in heightened dopamine in many more brains than your own. Is your view that no other brain&#x27;s dopamine is objectively valuable in comparison to your own? Given that human societies have existed since before we existed as a species, it seems to me this view is not tenable unless you wish to spend your life yak shaving by yourself.<p>In my view this degree of nihilism is a little draining, but my point is that you have to have already made several assumptions about value which presuppose your conclusion.')
