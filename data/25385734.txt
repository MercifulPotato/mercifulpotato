Item(by='nameless912', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607694912, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25378551, text='It took me a very, very, very long time after I got my diagnosis of Bipolar II and ASD to check the box saying I was disabled. This is even after a couple of crisis calls, nearly failing out of college, nearly destroying my relationship with my partner, and having a couple of really rough months early in my career where I was worried I would be fired for not getting anything done.<p>The stigma around being disabled is very, very real. My parents still hate that I embrace that label. They point to my uncle who is schizophrenic and has severe arthritis and who has been on disability since they were in their mid-30s and say &quot;see, HE&#x27;s disabled, you aren&#x27;t!&quot; and it&#x27;s incredibly difficult to deal with. Because I&#x27;m now medicated, have a stable relationship with my partner, see a therapist once a week, and have special accommodations with my boss (mostly around taking sick leave a little more frequently than &quot;average&quot; but keeping him in the loop when I&#x27;m having a bad day), my life externally looks &quot;normal&quot;. I work 40(ish) hours a week, my partner and I own a house, we recently moved back home to be closer to family, and we&#x27;re happy. But I still check that little box because of all the work that it took me to get there, and because more people need to know that disability and work are not mutually exclusive.<p>I&#x27;ve started being more &quot;out&quot; about my disability (it&#x27;s funny, my partner semi-recently came out as bisexual and I&#x27;ve learned a lot from her about how to own my identity), becoming more comfortable talking with people about it at work and in my personal life. I&#x27;m helping out with a new ERG at my job that talks about disability as it pertains to our field and I&#x27;m trying my best to be true to myself. It&#x27;s hard because others still see someone who&#x27;s &quot;fine&quot;, but I&#x27;m getting more comfortable every day with my identity. I just hope that my being more open changes someone&#x27;s mind some day about either their perception of others, or their perception of themselves.')
