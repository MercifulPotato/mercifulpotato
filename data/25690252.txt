I&#x27;m banning your account until we get some reason to believe that you want to use this site as intended. That level of abuse is deeply not ok.<p>No, I&#x27;m not siding with liar-fascist-traitors. We&#x27;d ban any account that posted this way. Being right doesn&#x27;t give you any excuse to behave like this, and no matter how wrong your enemies are, it doesn&#x27;t give you the right to destroy the commons. It&#x27;s not in your own interest to do so, either, but that&#x27;s another story.')
