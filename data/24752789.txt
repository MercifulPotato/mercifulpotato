Then you&#x27;ll end up released at an earlier date.<p>If you&#x27;ve already lost your job and can&#x27;t afford rent anywhere, it might also make sense - getting a job and renting a place are hard to do, and to do all that only to later be convicted and sent to prison and end up defaulting on your rental contract and being declared bankrupt - might not be the best move for your post-prison prospects.')
