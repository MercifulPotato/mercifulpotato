Some of them have USB DACs and wired headphones, mechanical keyboards, special mice or trackballs, charger cords for their phone, laptop docking stations, smart card readers, mouse pads, network cables, etc.<p>I can kind of see the point for locations where aesthetics are more important than usability (eg. receptionists) but otherwise for most people it wouldn&#x27;t add that much, since they&#x27;d lose the aesthetic by plugging in whatever cord they need to charge their phone, USB coffee mug heater or whatever.<p>A more useful thing in my option would be a build your own option that allows placing items where you&#x27;d want them and have it route and build the thing automatically, but I&#x27;m not sure part of that target market, so take that with an appropriate amount of salt. :-)')
