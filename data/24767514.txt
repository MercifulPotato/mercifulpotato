Why not select the worst 119 days of ww2 and compare it to 119 days of covid? After all, most of 1366 days of ww2 didn&#x27;t involve actual fighting. Also, are we including definitive covid deaths or &quot;covid related deaths&quot;. Because if we included &quot;ww2 related deaths and not just combat deaths&quot;, then I suspect that ratio would plummet towards 0.<p>&gt; I would be curious to know what rate of death you would consider abnormal.<p>I guess it depends, but spike in deaths every now and then is normal even if it looks abnormal. It may sound counterintuitive but that&#x27;s just life.<p>Your statistical analysis is intentionally dishonest. You cherrypicked the time frame and example to fit your agenda. How about try another set of data - the US combat deaths on D-Day ( 2500 deaths ) and extrapolate that to 119 days and population adjust and enjoy. Funny how that makes covid look like a walk in the park huh? But if I did that, it would be just as intellectually dishonest as your example.<p>Also, almost all of the combat deaths in ww2 was young healthy men whereas covid seems to afflict predominantly older people - almost all of them 45 and over. So not quite apples to apples right?')
