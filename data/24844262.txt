Your bias is clear, and so strong that you&#x27;re already assuming I have a side so you can argue against it when I only talked about the media.<p>&gt; <i>&quot;Distrust everyone, and you’ll believe anyone.&quot;</i><p>No. Did you just make this up? I don&#x27;t believe anyone <i>because</i> I distrust them all. That&#x27;s what &quot;distrust&quot; literally means.<p>&gt; <i>&quot;Books will help broaden your perspective&quot;</i><p>I know. I&#x27;m discussing the state of the media, not worried about my perspective.<p>&gt; <i>&quot;is demonstrably untrue and a falsehood.&quot;</i><p>Just say &quot;lie&quot;. These are same weasley words that media often uses to create a narrative. However my statement can never be a lie regardless of how you feel about it because it&#x27;s my personal assessment.<p>&gt; <i>&quot;people’s confidence in reputable sources&quot;</i><p>Politifact isn&#x27;t a news site. Pro Public might be good but, again, I don&#x27;t care about site reputation. It no longer matters because this authority has been disaggregated and over-extended, a problem caused by the media itself. I look at every piece as an isolated instance and apply trust based on numerous factors, with the publishing organization very far down that list. I find this approach far superior in uncovering the truth.<p>I also have no interest or responsibility in other people&#x27;s confidence in the media, and I&#x27;ll freely express what I think. If their confidence is shaken so easily then maybe the problem is how little trust they already have in the precarious state of the media today. If you disagree and want to still rely on publisher-based reputation then that&#x27;s your prerogative, but don&#x27;t project your insecurities or political beliefs onto me.')
