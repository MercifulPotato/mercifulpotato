The money left on the table is due to them selling at $68 when they likely could have sold for high (given the pent up demand).<p>Some people argue that they wouldn&#x27;t have been able to sell all X shares at $130 per share. That may be the case, but it&#x27;s really hard not to think the $68 price was way too low.<p>You can issue more shares to raise more money and drive the price down, but you never can undo the discount you gave the IPO investors.')
