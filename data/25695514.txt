I&#x27;m just demonstrating that not only the left <i>wants</i> to speak to the extremists, but also the right itself wants (Pence and Fox News). But the extremists don&#x27;t care: they&#x27;re even attacking both left and right preemptively. There&#x27;s <i>zero</i> interest from extremists to understand opposing opinions.<p>This theory that the left is to blame for the radicalisation of those people holds absolutely no water.')
