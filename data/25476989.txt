SNR is at best 65dB, low frequencies go through processing before getting cut to account for limitations of the medium and channel separation is less than 30dB. Furthermore, there&#x27;s wow, flutter and rumble. You also have issues with RIAA equalization (many preamps STILL can&#x27;t get that right) and cartridge loading, that end up affecting high frequency response. The latter is also affected by stylus and record wear.<p>With vinyl being such a technically flawed medium, ofcourse you could A&#x2F;B between that and a high bitrate MP3 file that most probably is transparent to a lossless source. MP3 reaches transparency at lower bitrates, as has been proven by ABX (not A&#x2F;B, those are useless from a scientific perspective) tests conducted in many communities like Hydrogen Audio.')
