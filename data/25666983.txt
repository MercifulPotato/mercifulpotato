DC sort of gets the <i>opposite</i> treatment, though, which is good from that perspective but sort of sucks for the people living there, since they have limited autonomy. So I&#x27;d posit that DC, the territory, should have <i>no</i> residents besides the President himself; the only way I get that without forcing seven hundred thousand people to move is to change ownership of the land to some state that wants it.')
