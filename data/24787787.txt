This goes for Amazon, Netflix, Youtube, etc.  They all seem to think whatever I bought&#x2F;watched recently must be like the only thing I&#x27;m interested in.<p>Just some basic logic could weed out stuff from suggestions - if I buy a fairy princess doll (for a niece) but all my other purchases are tools, computer&#x2F;electronics, video games, household supplies, etc. then obviously that was a gift or one time type of purchase, even if I shipped it to myself.  Don&#x27;t make suggestions for more fairy princess doll like products because that is the last thing I bought.<p>I would think they could group users together anonymously and provide trending suggestions based on that.  I&#x27;m sure there are lots of people with similar sets of categories and they are buying&#x2F;watching things.<p>The Netflix Top 10 in the US list is a start in that direction.<p>Unfortunately Amazon seems more motivated to suggest advertised products (actual advertised ones and ones with inflated fake ratings), their own products and probably stuff they want to get out of warehouses before caring or tracking what a customer is actually interested in.<p>Them caring about what <i>you</i> want doesn&#x27;t make them more money.')
