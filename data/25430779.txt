How much extra paperwork, tariffs, expenses, licenses, applications-for-permission etc there will be come 31st December, how we can no longer conduct some kinds of business, how professional qualifications cease to be valid in Britain after 31st December, and how some people who are currently employed can no longer be employed from 1st January.<p>All the adverts and policy effects that actually affect people are focused on 31.12.2020.<p>(Reading between the lines it also means some people will no longer be permitted a bank account or the ability to rent a roof starting in the middle of next year, though the government prefers not to headline that unpalatable truth.)<p>On 31.12.2020 things will change in a way that affects some of us harshly indeed.<p>I&#x27;m British.<p>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, Brexit proper happens for me on 31.12.2020 because that&#x27;s the day I&#x27;m deprived of my previous life-long right to work, study and move my life to the other EU countries, which I have previously used, and hoped to use again :&#x27;(<p>I absolutely hate that such a major freedom, and my family&#x27;s freedom, and my EU citizenship, is being taken away so forcefully against my consent and without me breaking any laws.<p>I was considering leaving Britain and emigrating to another EU country this year under EU-citizenship-grandfathering terms, but Covid made it infeasible.  If the Brexit transition period had been extended I might have been able to do it next year, but it will cease to be possible after 31.12.2020.<p>What a Christmas present.<p>On 31st this year, around midnight, many of us will mark a day of darkness and sadness, as doors close on our life choices, and the Britain some of us had some sort of love and pride in some years ago finally ceases to exist.')
