It means you have much less control over what you focus on. ADHD people can even have a tendency to hyperfocus on things that interest them or give them a constant dopamine drip. Hyperfocus can lead them to forget to eat or stay up very late without even noticing, simply because they&#x27;re focused so hard on the thing they&#x27;re preoccupied by.')
