One part was on building a company to appeal to basic instincts vs creating tools and systems to benefit people.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;1e8VZlPBx_0?t=2814" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;1e8VZlPBx_0?t=2814</a><p>There are universal human traits that have negative impacts on people over the long-term but are craved during the short-term. These are like legal drugs. If you can use a few of these traits and tie them to an addictive feedback loop, then you probably have a product that&#x27;s successful (and totally evil). It&#x27;s concerning that some of the bestselling books in the startup bubble are about how to create these addictions in people.<p>It would be nice if there were more tools and systems companies for helping humanity grow. I guess most modern day big companies are like a mix of the two. For every major social network there are usually some awesome engineering tools that get open sourced. It&#x27;s harder to create a tools only or systems only kind of company but they&#x27;re definitely nice since they expand the way we all think.')
