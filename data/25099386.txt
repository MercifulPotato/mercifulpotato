Personally, I prefer using an open source alternative OS where generally everything is disbled by default.  (NetBSD is best exemple I have found.)  Commercial OS like the ones created by Apple, Microsoft, Google, etc. have default settings that are opinionated, i.e., some users might not wish to choose these settings. This puts a burden on the user to disable or work around them somehow.  Apple iOS and MacOS by default generate a considerable amount of network traffic to Apple servers as soon as they are powered on.  When I power on a computer running NetBSD, there is by default no traffic to a corporate mothership.<p>Given the choice between (a) a corporate OS that requires me to perform some amount of work to &quot;turn off&quot; some &quot;features&quot; the corporation has enabled and (b) a non-corporate OS that requires me to perform some amount of work to &quot;turn on&quot; the &quot;features&quot; that I want to use, I prefer (b).')
