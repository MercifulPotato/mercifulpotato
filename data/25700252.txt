It was a great country to boost my career but the lack of hills&#x2F;mountains&#x2F;nature (not designed by humans) eventually forced me to leave.<p>On the topic of bikes... Iâ€™ve got in the spare room: Orange 224 + P7 (both 2008);  Genesis Flyer (2019);  Canondale CAAD8 (2010); Production Privee Shan No.5 (2020)... and a Sparta Dutch city bike with a huge basket and panniers :)  Pretty much covered for any scenario!')
