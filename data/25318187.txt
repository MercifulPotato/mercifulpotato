Capitalists have a point here. I tend to argue that at least in democratic societies people have some control over it, whereas in a free labor market they don&#x27;t. But in practice, like so many things democracy is supposed to fix, people largely aren&#x27;t concerned with it.<p>&gt; Of course it is. Teaching an employee on your systems&#x2F;way of working costs money and is an element in the decision of whether or not to hire an employee. This decision affects demand and therefore price&#x2F;wages.<p>Definitely, stickiness works both ways. We&#x27;ve all probably encountered situations where someone&#x27;s made themselves virtually unfireable because no one can do the things they can. I think generally people characterize that as some kind of selfishness or at least a labor antipattern, but I tend to view it as a rational response to a lack of financial stability: if your employer can completely destabilize you financially, it&#x27;s pretty rational to take drastic steps to guard against that.<p>Suffice to say it&#x27;s complicated; far more complicated than the supply&#x2F;demand curves charts you get in econ 101.<p>---<p>I&#x27;ll add that my prescription generally is:<p>- Enshrine the right to organize<p>- Require equal profit sharing across all employees<p>- Require significant worker representation on corporate boards<p>- Heavily tax relatively high salaries, e.g. if everyone makes $1m then 0 tax. If one person makes $100k and 99 others make $1, insane super tax them down to $100 (include tricky stuff like bonuses or whatever)<p>- Heavily tax nationally high salaries with a progressive income tax<p>- Heavily punish tax dodging<p>- Set the minimum wage to a living wage and pin it to the CPI<p>- Abolish &quot;right to work&quot;')
