Item(by='ygra', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610635653, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25772481, text='For a long time I&#x27;ve had my full name as user name on my machine, which meant that my user profile path contains both a space (evil) and a non-ASCII character (even more evil, although it&#x27;s in Latin 1 at least). A lot of things break on one or both of those things and at times it&#x27;s a bit annoying to deal with. Some bug reports have also been closed as &quot;Won&#x27;t fix, just don&#x27;t do that. Who needs spaces in paths, anyway?&quot;. I haven&#x27;t tried to use non-Latin Unicode in my user name and profile directory, which would break everything that uses the old ANSI APIs on Windows instead of the Unicode ones, and that&#x27;s probably way too much breakage. But broken nonetheless, and that includes a lot of new, recent, and still-maintained software :-&#x2F;<p>In a similar vein, I&#x27;ve also used U+2212 as minus sign in my regional settings. There&#x27;s a lot of software that refuses to parse numbers it previously happily emitted.<p>I&#x27;ve given up on that too, by now, though. The only thing I still do is using English as UI language (so I don&#x27;t have to deal with bad translations of software), but German as my regional settings (with ISO 8601 dates). There&#x27;s a lot of software out there (I think GNU gettext is broken in that way on Windows) that assumes that the way I want my dates and numbers formatted has any bearing on the language I want to see in an application. Many others don&#x27;t care about the regional settings and use the UI language to also format dates, times, and numbers. That&#x27;s annoying, but at least nothing breaks, so that&#x27;s the only deviation from the standard user I still use, to still be able to work.')
