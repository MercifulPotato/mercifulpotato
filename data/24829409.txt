Everything that we&#x27;ve observed that moves through spacetime is bent by gravity. That&#x27;s why we say that gravity is a warping of spacetime itself, where electromagnetism isn&#x27;t.<p>If you tried to build the &quot;general electromagnetic theory of relativity&quot;, then 0 charged particles wouldn&#x27;t follow a straight line on a geodesic of spacetime. With gravity, <i>everything</i> follows a straight-line on the geodesic of a curved straight line, regardless of its mass.<p>As to why such a difference exists between gravity and electromagnetism, that&#x27;s well above my pay grade.')
