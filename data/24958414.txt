And am always curious to see what other people come up with.<p>Oh I was disappointed. Logging in on a mobile device was already cumbersome. Finally checked on the desktop and tested a bit. But the UX is so messy! It&#x27;s really not clean nor simple to use.<p>Would never want to use that with SCRUM. Just having to think about on boarding customer to this tool gives me headaches.<p>Recently, we have switched to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linear.app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linear.app</a> (note: I have no affiliation with them). It&#x27;s just super amazing to use, lots of shortcut, clear, dead simple, well documented. Perfect balance for us.<p>Hope this comments helps both the team behind Tara and some other looking at alternatives.')
