I don&#x27;t see any good competitor in the area. I would love to be able to perform longer analyses in a statically typed platform, and transition to a production system without having to change languages. I think lots of people have similar needs.<p>The OWL libraries are surprisingly good despite having very little developer mass behind them. Of course the whole ecosystem is tiny in comparison with Julia, let alone Python. I wonder if large users like Jane Street have their own private Ocaml implementations of the equivalents to NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Keras.')
