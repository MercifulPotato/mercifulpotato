Intercepting this single token allows attacked to craws whole internal system. It wont grant access to other users data, but nevertheless it doesn&#x27;t seem like a secure solution to me.<p>&gt; Each sub-service can have in token what is required to access it, and that can be managed by main frontend service.<p>This would require UA token to contain audience claim of every single internal service, this is unlikely to pass security review.')
