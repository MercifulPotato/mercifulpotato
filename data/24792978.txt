If you have a phone battery for only a year, that&#x27;s 365 charge cycles of a 3000mAh battery.  At $0.20 a kWh you end up with less than a dollar for a year&#x27;s worth of power.<p><pre><code>    3000mAh*3.8v &#x2F;1000 = 13.3Wh in a phone battery.\n    13.3Wh * $0.20&#x2F;kWh * 365 ~= $0.95 a year\n</code></pre>\nEven at 10 years of life, it takes a dollar of energy to make a battery at a 10:1 cost?  Seems like a fine trade.')
