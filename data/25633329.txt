If you don’t know how, then take a minute to google the processes that lead up to the improvement... slowly you internalize that knowledge and it becomes second nature.<p>It’s an exercise, but after a week or two you will come to do it naturally. Just make sure you tell people your ideas if your not going to use them.<p>I’ve found that when you “release” an idea, better ones follow.')
