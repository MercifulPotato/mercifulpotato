Observe council meetings and school board meetings and committee meetings.  Whatever is public.  This stuff can be boring; you&#x27;ll observe pointless personality clashes and interminable dumb arguments, but at the same time, this is where important decisions that affect your community get made.  Once you understand the issues, you can work to influence policy in the direction that you think is best for your city.  You can do this by offering comments during public comment sessions, organizing a group of like-minded people, or even running for office yourself.<p>It&#x27;s a big time committment, but this is how change happens.  We like to malign our political system, but it&#x27;s set up for you to participate, and that&#x27;s something we should cherish.')
