If your front-end is making 18 queries to REST API and you&#x27;re making a case for how awesome GraphQL is, I think perhaps your REST API design needs to be properly thought out. I personally like to start with GraphQL, once everything is ready and I know what I want, write proper API endpoints. They can be REST-ful or REST-less. One API call for one function the front-end needs to perform.<p>I think a good way of doing this is to use Postgraphile&#x2F;Hasura to make a quick and easy GQL API, and then when you move to your &quot;proper API endpoints&quot;, you can use Postgraphile in schema-only mode [0] at first, and then you have the ability to arbitrarily change endpoints to use custom SQL queries instead of using Postgraphile to build your query, while leaving other, simpler endpoints to still use Postgraphile.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.graphile.org&#x2F;postgraphile&#x2F;usage-schema&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.graphile.org&#x2F;postgraphile&#x2F;usage-schema&#x2F;</a>')
