Any solution will not be uniformly adopted and there will be multiple competing solutions, lacking various levels of polish. Also the money under Linux is with servers, so unless <i>that</i> changes, the desktop landscape is never going to approach MacOS or iOS cohesiveness. Too many ideas, too many projects and efforts, too little top-level organisation and too little time or monetary interest for consumer desktop solutions, especially by the largest players who&#x27;re all focused on the server and cloud and any benefit for the desktop is incidental.')
