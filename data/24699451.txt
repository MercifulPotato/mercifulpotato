If you let someone into your home, and one of them is going to die if they don&#x27;t steal food from you, which person is more likely to steal food from you?<p>Google&#x27;s business model literally does not allow it to be ethical.<p>&gt; <i>The HN discourse around Microsoft these days really just shows that Microsoft&#x27;s attempts to buy back goodwill with things like VS Code must be working.</i><p>I see a lot of people with your point of view. Are you still influenced by your perceptions of Microsoft from the Ballmer and Gates days?<p>I was also in the industry at that time, and today&#x27;s Microsoft is just a different company. It&#x27;s leadership is different, most of the Baller&#x2F;Gates people have left, and their policies are completely different.<p>VS Code is great, but Microsoft isn&#x27;t doing anything to lock you into it. I don&#x27;t use it at all. TypeScript and .NET are both IDE-agnostic, for example.<p>Companies aren&#x27;t people. They don&#x27;t have consistent cultures, personalities, or beliefs. Microsoft sucked in the past, but they&#x27;re the only large tech company that I&#x27;m not actively angry at on a daily basis anymore.')
