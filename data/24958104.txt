Hugely important for Cloze cards and language learning.<p>It really isn&#x27;t even a comparison...the mobile app is only useful if I&#x27;m on the go and have a minute to do some cards. An hour on the desktop version will let you do hundreds, even thousands of cards, while mobile is maybe a hundred, tops, assuming you want to stare at your phone that long.')
