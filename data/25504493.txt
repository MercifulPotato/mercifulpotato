Folding it up to put in its padded bag takes less than 30 seconds and I do that every time I put it away in my hall.  I don&#x27;t own a flight case for it but they exist and don&#x27;t require disassembly to use.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that everyone does this, just that treating a bike like a musical instrument isn&#x27;t that far fetched an idea.<p>&gt; you must admit having several bikes is pretty extreme in itself.<p>I&#x27;m in a bike club.
