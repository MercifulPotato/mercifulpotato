I have lost access to my account and the money in it, because they have the wrong phone number on file. In their support forum, there are pages of people with the same issue - they&#x27;re locked out of their account, with seemingly no way to contact anyone at PayPal to resolve it.<p>I hope they get sued for this practice of abandoning their customers, cutting off contact, and keeping the money.')
