If the autocomplete comes up fast, you are a happy developer, if your scripts finish running instantly on every save, you are a happy developer. If you click and it runs, you are a happy developer.\nIf you think about it, Docker itself is about that comfort of not having to deal with the tool setup every time. On Apple dev technology that&#x27;s the default without Docker. Search for Xcode on AppStore, click download,  click open once it&#x27;s downloaded, write your Swift code that can do UI and backend , click run and it runs. Sometimes autocomplete stops working but you just close Xcode and open it again and it works :)<p>There&#x27;s nothing you can&#x27;t do on 2015 Macbook Air that can be done on a fresh high end Macbook Pro. The difference comes from the comfort of being snappy and people pay multiple times more for that snappiness.')
