Decisions have to be made based on SOMETHING.  Science encodes the condensed wisdom of experience, so if you say don&#x27;t use what we know, what process do you propose to use to decide what is worthy of investigation?<p>Cold Fusion requires not just one &quot;miracle&quot;, but a stack of multiple miracles, all in contravention of existing knowledge.  It requires that fusion can occur when QM calculations show it can&#x27;t.  It requires that excited nuclei not emit gamma radiation.  It requires that energy go not into energetic charged particles (which would produce detectable secondary radiation) but somehow immediately go into the lattice of a solid, spread over large numbers of atoms.<p>Stack on top of that another coincidence: that despite P&amp;F&#x27;s initial results being shown to be bullshit, that somehow there was a pony in there somewhere anyway.<p>The simplest and cleanest explanation for all this LENR work is that it&#x27;s nonsense driven by some combination of almost pathologic wishful thinking, incompetence, and even outright fraud.')
