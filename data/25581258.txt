What you do - stroke or no stroke - becomes paths in the brain. Habits are simply more well established paths. What you do today influeces what you&#x27;ll do tomorrow. And so on.<p>That is, what you &quot;feed&quot; your brain will manifest itself physically as paths in the brain. Full stop.<p>When you develop a habit of consuming violece - and enjoying it - those paths are real. Pretending they don&#x27;t exist doesn&#x27;t make them magically disappear. Confirmation bias works that way, the science does not.<p>Furthermore, human behavior is often learned for the collective. That is, for example, given a group of cigarette smokers, the more who quit smoking, the more likely others in the group are likely to quit.<p>Put another way, going in the other direction, humans naturally gravitate to broader norms. That is, the more I see others with excessive weight, the more likely others will join that club. So yes actually, you are what you eat. Literally.<p>Now please explain - not being snatky - how that&#x27;s nonsensical.')
