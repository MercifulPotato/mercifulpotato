While I definetely recognise Trump as the lesser evil, I know very very well from family experience (eastern europeans caught between hitler and stalin) that chosing the lesser evil is guaranteed to bring you evil, and wholeheartedly supporting it means you become the evil, so it is certainly not a worhtwile compromise.<p>Still I don&#x27;t believe it is fair what the media is saying. When things got hairy - he was doing his absolute best to calm people down, his election fraud arguments are quite solid (just that the statistical probability of Biden getting more votes than Obama, but only in the 5 states that mattered being one to quadrillions..., not to mention the affidavits, leaked videos, etc). Still, it is extremely surprising how his supporters went from doing truck and yacht rallies (regattas(?)) to storming the capitol with violence (!!!!!). And quite frightening actually.<p>Now it is confirmed that some good portion of the stormers were Antifa, probably angry after rooting for the Democrats all summer, just to be ignored once election victory was guaranteed. This is even more scary. WWII ended up well, only thanks to the fact that the bad guys were fighting each other.<p>I am a well-trained gun-owner and I am perfectly aware that the one and only good thing that could be achieved through violence is preventing further violence. I am also aware of the pain and damage modern warfare is able to inflict and all of what happened makes me feel extremely weird and a bit scared for my family...<p>P.S. I apologise for infringing the rules, I am aware this is not the right place for it and would be perfectly happy if my comment against racism and marxism is removed.')
