A physical action like holding down your home button is much less likely to trigger on accident.<p>Not to mention, you can also full-on disable the voice assistant on your smartphone, in which case, there&#x27;s practically zero risk of a false positive.<p>&gt; With a cell phone, it is actually tougher, because you&#x27;re also trusting the manufacturer that their security model is such that 3rd party software can&#x27;t violate the privacy policy you&#x27;re expecting.<p>Stealing my contacts is bad, getting access to my microphone is worse.<p>If the argument is, &quot;my phone might get malware, so having an always-on-microphone is exactly the same&quot;, that just seems really fatalistic to me. These are different risks that belong in different categories.')
