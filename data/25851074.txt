Item(by='yjftsjthsd-h', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611172225, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25849112, text='&gt; Curious, do you consider Fedora to be an alpha?<p>Slightly detached because of their processing&#x2F;release process (Fedora X never quite matched to RHEL Y even if there was some derivation), but yes, Fedora is absolutely the alpha for RHEL. It gets changes, including breaking changes, on a fast track (IIRC, Fedora frequently goes toe-to-toe with <i>Arch</i> for having the most recent packages), has a 13-month lifecycle with a strong expectation that you&#x27;ll `dnf system-upgrade` regularly, and doesn&#x27;t shy away from pushing on tech that they believe to be desirable even if it&#x27;s not (yet) widely used (Wayland, BTRFS, CGroupsV2).<p>&gt; Did you consider RHEL to be a beta for CentOS previously?<p>Now <i>that&#x27;s</i> an interesting point that actually makes me stop and consider:) It is true that previously CentOS could legitimately claim to be even more stable&#x2F;slow-moving than RHEL. I think the distinction that I would make is that RHEL had its own betas that were called betas, and that each point release was frozen&#x2F;stable until the next one came along, while Stream is explicitly unfrozen all the time. So yes, I suppose a person <i>could</i> have described RHEL as CentOS&#x27;s beta, although probably only jokingly because it still had Red Hat supporting it and feature freezes to control changes.')
