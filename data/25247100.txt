But I would note that<p>&gt; I do think hard work is valuable ... because building a hard work habit ... is likely to lead to hard work with high value results later in life.<p>It sounds like you still value hard work because it increases the expectation value of future outcomes, and not <i>entirely</i> “just because” you value hard work.
