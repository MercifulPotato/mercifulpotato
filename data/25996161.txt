You wake up one day and everything is gone?<p>Yes, actually that&#x27;s about what I expect. Not literally in a day, but fully do expect that in another year or two Google will announce that Stadia is going away and that in a few months it&#x27;ll be gone. Games were rentals, not leased&#x2F;sold, so they&#x27;ll stop charging but you&#x27;ll hardly be able to take your games with you. Saves might be Takout-able, so if you go re-buy the games you can keep playing... probably... if you even have hardware to game on...<p>In contrast, I&#x27;ve known people who ran MS software locally for months-to-years after it was obsolete&#x2F;discontinued, and non-Microsoft software even longer (cue the classical story of the business that held on to their DOS software until Windows XP <i>finally</i> made it too painful to use).')
