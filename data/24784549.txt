With that framing, what is the expectation for Facebook and Twitter? To devolve into 4chan?<p>Personally, I like well moderated sites. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here! It&#x27;s bizarre to me that so many other people who chose to spend their time here expect Facebook and Twitter to be laissez faire about moderation.')
