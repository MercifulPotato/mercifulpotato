But beyond that, if company X decides to overrun their specific address with advertising (I would call it SPAM, but the CAN-SPAM law calls it an &quot;existing relationship&quot;) and their &quot;unsubscribe&quot; link does not work, then I simply disable that one email address and the SPAM problem is gone.<p>Also, it becomes abundantly clear which companies sell their email address lists to spammers, and halting the spam again involves simply disabling that one address.')
