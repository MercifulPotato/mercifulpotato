The guarantee exists because Haskell is not expressive enough allow you to break that guarantee.<p>I mean yeah. An obese person is more powerful than an olympic athlete because the obese person is better at weighing more.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t think most people are using the word in the way you define it. They think Haskell is less restrictive than python&#x2F;javascript because really they haven&#x27;t thought about why Haskell is better. Haskell is more restrictive and less expressive and less &quot;powerful&quot; and that is why it is &quot;better.&quot;<p>Case in point your example of highly polymorphic functions as a unique feature.... Completely mistaken given that polymorphism is available on most typed programming languages and that all data structures in untyped languages are polymorphic to each other.')
