You can see applications on the pages for OpenLB and Palabos, which I believe are some of the more mature implementations of Lattice Boltzmann.  Unfortunately it’s a bit hard to find references to industrial users since in my experience most industrial users don’t advertise the methods that they are using.  I usually would find out about them by meeting people from industry at conferences where these tools would be talked about like the SIAM conferences and HPC conferences like SuperComputing.  At one of my old jobs where some folks were implementing parallel LBM tools one of our major industrial partners came from the petroleum industry, and they were interested in flow through complex geometries to model fluids + porous rocks.')
