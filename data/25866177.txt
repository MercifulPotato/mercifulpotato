Item(by='julianmarq', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611272021, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25865950, text='&gt; people who like open source (generally left-wing people doing stuff for betterment of society)<p>Do you really think that liking open source is in any way correlated with politics?[1] I&#x27;d like to read a source on that one, because it&#x27;s certainly not been my experience. Maybe we&#x27;ve contributed to different projects and&#x2F;or read different people.<p>But even that aside, you think that everyone who likes open source is condemning amazon and on elastic&#x27;s side? That is even more suspect. Just as an example, the creator of sourcehut has been criticizing elastic all week, and all of his posts—at least one of them explicitly saying that Amazon is definitely allowed to do what it&#x27;s doing—have reached the front page here. And he&#x27;s someone whose &quot;liking open source&quot; credentials are good enough, I think.<p>[1]: I&#x27;m not even going to get into other implication, that wanting to improve society is also in any way related to any given political leaning.')
