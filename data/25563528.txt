I just ran into this with a mortgage lender. I waited for a follow up email about a loan and the entire thing ended up falling off my radar. Had they simply replied with a “sorry no” I would’ve just moved on to another lender.<p>It’s my own fault really, because I should’ve just contacted multiple lenders, but I had an existing relationship with this place and was giving them the courtesy of first priority.')
