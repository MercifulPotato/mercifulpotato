At the same time, people are surprised I don&#x27;t own a car, and I&#x27;ve been considering getting one.<p>We don&#x27;t need a car here for most things. But it is still extremely convenient to have one.<p>Move out of the bigger cities, and things change even more. Bikes are popular, and often used. But very rarely are bikes and public transport able to replace a car. I&#x27;d guess like 10% of people go without a car because they don&#x27;t need it. At the same time, I think almost everyone here will own a bike for just general purpose.')
