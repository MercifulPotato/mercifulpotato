In my opinion the way it should be is that in the backend you export a typed function like &quot;getTasks(filter: Filter): Tasks<p>And in the frontend component you should be able to use it immediately and it would be correctly typed without having to duplicate types or anything. And if function is not complete yet it will not render the component before.<p>This should be instead of REST and Graphql, both of which have many issues imo.')
