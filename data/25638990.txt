The data within these networks, user IDs, passwords, financial records, source code, you name it, can be presumed now to be in the hands of Russian intelligence agents.&quot;</i><p>Reality from the linked source: <i>&quot;The breach is far broader than first believed. Initial estimates were that Russia sent its probes only into a few dozen of the 18,000 government and private networks they gained access to when they inserted code into network management software made by a Texas company named SolarWinds. But as businesses like Amazon and Microsoft that provide cloud services dig deeper for evidence, it now appears Russia exploited multiple layers of the supply chain to gain access to as many as 250 networks.&quot;</i><p>There&#x27;s a big difference between 250 and 18000.<p>Further it claims that the source code access is significant.  As noted in this thread: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25599210" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25599210</a> all major Governments have had read access to the source code for Microsoft products for years.<p>The hack is extremely serious and for that reason it merits accurate claims, response, and technical actions.  Fearmongering like this article does to push an opinion piece is not it.')
