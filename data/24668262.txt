India has a lot of people, some terrible infrastructure, has high amounts of competition, and the idea of craftsmanship is incredibly rare.<p>Their value for life is much lower. There&#x27;s just too many people. The idea of a pedestrian lights is a tourist thing. They don&#x27;t pay attention to it. Have 8 rows of cars on the road per each side? How do you cross? You just walk across it during traffic. (I&#x27;m not even joking.. I&#x27;ve done it) (Another thing.. traffic is extremely chaotic and dagerous.. lines on the road have no meaning there) Extremely poor and begging with a &lt;5mo. They&#x27;ll let it crawl around where people are walking in connaught place. (Btw go a little further to north and there is a good chance that baby was stolen [That&#x27;s a thing])<p>Competition: Theres little to no social support from the government. Also, the families are hyper aggressive in getting their kids to succeed. This is shown in the marriages and determination of what their kids will do for work.<p>Craftsmanship: they produce quite a lot in that country. They&#x27;re also having to deal with a market that won&#x27;t support luxury goods. (Ok Goa can.. but Goa isn&#x27;t buying domestically for that.. they&#x27;re not buying their employees Tata motors cars, they&#x27;re buying Mercedes SUVs)<p>You could never honestly convince me that they&#x27;re not entrepreneurial. They are very much. There are aspects I love about it and there are parts that make me sick.')
