To achieve maximum performance, the tool itself is written in Go, embedding a JavaScript runtime allowing for easy test scripting.<p>How is it possible that pure go JavaScript interpreter (goja) with bindings for net&#x2F;http and some reports would be faster than the same tool written in nodejs using its http-client (which if I remember correctly is written in C)?<p>I donâ€™t mean to downplay the importance or usefulness of k6, I just find their reasoning behind choosing go somewhat contrived')
