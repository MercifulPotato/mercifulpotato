Lived in Valparaiso while I worked in Chesterton. Revisited same city in 2016, met my now wife who is from Crown Point. We got married and rented from a friend in the Miller Beach community neighbourhood of Gary <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Miller_Beach" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Miller_Beach</a>, a block from some really wonderful beaches, dunes, nature reserves, etc. Never understood &quot;lake life&quot; but after having lived a &quot;lake life&quot; for a while, I really loved it. Walking my little old dog in the morning alone on the beach with a coffee, listening to some nice music, on a nice calm day, really was a some of the nicest, most peaceful times of my life.<p>I knew about Gary&#x27;s history, but I really put it to the back of my head, I always thought it couldn&#x27;t be that bad, could it? Or, I wouldn&#x27;t be affected, would I? I knew the bad schools, crime, etc, I knew my wife and I would have kids, I always thought I&#x27;d deal with it when I&#x27;d need to deal with it, just didn&#x27;t think it would affect me so seriously, so soon.')
