Item(by='throwaway9d0291', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608548198, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25493618, text='I think you&#x27;re reaching about about Switzerland being the problem here.<p>&gt; Threema was launched in 2013<p>&gt; WhatsApp was bought by Facebook in 2014<p>So a year after Threema&#x27;s launch, it was competing with a multi-billion dollar global corporation which already had a user count in the billions.<p>&gt; Signal to launch an iOS app in 2014<p>Signal is free (which a lot of casual users care about) and open-source (which a lot of privacy&#x2F;security-conscious users care about).<p>&gt; Why? I&#x27;m guessing because the founders lacked the experience or the right people to guide them from startup into massive growth [...] sadly Switzerland lacks the people with that kind of experience.<p>Can&#x27;t the same be said of other European tech startups like Spotify and Skype?<p>Plus, ProtonMail, another startup in a similar space, based in Switzerland, has managed to become basically &quot;the&quot; secure email provider.<p>I think the real story here is much simpler: Threema is a small company and came into a competitive space where it had to compete on multiple fronts: tech giants on one, open-source on the other. As a paid _messaging_ app, it had a difficult future ahead of it whatever it did, no matter where it was based.<p>And for Switzerland in general, remember that it&#x27;s a small country that has fewer than 9M people. Don&#x27;t take the absence of unicorns to indicate that they&#x27;re impossible.<p>EDIT: One more thing that occurred to me - what&#x27;s the alternative? I&#x27;d suggest that a good part of the reason why Threema got the success it did in the German-speaking world was that it was from Switzerland. If it came from say the US, I suspect it wouldn&#x27;t be trusted.')
