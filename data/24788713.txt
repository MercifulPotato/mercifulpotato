Every time you contract a plumber, you engage in &#x27;political neutrality&#x27;, because neither your nor the plumber interrogate yourselves on your political affiliations. You want your plumbing fixed for a fair price, and the plumber wants to get paid for a job well done and get back home in time for dinner.<p>Just because you set up a false choice of &quot;you&#x27;re either with me or against me&quot;, doesn&#x27;t mean the rest of us will play your little game.')
