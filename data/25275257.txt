I&#x27;m sure Coremark is a decent benchmark but it is unfair towards the xeon usecase.<p>&quot;EEMBC’s CoreMark® is a benchmark that measures the performance of microcontrollers (MCUs) and central processing units (CPUs) used in embedded systems. Replacing the antiquated Dhrystone benchmark, Coremark contains implementations of the following algorithms: list processing (find and sort), matrix manipulation (common matrix operations), state machine (determine if an input stream contains valid numbers), and CRC (cyclic redundancy check). It is designed to run on devices from 8-bit microcontrollers to 64-bit microprocessors.&quot;<p>Maybe someone has a list of OTHER small embedded microcontrollers to compare with this processor? Still fun to see risk-v in the news again.')
