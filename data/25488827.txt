I find almost all forms of music entertaining and sometimes quite moving: rock, pop, jazz, hip hop, country, classical and even occasionally opera.<p>However, there is one common form of music I can’t tolerate, background music. Such music seems to prevent really deep thinking in me. Music with lyrics interferes with my ability to write and any music slows my ability to do mathematics. I’ve mentioned this to my friends and coworkers, and they always give me this look like they can’t understand what I’m talking about. I suppose I prefer to sit in a quiet room alone.')
