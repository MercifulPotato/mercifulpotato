Lots of people will bid it up because they expect other people to join in, until at some point they stop believing others will join in. I can&#x27;t disprove it, because bubbles do of course happen, but that doesn&#x27;t say much about how long this particular one will continue.<p>I guess what I&#x27;d encourage you to do is write some notes for yourself about exactly what you expect will happen, so that when the justifications for the bubble change again you&#x27;ll be able to notice and hopefully get out in time.')
