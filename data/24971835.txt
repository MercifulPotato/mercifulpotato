If you pay enough money, you can install cages with your own access control in our datacenters.<p>* architecture support and consulting<p>* you can visit our datacenters if you really want<p>* lots of certifications that will make your compliance department happy<p>* if the auditors come to you, and request access protocols to your servers, we can provide those<p>... and so on.<p>Why do I list all that? Because cost is just one aspect to consider, and some business have good reasons to optimize for other aspects.<p>Some value flexibility in their service provider, some value  physical proximity, some value constant contact persons over multiple years.')
