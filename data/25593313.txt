That obviously disturbers the birds since it was a nesting area. I think we should not trust self policing or regulation here and manufacturers should geo fence off such nature reserve areas as no fly zones. And I will be straight either they geo fence or they do not get to sell their products on the market and I think that there should be a hefty fine if you ignore the rules.<p>Our public spaces and the environment and nature is a shared space, and you cannot do whatever you feel like in a space we share if its disturbing, neither should and can I.')
