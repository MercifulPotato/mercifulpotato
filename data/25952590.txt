Item(by='kypro', descendants=None, kids=[25952655], score=None, time=1611885119, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25952208, text='This is what upsets me the most about what&#x27;s been happening in recent days. There is now a popular narrative that the market is rigged against the little guy, but as a little guy who&#x27;s been investing for about a decade now I know this couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth.<p>The only reason this situation with GME happened is because no one person has power to control what investor decide to buy and sell (with this perhaps being one of the few exceptions I&#x27;ve ever come across). I don&#x27;t really understand where this claim that retail investors can&#x27;t take the opposite side of a hedgefund&#x27;s trade is coming from. Hedgefunds that are over-levered go bankrupt all the time because retail investors along with professionals take the other side of the trade. It&#x27;s worth remember a lot of hedge funds lost money shorting TSLA this last year too and that trade was largely retail driven.<p>I also think a lot of people are being really spiteful. I understand why hedgefunds get a bad rep, especially after all that happened during the GFC, but most hedgefunds are doing honest business. I don&#x27;t really understand why Melvin Capital deserves to be put out of business and for their employees to lose their jobs because of what some other hedgefunds have done in the past.')
