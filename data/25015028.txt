I never used those &#x27;ready-made&#x27; tools though. All the resolvers were written by hand and the SQL queries as well (in the ORM specific language).<p>GQL works well when you have unstructured data that &#x27;links&#x27; to other or in places where you need to query data in various different ways, with different joins that REST doesn&#x27;t help (or you end up creating a querying language on top of your REST endpoints anyway (&#x2F;clients&#x2F;?age&gt;2&amp;link=business,jobs&amp;business.broke=false&amp;etc etc etc)<p>Then you need to do this for pretty much every REST endpoint that may need this functionality. With GraphQL the server knows how to fetch the individual entities along with the filters, and create a nice graph of it for you (and you can optimize the resolvers if you dont want to have a lot of DB calls).<p>Saying people are using GraphQL as the new ORM is the same as I saying people are using Ruby on Rails (and their scaffolding) as the new low-code solution.')
