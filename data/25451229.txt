The RHEL 8 sources are in git.centos.org, though not in SRPM form.<p>I know that GPL only requires Red Hat to provide sources on request to those receiving their binaries. But in principle the receiver can then legally redistribute those sources. Now AFAICT nobody&#x27;s actually doing that redistributing. I don&#x27;t know whether that&#x27;s due to lack of interest, or due to some Red Had shenanigans that makes redistribution illegal&#x2F;unattractive.')
