In this system, gmo can help reduce the nefarious intrants (fertilizers, pesticides ...). This sounds like optimization.<p>Alternative cultural models, multicrops for instance, are saner but implies many technical and economical issues that still have to be dealt with. This is more like an architectural change.')
