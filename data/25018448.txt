Considering High Frequency Trading', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hey all,<p>I currently work at Facebook and got an offer from Citadel last week that is expiring Monday.<p>The offer is:\n220k salary, 300k bonus, 50k sign on in NYC<p>My current TC is 275k in California. I have a great WLB and a lot of friends here -- is it worth considering doubling my TC and moving to NYC? I think the work at Citadel and having a higher caliber of coworker would be super interesting as well. I&#x27;m concerned from going from a nice WLB where I can enjoy my life to what I assume is 50+ hours a week. Has anyone worked in both FAANG and HFT?<p>YOE is 8')
