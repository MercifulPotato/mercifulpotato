But a code pipeline that can be used to quickly develop, test and deploy is essential. There is absolutely nothing wrong with using containers. In fact, in 20 years in tech, it&#x27;s the best packaging solution I&#x27;ve seen. As for Kubernetes, as long as you&#x27;re not managing the backend, it&#x27;s fine. I joined a tiny startup less than a year ago, set up EKS with Terraform and created CI automation to build and push containers when tests pass. It&#x27;s not hard. And it does encourage good practices. If we had to move everything to Azure or GCE, it would be much easier to do so because we haven&#x27;t painted ourselves into the AWS corner.')
