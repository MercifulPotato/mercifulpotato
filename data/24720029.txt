Our neighbors have recently recovered from Coronavirus<p>2. Our son had a cold &#x2F; fever around the same time lasting several days<p>3. He had several days of diarrhea after the cold symptoms subsided<p>I talked to my coworker whose wife is a doctor and he relayed the symptoms to her and she said it very well could be a mild coronavirus infection.<p>We weren&#x27;t concerned for his health because he&#x27;s handled it just fine, but we figured it would be good to know in terms of avoiding spreading it to other people.<p>So we called and set up an appointment. They got us in like an hour and half after we called.<p>Got there and the doctor said, &quot;Nope, no need for a test.&quot;<p>At this point I&#x27;m extremely skeptical that the number counts are in any way accurate. Also I&#x27;ve lost faith in the &quot;we&#x27;re not doing enough testing&quot; argument since we went and tried to get tested and they turned us away.')
