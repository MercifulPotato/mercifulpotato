Traditionally, it&#x27;s about night-time lighting on Earth that isn&#x27;t shielded from transmitting light upwards.<p>It startled me to find (in a long ago HN thread) that people, presumably nerdy types, are not generally sympathetic to the complaints. I somehow assumed that universal lukewarm quasi-environmental feelings would mean people would go &quot;yeah, lighting the night sky is inefficient and dumb, and astronomy makes pretty pictures&quot; but apparently &quot;fuck astronomers&quot; is a popular opinion.')
