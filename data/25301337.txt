What the study <i>actually</i> says is that they found wildly huge odds ratios in their confidence interval. The only “conclusion” that can be drawn from this is that the study is inconclusive.<p>To explain further: to positively conclude that there’s no benefit to mask wearing, the study would have had to produce a small confidence interval around zero effect. In reality, its 95% confidence interval is between 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection. Any number between these bounds is compatible with the study results. That’s all over the place, and doesn’t allow <i>any</i> conclusion.')
