Hokkaido, however, generally has good insulation and central heating.<p>Unsurprisingly, while nowhere near as bad as Winnipeg winter in Hokkaido is much longer and deeper than in most of Honshu. Although it likely helps that Hokkaido is much drier, especially in summer, meaning house rot is less of an issue.')
