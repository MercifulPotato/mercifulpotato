When the company I worked for closed up and laid everyone off (the day after Labor Day!) in 2019, I didn&#x27;t know what to do. I knew I didn&#x27;t want to work for another person&#x27;s startup. I hated being ordered around, and I wanted the freedom to act on the ideas I have. I managed to save about $110k, and my goal was just a downpayment for a house. It took me <i>years</i> to do this. (I never bought a house - the real estate market kept shooting up, and I kept refusing to swing at it. I knew that property taxes and HOAs meant that I&#x27;d remain in chains forever, working for <i>someone</i>, had I bought in.)<p>So I spent a lot of time working on my own open-source software. I ended up building a layout system, prototyped in JavaScript, meant to replace HTML and CSS. It&#x27;s kinda like SwiftUI and Flutter, but I never picked up any contributors, so I stopped working on it when the pandemic really started.<p>But that&#x27;s not all I did. I also spent a lot of time reading about the financial markets, about investing, and I had always had an interest in how great companies are run. So I put my savings into $TSLA, $SQ, $ARKK, $ARKG and now I have $500k. (I had some money in &quot;value investing&quot; stocks early on, but sold out of those very quickly when I realized how poor the gains would be, pumped it all into in 10X innovation stocks.)<p>I live cheaply - I eat hamburger and hot dogs, and I live in a total dump of an apartment. Why? Because I know that I&#x27;ll be a millionaire in a year.<p>What are the things making me rich? Excellent companies managed by the best allocators of capital out there. What are they doing to drive humanity forward? One is transitioning humanity to carbon-free energy, which is part of many changes required to help us avoid climate disaster. The other is using analytics to bring loans to people that banks refuse to serve and drastically undercutting payday lenders.<p>I wrote up some of my story in these posts way back in May:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22958528" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22958528</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22964850" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22964850</a><p>Seven years ago, I had just moved to California. I had no savings, and a job that only paid $35k&#x2F;year.<p>Anyway, my point is that you don&#x27;t have to be poor forever. It takes a great deal effort, planning and diligence, but you can rise up.')
