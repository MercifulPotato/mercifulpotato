Apple sells refurbished devices. There’s a reason Apple isn’t reselling the devices it sent to GEEP. You have no idea why these devices were tagged for recycling, no idea what condition they were in, no idea who they’re being sold to, no idea how long they’d last, and no idea what would happen to them afterward. Your first “scenario” completely ignored what happens after a resold device’s life ends.<p>In a third scenario, the devices are sold overseas to people who recycle less often than Americans. In a fourth scenario, they’re sold to business that are tearing the devices apart, pulling out a couple of tiny components and scrapping everything else.<p>&gt; Why is the 2nd owner more likely to landfill it than the 1st?<p>This question is irrelevant because 100% of the devices that ended up at GEEP were supposed to be recycled, contractually. If there’s any non-zero chance at all that the second owner won’t recycle, then it’s guaranteed that more devices will end up in landfill due to GEEP breaking it’s contract and illegally reselling used devices.<p>I see you didn’t bother to address my question why you think Apple has a bad record on the environment, compared to other companies that make similar products. I realize their environmental responsibility report is part marketing, yet they have in fact been putting some of their money where their mouth is. Some manufacturers don’t produce any such reports, and haven’t bothered to even try to make their products recyclable. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;environment&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;Apple_Environmental_Progress_Report_2020.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;environment&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;Apple_Environmental_Pr...</a>')
