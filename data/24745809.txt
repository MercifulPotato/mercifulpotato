We did no marketing&#x2F;sales except having that &quot;Powered By&quot; button shown for forms created by all non-paying users.<p>Since the &quot;Powered By&quot; button of each form was affected by the number of people visiting each form and some creating their own, leading to more views of the &quot;Powered By&quot; button, we called it &quot;Viral Marketing&quot; (maybe &quot;Marketing&quot; is the wrong word, don&#x27;t remember exactly what we used to call it) where the growth of the platform funded more growth of the platform, inherently.<p>So +1 for the &quot;Powered By&quot; button, leads to tons of people discovering your product based on already using it for something. Users who want to white-label the usage of your product will also be ready to pay more to get rid of it, so not only a acquisition channel, also a way of affecting how you set pricing.')
