Large corporations control access to decent healthcare, for one thing. Also, you can be fired at any time, for any reason in the majority of positions. There is little to no social safety net to protect a person when they get fired.<p>Given this kind of an asymmetrical environment, anonymity helps restore the balance. The candidate doesn&#x27;t have to risk their entire livelihood every time they make a statement about how they were badly treated by a company.<p>And on a deeper level, what is &quot;professional&quot; anyway? 20 years ago we were told that you should wear only suits and ties to the office because &quot;that is professional&quot;. Today you would be laughed out of several tech companies for saying that. Similarly, being kinder to people and stricter to corporations is a direction that professionals in the US software industry seem to be taking, and I think we are better for it. Maybe in 20 more years it will be seen as basic &quot;professional&quot; courtesy to your fellow software developers to leave a rating on a hypothetical RateRecuiters when you finish any interview process!<p>--------------------------------------------<p>[1] I think your statement about not seeking anonymity would apply far more in European countries or other places where there are strong laws protecting labor, and a robust safety nets.')
