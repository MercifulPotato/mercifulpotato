Sure, the customers who purchase a locked-down device might not be able to update their device.  But the technology will still be out there, so that it can be built upon to improve the next generation of hardware --- perhaps hardware created by a competitor, or using open hardware.    This is especially true for consumer-grade devices, which generally become obsolete and replaced within 2-3 years anyway.<p>And if this is something that a sufficiently large segment of the users actually care about, then they will vote with their feet, and purchase hardware where they <i>can</i> update their own code.    Maybe this will even result in a software ecosystem where the company selling an open product will be able to take those improvements from the dedicated power users to improve future releases of their product.   But this is something which is best enforced by market forces --- if it&#x27;s really an important right that users find important, they will demand it.<p>This is essentially the debate when the FSF tried to convince the Linux kernel community to relicense to the Linux kernel to the GPLv3.   We declined, essentially because we saw the downsides of the anti-Tivo-ization clauses had towards people choosing to use Linux versus some other OS.   And we believed that growing the contributor base was in the long term, far more important than the more short-term anti-Tivoization concerns of the FSF.   This is why the Linux kernel is GPLv2 and not GPLv3.   We didn&#x27;t give in to the siren call of the FSF position.')
