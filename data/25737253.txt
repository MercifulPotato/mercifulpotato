I&#x27;m saying that things have gone so far that people express extreme suggestions like that one, and along with that extremism they are less receptive to <i>any</i> discussion or research challenging their narratives. For example, I&#x27;ve seen concerned parents and organizations push back on policies that let children secretly consent to puberty blockers without notice to parents. I&#x27;ve literally seen posts discussing this get deleted from Facebook or Instagram, due to activists mass reporting them. The practice of banning &quot;wrongspeak&quot; that doesn&#x27;t align with favored groups&#x2F;causes is very real and it is a big problem.')
