The dual-issue cores in the HiFive Unmatched should be around 50% faster.<p>amd64 machines do have the advantage that you can get them with 32 or 64 cores and hundreds of GB of RAM -- at a price, especially in power consumption.<p>The three year old HiFive Unleashed uses around 5W to 6W at the wall when building flat out, considerably less than the maybe 25W a quad core i7 or Ryzen will use, with lower performance running qemu-system.<p>The new HiFive Unmatched probably has the same or lower power consumption, at 50% higher performance.<p>Running qemu on a Pi 4 would use about the same power as the RISC-V chip but be waaaaaaay slower.')
