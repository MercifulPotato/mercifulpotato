Grab your morning coffee and just face the sun and breath and just relax for a bit. No phones allowed.<p>- I&#x27;ve halted all work on side projects during this pandemic. It&#x27;s more important for me to enjoy my free-time now since the separation between home and office is not as clear with most people working from home.<p>- Daily conversation(s) with some friends&#x2F;family. Not always realistic but contact with loved ones, even just BSing has always been helpful to me.<p>- Limit social media as much as possible. No offense to the people who enjoy these platforms, but I think Facebook, Twitter, Reddit are not good for humanity. Humans best interact face-to-face, even if it&#x27;s over a video call.<p>- Limit news intake. I only look at the highlights periodically, any more than that and we&#x27;re feeding that up-to-the-second news cycle that keeps us engaged and anxious.<p>- Read a book, any book. Phone is turned off and put away. This helps even if you&#x27;re only able to do it for 30 minutes.<p>- Explore non-digital side projects. Have you moved home and now live with family? Is there potential to start a small garden? Something else? There&#x27;s so much we can do that doesn&#x27;t involve a computer or phone.')
