(obviously not actually, but i think you get the point.  it would probably be more like &quot;the cat ran and the cat ran and the cat ran...&quot;)<p>could try to combat this by working to identify and only train on &#x27;human content&#x27;, and that may or may not be effective, insofar as model develpers will generally aim to have their bot content be indistinguishable from human content.  a bit like GANs.  at that point though, it becomes a little harder for me to reason on&#x2F;make predictions about')
