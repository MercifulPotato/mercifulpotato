You would have to buy 2,000 copies yourself and try to sell that out of a car.<p>When amazon opened that up it allowed anyone to publish and now we have other smaller sites like smashworlds that offer similiar.<p>Things are now so much more open as a publisher.<p>On the selling side you had smaller book stores being pushed out by Chapters. Chapters bought up many book chains and pushed out many smaller shops with better prices.<p>When Amazon came in they were fighting against the big box stores and they won.<p>Things appear centralized with Amazon but you can sell your ebook from anywhere (from your site&#x2F;app&#x2F;newsletter) you couldn&#x27;t do that before.  Everyone wants easy Amazon sales.')
