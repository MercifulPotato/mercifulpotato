It’s not about what is or isn’t technically possible. (Btw it’s technically possible to innovate, have clean code, and maintain backwards compatibility without an unreasonable amount of effort.)<p>The GTk developers aren’t ordinary people. They comprise an organization of trusted individuals and leaders. Not to mention, Many of them are employees are large companies like Red Hat and Canonical. They have resources. The likelihood of a random strangers contributions being upstreamed are low, let alone them setting project direction around backwards compatibility.<p>Hundreds if not thousands of apps have been left behind in GTK2 and GTK1 before that. Those are all apps that could be part of the current GNOME ecosystem, now they will look like bad foreign apps. Tens of thousands of man hours completely wasted.<p>This will kill the GNOME desktop. It’s a dead end for anyone but GNOME developers. Everyone sees it. GTK4 is just the latest demonstration of their incompetence and disregard for other developers.')
