Why tweet threads instead of blogging, as many HN users ask? Tweets get traction and build an audience (yes, owning your platform is better than a corporation owning your platform, but you have to go where the eyeballs are) with which I can drive traffic, users and customers to other sites I want them to see.<p>Twitter is also an amazing community, I&#x27;ve had many good interactions there that are simply not possible in other social media platforms.
