Item(by='patrec', descendants=None, kids=[25533110], score=None, time=1608801912, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25524714, text='&gt; The head commit on master is the same, but the state of previous commits from your branch becomes different and untested, and quite possibly broken.<p>Try to break it down, and you will see that the scenario you&#x27;re positing doesn&#x27;t make much sense and your concerns are unfounded:<p>Let&#x27;s posit the following:<p>1. We have a feature branch B, with carefully crafted and individually tested commits.<p>2. We have a minimally working CI setup (which means we always test the code state of the new head of master before landing stuff in master &quot;for real&quot;).<p>On that assumption one of two things can happen when you try to land B whether via rebase or merge:<p>a) CI fails, because changes in master in the meantime make it so your branch now triggers a test failure or merge conflict whereas before it didn&#x27;t. We can ignore this, scenario, because nothing lands till<p>b) CI passes. So we know the HEAD commit on master is fine. But, you say, whilst I know the individual commits on B are also good (I tested them all) and the merge commit is good (CI!), with rebase I only know the head commit works -- what if the rebasing broke some <i>intermediate</i> commits?<p>But for that to happen, all the following need to be true:<p>1. You don&#x27;t didn&#x27;t use rebase -x (why not, if you carefully test all individual commits on the feature branch?)<p>2. Your individual commits all work correctly on the feature branch and would pass CI.<p>3. The sum of your individual commits plus master works correctly and definitely does pass CI.<p>4. Because of changes in master branch since the common ancestor of present master and B, a) at least one of the commits of B no longer would pass CI when tested, although it does on the branch (not an unlikely scenario so far) <i>AND</i> b) a latter commit on the feature branch miraculously fixes this incompatibility (because we know the HEAD passes). This is not theoretically impossible, but exceedingly unlikely.  And, you can easily guard against it happening as described above.')
