The surgery itself, the hospital stay, etc. was about 18,000€ in total.<p>We had to pay about 1,000€... for a hotel and living expenses for my mother and myself since we wanted to stay with him. Insurance covered everything my dad needed.<p>So you can literally have brain surgery for what it costs to get some stitches in the US.')
