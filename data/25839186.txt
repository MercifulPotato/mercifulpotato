That&#x27;s no longer the case. Intel&#x27;s new problem is much bigger than that at this point.<p>Until fairly recently, Intel had a clear competitive advantage: Their near monopoly on server and desktop CPUs. Recent events have illustrated that the industry is ready to move away from Intel entirely. Apple&#x27;s M1 is certainly the most conspicuous example, but Microsoft is pushing that way (a bit slower), Amazon is already pushing their own server architecture and this is only going to accelerate.<p>Even if Intel can get their 7nm processes on line this year, Apple is gone, Amazon is gone, and more will follow. If Qualcomm is able to bring their new CPUs online from their recent acquisition, that&#x27;s going to add another high performance desktop&#x2F; server ready CPU to the market.<p>Intel has done well so far because they can charge a pretty big premium as the premier x86 vendor. The days when x86 commands a price premium are quickly coming to and end. Even if Intel fixes their process, their ability to charge a premium for chips is fading fast.')
