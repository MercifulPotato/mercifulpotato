The tradeoff is fewer rules and less expressivity. As someone who couldn&#x27;t live without an adblocker, I appreciate it and look forward to it because it removes a massive security risk (image the carnage if one of the major adblocker extensions get compromised).<p>Your citations do not support the claim that &quot;<i>It&#x27;s only a matter of months before Adblockers won&#x27;t work anymore.</i>&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of reasons to not like Chrome, but this is not a justification for spreading FUD.<p>In fact, the very blog post you cite states that &quot;<i>There is not an exact date for removing support for Manifest V2 extensions</i>&quot; and has a quote from the Adblock Plus team, praising the collaboration with Chromium.')
