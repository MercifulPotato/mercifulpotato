Item(by='Cthulhu_', descendants=None, kids=[25671918], score=None, time=1610031331, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25669903, text='Good, this means I can finally exit at a modest profit.<p>I jumped on the bandwagon in 2017, and made the mistake of doubling down in 2018. I put some in Ethereum which is a pretty solid coin in terms of value, but made the mistake of buying Ripple (XRP) and some other random shitcoins because of trying to spread my investments on the one hand, and assuming everything would follow the bitcoin anyway. Which is partially true I guess.<p>Anyway, my eth is up so if I sell that now I&#x27;ll break even. I bought XRP at like $2 and then some, that one&#x27;s only worth $0,18 at the time, lol.<p>We&#x27;re not talking massive amounts thankfully, there was a limit on how much I could spend at once via credit card.')
