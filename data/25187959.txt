I haven&#x27;t seen this way of selling content before. It&#x27;s funny because it&#x27;s kind of backwards of everything else I&#x27;ve seen (as in, pay a premium to be among the first to see it). I can kind of see it work by triggering the sense of urgency and make people click it before having a second thought.')
