Everyone in orientation was telling me &quot;You&#x27;ll be spending most of your working life dealing with &lt;new project codename&gt;&quot; but they were actually training me on the existing system. About a month out of orientation there is a company wide. They canceled &lt;new project codename&gt; because it wasn&#x27;t meeting it&#x27;s technical specs.<p>It was also, coincidentally, the company where I most respected the key technical decision-makers, because they had the will to discontinue a product that a few customers already were using, because it wasn&#x27;t meeting its criteria.')
