But once I could price compare them via google maps they became un-investable to me because they can only compete in 2 areas, people and policy.<p>Once you lose control of the sales channel your business is commoditized and pricing pressure will remove all margin. Competing on price is a losers game if you want margin and growth. You can make a niche by having a better experience or better refund policies but the value competitor will drive the price down and steal marketshare.<p>Airlines and hotels are perfect examples, now ridesharing is little different.<p>If Airbnb can continue to control the experience then I think it is a great company to invest in. But if you can buy an airbnb on expedia and see the prices of nearby short term rentals from other competitors like vrbo then they are toast.<p>Aggregators are easy-mode tech, you are transferring wealth by taxing margin of other companies that have operational efficiencies or deficiencies.')
