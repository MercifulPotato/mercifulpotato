I didn&#x27;t say that Jack the EE couldn&#x27;t be a perfectly serviceable developer. I&#x27;ve worked with a number who are (and a few who excelled). My point is that the management teams (with no one with software experience) perceive one <i>specific</i> person&#x27;s relative ease at picking up programming as the <i>general</i> case for programming. This causes them to underestimate what it takes to actually build up the software portion of their business. This happens <i>especially</i> for non-software companies in the same way that software companies might underestimate the difficulty of other fields (how many startups have we seen posted here on HN that are composed of primarily programmers and think they&#x27;ll revolutionize the fashion industry, the car audio industry, or the banking industry?).<p>And since management teams in large companies tend to grow out of whichever departments are the primary domains, if software is always seen as tertiary then managers with software background are consistently absent or too few to clear up this confusion.')
