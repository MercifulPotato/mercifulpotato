That we have natural incentives to encourage extremism certainly contributes, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the primary driver.<p>Countries like the US with a presidential system could have less politicized administrations (but that may just shift the primary fight to the elections for the legislative). In countries with parliamentary systems, the executive is accountable to the legislative, so division of power between these two is mostly on paper, as the executive is typically controlled by the majority of the legislative.<p>I do believe that &quot;make politics boring again&quot; would mean &quot;make politics have less influence on the average citizen&#x27;s life&quot;, and I think that&#x27;s a great idea. But I&#x27;m aware that this also just so happens to align with my political views, so others might see that very much differently.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just a natural evolution when societies rapidly become more diverse. Identity&#x2F;group&#x2F;tribal politics play a much larger role, the stakes are raised, and more tribalism is the response.')
