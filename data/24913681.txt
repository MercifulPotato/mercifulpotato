Item(by='bigiain', descendants=None, kids=[24914505], score=None, time=1603845374, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24913186, text='I totally get that some people won&#x27;t agree with me here...<p>To me, the rules are &quot;advisory&quot; and attempt to accomplish the actual social contract goal of &quot;keeping other road users safe&quot;. The intended goal is safety - the rules codify more or less effective practices to achieve that goal. The rules are inevitably fairly blunt instruments setting limitations based on generalisations or lowest common denominator assumptions. A semi trailer doing 50 has a much greater risk of endangering other road users than a motorcycle doing 100. The bike has shorter stopping distances, better manoeuvrability, can evade other vehicles through much smaller gaps - and most importantly a motorcycle rider has a significantly higher motivation to &quot;not get it wrong&quot; due to the enormously higher risk of self injury in any accident. Car&#x2F;truck driver mostly need to deal with insurance companies. I need to deal with being turned into road jam.<p>Assuming I was being &quot;reckless&quot; or &quot;putting other lives in danger&quot; because I was doing 100 in fairly light 2am Bay Bridge traffic (which was all doing 80 or so anyway) screams of mindlessly adhering to rules without any concern for the goals of the rules and the desired outcomes.<p>I&#x27;m most likely overestimating my own skill and safety, because everybody does - even people who understand that everybody does, but I&#x27;ve got about a million km of motorcycle riding over 30 years during which I&#x27;ve injured _zero_ other people to back up my side of this argument.<p>I also totally accept the fact that my disregard to being a stickler to the rules means one day I may &quot;get the book thrown at me&quot;. I&#x27;d also point out that the cop in the incident recounted above should (and would) have done so if he considered me to be &quot;riding recklessly and putting other lives in danger&quot;, and he chose not to. Apart from the Treasure Island entrances&#x2F;exits, the Bay Bridge has no intersections or driveways where unexpected vehicles might enter, has great sightlines to see slow or stationary traffic from long long distances, and often has traffic flowing at 70 or 80. There are definitely times&#x2F;places on that bridge where doing 100 is clearly not &quot;reckless&quot; - although I totally understand some people&#x27;s subjective opinion of reckless is no doubt different to mine, and the minisucle increase in risk to there road users of a motorcycle moving through light traffic at 20mph faster than everyone else on that stretch of road could for some people cross over into recklessness.<p>(I also admit I have a somewhat risk-happy personality, and view a lot of things differently to my more risk averse friends. I would be astounded to discover my personality trait there was not shared by a majority of HN readers. You don&#x27;t dream of starting or working for &quot;swing for the fences&quot; disruptive startups if you&#x27;re a rules stickler. Maybe my &quot;enjoy riding fast on the road while accounting for others safety&quot; has crossed over into the Uber-style-evil rules flaunting. I don&#x27;t think so, but I bet Kalanick doesn&#x27;t think that either, and he&#x27;s wrong - so maybe I am too...)')
