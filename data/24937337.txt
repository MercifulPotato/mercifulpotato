Corruption is not a problem &quot;legislation&quot; can solve. Instead, we should all take responsibility and act together to make society a better place. Grab the bull by the horns. The buck stops here, with us. We should all stand strong as individuals, together. Sign our own executive orders. Hold our own hearings and make decisions for ourselves. Don&#x27;t let the Zuckerbergs and the Dorseys trample over your privacy and your sanity. Take charge of your life. Whip it good!')
