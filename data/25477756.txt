Other relevant files are &quot;Install&quot;, &quot;Contributing&quot;, etc. Your README should be concise and refer to another text (or markdown) files in the repository.<p>Of course people adapt and evolve but, I don&#x27;t understand the attitude of &quot;We&#x27;ve just invented this&quot;. No, we didn&#x27;t. README.1st, CONTRIBUTING files are as old as computing now.')
