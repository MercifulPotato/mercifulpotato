There is not currently any money for it. They hope to bring a separated path in the future.<p>If the author wants to write the people of San Francisco a check, go ahead.<p>Let&#x27;s also remember that many of the large employers that existed on Market Street have either left, or gone remote for at least the next year. There is zero urgency for what is, for at least the next year, a mostly quiet, low traffic corridor. The city government is wisely allocating limited resources to more pressing matters. AKA, this global pandemic thing you might have heard about.<p>EDIT: For the jerk that cowardly downvoted me.<p><i>&gt; Given the economic challenges and changing demands we now face in San Francisco due to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, our departments came together and made the tough decision to adjust the design for Better Market Street in order to move the project forward. As a City, we remain committed to working with our community partners and delivering the Better Market Street project to make this vital corridor safer, more resilient and more inviting for all. -Acting Public Works Director Alaric Degrafinried</i><p><i>&gt; The full project from Octavia Boulevard to Steuart Street was estimated to cost over $600 million when the project was approved. However, the City has only secured approximately $200 million to plan, design and construct the project. The funding gap was going to be a challenge even before the current financial crisis decimated our department budgets. In order to move forward and construct the project, the design scope had to be reduced to fit within the budget.</i><p><i>&gt; The redesign does not preclude the option to build sidewalk-level bikeways later. We plan to revisit this segment between 5th and 8th streets in the future when conditions improve.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;storymaps.arcgis.com&#x2F;stories&#x2F;549e254bccb6413b953d1173eb1a63e7" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;storymaps.arcgis.com&#x2F;stories&#x2F;549e254bccb6413b953d117...</a><p>Please respond to these points as opposed to cowardly hiding my comment without any public response.')
