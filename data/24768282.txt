She&#x27;d immediately buy the new generation when it came out.<p>You know what I really want to see, more than any of this gitter and glam and a few features here and there? A real, actual campaign to reduce e-Waste. I way out of this bullshit, constant consumerism mess. How many more wars have to be fought, and people repressed, to continue the machine that gives us more machines?<p>Apple has so much money at this point. What are they even going to do with more? How about you do something that&#x27;s actually innovative Apple: Officially open all the hardware specs, bootloader keys and what you can legally release of device drivers for iPhone 1-7. Maybe even contribute some code to get a DarwinBSD booting by itself on those devices; letting developers add on new layers.<p>How about something that will actually end the cycle of factory sludge, toxic waste and human toil that goes into each new generation of shiny new product.<p>I&#x27;m sick of these releases. Give me something fucking upgradable, fixable and usable. Give me something that&#x27;s thicker and bulkier, but that I can take apart myself and fix.<p>I&#x27;m in the minority though. The rest of the planet is okay with this. Their advertising has made people even more okay with this, so they&#x27;ll just keep selling us this crap, until we&#x27;ve extracted every last resource the Earth can give.')
