You can quite easily turn resources obtained from a PoW system into a PoS financial system and have the worst of both worlds.<p>Do you want an example?<p>&gt;  If you mine and do not sell, you perpetually consume and fail in short order.<p>With ETH you can mine ETH, lock in a MakerDAO vault and pay your operations with very low-interest DAI and use that to finance all your operational costs.<p>As long as your profit from mining is higher than the interest from minting DAI (which is very easy to do), you can mine forever without ever giving up the original ETH. Your only limitation would be in how many people would be willing to buy all the DAI you will be minting.<p>This is no different than a PoS system, except that it still has to bear all the PoW costs and externalities.')
