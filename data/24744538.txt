But when they found out what I wanted it for, they sold me teflon pipe thread tape instead. The tape fills up the gap between the head and the pipe just fine, it&#x27;s waterproof, and it&#x27;s very slippery, so it&#x27;s easy to put the shower head on and take it off again. Also you can remove it easily, even years later. I had never heard of teflon pipe thread tape, but it was just what I needed, and much better than the caulk would have been.\nI get two reactions from people I tell this story to. Some people say ``Teflon pipe thread tape! Wow, I never heard of that before; I&#x27;ll have to remember it.&#x27;&#x27; And some people interrupt me right at the beginning and say ``You should use teflon tape for that, you know.&#x27;&#x27;<p>This talk is about teflon pipe thread tape. It&#x27;s also about hose clamps, self-chalking plumb lines, mending plates, WD-40 in a spray can, and a whole bunch of other stuff. None of this stuff is specially magical; that&#x27;s the point. Each of these tools will make half the people in the audience say ``Well, of course! Everyone knows about that.&#x27;&#x27; But the other half will say ``Wow! I never heard of that before, but now I don&#x27;t know how I ever got along without it.&#x27;&#x27;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;perl.plover.com&#x2F;TPC&#x2F;1998&#x2F;Hardware-notes.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;perl.plover.com&#x2F;TPC&#x2F;1998&#x2F;Hardware-notes.html</a>')
