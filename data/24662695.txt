The problem is that US gov is expanding their laws as crossbordering. E.g. if I don&#x27;t work with american people at all and do service with less regulations requirements I can be still charged and extradited to US prison because &quot;SOME Americans could lie both to me AND American gov and use fake data and VPNs&quot;. That&#x27;s a nonsense for today global world and slowing down lots of developing countries. Current world should revise extradition laws and US intervention in non-US citizens businesses.')
