Item(by='arrosenberg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605334855, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25089639, text='No doubt, Uber has responded to regulatory pressure by making minor concessions in a (now successful) attempt to circumvent State law.<p>&gt; Related, if a software contracting firm says: &#x27;hey, there&#x27;s a gig that pays $x an hour, no negotiations - do you want it?&#x27;<p>That&#x27;s not what is happening here. The driver and the rider are not forming a carriage contract. Uber is forming a contract with the rider, and employing drivers to fulfill those contracts. Even with the concessions Uber has offered, they are still using their platform power to control activity via incentives, and whatever games they play with the algorithm once the heat is off. At the end of the day, as long as the labor pool remains unorganized, Uber still retains pricing power.<p>None of these drivers own the customer relationship (again, they are not forming a contract with the riders). That means that (without violating the TOS) these drivers are not holding any equity in the business. In your proposed scenario, if you accept the software contract and do good work, there is a likelihood of more work at higher rates, and increased business through word of mouth. With no opportunity to build wealth, I can&#x27;t imagine how rideshare drivers would be considered independent.<p>It&#x27;s fine to look at the problem from a customer-centric viewpoint, and I realize that doing so has been a fairly orthodox economic strategy for the past 50 years, but that doesn&#x27;t make it correct or good. None of the ride share companies seem to be able to turn a profit, even with a questionable model built on exploiting labor laws, yet they had $200M to pass Prop22. That kind of strategy only makes sense if your goal is to gain a monopoly position, and it is right to oppose these companies in doing so. Devaluing labor maybe optimal for some individuals, but it&#x27;s bad for labor as a whole, which is exactly why we pass law that raise the floor.')
