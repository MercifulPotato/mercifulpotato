The results are, for me, very surprising how good was the experience:<p>- Started Steam. Set Proton version to 5.13-1.<p>- Install Path of Exile. Install went really fast compared to my Windows 10. Im using both on SSD, Windows NTFS and Linux Btrfs.<p>- Started Path of exile. Put settings on high&#x2F;ultra and set graphics backend to Vulkan. I have a RTX 2080S with a 6700K im sure PoE can run on high&#x2F;ultra.<p>- Restarted. Played for like 1h between 150-200 fps without any glitch or anything i could say its worse than Windows.<p>- During this time i had Discord on background, Firefox, Terminals and was able to switch workspaces without any issue with i3.<p>I&#x27;m really surprised how smooth the experience was. I have really to give kudos to the Team working on Proton and Steam for this nice &quot;Desktop&quot; experience.\nPlus it seems from my Steam library, apart from some MP games that have anti-cheat, it seems most of the games are playable and classified as gold or platinum.\nI really recommend to anyone not playing competitive MP games to give Linux a try with Steam. Well done!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.protondb.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.protondb.com&#x2F;</a>')
