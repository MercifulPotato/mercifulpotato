We also had tons of issues with the toolchain for which the “solution” was “mvn clean install”. So I made a small program which printed snippets of pre-recorded Maven build output in an infinite loop, and launched it on my second screen whenever I wanted some time off from coding that enterprise crap. Nobody would complain that I’m browsing Facebook or swiping in Tinder, as I was clearly waiting for the “build” to finish :)')
