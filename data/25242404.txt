From what I&#x27;ve gleaned, &quot;holographic&quot; refers to Tony Plate&#x27;s Holographic Reduced Representations<p>- &quot;hypervector&quot; is just a swanky term for very-high-dimensionality vectors, a la &quot;hypersonic&quot;, &quot;hypervisor&quot;, hyper-encabulator, etc.<p>- this reminds me an awful lot of thought vectors. The first abstract linked mentions HRRs alongside semantic vectors, so both are types of hypervectors I think?<p>- this also reminds me of Numenta&#x2F;Nupic&#x2F;sparse distributed represntations. I think SDR&#x27;s are also hypervectors?')
