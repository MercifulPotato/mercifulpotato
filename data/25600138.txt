(Yet. It is possible in principle, it just hasn&#x27;t been achieved.)<p>In contrast, output from radio telescopes can be sampled and recorded with careful time registration, and the samples interfered numerically, so signals from radio telescopes thousands of miles apart can be treated together, yielding images of overwhelmingly finer detail. Even when using just a single radio telescope, a reflector dish can be made much larger than any practical earthbound optical mirror.<p>So, if a radio-telescope image is indistinct, it is likely that the object imaged is itself indistinct.<p>The recent image of a black-hole accretion disc was composed from radio-telescope traces. No optical treatment could produce an image of such resolution.')
