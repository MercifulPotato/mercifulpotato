I&#x27;m sure there are some large data migration cases which could make it a problem, but for my typical development (1-3 instances of a JetBrains IDE open, PostgreSQL and MySQL servers running, Docker running, sometimes even VirtualBox running, half a dozen or more terminal sessions, 1-5 Rails apps running - all of these simultaneously) I have been fine with 16GB.<p>If anything does start to create memory pressure, it&#x27;s usually Chrome or Firefox after they&#x27;ve been open for weeks (since my laptop uptimes are usually 30-90 days), with far too many tabs open.')
