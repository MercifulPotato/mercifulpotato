Every other empire in human history has also committed huge atrocities, so much that it&#x27;s almost tautological.<p>Do you think modern times are any different?<p>Can you count the civilians death in Palestine, Iraq, Afganistan and many other places where USA and its allies bombed and bombs regularly. Talk of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, it’s more brutal and worse than Kalinga which transformed Ashoka. Did this transform USA (its allies) or it’s political establishments?<p>Here not even talking about WWI and WWII. So don’t think living in a bubble unaffected by these can legitimise the tyranny of majority or democracy or communism which propelled to kill millions of others with different beliefs.<p>&gt; but political structure still exists<p>Yes they are based on majoritarian views and politics at the expense of muzzling the minority.<p>We need a modern revolution based on science and humanity, removing the artificial barriers created by us, but anyways I know I am dreaming.')
