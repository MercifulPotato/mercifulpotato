And even if they do make eye contact, it doesn&#x27;t actually mean that they like it. Forcing people to feign pleasure under threat of poverty may work to a certain extent, but it&#x27;s harmful to social cohesion in the long run. It breeds resentment and humiliation, and it&#x27;s harmful to mental health and self-esteem, and as we are already living in the most unequal time since before the civil war, it&#x27;s not very safe for your corporate masters to be fanning the flames of class antagonisms.')
