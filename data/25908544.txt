Then they are only willing to pay a fixed price for a car that averages the value of a &quot;peach&quot; and &quot;lemon&quot; together (pavg). But sellers know whether they hold a peach or a lemon. Given the fixed price at which buyers will buy, sellers will sell only when they hold &quot;lemons&quot; and they will leave the market when they hold &quot;peaches&quot;. Eventually, as enough sellers of &quot;peaches&quot; leave the market, the average willingness-to-pay of buyers will decrease (since the average quality of cars on the market decreased), leading to even more sellers of high-quality cars to leave the market through a positive feedback loop. Thus the uninformed buyer&#x27;s price creates an adverse selection problem that drives the high-quality cars from the market. Adverse selection is a market mechanism that can lead to a market collapse.')
