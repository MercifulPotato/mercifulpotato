Apparently the cost of a Falcon 9 launch is down to $28 million, which is ~$1,200&#x2F;kg thanks to reusability.<p><i>″[The rocket] costs $28 million to launch it, that’s with everything,” Couluris said, adding that reusing the rockets is what is “bringing the price down.”</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;16&#x2F;elon-musk-spacex-falcon-9-rocket-over-a-million-dollars-less-to-insure.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;16&#x2F;elon-musk-spacex-falcon-9-ro...</a><p>As SpaceX uses their Falcon 9s more, the cost will continue to fall and approach consumables plus the amortized cost of the 1st stage.<p>The Starship is the same idea, but with larger payload and better reusability. Realistically it&#x27;ll be somewhat expensive initially, but as they improve the design and reuse, costs will drop.')
