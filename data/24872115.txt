You would end up improving a lot of things not necessarily related to speed. I still often crank out a really shitty version that works just to get to the points that require some deep thought. You can get a lot of work done if nothing really matters. The first rewrite is helped a lot by having done things before. The second full rewrite sadly never happens anymore.
