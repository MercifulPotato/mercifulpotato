A small subset of C++ is supported through Vivado&#x27;s high level synthesis compiler, which transforms some C++ code into Verilog. RTL stands for register-transfer level, which is a general layer of abstraction; one uses a hardware description language such as Verilog to describe RTL designs. The analogy of Verilog with RTL is &quot;Verilog is to RTL, as Haskell is to functional programming&quot;.')
