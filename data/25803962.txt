Everything from the company&#x27;s marketing material to its recruiting practices exudes an almost overwhelming amount of positivity. They put a huge emphasis on hiring &quot;the nicest people in the world&quot;. Disagreements or arguments at the company are almost non-existent, because everyone tries their hardest to be positive and nice at all times. Every other sentence in Slack ends with an emphatic exclamation point (or two or three) and &#x2F; or a smiley face.<p>I like my job, and I will gladly take it over a workplace with toxic negativity, but it&#x27;s still been somewhat exhausting. There&#x27;s that underlying anxiety that if you&#x27;re somehow not seen as exuding the correct level of positivity, that you might get let go.<p>Everyone at the company is constantly patting themselves on the back about how it&#x27;s &quot;the greatest place to work in the world&quot; and that they have &quot;the most incredible co-workers&quot;. This makes it hard to disagree with things or point out things that aren&#x27;t working, because everyone is so afraid to hurt somebody&#x27;s feelings.')
