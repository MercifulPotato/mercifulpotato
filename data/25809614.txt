Item(by='sundarurfriend', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610878942, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25809430, text='4chan is one of those websites I&#x27;ve always wished I could get into, but is too chaotic and difficult to navigate that I stumble out every time. But the few times I&#x27;ve been there, I&#x27;ve been surprised by the quality of some of the posts.<p>People (&quot;normies&quot;) generally associate anonymity with the worst of humanity (G.I.F.T. and all that), but if you&#x27;re willing to wade through that there&#x27;s also the best of humanity in there. People sharing immensely personal things they wouldn&#x27;t have been willing to share anywhere else, writing down deep thoughts that they might have been too shy to post under their real (or real-associated) name, unfiltered advice that cuts through bullshit because they don&#x27;t have to worry about their image. The lows are really low (and I don&#x27;t wish to understate this part), but the highs are also pretty high.')
