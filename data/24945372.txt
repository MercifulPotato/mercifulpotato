In no way does someone waive their right to “be upset” by neglecting to mention all the things they don’t like in a license.<p>&gt; Separately, I&#x27;m not certain about the distinction between law and morality. Law is a set of rules of what things shall and shall not be done, being a code of moral rules in this sense. This is also what we use it for: we as societies generally use law to express our ethical stance on murder and violence, for example, but also theft, the permission to take drugs and drink alcohol, to go out at night.<p>This is not really true, law is a means of resolving and preventing disputes by codifying acts and their consequences so as to allow social coordination.<p>&gt; Wwere does the line go? I can understand justifying that position by saying that people with different moral codes would riot, making it impractical to forbid what I see as immoral.<p>The case is that people with different moral codes would seek to impose their contradictory codes upon each other so we seek the minimum viable ruleset that allows us to live in peace and leave questions of morality up to the individual and their community.<p>&gt; I ask this question because that was not explained, and is the justification for preferring to abolish copyright rather than instill the 4 rules, even though the author seems to agree with both, and both are just as impractical to implement at this time (would make people riot).<p>The author explains his opposition is both moral and practical in nature. Moral because ideas are not scarce&#x2F;rivalrous and so not properly considered property; and practical because law as an instrument is wielded by interested parties who have disproportionate power to realize those interests using the machinery of social order.')
