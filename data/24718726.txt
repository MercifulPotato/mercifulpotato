The company I worked at was unionized and the union made yearly salary adjustments happen.<p>But to answer your question: In Germany, what the company actually ends up paying is about 20% higher than what you have in your contract. The company pays part of your unemployment insurance, healthcare insurance and some other contributions&#x2F;taxes employees don&#x27;t get to see. Your own contributions are usually around 40%.\nIf a company pays 100k in total you end up with ~50k in your pocket after taxes&#x2F;contributions.<p>I also feel that tech salaries in some regions of the US are a bit disconnected from what is happening in the rest of the world.')
