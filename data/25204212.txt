It&#x27;s true, though, that the computer could still be stuck even though it updates the spinner. This is a hard problem to solve.<p>The problem that people might assume the computer is stuck in a loop or at any rate that the animation is not going to stop is related to spinner animations on websites. Since the spinner is not a function of the browser, but is instead something implemented in the individual site&#x27;s code, then stopping the spinner needs to be also coded for and many sites neglect to write the code for &quot;when error happens stop spinner and tell them that things went wrong&quot;.<p>So over time people exposed to negligent website spinners start to suspect any spinner that takes too long.')
