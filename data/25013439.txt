Zen 3 now has superior IPC as well; the now unqualified performance lead of AMD devices happens at lower frequency.  The process node problem is just the most visible and embarrassing problem Intel has.  It is not the <i>only</i> problem.  Intel&#x27;s 10th gen is also still well behind the curve wrt side channel attacks.  That gap will persist until Rocket Lake appears.<p>The rot at Intel is old and runs deep.<p>The one area that Intel has managed to maintain superiority is quality.  Intel is still the thing to buy if you want minimum glitches.')
