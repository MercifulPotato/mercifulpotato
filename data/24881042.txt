Furthermore, it is not always easy to find a decent image but the mere search for this image will make your brain work with that word in mind and create associations.<p>Granted, it is not easy to find images for words such as &quot;philosophy&quot; but with a bit of creativity it is possible and if not, it&#x27;s always possible to explain the target word in the target language to stay immersed.')
