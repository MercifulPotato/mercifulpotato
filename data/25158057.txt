Adding types to dynamic languages might actually exhibit this behavior, of inevitably leading to really, really complex type definitions which just confuse things tremendously.<p>In your case, your alternative is back to untyped, unsafe JavaScript. Maybe that&#x27;s not so much better. Another alternative would be to move to a language designed with types in mind from the get go, say OCaml (with ReScript) or Java (with JSweet), or others.<p>Bottom line, I think that claim is still true:<p>&quot;Forcing types on a dynamic language like this seems to inevitably lead to really, really complex type definitions which just confuse things tremendously&quot;<p>But if that is a good or bad trade off for you to make, I think that&#x27;s very contextual, it depends. Maybe that&#x27;s okay for someone, and they&#x27;ll use TypeScript. Maybe that&#x27;s not okay, and they&#x27;ll go back to JavaScript. Maybe they&#x27;ll instead explore a ground up typed lang like Java.')
