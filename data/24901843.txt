Anti-circumvention is the most world-hating corporate-owned-world flaming garbage that could be devised, and violating it comes with unbelievably mercilessly cruel criminal penalties.<p>The menace of this threat has silenced science &amp; speech, has prevented mankind from examining the world about them, learning of it, &amp; discussing it. We have outlawed knowledge, outlawed idea, literally criminalized knowing something about the world with steep jail time. This is a farce, of the highest order, one of the greatest shames the law has done unto itself.<p>Great recent thread from Doctorow on this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mamot.fr&#x2F;@pluralistic&#x2F;105090187888073250" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mamot.fr&#x2F;@pluralistic&#x2F;105090187888073250</a><p>I also recommend Bunnie Huang&#x27;s &quot;Why I&#x27;m Suing the US Government&quot;, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bunniestudios.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;?p=4782" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bunniestudios.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;?p=4782</a><p>Anti-circumvention laws must be stopped.')
