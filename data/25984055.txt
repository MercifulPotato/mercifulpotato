If we were to start from scratch building a stock market or banking system today, we might take different approaches.<p>But there&#x27;s a market that exists at substantial scale that was originally built around T+14 settlement (and then T+7, T+5, T+3, all the way down to T+2 which is really still brand new).  And while there&#x27;s substantial risks and costs that come from delayed settlement, there&#x27;s also substantial benefits... and an entire global financial system that relies upon the properties we get from these settlement delays.  Another equilibrium being perhaps slightly better overall doesn&#x27;t necessarily justify reinventing the wheel.<p>I suspect we&#x27;ll get to T+1 settlement for stocks and many banking transactions in a few more years (we&#x27;re already there for options)... and then it may be time to discuss the benefits of various types of &quot;instant&quot; settlement for some subset of financial activity.')
