We&#x27;re just middle class. E.g. only my dad has a car; my sister is 42 and I&#x27;m 38, and we still don&#x27;t have our own car. Whenever something related to making use of the insurance plan comes up, the insurance agent would be very helpful and ensure we get our money&#x27;s worth. She would teach us what to do in order to not miss out on benefits. The claims process is also easy. We don&#x27;t get this nonsense where the insurer tries to deny us and hope that we don&#x27;t dispute.')
