Item(by='xoa', descendants=None, kids=[25125121], score=None, time=1605627332, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25124281, text='&gt;How do you begin to measure CO2 emissions for the entire lifecycle of a product?<p>You don&#x27;t, the entire point is that it naturally gets dealt with (or at least, sufficiently) if you simply internalize the emission cost of inputs. You set the price of emitting a ton of CO2 equivalent during energy or material production at the present bid price of industrial scale rapid removal of a ton of CO2 from the atmosphere with some attractive margin (10% maybe, but that could be set by experts), and then the market can figure it out from there. All energy then becomes net neutral, as well as the vast majority of materials, and it&#x27;s more straight forward to police (though still real work) since law enforcement just need to focus on a smaller number of central points.<p>&quot;CO2 emissions&quot; don&#x27;t just materialize by magic, they&#x27;re a result of energy&#x2F;material inputs to a product. Take care of those and there isn&#x27;t any need at all to care what people do with the product or for how long. There is no stupid, counter productive moralizing required either about what people do with their luxury energy budget. The goal is that the net amount of CO2 in the atmosphere stays static (or at this point, is lowered back to our optimal standard, then kept steady state). That goal is what should be legislated, not how to reach it.')
