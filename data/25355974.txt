Fuchsia is a foundation for developers to create long-lasting products and experiences across a broad range of devices.&quot;<p>&quot;The Zephyr ProjectTM strives to deliver the best-in-class RTOS for connected resource-constrained devices, built to be secure and safe.&quot;<p>This sounds a lot like the same to me - Fuchsia is perhaps more a general OS, but I would think that Zephyr can solve the same problems as Fuchsia.<p>What I like about Zephyr is that it is developed in the open and not in some google lab.')
