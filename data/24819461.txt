It is meant to be run inside virtual machines instead of from a USB like Obscurix. Whonix has a more leak-proof method of forcing all traffic through Tor but it isn&#x27;t amnesiac or forensics resistant like Obscurix.&quot;<p>Basically, Whonix requires a VM sandbox escape in order to leak your IP address. Obscurix does not have any comparable protection against malicious applications leaking your IP address. The purported advantage of Obscurix is its &quot;amnesiac&quot; property, but it doesn&#x27;t sound very compelling. Everyone should be using full disk encryption in any case, regardless of what OS they are running or what other steps they are taking to improve security. It&#x27;s not clear to me why I should care about the amnesiac property of the OS when everything is encrypted.')
