After all, we know that a lot of functionality is closed into Google Play Services, so that AOSP is to a great extent a bait for being fully tied to Google. Even without relying on closed-source components, you&#x27;re still relying on Google&#x27;s interest and good will in maintaining that project.<p>Instead, it&#x27;s much more important to promote the &quot;porting&quot;, or rather the adaptation, of Linux and *BSD distributions to work on RISC-V. Like with the Raspberry PI I suppose.')
