It&#x27;s the same question as the measurement problem: Schrodinger&#x27;s equation predicts that a particle can exist in many places at the same time, with different amplitudes, and interact with particles in all those places. However, if we want to predict the particle&#x27;s movement after it encounters a detector, we need to update the wave function to set its probability to 1 at the position of the detector and 0 everywhere else - otherwise, our predictions are measurably wrong.<p>Now, the question is: what causes this discontinuity in the equations of motion? Why is interaction with a detector different than interaction with another particle? Many Worlds simply reframes this problem, but doesn&#x27;t get rid of it. In MWI, you would say &#x27;the particle moves in all universes according to the wave function, until it interacts with a detector, possibly interfering with versions of itself in other universes. Then, when it encounters the detector, the world line of the detector splits - in some universes it passes the detector, in others it doesn&#x27;t. However, it no longer interacts with other versions of itself,so we must update the wave function inside the universe where it passed the detector&#x27;.')
