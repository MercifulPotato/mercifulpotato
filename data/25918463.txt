Grr.<p><i>From: victoria@monetization-providers.com</i><p><i>Subject: Monetise Your Chrome Extension</i><p><i>I came across your extension on the Google chrome store and wanted to reach out to you to offer a way to increase revenue earnings from your extension. We are providing our partners with Bing landers and feeds that pays really well on extensions for search. It can earn up to $800 a month per 5000 users, and it is a premium product by invitation only. If your extension does not have search this is not a problem with a simple update this can be added, furthermore it is completely acceptable by google chrome store.</i><p><i>If this is something you would be interested in, I would be glad to schedule a call to discuss this with you! Also if you are looking to sell your extension we can discuss this opportunity as we buy extensions.</i><p><i>Victoria Jude</i><p><i>Business Development Manager</i><p>The sending domain was registered yesterday.')
