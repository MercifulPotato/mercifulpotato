And it&#x27;s not like you can just exchange a few words here and there and consider it done. If a human has to make corrections they&#x27;ll likely rewrite the entire sentence and then the advantage of machine-assisted translation is pretty much gone. Overall you&#x27;ll save time but the amount of time saved is probably less than what we think.')
