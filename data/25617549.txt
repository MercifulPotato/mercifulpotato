For the next ~4 hours I basically forgot &quot;who&quot; I was, being deprived of a phone that constantly shows me my friends, notes, and pictures. Eventually, I did find my phone and it was the <i>weirdest</i> experience ever to look at my phone and slowly start &quot;remembering&quot; who I am.')
