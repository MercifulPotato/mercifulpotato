Item(by='pyuser583', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607557803, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25342382, text='Yeah - it was a weird situation. My wife - who was pregnant- received a phone call that a close relative had died.<p>The guy had been a living off the grid. A nice guy who was into green living, etc. He was retired with a good pension and savings, so decided to build his “eco cabin” in the middle of nowhere and he self reliant via renewables.<p>Sadly, living in the middle of nowhere means a reduction in time to arrival for emergency medical support.<p>He had a stroke.<p>The details were a bit gruesome: walking for miles seeking help before freezing to death. Scavengers arrived quickly.<p>My wife got the phone call. The cousin she spoke with emphasized the gory details.<p>My wife responded loudly and with emotion.Screaming, wailing, crying, etc.<p>She wanted to go the impromptu funeral they were having. Apparently he’d wanted to be buried at his cabin. No service, just have his friends dig a hole and throw him in.<p>Perfectly legal in that state, as long as death was reported.<p>She’s need the car - which means I would have to walk to work. In the winter. With images of a man I knew dying from hypothermia fresh in my head.<p>I said no, unless she can find her own transportation.<p>Buses don’t go to the middle of nowhere.<p>We had a bit of a shouting match.<p>Anyway she said she’s going to the funeral and basically stormed out the door. She didn’t take the car.<p>Apparently neighbors overheard. They heard my wife’s blood curtling scream, and also heard about our plan to “bury a body in the middle of nowhere.”<p>My wife was pregnant, which substantially increases a woman’s risk of being murdered by the father.<p>And she was gone.<p>I wasn’t certain what state the uncle’s cabin was in, much less county or municipality.<p>I wasn’t certain how my wife planned getting there.<p>My wife had a smartphone but didn’t take it with her (not as odd back then).<p>There were other incriminating things- bloody clothes, lots of used menstrual pads (wife is pregnant - does he have a mistress?), there had been several shootings in my apartment building. Etc.<p>The police arrived in a very agitated state. They were certain I killed my wife. They asked questions I probably shouldn’t have answered:<p>“Where is your wife? Where’s the body?”<p>“I don’t know where she is, but the body’s in the middle of woods somewhere”.<p>“Your wife is in the middle of the woods?”<p>“Not yet, but she will be.”<p>You get the drift.<p>I was arrested and sent to the police station to be interrogated.<p>I spent a lot of time waiting around, and very little time being interrogated.<p>I got be treated like a murderer for the length of time it took my wife to borrow a car and drive 400 miles - when she checked in with family.<p>Not a fun 12 hours.<p>It’s worth pointing out we were broke and living in a high crime neighborhood. There had been three shootings in that apartment complex that year.')
