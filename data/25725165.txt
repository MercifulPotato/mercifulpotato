It&#x27;s a tedious process so I&#x27;m not surprised engineers throw their hands up and just have a PM do it.<p>I do think SV puts more trust in their engineering teams to produce polished software, whereas other companies will burn through tons of dev resources over nit-picking or implementing speculative edge-cases.')
