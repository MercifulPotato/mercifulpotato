Or what we know about the universe is basically true (and we can&#x27;t travel faster than ligth, nor do something that, I don&#x27;t know, turns all our galaxy into 2D or triggering the big rip) or if we keep advancing we could do something that threatens something that is very far away. In the latter case close enough civilizations may worry about what we do, and be in a dark forest universe (ok, here I&#x27;m assuming how they should think here too). But for that to have any meaning we should be in an universe where the speed of light is not the ultimate limit in any meaningful way, and so far we know, we don&#x27;t.')
