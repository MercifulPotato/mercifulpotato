How could I sell ist against Acorn or Pixelmator? The latter is at 20$ and has superior benchmarks due to M1 support. It is available for the Mac and the iPad as well. It has the perfect UI, whereas Krita has a UI that would weird out everyone who learned graphics in the &quot;Adobe&quot; school.<p>LibreOffice, you probably know that Excel is one of the biggest software platforms out there. So, I can see a chance here, when you sell script&#x2F;macro development, but I wouldn&#x27;t know why anyone would want LibreOffice. It&#x27;s just in use because nothing else is available on Linux.<p>Blender is probably very good, but people who need such stuff don&#x27;t necessarily look too much on price. Performance is more important there.<p>I don&#x27;t know enough about music production to comment on Ardour.')
