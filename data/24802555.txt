The open source version would likely stagnate as the commercial version gains features. It&#x27;d be hard not to align with company goals and plans when your paycheck depends on it.<p>Better would be to use mechanisms that already exist to sponsor the core developers for a length of time (Patreon, liberapay, etc). Alternatively, companies like Amazon could create an internal fund that assists key open source projects they&#x27;ve commercialized to set up as non-profits and then makes donations to them over X number of years.')
