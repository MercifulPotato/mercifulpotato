TiVo-ization is a <i>violation</i> because GPL software and proprietary software are combined to form a single piece of software, distributed as a single binary firmware image; the fact that there&#x27;s some notional internal interface between the GPL and non-GPL code within, if you manage to crack the firmware that is, should be legally irrelevant. But engineers are wont to be distracted by concerns such as &quot;kernel space&quot; and &quot;user space&quot;, and &quot;dynamically linked&quot; vs &quot;compiled in&quot;. Absolutely none of this matters, if I&#x27;m getting a big-ass opaque blob with a mixture of GPL and proprietary code in it. The same goes for  the average Android handset, for that matter.<p>I think the battle was lost by <i>not pushing the advantage hard enough</i>.')
