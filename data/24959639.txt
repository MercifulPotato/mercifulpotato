And I’m not completely sure if this is the scenario you had in mind.<p>There were different types of revenue streams.<p>First are open projects for multiple companies to apply for, convince the clients they are the best party for x amount of money. These project’s are large, and requires also quite a bit of investments for the company competing for the project.<p>These are usually fixed price fixed scope projects. After finishing the project there often are several other contract types. ALM application lifecycle management contracts, these are often x amount of hour to per month. To keep the system’s up to date, Fix bugs that pop up and creating uptime reports and such.<p>Often there’s also an amount of money per month for on call support. The projects need to be kept running 24&#x2F;7 so if something breaks in the middle of the night someone needs to wake up and try to fix it.<p>Other types of revenue are teams&#x2F;individuals for hire. Imagine the customer having a few engineers and the consulting firm supply a few hands. They can be a range of roles, testers, frontend backend, scrum masters depending on the snake oil they company is selling ;).<p>There is also projects that happen together with FANG. Google and Microsoft are quite notorious for helping companies like mine to our connect with our customers. Helping them while including the latest whistles and bells of there offerings. That is also why many companies value certificates from Microsoft and Google etc. They get discount of cloud pricing, so they get a cut from what they pay for the infrastructure.<p>On systems that are in maintenance mode there are also some often RFCs (request for change) as larger changes with the system that is in maintenance mode.<p>Instead of waterfall projects the alternatives is to sell x amount of sprints or design sprints. But in my experience large companies and agile that it doesn’t really works')
