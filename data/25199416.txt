Even the IEA has finally agreed that solar photovoltaic is the cheapest energy in history:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.popularmechanics.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;a34372005&#x2F;solar-cheapest-energy-ever&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.popularmechanics.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;a34372005&#x2F;solar-che...</a><p>And this is from an agency that is notoriously pessimistic and wrong about solar, vastly overestimating costs of solar and underestimating future deployments. So when the IEA has declared solar cheap, one can be sure that there is zero data to support otherwise.<p>Similarly, the IEA has been unreasonably bullish about the cost of nuclear, but still places it as one of the most expensive sources of energy.<p>The data is not on your side, and I have to wonder why you came to believe the things that you are saying.')
