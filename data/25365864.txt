Yesterday I had to go downtown during rush hour and Lyft wanted $15. I&#x27;m not sure if this is normal (although I believe we have a hefty tax on rideshare to downtown, at least during rush hour), but at that point it&#x27;s significantly cheaper to pay the $10&#x2F;day or whatever that the parking garages charge (of course this isn&#x27;t factoring in the cost of ownership nor is it considering other transit options).')
