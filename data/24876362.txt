After buildings have already been hit once they make repeated strikes less effective. Chemical weapons are pound for pound vastly more deadly, especially as a follow up and more importantly disable people tying up resources for medical treatment and evacuation.<p>The most recent example is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ghouta_chemical_attack" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ghouta_chemical_attack</a> which killed or incapacitated ~5,000 with a few rockets.  It also acted at least in the short term as area denial which can be extremely useful.<p>PS: In terms of fighting a near parity army, simply using tents separated by sandbag walls makes bombs or rocket strikes significantly less effective.  Add even the threat of chemical weapons and things become significantly more difficult.  <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;armymomstrong.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2010&#x2F;02&#x2F;2-military-tent.jpg" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;armymomstrong.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2010&#x2F;02&#x2F;2-milita...</a>')
