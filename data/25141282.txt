It seems like you&#x27;re learning a completely different language for styling and layout. I also have some gripes with optimization in that the suggested solution to eliminating unused CSS is to use a tool that finds classes in HTML files, which is a pretty rudimentary way to accomplish that. (However, I&#x27;m sure in more advanced codebases, particularly JavaScript ones, there&#x27;s probably a better utility to use.)')
