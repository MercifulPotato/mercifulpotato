Like, not at all. Generally speaking countries in northern Europe are very good at English, it&#x27;s used often in cities and if you live in a major city you can do almost everything in English. I lived in Berlin for 3 years and you can do virtually everything (but administrative stuff) in English (in fact that makes it difficult to learn German by immersion, people switch to English as soon as they notice that you have a foreign accent or speak a bit slowly or with difficulty).<p>But that&#x27;s it. Local languages are dominant for any other situation. And while English is the main language used for business, the majority of people don&#x27;t speak it fluently.<p>That varies a lot per country, for example Sweden and Norway are really good at teaching English, Austria, Germany and Belgium are ok, France, Spain, and Italy are bad.<p>You can see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;EF_English_Proficiency_Index" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;EF_English_Proficiency_Index</a> for some comparison between countries.')
