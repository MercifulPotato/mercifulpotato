I think applications should largely deliver all of their own resources.<p>If you&#x27;re in financial or security (military) applications, there may be legal, resource and other requirements that supercede what you can do.<p>It&#x27;s not a one size fits all... that said, modern web application development centers around resources via npm, and largely delivered <i>in</i> your appliation bundle, so it&#x27;s less of a concern in the common case these days imho.')
