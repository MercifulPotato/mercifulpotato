(I&#x27;d also add that I think hovering over such UI ought to offer an explanation as to <i>why</i> that particular action is unavailable, and possibly, what steps to take to effect it.)<p>And it can be downright confusing if someone is giving instructions: are you misinterpreting their instructions, are their instruction wrong, or is it that the software is hiding the UI from you?')
