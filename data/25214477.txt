It uses a lot of space, i can&#x27;t just have a list of channels, no i need groups etc.<p>It even doesn&#x27;t matter to me if its slack or hipchat or matrix or whatever. I don&#x27;t know why we migrated to slack.<p>I don&#x27;t get why Teams doesn&#x27;t provide a lightweight chat typical UI. I would just switch to Teams. After all video calls are much better on Teams and more stable.<p>But then Slack integrated Teams and Zoom. They clearly don&#x27;t want to compete in this area and i also don&#x27;t get why.')
