Fortunately, code is restricted enough that we can do pretty well without those.<p>You don&#x27;t write spaces to align text in Word: it&#x27;s a nightmare to maintain and the software provides better tools for that purpose. Why do we still write code as if we were using a typewriter?<p>You may think you are improving readability by aligning columns of text, but then, the impossibility of standardizing such baroque formatting rules goes against that. Furthermore, you are preventing people from using a variable-width font, which is actually better for readability.')
