It&#x27;s one thing if your dynamical model produces two state estimates and covariances, and another entirely when they actually match reality quantitatively!<p>LeoLabs has a recent paper [1] that evaluates the state prediction accuracy.  They&#x27;re finding the right thing (Mahalanobis distance at various temporal separations between their state estimate and an object position).  See secs. 4 and 5.<p>But: they are not getting the chi-squared distribution that you&#x27;d want.  They are getting log-normals, with significant probability mass out to a Mahalanobis distance of 10 and higher (!) -- see the figure in sec. 5.<p>That&#x27;s a very high deviation.  It&#x27;s not unexpected, because this is a hard problem, but the deviations do not appear to follow the expected law.<p>If their collision-probability takes this into account, that&#x27;s good.  But if not -- if they&#x27;re assuming a Gaussian prediction cloud -- then their collision-probability will not be well-calibrated.  If my cursory examination of their (well-done!) paper is correct, a poorly-calibrated probability would be very wrong indeed.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amostech.com&#x2F;TechnicalPapers&#x2F;2019&#x2F;Astrodynamics&#x2F;Park.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amostech.com&#x2F;TechnicalPapers&#x2F;2019&#x2F;Astrodynamics&#x2F;Park...</a>')
