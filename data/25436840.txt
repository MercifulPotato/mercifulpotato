Item(by='roganartu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608074889, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25436540, text='I admittedly have not looked at the data, but I would have a _very_ hard time believing that the total population of NYC is down 40% based on what I see outside my window and while moving around the city (eg to the go the gym etc). The city feels a little quieter than it normally is,  but certainly not the ghost town that a 40% population reduction would be.<p>It follows from that observation that, if 40% of the population did indeed leave, that they would have to have been replaced by people moving into the city. New lease signings being down suggests this is not the case.<p>As an anecdote, about 10% of the apartments in my building that I can see out my window are empty (normally ~1-2% are at any given time). The buildings across the street (which are mostly owner-occupied) are all still occupied.')
