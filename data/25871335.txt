For example even Google, with its teams of lawyers doesn&#x27;t feel comfortable using it <i>for any purpose</i>.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.google&#x2F;docs&#x2F;using&#x2F;agpl-policy&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.google&#x2F;docs&#x2F;using&#x2F;agpl-policy&#x2F;</a><p>It appears that they are concerned that it may be argued that if for example YouTube uses an AGPL DB that they would be required to release YouTube under AGPL.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that the interpretation is correct, but if companies can&#x27;t be sure they won&#x27;t use your software.<p>And to be honest IANAL but their interpretation seems reasonable to me. If you put Mastodon behind NGINX I think it is fairly easy to argue that the user is &quot;interacting with it remotely through a computer network&quot;. So now if you have a theoretical AGPL Elasticsearch and your site sends the user search query to it and returns the user the results it doesn&#x27;t seem clear that this is a legally meaningful difference. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to argue that in court. I&#x27;d just use different software.')
