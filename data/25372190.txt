(Eg the government could just buy water at market prices and distribute as this basic income in kind.)<p>The important thing is that we DON&#x27;T have enough water for all uses we can dream off, like growing almonds in the desert.<p>So you need some kind of rationing.  That means denying water to some uses.<p>Rationing via market prices is one of the most (economically) effective and just ways we have come up with.<p>(If you want to make some argument about how the water in a specific country should be the common good of everyone; you can still do the trading.  Just have the government own all water sources, auction off the supply, and distribute the proceeds to everyone individually.)')
