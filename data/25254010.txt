This is something I want to support and there is some WIP code for it. Currently I&#x27;m only waiting on Wasmtime (the WASM runtime used by Lunatic) to get support for shared memory.<p>Regarding the question about sending code, this also can be implemented. Wasm allows you to share function indexes (pointers) and dynamically call them.')
