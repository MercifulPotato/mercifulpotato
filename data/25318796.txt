They‘re civil, and there are often serious domain experts participating. I like how that exposes me to quite a breadth of knowledge and opinions.<p>In terms of learning, it‘s very much a breadth-first approach. You‘ll hear about plenty of topics and new developments (and thankfully not just from tech), but it‘s the wrong place if you want to learn about any one topic in detail.<p>Also, over time you‘ll figure out the various likes and dislikes of the „HN crowd“. Like any other community, we have our preferences and biases, our little squabbles and unspoken taboos, that do quite strongly influence the topics you‘ll find here amd the way they‘re discussed.')
