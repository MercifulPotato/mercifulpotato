Particularly from this high pulpit of HN, where we nearly all have cushy tech jobs where we don&#x27;t have to interact with anyone to get paid.<p>Seems like a perfect opportunity for the government to continue supporting people. Perhaps some taxes on your high pulpit would do some good.<p>But heaven forbid we do that - because the real answer isn&#x27;t &quot;oh people die in a bad economy.&quot; It&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m unwilling to support my fellow americans in a proper way, I&#x27;d rather them risk their lives instead of providing some support during difficult times.&quot;<p>e.g. &quot;my taxes!&quot;. It&#x27;s a bad faith argument. The economy has been bad before and we never cared about the poor then.')
