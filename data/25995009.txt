Item(by='pyrrhotech', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612218652, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25994325, text='I agree with most of the article except for the evidence of block size used to claim that the bulk of the volume was not retail. 500k - 4 million blocks can easily be retail. I trade that size all the time, even up to 12M blocks, I&#x27;m a retail trader. There are dozens of screenshots from wallstreet bets of fellow retail traders trading this size. Many retailers use up to 3x or more leverage, meaning one would only need a low 6 figure account size to trade the low end of that block range, and yes, many retailers are &quot;all in&quot; during this frenzy with a single trade, again evidenced by YOLO screenshots on WSB recently.<p>Retail does not mean &quot;poor&quot;. Retail means you don&#x27;t work for an investment fund. In fact, my grandfather is worth $250M and frequently trades 10-50M blocks. He is still a retail trader managing his personal assets. Despite popular belief, a large portion of the 1% and even billionaire class manage their own money or at least a large part of it in the stock market.')
