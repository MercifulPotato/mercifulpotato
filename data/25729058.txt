I think that the harm caused by these loud demagogues (is that redundant?) is massively overblown.<p>The US president, perhaps the one with the most platform and audience and reach, couldn&#x27;t even summon a properly armed militia, it was only a small group of mostly unarmed rioters. Their best efforts achieved precisely nothing: they did not seize any power, they did not hold any territory.  It wasn&#x27;t even a battle.  Far from an insurrection, it was just some\nsmashed windows and an instagram moment and now they&#x27;re all in jail.  Calling what happened an armed insurrection is factually inaccurate, even if a few of the rioters brought weapons.<p>If platform\nand reach are proportional to messaging effectiveness (the presumption that this sort of censorship makes) then everyone else&#x27;s efforts along these lines (who isn&#x27;t the president of the United States) will be substantially less effective than even this massively ineffective display in DC.<p>Let them squawk. Misinformation and lies simply aren&#x27;t that dangerous, otherwise we would have had to ban the church centuries ago.<p>Americans are inundated constantly with bullshit messaging from large, powerful organizations. They aren&#x27;t nearly as malleable as the pro-censorship people seem to think they are.')
