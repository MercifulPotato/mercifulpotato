It specifically says emails were allowed. But I wonder if a person maintaining an intranet site could post a banner on it with the same message. I&#x27;m guessing not since it isn&#x27;t designed for that type of communication. I&#x27;m not sure where the plugin would fall. Seems like the message didn&#x27;t fit the intended plugin scope.')
