All the work is done locally, none in the cloud, which is what I want.<p>Personal CRMs like this don&#x27;t seem like a huge market.<p>===\nAt the risk of sounding like a shill, how I have all the functionality described in the article:<p>(I assume android users already have the functionality described in this article as they only support gmail)<p>On the iphone, the contacts app automatically scans for phone numbers, mail addresses etc in your mail and messages (I get a message from an unknown number and messages says it thinks it&#x27;s from &quot;foo&quot; as an email from &quot;foo&quot; included that number in its signature block).  I hope the M1 means that this kind of functionality will migrate back to the Mac soon.<p>And on the Mac I use BusyContacts which aggregates the info for a given person X into a single address book entry.  It connects to a bunch of address book services (unfortunately LinkedIn and FB seem removed their APIs a couple of years ago).  When you look at someone&#x27;s card you also see recent messages and email from them in a sidebar.<p>I am the only person I know of who has bothered to add a third party contacts manager, not that this is the kind of issue that comes up in conversation.')
