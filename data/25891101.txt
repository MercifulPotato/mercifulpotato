Macros are can be used like a customizable JIT compiler if you need the performance. In Racket&#x27;s case, you can even run the expansion step separately like a compiler since it separates macros out as a distinct execution phase.<p>Functions aren&#x27;t represented as lists at runtime, but you still get a lot of control via continuations. You can even serialize continuations to send them over the network or save it to disk. That does have security implications, but it is flexible and convenient.')
