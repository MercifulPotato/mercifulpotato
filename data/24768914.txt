Is the CPI a cost-of-living index?\n...\n&gt; Both the CPI and a cost-of-living index would reflect changes in the prices of goods and services, such as food and clothing that are directly purchased in the marketplace; but a complete cost-of-living index would go beyond this role to also take into account changes in other governmental or environmental factors that affect consumers&#x27; well-being. It is very difficult to determine the proper treatment of public goods, such as safety and education, and other broad concerns, such as health, water quality, and crime, that would constitute a complete cost-of-living framework. Since the CPI does not attempt to quantify all the factors that affect the cost-of-living, it is sometimes termed a conditional cost-of-living index.<p>Public services are being gutted in the US.  I think this explains why cost of living indexes can be north of 10% while the CPI is &lt; 2%.<p>It doesnâ€™t explain how groceries, rent, medical care and education costs have all skyrocketed without raising the CPI.  My guess is that people are spending less than they used to on things like recreation and apparel, due to lack of money.')
