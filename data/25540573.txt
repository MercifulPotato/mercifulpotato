If complex systems were impossible to model science wouldn’t be a thing.<p>Not quite. It can makes them unpredictable, not unknowable... more specifically it can make them computationally irreducible which means we cannot find a simplified description of their behavior without having to compute every step, even when we understand the underlying rules that govern them. In fact we often <i>cannot</i> model them very well, an easy every day example is the weather, which we desperately want to know, but our methods are a significant compromise - that may seem like an unfair analogy but it really isn&#x27;t, the atoms of society may be fewer but they have far more dimensions and more complex individual interactions.<p>It doesn&#x27;t always apply, even within the same medium, it depends on the context e.g predicting weather requires some kind of simulation of fluid and pressure, yet in a different, more narrow context it&#x27;s not necessary to attempt simulating the underlying mechanisms in any way or form, instead the overall behavior can be simplified to a set of descriptive equations (Bernoulli&#x27;s).<p>It&#x27;s funny because this does touch on a core issue for science - we still mostly hold this traditional view of it based on a history of going after the more easily obtainable nuggets of behavior with nice manageable reducible descriptions, but we have been unwittingly selective.<p>&gt; what other complex interactions are resulting in a new strain becoming dominant over an existing one?<p>It does not need to result in a new _variant_, this right here is the misunderstanding. These two things can happen and not be related.')
