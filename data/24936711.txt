Note that this was in 2018, so some time before they&#x27;d actually nailed anything down formally. Anyway they told me I&#x27;d have to apply for indefinite leave to remain, and eventually become a Brit. There was a fee too, I think ~ Â£1000. And the kicker, they said I was only allowed a UK passport and one other. And so I left the UK.<p>Having left I no longer paid much attention - I have no idea what the actual rules&#x2F;requirements are for EU citizens with an additional non-EU citizenship to naturalise into the UK. And honestly I was so destroyed by the referendum anyway that I doubt anything would&#x27;ve kept me in the UK. Crazy sad.')
