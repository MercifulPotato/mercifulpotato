WeWork, etc.).<p>We&#x27;re both saying: be ruthlessly rational with your time and money.<p>However, I think a bias towards spending (vs. irrational frugality) is actually much more rare than you think. Everybody knows about WeWork, but they don&#x27;t hear about all the engineers who spent 6 months optimizing their AWS bill to save $500 when they hadn&#x27;t even found product-market fit yet.')
