I’ve got down to the second tracking of exactly what I did during my last job for around two years. Easy to sort by work-vs-fun. If I had used it on my personal laptop I’d have near 90% coverage of my life. Then tracking the rest would require less manual effort. Probably could semi-automate that too by building an app that polls you every 15m with a few quick-add entries.<p>I can’t imagine doing this manually in a spreadsheet.')
