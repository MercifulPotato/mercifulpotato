After giving just a quick skim, this paper looks like great work. The findings are remarkable, and they&#x27;re presented in clear, to-the-point language.<p>I confess to being a bit shocked that given the same number of parameters, training is 1.65x faster (whoa), generation is 9x faster (wait, what!?), and perplexity is better (which is a flawed measure, but still), and all by using a new form of &quot;curriculum learning&quot; and adding position embeddings to the queries and keys but not the values.<p>And it&#x27;s so nice to see new ideas and improvements that don&#x27;t rely on yet more computation or yet more parameters (I&#x27;m looking at you, GPT-3).<p>Congratulations!')
