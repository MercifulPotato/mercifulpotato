So, the recruiter might mention a number, and I&#x27;ll think to myself &quot;that plus Y%&quot; would do it for me. But I have no reason to say that. Who knows, maybe &quot;that plus Y+Z%&quot; is the firm&#x27;s real upper limit. So it can&#x27;t be the fault of recruiter, but also, it would be unwise for me too early on.<p>I could give an absolute minimum, but that would be an anchor I don&#x27;t want to be tied to.')
