As long as the node runs and the pod itself runs and there is no issue with a pod with a higher priority, k8s will not throw it from that node.<p>But imagine a database as a pod with 60gig of ram and a ha setup. Now you need to update your node, what does k8s? It will throw it out and creates a new one which needs to recover or read all the logs to fill up 60gig of ram again from nothing. Instead it could migrate this pod to another node and keep the downtime to a minimum.<p>Or a jenkins master, it has to shutdown on node 1, recreate to node 2 which takes time and then your agents need to be able to recover from it.<p>You have to be able to roll through your whole k8s infrastructure to update every node on a regular basis; Alone for security reasons.')
