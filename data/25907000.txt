It doesn&#x27;t account for transistor count or density just the size of the entire chip? With pipelining I don&#x27;t think a signal has to travel across the entire chip every cycle. It also doesn&#x27;t really address the question above, since single core CPU speeds haven&#x27;t increased in 15 years even though transistors have kept getting smaller and closer together.<p>Seems like an intriguing napkin math limit&#x2F;simplification though, I&#x27;d be interested if anyone could elaborate on if there&#x27;s any substance to it.')
