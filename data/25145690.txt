We <i>have</i> developed weapons to kill en masse, such as nuclear weapons etc. The vast majority of the weapons we create <i>now</i> are designed to limit casualties as compared to past years. Think about all the dumb, nuclear, and fire bombs dropped in WW2, Korea, and Vietnam. Now compare that with today&#x27;s weapons, such as hellfires that have blades instead of warheads so you can kill a passenger in a car without killing the driving.<p>Do we still have the other types of weapons - sure. But overall, the trend is fewer casualties because we stop using the indiscriminate weapons.<p>I&#x27;m curious how you see the advanced weapons falling into the hands of evil and being used against &quot;the people&quot;. The people are the ones who are in the military. Generally, you would have factions on either side of an issue with similar weapons.')
