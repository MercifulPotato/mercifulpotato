Apple&#x27;s M1 chip on preliminary analysis looks like a huge game changer.... for Apple. They don&#x27;t have much of a history of licensing their tech (except for a disastrous period of Mac clones waaay back) so I don&#x27;t see the M1 disrupting the notebook&#x2F;desktop market.<p>That leaves AMD. AMD Isn&#x27;t eating Intel&#x27;s lunch, they&#x27;ve had a pretty good taste of it and are about to say &quot;no, not just lunch, we&#x27;re taking all the food&quot;.<p>But there&#x27;s a window. My not-very-expert opinion is that the window is 2 years. That&#x27;s how long Intel has, while AMD chips away its market share with new installed systems, to turn things around. If they do it, they&#x27;ll still have to claw back their previous position, or there will simply be a new stable equilibrium, but I think Intel&#x27;s dominance in the server &amp; consumer-grade space gives them some breathing room.<p>In the consumer space, shoppers for high end systems e.g., gaming etc are gone: AMD has them now, and more every day. They have me, that&#x27;s for sure. But the much much larger consumer market is not in gaming. Intel has the name recognition for the average consumer, and it&#x27;s their hardware in most consumer grade systems. A quick glance at a dozen consumer grade laptops &amp; desktops from HP &amp; Dell don&#x27;t show any AMD CPUs in them.<p>So, Intel still has that level of inertia. If they can limit the bleeding in server &amp; high end systems to a rapid bleed-out instead of a near instant &amp; complete gushing torrent, that inertia may be enough to allow them to claw things back if they&#x27;re able to execute within the next two years.<p>I&#x27;m no Intel fanboi: They lost me unless&#x2F;until they turn things around. And from where they are now, I don&#x27;t rate their chance more than 50&#x2F;50, which might be generous. But I do think they&#x27;ve still got 2 years until their viability is really threatened. At that point, and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ve got some skunkworks &amp; low-profile conversations going on about this already, they&#x27;ll need to look at offloading high performance fabs to TSMC.<p>Personally, from a global strategy standpoint, I think the US might not want to lose what is really a strategic asset that way though, so we could also see some type of subsidy&#x2F;bailout&#x2F;whatever to prop them up.')
