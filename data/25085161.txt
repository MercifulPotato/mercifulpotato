In Q3, more than 27,000 developers wrote and deployed their first Cloudflare Workers. That&#x27;s up from 15,000 a year ago. History proves with new computing platforms, the more developers they have, the more quickly they improved and the more likely they are to win. Looking at GitHub and other sources of data on developer engagement, we believe more developers right deploy real applications and code on Cloudflare Workers every month than every other edge computing platforms combined. So what are they building?<p>- One of the most viewed publications during the 2020 elections used Cloudflare Workers to power their elections news platform and ensure it scaled during the unprecedented spike in traffic last Tuesday as well as Wednesday and today.<p>- A popular health foods company uses Workers to power their online ordering system.<p>- An online marketing firm working with major brands uses Workers to customize content on a per visitor basis.<p>- A publicly traded electronics testing firm use Workers to bridge their on-premise and cloud-based infrastructure.<p>- An innovative start-up is using Workers to power an online crypto scavenger hunt.<p>- And one of the largest online learning platforms uses Workers to deliver their customized content during this time of skyrocketing demand.<p>It&#x27;s great to see more use cases every quarter, but I think we&#x27;re just scratching the service. Most use cases today have focused on performance. Over time, I expect those use cases will pale in comparison to what is a much bigger opportunity, helping customers manage the challenges of compliance. As governments around the world increasingly insist on data localization and data regency, sending all your users&#x27; data back to AWS feeds for processing will become unacceptable. What our largest, most sophisticated, most compliant sensitive customers are looking to Workers for is as a way to manage this increasingly complex regulatory environment. That&#x27;s why during Cloudflare&#x27;s Birthday Week, our announcement of Durable Objects may have been one of the most important edge computing developments you may have missed. Durable Objects allows developers to define a data structure and store it safely on our network close to users that need to access it in order to ensure performance and consistency. It also allows developers to define where that data can move across our network and where it cannot, such as this user&#x27;s data may never leave the EU or this user&#x27;s data may never leave Brazil.<p>Given Cloudflare&#x27;s network spans more than 200 cities in more than 100 countries worldwide, Durable Objects provides fine-grained control over where data is stored and processed. That functionality is critical for the increasingly complex compliance challenges that face every global company today. In other words, the future of edge computing will be defined as much by intelligent edge storage as it is by computing. And while others are still working to launch for edge computing platforms, we have products like Durable Object in market that are defining that future today.&quot;')
