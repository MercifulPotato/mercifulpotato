I found this which is at least a natural experiment:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healthaffairs.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;10.1377&#x2F;hlthaff.2020.00818" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healthaffairs.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;10.1377&#x2F;hlthaff.2020.0...</a><p>&gt;  Mandating face mask use in public is associated with a decline in the daily COVID-19 growth rate by 0.9, 1.1,1.4, 1.7, and 2.0 percentage points in 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, and 21 or more days after state face mask orders were signed, respectively.<p>I&#x27;m trying to sort of if those percentages are absolute or relative. I think they&#x27;re absolute because some of the graphs are labeled &quot;percentage point change,&quot; but using absolute percentage point changes for an analysis like this is seriously flawed because a 2% reduction could range anywhere from a miracle to statistically significant, but negligible.<p>It&#x27;s also not clear if people feel safer wearing face masks, so they engage in riskier activities.<p>My guess is they&#x27;re not as effective as claimed because while the Bay Area has pretty high compliance, if masks were systemically very effective, we&#x27;d see case rates drop a lot faster, not still be above mid-June numbers. That said, whatever the Bay Area is doing right now is working.')
