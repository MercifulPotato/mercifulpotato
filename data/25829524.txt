With him at the head of the column, many more people storm the building (the Capitol police likely don&#x27;t put up a fight because nobody told them to fight the President), they occupy the building and take representatives hostage. At this point in time there is no longer a democracy in the US. What happens after that is anybody&#x27;s guess; by my lights, probably the military leaders don&#x27;t the President, their troops mostly follow their orders, they retake the Capitol, restore power to Congress, and install Pence as President, followed by democracy being restored not long after by a quick 25th amendment or impeachment and removal. But it would be plausible that some number of the military&#x27;s leaders choose to back the President instead, or that an insufficient number of the troops follow their orders, resulting in either a successful coup or a protracted civil war.<p>The only thing that saved us from this was Trump&#x27;s cowardice.')
