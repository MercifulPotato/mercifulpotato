Nobody is working on it any more. (Someone tell me if I&#x27;m wrong.)<p>There is also the open-source SPARC-based LEON radiation-hardened processor line favoured by the European Space Agency, but I think they are looking at moving to RISC-V in the future.<p>Not only is OpenSPARC dead, I get the impression that &quot;ClosedSPARC&quot; is pretty dead too. After M8, Oracle laid off their CPU design team, there will be no successor to SPARC M8. Fujitsu was going to continue on, but, rumour has it, that they tried to buy SPARC off Oracle but couldn&#x27;t reach a deal (probably Oracle was asking for too much money) and after that they&#x27;ve decided to move away from SPARC towards ARM. So I doubt their latest SPARC CPU (SPARC64 XII) is going to have a successor either.<p>POWER&#x2F;AIX is a different situation from SPARC&#x2F;Solaris. Unlike Oracle, IBM is continuing to invest and we can expect new iterations in the future.<p>(I used to work for Oracle, but not in the Systems area, and this isn&#x27;t any non-public info, just stuff I&#x27;ve heard since I left.)')
