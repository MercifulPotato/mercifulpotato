Even better, what percentage of all business that run online ads get a positive return on their investment, and what is the average of that return.<p>My personal experience is that it is pretty hard to get consistently good performance running campaigns on FB or Google. It requires a lot of learning and a lot of trial and error. On top of that, they constantly push you to spend more by giving you dubious recommendations on how to “improve” your campaigns.
