I&#x27;m pretty sure that there are people who would count any measures to reduce obesity as fat shaming (i.e. &quot;cancelling fat culture&quot; or something ridiculous like that), and the discussion tends to get emotional very quickly.<p>I think we have fairly strong evidence that gay shaming doesn&#x27;t make people less gay (there are homosexuals even in places where that carries the death penalty). I don&#x27;t think we have equally strong evidence that telling people they&#x27;d look better and reduce their risk for cardiovascular disease if they lost weight doesn&#x27;t help (at least some of them) to actually do it. At least I&#x27;m not aware of any and I believe the confounding variables with anything related to nutrition are so numerous that gathering solid data is extremely difficult.')
