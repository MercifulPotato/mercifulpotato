I see mediasoup-client SDK in use, but that does not support P2P.\nHow many participants are supported by the app? WebRTC requires to re-encode each video stream, so there is a CPU limit for how many peers one can talk to.\nI noticed there is some kind of latency in ms next to each participant. How is that measured - time to the next peer or time to the presenter?')
