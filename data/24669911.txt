In Formula 1 racing they&#x27;ve been integrating sensors and transmitters for vital stats into the drivers&#x27; gloves.  This allows the medical team to see what&#x27;s going on as they&#x27;re driving out to the crash.  I believe they keep the gloves on if possible during patient transport so they can continue monitoring.<p>I imagine being able to provide a doctor with historical data on your vitals can be extremely beneficial.  Taking your vitals while you&#x27;re sitting in a clinic doesn&#x27;t give the full picture.  What does your heart rate mean at that time if they don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s normal for you?  What if your temp is not high enough to be considered a fever, but it&#x27;s elevated 3+ degrees higher than typical for you?  Of course the accuracy of the sensor could be called into question, but if it&#x27;s precise enough you can still use it to analyze trends and anomalies.')
