How will your business operate once the government is down?<p>Let&#x27;s dispatch with the second one first. Even if you bulldozed the entire city of DC and everyone who works there was permanently relocated to the North Pole by Santa Claus to make toys for little children forever, there would still be a government because there is a constitutional process for electing or hiring some other people to do it.<p>So what should platforms do about this? That&#x27;s too narrow a question. It&#x27;s what should society do about this? Step one, arrest the people breaking the law. Violence and calls for violence are illegal. At which point it&#x27;s not clear that we even need a step two, because then the relevant people are in jail.')
