Gov&#x27;t acquisition law has become so complex, yet has one single constraint in mind with every update:<p>Protect and enable small and disadvantaged businesses.<p>It&#x27;s not perfect, in many new ways inefficient, but seems to do its job.<p>But what is the constraint we need when it comes to propagating information? It&#x27;s not as objectively clear as the acquisition case.')
