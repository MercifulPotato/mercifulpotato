Another way of saying this is that Python opcodes are very complex, and the cost of executing them dwarfs the cost of dispatching them. Another analogy I give is that executing Python is more similar to rendering HTML than it is to executing JS -- it&#x27;s more of a description of what the runtime should do rather than an explicit step-by-step account of how to do it.<p>Pyston&#x27;s performance improvements come from speeding up the C code, not the Python code. When people say &quot;why doesn&#x27;t Pyston use [insert favorite JIT technique here]&quot;, my question is whether that technique would help speed up C code. I think this is the most fundamental misconception about Python performance: we spend our energy trying to JIT C code, not Python code. This is also why I am not very interested in running Python on pre-existing VMs, since that will only exacerbate the problem in order to fix something that isn&#x27;t really broken.')
