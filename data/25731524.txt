E.g. consider the following code (in Kotlin, but hopefully still readable):<p><pre><code>  fun rotateKeys() {\n    publishNewKey(key = generateKey(), timestamp = now())\n    schedule(::rotateKeys, 1, TimeUnit.HOUR)\n  }\n</code></pre>\nif `generateKey` and `publishNewKey` take around ~1s then you&#x27;ll observe exactly this behaviour - the timestamps will start drifting from some original value.')
