Personally I choose to believe that the theory is just incomplete because nobody can even define what a &quot;measurement&quot; really is, meaning in which cases what we do is a &quot;measurement&quot; and in which cases it is not a &quot;measurement&quot;. I also think that this is what people like Feynman refer to when they say things like &quot;nobody understands QM&quot;, it&#x27;s actually &quot;nobody understands the wave function collapse&quot;, the rest is just maths.')
