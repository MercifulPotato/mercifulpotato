These edicts preserved in museums throughout India. History is done, through primary sources not quoting your favorite secondary sources or top level wikipedia articles.<p>As a Buddhist, whose traditions were destroyed, this level of Holocaust denial is mind-numbing.  I didn&#x27;t understand the reason behind the refusal to acknowledge the Holocaust visited by the Turkmen Islamic invaders (not Persian!!) upon the Indic traditions. Millennia old traditions wiped out, monasteries burnt and traces of whole civilizations erased. But I now realize there is something primal in Human nature which wants to bury Holocausts like the ones inflicted upon the Jews in Europe, the Armenian genocide, the Congo Holocaust. It allows us to pretend human nature is benign and nurturing. Your denial of the Mughal&#x2F;Turkmen atrocities is just another facet of that human nature.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;VertigoWarrior&#x2F;status&#x2F;1315211390311755776" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;VertigoWarrior&#x2F;status&#x2F;131521139031175577...</a>')
