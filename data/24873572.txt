Google Play Music (GPM) launched in 2011.  To get music on here, I&#x27;m guessing that team had to sign contracts with the various publishers and record studios.  The onboarding and licensing terms of those were likely entirely around this music streaming service.<p>Then you have Youtube.  It&#x27;s been a video hub for anything, and other those 9 years since GPM launched, it has become a place where lots of people listen to music (watching music videos or the like).  You have companies like Vevo that publish music content there.  I&#x27;d guess Youtube has different contracts with those companies that have evolved over time about how music can be played.<p>So over these past 9 years, 2 products that had little overlap, have started to overlap more and more.  As youtube expanded, it started butting into GPM&#x27;s world.  That likely was odd for Google for contracts and licensing of that content.  Youtube Music (YTM) likely allows them to do it all under one silo now.  Plus, YTM lets you do background music or videos, which is not something you could ever really do with GPM.')
