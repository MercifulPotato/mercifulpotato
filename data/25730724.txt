If I imagine myself maintaining a server and I learn it’s being used for death threats and coup plannings, I would tell them to stop doing that or I’m shutting them down. And then if they didn’t do it I would immediately revoke their access. I don’t know about everyone else on this site but I wasn’t put on this planet to design and build tools for terrorists and extremists. I’ve been on Parler and it’s disgusting. The public doesn’t want it to be on AWS and AWS doesn’t want it on AWS. There’s no reason they should be forced to host it.')
