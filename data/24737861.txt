Compiling multiple independent headers is very hard, though.<p>Are you sure this is the case? my interpretation of clang&#x27;s documentation does not confirm this. From what I understand, the at the very least headers are pre-parsed to an AST. At best, they are fully precompiled. I don&#x27;t see mentions of restrictions on the number or nesting of headers.<p>&gt; The C preprocessor is a fundamental design problem.<p>Come on, this is a huge overstatement. While I can agree that a textual replacement based preprocessor is not the sexiest of things, it does have the advantage of being pretty much limitless, simple to grasp, and implement.')
