I believe that one day programs will look like factory floors or cities. They will produce and consume physical analogues for values and types, which you can pick up and examine. Want to debug a function? Strap on your VR headset, teleport into its physically reified room and watch the execution. Tinker with the pipeline in real time.<p>Iâ€™ve been dreaming about this forever, and there have been many attempts, but with remote work and VR going mainstream I think someone will eventually build something usable and scalable.')
