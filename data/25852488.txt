It seems to me if you&#x27;re in a situation where you truly depend on such a commitment, you should be paying for a contract with someone, not hoping for the best.  Had Red Hat not been supporting CentOS for over 6 years, it may have fallen apart even sooner.  Who knows.<p>So while this is disruptive and bound to be upsetting, Red Hat are still being quite generous with their new offerings.  And as far as I know, they are not standing in the way of CentOS replacements such as Rocky[0] or Lenix[1].<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rockylinux.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rockylinux.org&#x2F;</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.projectlenix.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.projectlenix.org&#x2F;</a>')
