As others have noted, e2e was a novelty at the time, not a norm, and the platform itself was extremely new (less than a year old), and their stated reason for this was to protect against weak client RNG, which in retrospect sounds like a weak reason, but looking back at the news of 2013, this was right around the time the Snowden leaks caused everyone to believe RDRAND could indeed be compromised, so &quot;client having state-compromised RNG&quot; was indeed something on everyone&#x27;s mind.<p>Further, the fact that this was caught so quickly is in some sense a vindication of Telegram&#x27;s model - even in its infancy when it had orders of magnitude fewer users, the fact that the client was open source allowed someone to quickly spot a vulnerability.<p>The verdict? IMO Telegram secret chats are probably secure (90% certain), but if I were plotting a murder or something, I wouldn&#x27;t do it over a smartphone app anyway. There&#x27;s just too many leaky, complex layers in the stack, some of which aren&#x27;t even open, and quite dubiously so. If security is a life-or-death situation for you, you&#x27;d be a fool to use any smartphone app.')
