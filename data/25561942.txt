I&#x27;m an example to illustrate a point.  The point is actually about the economic rationality of centralized food production - whether it is more efficient for one person to cook for many, or for each person to cook for themselves, <i>in aggregate</i>.  Economics doesn&#x27;t care about individual people; it cares about incentives, efficiency, and the behavior of abstract firms in response to those.<p>The rest of my post was about specific ways that the behavior of individual firms (using myself as an example) may diverge from what the economic model predicts, specifically because of transaction costs.  That and a counterfactual (Taiwan) where these transaction costs don&#x27;t exist, to illustrate how behavior then converges on what economics would predict.')
