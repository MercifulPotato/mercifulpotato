The lack of action on the part of the government to restrict and hold corporations to the same level as the government is supposedly held by the constitution seems intentional.<p>Its a backdoor way around the constitutional restrictions. AKA the government can&#x27;t restrict free speech or search your house everyday, but its going to allow everyone else to restrict and search your house for the same effect. Given the close ties between the leaders &amp; .001%, the result is the same. It won&#x27;t matter to you when you get charged with a crime you didn&#x27;t commit whether the government was tracking your phone or the phone company reports your phone to the government. The result is the same.')
