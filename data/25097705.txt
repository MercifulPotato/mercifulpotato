The point is that not <i>all</i> old methods are great. Fields move forward one funeral at a time, and there do remain a lot of aging researchers who are stuck in the past. This is not to say that every old researcher is doing a bad job or that every military historian is doing a bad job... it just seems to be the field that has resisted progress the most.<p>I obviously don&#x27;t have a full view of the field, but I do know a few military history faculty in their 30s and they don&#x27;t view themselves as pariahs. They also scream at their laptops when terrible scholarship ends up flying off the bookshelves because bad military history sells like hotcakes.')
