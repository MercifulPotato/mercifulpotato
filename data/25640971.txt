The short answer: is because it works.<p>If they send 5k emails out, asking for $2k, all they need is for a small percentage to fall for it.<p>They know how much effort to put in to get a specific return.<p>Why can&#x27;t that be the same idea here? Pick out the ones who don&#x27;t ask questions, or take 2 seconds to Google something, etc. Whip them into a frenzy. Then steer them to a specific site. Or to donate. Or even just start following whomever wrote this out, to be convinced to donate somewhere later.')
