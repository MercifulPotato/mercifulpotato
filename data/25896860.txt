I have isolated for a year now, wearing masks and not meeting anyone.<p>My day consists of making a coffee, joining the morning stand up call at 7:30 and then grinding through the day until itâ€™s 17:00.\nI leave the apartment to buy couple of beers not enough to get me wasted but enough to get me numb.<p>This repeats every single day. I cant get rest. At all. I am a prisoner in my apartment.Every little noise makes me realize that there is no way I can rest at home.<p>I have not met my parents for a year now. They say I should.That this pandemic is fake and they are not scared.<p>They do know this pandemic is real but dont care anymore. Staying at home all day and not meeting with anyone is not life worth living.<p>I had been tested for covid 20 times already. Some cheap AGs some expensive PCRs. I had to do it because the government said I had to. I never had any symptoms. Never met with anyone at all.For some tests I had to pay myself.I can still afford it. Still. But for how long?<p>I keep hearing how we just have to wait a little longer. How a bunch of private corporations will make this go away.<p>Unless maybe it wont go away because there is a new strain because we have waited too long to roll out the vaccines.<p>I am ready to take my life back. No matter what happens next I am not, nor my parents are,going to live like this.<p>Whatever it takes I am taking my life back.')
