So you have your ecommerce store charging in EUR, and you pay with your Monzo&#x2F;Starling&#x2F;Revolut whatever and get the interbank rate to GBP. How is the store going to pass costs onto consumers in a way other than shipping costs? You can&#x27;t use currency because the bank has given you the interbank rate (and cut off the card&#x27;s conversion fee).<p>Also btw if you let your card processor convert currency for you they&#x27;re going to be even worse off as an EU store owner - Stripe charges 2% extra to convert your currency for example. So your fees are now going to be over 3.5%.. best to leave it in EUR.<p>You need to run an ecommerce store to understand its very hard to ask a customer their country first. Unless you&#x27;re Apple..<p>Also when you run an ecommerce store you want US customers too, so your UK problem is equivalent to your US problem.')
