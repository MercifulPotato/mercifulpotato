(Our max bottle is $14ish wholesale). I run a brewery that also serves wine and our bottle loss is a significant enough percentage of our total wine sales, because of our low throughput. It commonly happens that a bottle goes &quot;bad&quot; with only 1 pour from the bottle thus returning a loss on that bottle.<p>Even with the bottles that leave two pours, at expiration, we are making a few dollars but not enough to keep the lights on.')
