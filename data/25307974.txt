Make it clear how to get out. (Don’t do what vim does.) If your program hangs on network I&#x2F;O etc, always make Ctrl-C still work. If it’s a wrapper around program execution where Ctrl-C can’t quit (SSH, tmux, telnet, etc), make it clear how to do that. For example, SSH allows escape sequences with the ~ escape character.<p>I find it confusing that vim is considered less discoverable here than SSH.  In either case, you can find the information in the manual (not ideal, but a baseline).  In the case of vim, when you hit ctrl-c it tells you how to leave for real.  So far as I&#x27;m aware, there&#x27;s no real way to discover the magic ~ invocations in SSH except resorting to the manual or exhaustively trying every key combo with no evidence that you&#x27;re on the right track or that there&#x27;s even a track to be on.<p>Also, vim <i>is</i> (in part) a wrapper around program execution.')
