Having similar magnitudes of total throughput (bandwidth) isn&#x27;t enough to make RAM and SSDs comparable and thus remove the need for more RAM. Random access latency with basically no queue depth is very important for total performance. Certainly, SSDs are far better at this than hard drives were... but, SSDs still serve a different purpose.<p>Intel&#x27;s Optane SSDs are based on a completely different technology than other SSDs, and their low queue depth latency is <i>significantly</i> better than any other SSDs out there, but good luck talking Apple into using more Intel stuff just when they&#x27;re trying to switch away, and even then... just having some more real RAM would be better for most of these creator&#x2F;pro workloads.')
