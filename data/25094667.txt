For a long time I got by with my resume just covering achievements at a high level without any numbers. Every time I asked for resume advice, people suggested adding more numbers to it. Having worked on building up a lot of infrastructure stuff from the ground up, I never really had a great way to describe my job with a handful of numbers because the impact was the creation of the project rather than increasing&#x2F;decreasing&#x2F;reducing&#x2F;whatever metrics. Eventually I caved in to the trend but this led to an interesting encounter: I had one behavioral interview where the interviewer really ripped apart some of the numbers -- what does &quot;growing user base by 50%&quot; mean out of context if you only have 10 users, how accurately can &quot;decreased load time by 75%&quot; actually capture the scope of your work if it&#x27;s a 5 minute change, etc.? Numbers can be great to tell a story, but it seems like often time that story is either a distraction from the day-to-day reality of a job or just a gamed metric of some kind.<p>This trend really sucks because there&#x27;s a definite pressure (at least early in one&#x27;s career) to pick up tasks at work that look good on a resume but may be low-impact IRL (e.g. rather than adding a new feature that people will pay for, let&#x27;s just whittle away at latency that&#x27;s already fast enough for our users).')
