By collecting it when its online it makes it possible to hand over to lawyers so they know what to go subponea.  At least once a video I saved probably personally saved me from a frivolous lawsuit (attorney fired his lying client after sending me a threat letter which I responded to with an archived video).<p>I sometimes use youtube-dl to buffer longer pieces which I&#x27;m watching which might suffer from infuriating connection interruptions.<p>I don&#x27;t use youtube-dl to save copyrighted music (except incidentally), among other reasons: the audio on youtube is often pretty low quality.')
