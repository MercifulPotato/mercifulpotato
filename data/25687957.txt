All wolf packs are strictly hierarchical. Meaning there is no wolf pack without a hierarchy.<p>&gt; A typical wolf pack is formed of a couple and their offsprings.<p>Which forms a hierarchy.<p>&gt; The idea that wolf pack have complex fixed hierarchical structure<p>Who said they had a &quot;complex&quot; &quot;fixed&quot; hierarchical structure? It&#x27;s rather simple and obvious.<p>&gt; Wolves are however both social and used to complex interactions involving social dominance.<p>&quot;complex&quot;, &quot;social dominance&quot;. Which is it? You say they don&#x27;t have complex hierarchy and then claim complex interactions involving social dominance. What do you think social dominance exists to create?<p>Wolf packs have hierarchy like human families have hierarchy.')
