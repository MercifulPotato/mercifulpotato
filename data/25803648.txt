When anything is done, we will be taxed for it. $12B was handed over to contractors for work done on Yucca Mountain.<p>Wikipedia:<p>&gt; &quot;US court of appeals ruled that nuclear utilities may stop paying into the nuclear waste ... The fee ended May 16, 2014.&quot;<p>&gt; &quot;Lacking an operating repository, the federal government initially paid utility companies somewhere between $300 and $500 million per year in compensation for failing to comply with the contract it signed to take the spent nuclear fuel by 1998. For the ten years after 2015 it is estimated to cost taxpayers $24 billion in payments from the Judgment Fund. The Judgment Fund is not subject to budget rules...&quot;<p>So, $47b was collected from ratepayers for extra-high-cost power, and sent to the govt. Now, taxpayers are <i>paying out</i> $2.4 billion, every year, directly to nuke operators, who pocket it. ($2.4b would buy a pretty big solar farm.)<p>When something is determined to do about the waste, there will be no nuke ratepayers left, at several times the cost of renewables -- or operators, except those kept open to collect their $2.4b. Instead, taxpayers will pick up the bill. Again.')
