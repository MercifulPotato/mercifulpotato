I am more concerned about communism actually because it has a veneer of respectability that makes it potentially more dangerous than fascism in the current climate, although I do believe that they&#x27;re both evil. I am not talking about the Orwellian double speak that equates antifa the extremist group, with anti-fascism.<p>It&#x27;s not my conclusion that there are no fine people on either side, I was simply outlining the absurdity of thinking that there were only fine people on one side, given the visible existence of political extremist groups on both sides that many protesters (on both sides) overlooked when they attended the protests in order to voice their political opinion about what should happen with the statue.')
