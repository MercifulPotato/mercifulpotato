Item(by='rektide', descendants=None, kids=[24761127], score=None, time=1602540852, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24759031, text='How do you feel about the author&#x27;s conclusion?<p>&gt; I don’t want to make this blog post a rant against side projects. In fact, I’m advocating the exact opposite. Continue to do as many side projects as ever, code on nights and weekends if you want too, but don’t think about how they could be useful to you to get a new job.<p>IMHO, that&#x27;s over-doing it, but fairly on target. Like dating, one wants to be an interesting person. Your projects, to me, demonstrate that you are an interesting person, but as per the topics of collaboration &amp; communication that the author starts with, while yes I want to work with interesting people, it&#x27;s not what I&#x27;ve found to be the primary nor even all-that-distinguishing characteristic of hirees. Somewhat sadly; keep hacking! ;)')
