But we also have an Outlander PHEV. I wouldn&#x27;t call the Volt a PHEV or include it in the same category as the Outlander at all. The Volt is an electric car that happens to have an ICE as backup. the Outlander PHEV is a soft hybrid with a bigger battery. It&#x27;s pretty much impossible to drive it without using the gas engine, even when you hit the &quot;EV&quot; button. And from my impression that&#x27;s the case with pretty much every PHEV other than the Volt.<p>But we needed a people mover that fits kids, dogs, skis, etc. for longer trips. So that was the best compromise.<p>It&#x27;s a shame they killed the Volt and screwed up in marketing it. Such an amazing piece of engineering. I don&#x27;t like GM&#x27;s products generally, but I would have bought an Equinox type vehicle with a Voltec drivetrain and paid good money for it.')
