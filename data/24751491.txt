The corresponding definition of Spotify Content is:<p>&gt; Spotify Content‚Äù means any content, data, information or material made available through the Spotify Platform, Spotify Service or by Spotify. This may include, among other things, sound recordings, short-form videos, cover art, musical works, artist biographies, song lyrics, metadata, playlists, and user data<p>So it seems that the list of songs that the user &quot;likes&quot; is considered Spotify Content. Does any body know how far this goes? What if one tool accesses the API to extract the list of user&#x27;s songs into a CSV file, and then a separate tool is used to automatically &quot;like&quot; a list of songs from a CSV file in a competing platform?<p>Does Spotify really own the (Artist, Song) tuples that make up a list of songs?')
