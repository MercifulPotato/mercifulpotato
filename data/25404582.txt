It was pretty popular in its day (I&#x27;m actually working on a new version at the moment).<p>Anyway, the way the tiles were drawn was that it gave each player an array of tiles of the same numbers that was just enough for how many turns they&#x27;d end up having, but it shuffled the order of each array at random.<p>Even though that was the case, I often got players saying the game was cheating, and the computer always got high numbers and they always got low numbers, even on easy. I even had one player claim they counted the 20s and the opponent got more (although it&#x27;s possible to increase the numbers on the tile by placing one of the same team&#x27;s tile next to it, so I&#x27;m guessing they only counted at the end of the game and didn&#x27;t reinforce the tiles as much).<p>But it&#x27;s literally not possible according to the code. And it wasn&#x27;t a bug either, I tested it pretty thoroughly, and played the game a ton myself. And plenty of other players never had an issue with it too.<p>That was when I learned that people in general tend to not be very good judges of randomness. And I&#x27;ve seen many examples since that reinforce that.<p>As a matter of fact, I was actually working on a dynamic draw mechanic for the new game, where the further behind in score you were, the more of a boost to the numbers it would draw from you, to give you more of a chance to get caught back up (and vice versa, if you were ahead). So basically like this dynamic difficulty thing.<p>I knew not everyone would enjoy that so I was planning on having it be something you could turn on or off in the Options menu. And it&#x27;s not something to get more money off the player, just something that might improve their experience.<p>The game will probably be a paid for game to begin with, or on mobile it might be free but you have to deal with ads unless you pay $5 to get rid of them.')
