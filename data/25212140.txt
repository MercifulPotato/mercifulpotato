Of course that assumes you, to whom I&#x27;m replying, are actually tall.<p>It&#x27;d be like getting football advice from a 190-pound wide receiver when you weigh closer to 300. Some of the advice will still be good, but it does ignore a key difference, and you&#x27;d be better off hearing advice from offensive linemen, who&#x27;d be in your weight class.')
