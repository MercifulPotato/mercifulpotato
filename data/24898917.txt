(That was handy!)<p>And Expect blew me away back in the day of distributed systems management (I&#x27;m more of a programmer than a sys-admin, so I guess it would even be more important to those folks?).<p>The whole &quot;There is no math, only strings&quot; thing, still irritates me to this day, but I suspect you are right - this might be tied to the simplicity and strengths.<p>IDK. Food for though. Interesting piece. I think that I&#x27;m the only person I know that still dabbles in TCL after about 15~20 years ago (maybe I need to get out more), but it certainly rocks where it rocks! It is always surprising and pleasant to see a modern piece on it.')
