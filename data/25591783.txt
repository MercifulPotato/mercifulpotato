Self-driving cars are ridiculously complicated black-box program with at most software fail-safes that are itself more complicated than one can reason about so the only thing remaining is empirical testing in real-world situations. And every single bugfix have to be retested substantially as it can just as easily make something else worse - and I don’t feel confident about today’s “self-driving” cars')
