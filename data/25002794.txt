Indeed, in a vacuum world it would be very much a problem that needs to be addressed. Right now however, there are ipv6 addresses in use that use the other end of the spectrum already. During the migration period it won&#x27;t be a problem either. In the far future, where most traffic uses the new scheme, one can hand out temporary ranges from the traditional ipv6 assignments to high-traffic ASs.<p>And even if you don&#x27;t do such measures, the rest of the address space won&#x27;t be a &quot;complete waste forever&quot;, one will just have to identify the implementations which have problems with these addresses and change them. It&#x27;s a solvable technical task like any other.')
