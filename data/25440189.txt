Item(by='WA', descendants=None, kids=[25440613], score=None, time=1608106279, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25436450, text='&gt; If the same person registers two accounts with two email addresses, but provides the same information for both, would you know that they&#x27;re the same person?<p>Probably. I find it odd that Apple didn&#x27;t choose words that are already clear with respect to privacy laws such as GDPR. The GDPR doesn&#x27;t talk about identity. It defines personal data or personally identifiable information (PII). If you collect this data, you&#x27;re subject to GDPR compliance.<p>Apple has a weird phrasing of this. You apparently can collect an email address, but not link it to an identity, which is different from collecting an email address and linking it to an identity. It&#x27;s unclear to me what they mean by this and what &quot;identity&quot; is supposed to mean.<p>It&#x27;s way easier to say: an email address is a piece of data that could identify a person, hence you must treat it carefully and comply with GDPR laws (collect it with consent only, make sure to delete it when you&#x27;re done, user&#x27;s right to change PII and user&#x27;s right to get info about everything they have on you).')
