You can choose to support hardware that supports your platform. You can choose to buy local rather than carrots flown in from South Africa; wtf Waitrose! You can donate your time to helping people hoping it makes the world slightly better.<p>Not playing games that go out of their way to force me to run Windows is <i>my</i> moral stand here. I get that it&#x27;s not for you, and it&#x27;s not for a lot of other Windows gamers, and  it might even be stopping the Year of the Linux Desktop...<p>But my view is <i>this too shall pass</i>. Trusted Clients are bound to fail, as they have again and again and again. They&#x27;re running out of options. Engines with action integrity checks are the future.
