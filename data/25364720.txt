It would be more free both for publishers and consumers, in my opinion.<p>Right now we are all stuck trying to act like megaplatforms can house everyone fairly. They can&#x27;t. Current events <i>prove</i> it. Facebook tried, Reddit tried, Twitter tried, and Youtube tried, and all ended up taking editorial stances that are often construed as partisan.<p>If we had a competitive landscape of smaller platforms, everyone could have a platform that works for them, with editorial decisions that work for them. This could all be decided by the free market instead of everyone collectively wringing their hands about freedom when a tech giant makes a stand on misinformation.<p>I don&#x27;t know how society can deal with the tech giant&#x27;s moats, but I think that&#x27;s the real demon to slay.')
