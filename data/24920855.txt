From a brief look it seems counting is not so clearly defined as mathematic skills expected by various milestones. [1]<p>For example,<p>&gt; Pre-school - Kindergarten<p>During this stage, children should begin to:<p>- count aloud<p>- compute the number of objects in a group<p>- understand that a particular number of objects has a fixed value despite the size or nature of those objects<p>- understand relative size and be able to sort objects by size and shape<p>- follow a sequence of two- and three-step commands<p>- be able to perform simple addition and subtraction computations<p>I believe my cat Pip only can only do the “follow a sequence” ability of these mathematical skills, so even if he can “count” he has a ways to go in developing his math skills.<p>Fortunately, lack of mathematical skill does not get in the way of my adoration for the animal.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;wgbh&#x2F;misunderstoodminds&#x2F;mathbasics.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;wgbh&#x2F;misunderstoodminds&#x2F;mathbasics.html</a>')
