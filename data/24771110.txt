Item(by='dont__panic', descendants=None, kids=[24773916, 24772277], score=None, time=1602628714, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24768018, text='I&#x27;ve replaced my 2016 SE&#x27;s battery once through Apple ($29 battery lawsuit program) and once myself ($29 and an hour of my time, via iFixit). So the whole phone cost me something like $460 over 4.5 years.<p>I&#x27;m looking at the 12 Mini.<p>- It doesn&#x27;t have a headphone jack, so I&#x27;ll have to buy an adapter to use my chonky set of headphones with it.<p>- Apple phased out TouchID, and my state is experiencing it&#x27;s worst-ever COVID numbers currently. So I&#x27;ll just have to enter my passcode whenever I&#x27;m wearing a mask now, which is something like 40% of the time.<p>- It comes with a lighting&lt;-&gt;USB-C cable, but not a wall plug. I don&#x27;t have any USB-C wall plugs. Am I supposed to only charge this thing off my work laptop, or should I buy a $20 USB-C wall plug from Apple? My current lightning cable is fraying 4.5 years in so I need a replacement.<p>- The phone is advertised at $699, but it&#x27;s actually $730 if I want to use it on non-Verizon&#x2F;non-AT&amp;T (I use Google Fi). Huh?<p>- 64GB is the same storage size as my current SE, which is just a little too small for me to store local Spotify songs (lots of trips in the mountains with crappy signal) and podcasts. So I&#x27;ll have to step up $50 for the 128GB version if I want this to last me any reasonable number of years.<p>So I can either use my current SE, which is still treating me great... or I can cough up $780 + tax for the phone + $20 for a wall wart + $20 for a headphone adapter. So like $900 total.<p>Maybe I&#x27;ll pass on this one.')
