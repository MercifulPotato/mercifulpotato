Few of the sources were named with little justification for the anonymity. If they are ex-employee, what is the fear? Even about a court case, Huawei denies they were sued, yet the article doesn’t address whether court records dispute that.<p>As for the terrible working conditions, the article takes an absurdly long time to make a few tepid points. Chinese expats don’t mingle with the locals. They are rotated if they do develop ties with the local population.<p>The articles asserts that employees are handcuffed by payment in shares. When leaving the company, they must sell their shares. The articles says this robs them of their retirement. How? Must they be sold at a loss? When my employer matched my retirement contributions in shares, I was pissed that I <i>couldn’t</i> sell until I quit.<p>Again, I would love to hate Huawei, but this article isn’t doing it for me.')
