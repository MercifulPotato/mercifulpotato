Item(by='roenxi', descendants=None, kids=[25556156, 25558592], score=None, time=1609110203, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25551895, text='&gt; During and after the economic collapse of 2007-2009 I wondered who was at fault; who to blame. I kept waiting for a clear answer to &quot;THE root cause&quot;.<p>Well, there can be a difference between &quot;who is at fault&quot; and &quot;THE root cause&quot;. Quite a large difference, potentially.<p>In the case of &#x27;07-&#x27;09, maybe nobody was at fault (seems plausible) but there was a very neat root cause. The government handed out a lot of money to people who shouldn&#x27;t have gotten it, the people responsible were largely protected from bankruptcy and the system forced to reform largely as it was. The people who took excessive risk earned an excessive reward - they should have all gone bankrupt. The financial system should actually have changed, and people who made productive investments and didn&#x27;t take risk should have become ascendant. Instead we have the same old crowd playing the same old game.<p>Disabling the major feedback mechanism of capitalism is about as root-causal as can be gotten. Nobody in particular chose to disable it though, it was a consensus decision among the powerful.')
