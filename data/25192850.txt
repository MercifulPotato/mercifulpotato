According to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cutter_Laboratories#Cutter_incident" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cutter_Laboratories#Cutter_inc...</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nejm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1056&#x2F;NEJMp048180" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nejm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1056&#x2F;NEJMp048180</a>, the faulty production applied to 120.000 doses of vaccine, which lead to 56 cases of paralysis (0.046%) among vaccinated children. These sources further mention &quot;the exposures led to an epidemic of polio in the families and communities of the affected children, resulting in a further 113 people paralyzed and 5 deaths&quot;, which tells me that your number of 250 probably includes cases caused by such transmission. This is of course reasonable when discussing the total damage caused by the vaccine, but this number can not be compared to the incidence of paralysis for a single infection, as you do.<p>You would also have to include further transmissions caused by wild polio if you would like to make such a comparison.<p>&gt; still patently false. pfft. Perhaps false under some assumptions, definitely not &quot;patently false&quot;.<p>Even with your own calculation, which is inflated by also including transmission within the community for the vaccine but not for wild polio, the vaccine was very much comparable to wild polio (0.125% versus approx. 0.1%). Without vaccination, polio would usually infect virtually all children. So even with your own inflated assumptions it&#x27;s false that the vaccine was worse than polio.<p>So under which assumptions would it not be false?')
