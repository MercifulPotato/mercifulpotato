Item(by='pjmorris', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602536490, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24755271, text='&gt; Are you implying the “winners” know what they are doing with technology is immoral but are willfully casting it as moral just because they are in a position to do so?<p>Probably more the latter (&#x27;casting it as moral because they are in a position to do so&#x27;) than the former (&#x27;know what they are doing&#x27;)... IMO, most people, most of the time, think they&#x27;re doing the right thing, from their perspective. However I&#x27;d want to leave room for the idea that they may not be weighing, or even conscious of, systemic moral and ethical factors.<p>I think I am more, silently, responding to your second comment,<p>&gt; That’s an interesting systematic perspective if you can get to the view that morals&#x2F;ethics are subjective and a response to social standing.<p>I tend to view morals and ethics as part of an objective Platonic (technically, Judeo-Christian) ideal. So the &#x27;subjective&#x27; description rubs me the wrong way, though it is an accurate description of the observed effects.')
