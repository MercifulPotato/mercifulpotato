So far, the stuff before the courts have mostly been thrown out due to lack of evidence. Which supports the idea of due diligence and that the system works.<p>The second is whether the system itself is compromised. The problem here is that one can keep irrationally escalating accusations saying that the watchmen of the watchmen of the watchmen are all in cahoots. And we know from stuff like flat earth society that there are people willing to believe anything. The danger here is that if you have a large portion of the population and their political representatives believing that the system is rigged, that they might as well do everything in their power to rig it in their favor, which erodes the pillars of democracy.')
