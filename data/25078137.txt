That&#x27;s a lot! It&#x27;s still less than the  510.1 million km² of earth&#x27;s land mass, but it&#x27;s a lot more than the ~10.2 million km² of urban space. Presumably this is enough to cover every human habitation, so in principle, it might be possible to kill everyone with radiation from existing nuclear weapons.<p>While there is ~500m km2 of land on the planet, only about 60m km2 is habitable (less desert, poles, mountains etc). Not <i>in</i>habited, <i>habitable</i>. So yes that&#x27;s not only sufficient to wipe out all population centers, it&#x27;s double the amount needed to wipe out all locations on earth capable of sustaining human life.<p>The ecosystem destruction alone, let alone spectrum social, ecological, agricultural and atmospheric effects that total nuclear war would cause, pretty much guarantee a wipeout of large mammals from the planet a-la the Cretaceous-Paleogene exctinction. In fairness, the impact from that event was equivalent to 100 million of the largest bombs we have ever made, detonated in one spot. But it&#x27;s destruction was global, total, and immediate. The survivors of the first hours of a total nuclear war won&#x27;t have such a quick death to look forward to.')
