As it stands, we&#x27;ve all become digital hoarders as the up-front cost to accumulate stuff like photos and documents goes to zero. The problem is you&#x27;re dumping LOTS of cost into the future.<p>Photos are a big thing for me.<p>Initially, I used applications (Picasa and later iPhoto) to tag photos with metadata to indicate importance, etc. Applications tend to have zero respect for to commitment to preserving metadata. So by the time my kids are going to college, my family is going to have 200,000+ photos alone. What&#x27;s the point? Am I getting pleasure (or to borrow from the Netflix organizational guru &quot;Does it bring joy?&quot;) from this data?<p>Personally, my new strategy, having been burned by the tools is a pyramid:<p>1. Print and Frame&#x2F;preserve important or significant pictures (Say 20-30&#x2F;year)<p>2. Curate others that we care about. (Say 500&#x2F;year or 5-8%)<p>3. Purge stuff of no value. (Say 2500&#x2F;year or ~25%)<p>Based on my &quot;performance&quot; today, if I keep at it, I&#x27;ll be able to reduce the rate of growth.')
