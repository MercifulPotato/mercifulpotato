It&#x27;s all about the engine design. If we are going after rules of thumb, I would say that if the car is turbocharged, it will most definitely run better with higher octane. Although my turbo VW can run with regular fuel, it will just change timing and make less power.<p>I have a 78 Fiat with a carburetor however, that definitely needs 91 or higher.')
