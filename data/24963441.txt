Item(by='yorwba', descendants=None, kids=[24963689, 24963686], score=None, time=1604272995, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24962669, text='&gt; It is not possible to read at the get go, but after some practice, yes, any one can read old Tamil.<p>The &quot;after some practice&quot; makes this a bit of a squishy claim. For example, Malayalam and Tamil split less than 1000 years ago and are both descendants of Old Tamil. I would be surprised if &quot;after some practice&quot; a Malayalam speaker couldn&#x27;t also read Old Tamil, or for that matter Modern Tamil (and vice versa for a Modern Tamil speaker learning Malayalam).<p>So is Tamil somehow older than Malayalam? I think not.')
