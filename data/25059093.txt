If you&#x27;re reading from one buffer and writing to another, those buffers can overlap in C or C++, but can&#x27;t in fortran, so a fortran compiler is allowed more leeway with the way instructions are ordered (and maybe elided? Not sure). In compute-intensive workloads, every little bit helps.')
