There will be a higher emphasis on building&#x2F;repairing relationships with allies in the region, so that American blood is not spilled (allies will help put boots on the ground, backed by American guarantees). How long this will continue and whether this strategy will continue regardless of the changes of leadership in the US is open to question, though.<p>As part of the &#x27;pivot to Asia&#x27; initiated by Obama, America has helped many neighbors of Israel make peace with it formally.
