I carry a notebook, some pens, a water bottle, snacks, warm clothes, and other things that might help on my journey. I&#x27;ll stop for coffee, museums, interesting scenery, sketching, etc.<p>These little adventures give me time to relax, reflect, do some exercise and explore my city. It&#x27;s thoroughly satisfying.')
