Item(by='ryan-duve', descendants=None, kids=[25486890], score=None, time=1608474468, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25486191, text='As someone coming from the other direction of this &quot;hack&quot;, I agree with the author&#x27;s point to match needs to hardware.<p>Since being introduced to Linux in high school in the early 2000s, I have had a penchant for bringing old computers back from the dead.  As a result, every laptop I have ever owned has been one that a friend or partner throws away when Windows gets slow.  Every 3-5 year old laptop I have found can be brought back to life with a new Ubuntu&#x2F;Mint install and Fluxbox.  Case in point: I&#x27;m typing this on a 2011 Pavillion, my main workstation.<p>Finally, in the last few months, I realized my up-to-decade-old computers have been holding me back.  Professionally, I do AI work on cloud resources and my personal projects have naturally ventured towards the same technologies.  Docker, Scikit, NLP.  My symmetric gigabit internet is bottlenecked by the ethernet card on my main workstation which maxes at 1% of that.<p>So I finally ordered a new laptop: 64 GB RAM, latest processor, dedicated graphics card to try my hand at CUDA locally, which is being assembled now.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is the &quot;start of buying new laptops&quot; for me, or if this one is going to last 10+ years, but I think it underlines the author&#x27;s point of identifying and aligning hardware with laptop requirements, especially as those things change.')
