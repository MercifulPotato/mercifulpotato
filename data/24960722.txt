Arson, theft, and storm damage is very common and the last thing they want is to get hit with a bunch of costly \nlawsuits from people who refused to insure themselves. Basically the same concept as renters insurance.<p>You usually don&#x27;t have to buy theirs though, you can buy more comprehensive policies online for less and just provide proof of insurance.')
