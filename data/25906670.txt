I&#x27;m wary of people who little-to-no experience with a certain &quot;thing&quot; who are absolutely certain they understand that &quot;thing&quot;.<p>But there seems to be this idea that I don&#x27;t like working with these people, but that&#x27;s not true. Most of these people are really good people who are good at their jobs, who want to be a force for good in the world, and they legitimately think they&#x27;re on the side of righteousness. They&#x27;re the modern day version of crusaders, frankly. And much like the crusaders of old their prejudices are borne from ignorance and their certainty is tempered by each other as they self-reinforce.')
