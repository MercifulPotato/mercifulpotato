Item(by='barrkel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606802596, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25260774, text='Sure, and there&#x27;s also functional composition (functional code has the same problem - what does map(f) return if f throws?).<p>I think this is covered by the abstraction-breaking nature of failure modes, though. If your BufferedReader exposed the underlying Reader&#x27;s failure modes, it&#x27;s not just any BufferedReader any more, it&#x27;s a BufferedReader&lt;MySpecialReader&gt;, and you don&#x27;t get runtime polymorphism. You can write more generics to keep the polymorphism in static-land, but then you lose the ability to make choices based on error types.<p>The incompatibility is between errors and abstraction, not simply a single instance of composition.')
