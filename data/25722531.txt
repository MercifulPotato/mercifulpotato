Say you start in ~&#x2F;Downloads&#x2F;foo and want to store the file in ~&#x2F;Downloads, then navigating up will have &quot;foo&quot; selected, with usually no blank space to un-select (so you&#x27;d need to do ctrl+click or something to that tune); clicking &quot;Save&quot; (or whatever) will then descend into that directory instead of saving, so just using the mouse, or not using any shortcuts, you really can&#x27;t do this.<p>That&#x27;s a degradation from 2.10, or 2.16, from time even before the 3.0.')
