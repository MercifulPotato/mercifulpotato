For a 2-year old paper, this is easily a top 1% most cited paper.<p>Take for example a retrospective look at 2017 NeurIPS papers done in 2019 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;wip&#x2F;77YrB" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;wip&#x2F;77YrB</a>).<p>You can disagree with how she and&#x2F;or Google has handled this whole situation, but please do not denigrate work that has been cited (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.google.com&#x2F;scholar?oi=bibs&amp;hl=en&amp;cites=14954608238029559254" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.google.com&#x2F;scholar?oi=bibs&amp;hl=en&amp;cites=14954...</a>) by papers accepted at the most competitive&#x2F;prestigious ML conferences.<p>EDIT: I also do not see how in good faith you can say that VentureBeat, a company who makes the bulk of its revenue from running conferences catering to C-suite execs who can shell out thousands of dollars for a ticket, is &quot;leftist&quot;.')
