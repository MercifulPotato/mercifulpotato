Itâ€™s actual roots in the African diaspora and the Caribbean</i><p>Roots lost in time and declining though. In modern times it&#x27;s Anglo-saxon, or African-American-Anglo-Saxon, but have little to nothing to do with Africa or the Caribbean.<p>If you put an African or Carribean and a African-American there are little cultural traits they share (cultural as in everyday life, outlook, worldview, etc. - African-Americans might still carry some traces of e.g. African music in the modern music they produce). But even eg. food is totally different.')
