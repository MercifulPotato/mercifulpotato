If someone gave you a gold coin, the imprint of the mint gave you a guarantee it actually was pure gold (rather than a cheaper mixture of gold and silver, as an example).<p>The problem with forgeries was that forgers made their money by minting coins that weighted less or contained cheaper metals, and then passing them off as genuine.<p>If this goes on for long enough, the coinage deteriorates, since the large amount of fake coins in circulation means that a coin could no longer be expected to contain its specific value in precious metal.<p>Lindybeige (youtuber) talks specifically about this at around 13 minutes in this video: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=R2paSGQRwvo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=R2paSGQRwvo</a>')
