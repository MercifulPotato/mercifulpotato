And I&#x27;m saying AGPL is de facto not free software, because ~100% of serious (even hobby) installations violate it, even if it&#x27;s free software de jure.<p>And independent of this I also think AGPL violates freedom 0. E.g. the AGPL explicitly forbids you from running a service combined with proprietary software. You are NOT allowed to run a service by combining AGPL software with a binary blob you don&#x27;t have source code to. How could this possibly be &quot;The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose&quot;?<p>If I&#x27;m not allowed to run X with Y, how is it &quot;as you wish, for any purpose&quot;?<p>&gt; have the option of negotiating a commercial license with the original developer.<p>Only if ALL contributors (aka copyright holders) agree to this.
