Almost all sites have moderation and for good reason. Besides all the spam and trolls good moderation helps build a community. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re all here, and also why I&#x27;m selective about what subreddits I join.<p>If a company is so powerful that their moderation policies are effectively censorship, then there is definitely a serious free speech concern. The solution is to break up the monopoly so that no one company is that powerful.')
