That includes not only Spotify, but also YouTube &quot;videos&quot; and free downloads from my website. The Spotify income covers my own Spotify subscription, which is nice, but I didn&#x27;t make the music for money&#x27;s sake. :)<p>And I realize the above may come off as judgemental, but that&#x27;s not my intent. I hope it can be understood as an observation and an anecdote, not an argument about what others should do.')
