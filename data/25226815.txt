Non-useful ones only disappear reliably if they&#x27;re selected against. Otherwise, you get goose bumps, or piloerection in humans: We don&#x27;t have enough hair over most of our bodies for erecting it to do any good, but we still have all the structures to erect it anyway, because none of our ancestors lost any of them even as they became useless.')
