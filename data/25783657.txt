It is not easy to find another blacksmith.  Without the right blacksmith, there can be no magic.<p>Magicians will be magicians, always hustling (bullshitting), but they will never have the value and job security of the blacksmith.  The blacksmith can see the fruits of her own labour, whilst the magician must lie to herself and others in order to claim the blacksmith&#x27;s value as her own.<p>If the blacksmith is good enough, she will earn the trust of management and management may consult the blacksmith in the selection of magicians.  Management may ask the blacksmith to interview magicians and seek her advice on the final hiring decision.<p>The blacksmith may not carry the &quot;prestige&quot; of the hustling, bullshitting magician but she can command a high salary and dictate her own working conditions.  This is only if management understands her value.  What the magician thinks of the blacksmith is irrelevant.<p>Reliable blacksmiths are hard to find.  Magicians are a dime-a-dozen.')
