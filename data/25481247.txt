I&#x27;m not saying that you should expect something in return when being kind to people. That&#x27;s not real altruism.<p>I&#x27;m more talking about when someone goes in the other direction and is notably <i>unkind</i>, inconsiderate, cold, exploitative, or otherwise disrespectful to you. That&#x27;s when it&#x27;s time to switch to a new strategy.<p>To me, ignoring a neighbor who greets you is pretty cold and disrespectful, but yeah, everyone has a different line when it comes to these things, and it depends a lot on context.')
