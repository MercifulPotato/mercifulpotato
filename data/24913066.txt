Sure mental energy is wasted playing games, but a lot of modern mathematics has arisen from the study of games... Consider:<p>- Game Theory<p>- Was the &quot;Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg&quot; not a fun puzzle of sorts?<p>- Was probability and statistics not founded on trying to hack gambling?<p>- Did knot theory start out with advanced applications in mind or people deep dive into making knots for religious reasons?<p>- How are Fermat&#x27;s last theorem, the Collatz Conjecture, Goldbachs conjecture, or the twin primes conjecture not unnatural, constrained environments?<p>I&#x27;d argue DeepBlue and AlphaGo and Watson &#x2F;are&#x2F; playing the game, just in a far more sophisticated manner, and our collective learnings as humans provide the foundation for academic endeavors. If you remember, the first variant of AlphaGo studied games played by expert humans.<p>Also, playing, understanding, and thinking about these games has been a boon to the AI community for decades. McCarthy has an article on the subject called &quot;Chess as the Drosophila of AI&quot;.<p>My point is that these things start off as games and puzzle divorced from a problem, as a pure pursuit of leisure or curiosity, and over time, perhaps millennia, these mental explorations bear fruit in the most surprising ways.')
