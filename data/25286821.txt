I think it should be regulated like everything else in the space, and it’s horrifying externalities like energy consumption and criminality should be internalized via taxation. Once it has the same constraints as traditional finance it offers nothing of value, and will wilt away on its own. Or it won’t. Whatever. Makes no difference to me, once the harms are mitigated. JMHO.<p>My point as always is if you trust your government you don’t need crypto - as trust is a massive optimization - and if you don’t, you have much bigger problems. Just ask the North Koreans.<p>The rest is but a fictional dramatization of what life under authoritarianism might be like, just you, your MacBook Pro and your GPU cluster against the man, smashing TVs, killing TV repair men and scribbling down hashes. It just doesn’t reflect any reality I know of. I’d watch an HBO series based on it though! Maybe a modern reimagining of 1984 combined with Escape from Tarkov; we all know how 1984 ended yeah?')
