Item(by='dmfdmf', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602027232, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24703551, text='&gt; It is only through writing down my thoughts that my argument gains clarity.<p>Start writing a daily journal... it is a huge help in clarifying your thinking in all aspects of your life.<p>Also, do a search for Lincoln &amp; Euclid.  Early in his law studies Lincoln took a break to study Euclid&#x27;s Elements to learn how to reason and demonstrate an idea clearly. You probably don&#x27;t need to slog through The Elements (but that would be great) so check out TheGreatCourses.com for some good basic lectures on mathematical reasoning, the older the better. I bought the Dunham lecture &quot;Great Thinkers, Great Theorems&quot; and it is excellent. He walks you through simple proofs such as proving the Sqrt[2] is an irrational number and much more.<p>NB: Don&#x27;t pay list price unless you can afford it or can&#x27;t wait. Most items regularly go on sale at signficantly discounted rate. I got the GT,GT lectures at a discount because I found it posted to YT and emailed them to alert them.')
