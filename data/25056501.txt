Your comment is already grey on HN.<p>In the past men formed brotherhoods to enable them to do great things. Women will never support men, it&#x27;s simply not in their nature. Speak to any woman and they&#x27;re not even aware of men below them in society and disgusted by more than half of men. This is where their feeling of inequality comes from. But men now are not looking after each other. We are more divided than ever. Expected to stop our manly activities and forced into a feminine world from the beginning. If you divide men then huge inequality is inevitable. All women are born with the ability to reproduce. Men are born with nothing.<p>Feminism is a return to the jungle where alpha males kill each other on their way to the top and rule over all other males, forcing them into a lonely existence. We have been seeing this for years already. Nobody benefits from this in the long run, but in the short run it&#x27;s all benefitting that top 1% of men in society. Women are just along for the ride and no amount of feminism or &quot;equality&quot; will make them any more or less happy.')
