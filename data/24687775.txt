It&#x27;s like those reality soaps on Discovery (e.g. the gold miners), always complaining that they didn&#x27;t find nearly enough to make ends meet, but surprise surprise, next season they buy tons of new equipment. They&#x27;re not in the gold mining industry, they&#x27;re in the acting industry.<p>The motorcycle &#x2F; car customizers aren&#x27;t as much into that business as they are in the acting &amp; marketing one. Worked great for OCC, the show turned them into an internationally recognized brand. Wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they earn more off of merchandise than motorcycles.')
