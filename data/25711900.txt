Quoting the page:<p>&gt; I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant.<p>This seems like it&#x27;s clearly saying that, as a society, we should reserve the right to silence any group by force if we consider them to be intolerant. It&#x27;s often said that the government has a monopoly on force, so this is pretty much saying the government should reserve the right to quiet any speech it deems intolerant.<p>Is this really what the people quoting it want? I&#x27;m worried about the government using &quot;intolerance&quot; as a cover for suppressing speech it dislikes for other reasons. Some governments like manage to Germany ban certain types of speech without becoming authoritarian states, but others don&#x27;t. Particularly in the US, I have a feeling we&#x27;ll get Trump 2.0 at some point, and he&#x27;ll be smarter and more capable and more charismatic and more populist and more popular, and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a good idea to give him the right to say &quot;free speech is cancelled and if I think you&#x27;re not being tolerant enough [to groups I like], you&#x27;re going to jail bucko&quot;. Do people arguing on Popper&#x27;s side have a reason to be confident that this won&#x27;t ever happen?')
