I didn&#x27;t notice that. In any case, the use of tear gas at demonstrations seems solidly like a &quot;police tactic&quot; to me.<p>If your area has elected police leaders, then its important to choose a sheriff that you believe in.<p>&gt; so the law is simply invalid as applicable to him, which isn&#x27;t a “we have a sheriff as opposed to some other structure of county law enforcement” problem, but “we are trying to regulate the actions of higher levels of government” problem.<p>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is a &quot;most people don&#x27;t seem to understand how their own government works&quot;. The Sheriff&#x27;s check on power is the election. The locality elects the Sheriff, which is why its usually so difficult to remove the Sheriff (because the Sheriff represents the will of the people).<p>Sheriffs are relatively hard to remove by the very design of the office. It makes their elections very important.')
