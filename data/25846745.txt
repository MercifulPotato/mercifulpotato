I do believe lots of people believe that messages over time led citizens to believe their gun rights, free speech rights and voting rights were threatened, and that they would need to fight to keep them.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justsecurity.org&#x2F;74138&#x2F;incitement-timeline-year-of-trumps-actions-leading-to-the-attack-on-the-capitol&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justsecurity.org&#x2F;74138&#x2F;incitement-timeline-year-...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brandeis.edu&#x2F;now&#x2F;2021&#x2F;january&#x2F;trump-language-capitol-riot-mcintosh.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brandeis.edu&#x2F;now&#x2F;2021&#x2F;january&#x2F;trump-language-cap...</a><p>That being said, the speech itself certainly didn&#x27;t help.<p>&gt; they rigged an election.<p>&gt; They rigged it like they’ve never rigged an election before.<p>&gt; All of us here today do not want to see our election victory stolen by emboldened radical left Democrats<p>&gt; You don’t concede when there’s theft involved.<p>&gt; We will not take it any more<p>&gt; We will not let them silence your voices.<p>&gt;  Although with this administration, if this happens, it could happen. You’ll see some really bad things happen. They’ll knock out Lincoln too, by the way.<p>&gt; we’re going to have somebody in there that should not be in there and our country will be destroyed<p>&gt;  some of these guys. They’re out there fighting the House.\n Guys are fighting, but it’s incredible<p>&gt; Democrats attempted the most brazen and outrageous election theft. There’s never been anything like this.<p>&gt; We’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them because you’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.<p>&gt; We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing<p>&gt; Our country has been under siege for a long time<p>&gt; You will have an illegitimate president, that’s what you’ll have. And we can’t let that happen.<p>Probably a waste of my effort, but it&#x27;s quite disingenuous to claim that not saying the word &quot;trespass&quot; in this speech after years of messaging that the Democrats are the enemy of Trump and Trump&#x27;s followers proves it wasn&#x27;t yet another piece of incitement. He absolutely encouraged &quot;fighting.&quot; So either you believe he&#x27;s a complete imbecile who does not understand what happens if you get a bunch of armed citizens to believe their favorite rights will be lost if they allow a fraudulent election of a Democratic President to come to fruition, or you understand that he was intentional with his language over time.')
