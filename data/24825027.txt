Angel investors are &quot;cool&quot; and people will admire you during parties and whatnot. A FB engineer striking it big and starting to angel invest should be seen as a &quot;nouveau riche buying status&quot; move and not necessarily as a means  to gain even more money (though that may be a welcome bonus of course).<p>The status aspect is largely missing in other areas of the world and may be one of the reasons why finding investment in SV is so much different than elsewhere.')
