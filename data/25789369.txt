There will be a sudden huge demand for exiting from USDT, and the only way looks like buying BTC on semi or fully fraudulent unbanked exchanges (good luck with that).<p>This will also trigger a big price unbalance between exchanges, and it remains to be seen if arbitrage channels will be able to weather the storm and if so for how long.<p>If you hold USDT, better get out quick unless you want to be left holding the bag.<p>If you hold BTC (as in: for real, in your own wallet, not on some shady exchange, not your keys not your coins), it&#x27;s likely the BTC ecosystem is going to undergo a very large &quot;event&quot;. Up or down, who knows.<p>If you hold BTC on an exchange, especially a shady one with 100x leverage type offerings, get your coins out of there ASAP before you get BTC-E&#x27;d [1]<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;BTC-e" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;BTC-e</a>')
