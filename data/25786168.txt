Everything I&#x27;ve seen that looks like a live Zoom performance of 10-20 musicians is actually recorded separately (with a click track) and then edited together in a video to make it look like it&#x27;s Zoom.<p>But now that the music quality is there... Zoom could conceivably broadcast a click track (e.g. the host&#x27;s audio that would go to performers&#x27; speakers but not the audience&#x27;s, or even the host being a conductor or lead performer), performers would play &quot;solo&quot; (without hearing each other), but then the central Zoom server would wait for and cache every performer&#x27;s audio until they were all received, with a suitable buffer, and then output it mixed, to the audience, synchronized to the host&#x27;s (click-track) audio (timecodes).<p>And unlike normal Zoom calls where it only ever transmits 1 or 2 audio streams (the loudest ones at the moment), it would always mix all of them.<p>It&#x27;s probably complicated enough that it wouldn&#x27;t be worth Zoom&#x27;s effort, and also niche enough not to be worth a startup developing a separate product for it... but it certainly seems doable, no?')
