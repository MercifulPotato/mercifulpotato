To achieve that is hard work and just as much a form of trade.  The voluntary nature of payments for the objects implies they are <i>more</i> valued by others than ordinary trade where payments are mandatory and creators can &quot;coast&quot; with lower quality products.<p>Arguably the person doing a regular job for pay is being handed more, as almost anyone can work a basic job for pay and gets the fruits of everyone else&#x27;s labour.  It&#x27;s almost a freebie in modern society: Do some work get <i>vastly</i> more of what you need for a good life given to you while you produce maybe 1% of it yourself.<p>From this perspective, a job is 99% handout from the collective to you, 1% contribution from you to the collective.')
