There the cables also define capability so &quot;cables that look identical don&#x27;t actually work the same way&quot;.<p>In theory yes. In practice most of the cables are good enough for most users - e.g. in a home LAN cables are probably 10m at most, so even a cat5 cable can probably give people a connection that&#x27;s as fast as their internet uplink. If the problems with USB-C are common enough to impact normal users (and I think lack of thunderbolt falls into that category) then that&#x27;s a major difference in practice.')
