Item(by='jholman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606986666, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25274008, text='Note that the interpolating of attribute values along the edges of the triangle is not exclusive to a polygon-pusher, right?  If your raytracer has textures, it still interpolates the much same way the polygon-pusher does, right?  Am I getting confused?  (Of course the raytracer&#x27;s geometry is less likely to be triangles than the polygon-pusher&#x27;s geometry, but let&#x27;s keep it apples-to-apples).  And of course it applies to any kind of textures: baked in lightmaps, normal maps, whatever.<p>I mean, sure, the polygon-pusher presumably does it post-transforms, i.e. in screenspace, and the raytracer does it in some other space (exactly what space is gonna depend on implementation of the camera and stuff I think), but I think it&#x27;s pretty similar?<p>But as far as I know the depth-checking in a polygon pusher is totally about the raster, so in that sense, yeah, the (non-wireframe) polygon-pusher has a deeper relationship to rasters.')
