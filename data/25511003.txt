I am very confident that this was not the only idea he had to do so; I strongly suspect Frito-Lay discovered that as well, which is why he ended up in upper management.<p>Now, does it happen for everyone, every time? Of course not. It’s not even numerically possible for everyone to take this path. I’ve always taken pride in immersing myself with the company I work for as well, and while that has worked out very well in some cases in others it has had no apparent effect. That’s OK. I see it as part of my character, not merely as a play for more responsibility (and compensation).<p>I don’t think it’s just “luck”, though. I think someone who builds this type of character will benefit from it. It may not make them a VP at Frito-Lay, but it will benefit them.')
