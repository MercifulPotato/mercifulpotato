If there is later a dispute between the buyer and the seller, the email can be used to repudiate lies. In particular, if a third party (like a court) can authenticate the message, the honest party can convince the third party that the dishonest party is being fraudulent.<p>You are exaggerating when you claim that there is no legitimate need to authenticate messages as a third party.')
