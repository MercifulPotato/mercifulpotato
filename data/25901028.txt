If planets go in circle (the Real - the Territory), we create orbital equations, Kepler&#x27;s laws, etc (the Made up - the Map).<p>Isn&#x27;t it the same with Math? In this universe, some fundamental rules seem to be obeyed: (at macro scale) objects tend to keep their delimitations, they add up and substract nicely, etc. So we make up words, language, equations to match.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just that the constructs Math tries to Map are more fundamental, harder to imagine a universe where they are different (a universe where 2+2 things makes 5 things)')
