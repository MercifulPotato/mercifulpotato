One is that the best way to protect vulnerable populations is to make sure the virus isn&#x27;t spreading out of control in the non-vulnerable population.<p>Second, there isn&#x27;t really a non-vulnerable population.  The risk of dying if you&#x27;re relatively young is low, but it&#x27;s not zero.<p>Third, the death statistics don&#x27;t really cover the long-haulers; there are people who have serious complications for months at least.  Damage to heart, lungs, and neurological problems may be permanent.<p>Fourth, if you overwhelm the capacity of the local health care system to care for sick people, a lot more of them are likely to die or suffer worse complications.<p>Fifth, we don&#x27;t know how long immunity lasts.  Having a cycle where all the healthy people get Covid-19 once a year isn&#x27;t sustainable.<p>Sixth, if it some point one were to decide (like Sweden did) that herd immunity is a bad idea, your country is now in a much worse position to try to eradicate the virus by social distancing and masks.  For instance, the United States reduced new infections by about a half between mid July to mid September; that&#x27;s about two months.  If that&#x27;s the best we can do, it means that every time we increase the number of cases 2x (like we&#x27;ve just about managed to do in October), it means we&#x27;ve added 2 more months at least until the pandemic is over, if herd immunity doesn&#x27;t work and a vaccine isn&#x27;t forthcoming.')
