That&#x27;s an average of $23,000 per person.  The median is likely much lower as many doctors, lawyers, and other post-grads have $100-300k in debt.<p>I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s an arduous sum at all.  I came from a working class family and I had nearly twice that amount ~$40,000 when I got out of college in 2001.  I set up a payment plan and paid it off with about 5-6% interest.')
