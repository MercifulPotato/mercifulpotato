The code was horrible. Riddled with copy pasta (nearly half of the entire thing was copy paste and no code reuse). We basically refactored everything, standardized input and output file names. We put up a small Flask service to allow outside services hit it easily and wrapped it up in a Docker container so it was ultimately easy to deploy. Yes it was all the plumbing. However we also looked at the code, and the ML strategies, and while there was &quot;some&quot; level of competence, it was nothing more than word2vec add and divide. Totally horrible for actually finding key phrases that matter to the subject we&#x27;re matching. So we started tackling that too with LSTM but our time got cut short and shifted off to another area. So not only was the &quot;scientist&quot; they hired completely crappy at the engineering, they weren&#x27;t really helpful in the ML either.<p>This is obviously of lesser value to the topic at hand, and more about making sure you hire good people I think.')
