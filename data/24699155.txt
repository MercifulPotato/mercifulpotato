Importantly, the product manufacturers are not its competitors because they aren&#x27;t in the retail business; they are in the wholesale business of making and selling to retailers.<p>Amazon does not own the products in its marketplace. The sellers in the marketplace do not sell their products to Amazon. They are all sellers, like Amazon, and that is why Amazon&#x27;s practices are an antitrust issue.')
