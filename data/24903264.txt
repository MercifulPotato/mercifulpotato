I have no inside information, nor any particular depth of knowledge in the subject. Please seek more qualified sources for discourse at a higher level than &quot;Thanksgiving dinner political talk&quot;.<p>This is the best summary of issues I&#x27;ve seen: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.servethehome.com&#x2F;investigating-implausible-bloomberg-supermicro-stories&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.servethehome.com&#x2F;investigating-implausible-bloom...</a><p>There are so many technical problems with Bloomberg&#x27;s article that I find it hard to take it at face value.<p>Beyond technical issues, the graphics belie the lack of editorial oversight: the image of a penny with a chip next to it is labeled as &quot;[m]icrochips found on altered motherboards in some cases looked like signal conditioning couplers&quot;, but the chip shown is not a signal conditioning coupler. It appears to be an artist&#x27;s conception based on a google image search for &quot;signal conditioning coupler&quot;.[0] This is not the sort of ambiguity one expects in a well-vetted piece.<p>And further absurdity is this circular reference in a follow-up article[1] they published:<p>&gt;In response to the Bloomberg Businessweek story, the Norwegian National Security Authority said last week that it had been &quot;aware of an issue&quot; connected to Supermicro products since June.  Trond Ovstedal, a spokesman for the agency, later added to that statement, saying the agency was alerted to the concerns by someone who had heard of them via Bloomberg&#x27;s news gathering efforts. In its initial statement, the authority couldnâ€™t confirm the details of Bloomberg&#x27;s reporting, but said that it has recently been in dialogue with partners over the issue.<p>It&#x27;s a game of telephone:<p>----<p>Bloomberg to &#x27;A&#x27;: could you tell us about &lt;story&gt;?<p>&#x27;A&#x27; to &#x27;B&#x27;: I was talking to Bloomberg about &lt;story&gt; recently.<p>&#x27;B&#x27; to government: I heard about &lt;story&gt;.<p>Government to Bloomberg: Yes, we have heard about &lt;story&gt;.<p>Bloomberg to readers: Government confirmed they independently knew about &lt;story&gt;!<p>----<p>All of this makes me suspect that (a) relatively minor event(s) were misinterpreted by the authors as evidence of a widespread attack. I do not doubt that intelligence agencies interdict hardware and add backdoors (Snowden amply demonstrated that the NSA does this -- even without cooperation from any manufacturer). But I also would not be surprised if Bloomberg confused an Amazon red team&#x2F;blue team exercise for the real thing, or confused an internal report on the hypothetical risk of supply chain compromise for some real event.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;marcan42&#x2F;status&#x2F;1047935859020902400" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;marcan42&#x2F;status&#x2F;1047935859020902400</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2018-10-09&#x2F;new-evidence-of-hacked-supermicro-hardware-found-in-u-s-telecom" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2018-10-09&#x2F;new-evide...</a>')
