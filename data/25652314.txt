Item(by='apta_', descendants=None, kids=[25652383, 25654530], score=None, time=1609886970, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25651348, text='As a Muslim, almost every &quot;Shariah compliant&quot; financing contract I came across is <i></i>not<i></i> compatible with Islamic Law (Shariah). Unfortunately, we&#x27;re just taking modern parasitic and usurious financial contracts, and wrapping them under &quot;Islamic&quot; terms, and selling them as such. Any actual investigation of such contracts reveals that they&#x27;re nothing but interest and usury in disguise. Islam seriously warns about this sort of behavior.<p>Under Islam, loans are are strictly an act of charity. There can be absolutely no contractual obligation for the lender to receive any benefit of any kind (monetary or otherwise) from the borrower in return for the loan. The borrower is encouraged to return more than the amount he borrowed, purely as a show of gratitude, but it can in no way be part of the contract, and in no way implied one way or another (like &quot;off the record&quot; sort of thing).<p>True Islamic finance is pro risk sharing, with no exploitative and parasitic practices that we see today. Want to start a business? Pitch your idea to an investor willing to put money into it, you put in the effort and he (or multiple investors) puts in the money. If the business succeeds, all parties benefit, if it fails, investors lose their money, and you lose the time and effort you put into it. Fair across the board. Zero debt.<p>Applying actual Islamic finance rules, we would immediately rule out things like stock shorting, put and call options, margin and leverage trading, mortgages, interest bearing loans, selling debt for debt, and so on. Now you can bet that Wall Street won&#x27;t be happy, but time and time again those practices have proven destructive to the economy, and further increase the wage divide.')
