What wasnt loved was the one desktop everywhere so when they tried to push &#x27;Metro&#x27; to the PC, tablet and phone it struggled.  But the tiled phone interface was good, and a lot of people liked it.<p>I really think Ballmer and Cook are manifestations of the same person.  Mac OS quality is the worst it&#x27;s been in probably a decade+?  Hardware design for the laptops have been under massive scrutiny.  Cook brought the Watch to the table which is a massive success.  Their services business plan is just a money grab like their approach to accessories.  But Apple isn&#x27;t innovating much, they have been cashing in in recent years (besides the watch imo, maybe airpods but Id personally disagree)')
