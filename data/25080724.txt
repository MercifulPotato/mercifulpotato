Bannon can say things, and who knows what person already near the edge for whatever reason might fly off the handle and do something crazy.  It&#x27;s more than just &quot;a legitimate concern&quot;.<p>But that&#x27;s obvious.  Seeing the risk inherent in people like Bannon doesn&#x27;t even require effort.  Thinking like that (<i>and only that</i>) is kind of the equivalent of &quot;phoning it in&quot; [1].<p>Reality is very complex. <i>Infinity</i> complex, some people say.  Managing it skilfully <i>is a hard problem</i>.  There is risk, and problems, <i>everywhere</i>.  Attributing it all to cartoon evil characters like Steve Bannon and Donald Trump is pretty low effort thinking.  <i>Not even trying</i> to be <i>correct(!)</i> (as opposed to &quot;right&quot;).<p>My point is, why make this problem (just as one example - it is a recurring theme if one pays close attention) even harder by talking about it inaccurately &amp;&#x2F;or imprecisely?  I think most of us wouldn&#x27;t dare to write software at our day jobs this way, for all the obvious reasons, so then why do we accept it (or sometimes even <i>insist</i> upon it) when it comes to a far more complex problem, which is arguably more important than what we do from 9 to 5?<p>I am &quot;on the spectrum&quot; (in case it wasn&#x27;t obvious).  I do not understand why people behave like this - <i>in general</i>, but <i>especially</i> programmer types, who possess logical and systems analysis capabilities far beyond what general public <i>can even imagine</i>.<p>Why do people do this?  Human behavior seems completely counter-intuitive to me.  Like, backwards from what it should be.  Can you explain it to me in some way that might make sense, to someone like me?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.urbandictionary.com&#x2F;define.php?term=phoned%20it%20in" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.urbandictionary.com&#x2F;define.php?term=phoned%20it%...</a>')
