For eg, having commit rights to Debian requires a certain level of security know-how, being an Arch Trusted User has similar requirements (they moved to yubikeys everywhere a while back for eg).<p>We don&#x27;t even know if all these users have 2FA enabled for their NPM accounts. Building a software distribution ecosystem that offers trust guarantees post-facto is a really hard challenge, and I think that the right answer is in providing developers better sandboxes. That&#x27;s not to say this can&#x27;t be used as a signal as the author suggests, just that the &quot;strong-set-user&#x2F;package=safe&quot; guarantee doesn&#x27;t have an underlying basis as of yet.')
