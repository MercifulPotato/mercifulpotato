Somewhat to my original point: an electrobike is a much lower load than an electrocar!<p>This might be acceptable <i>on average</i>; theory in practice are the same in theory, but in practice they differ. A real-world user will require the ability to fully charge his electrocar on occasion, which means the fullbore 240V connection and a 100A breaker (potentially a 50A breaker depending on vehicle).<p>Assuming that every user follows average patterns will break the system.<p>Taking this idea out further, it speaks to infrastructure upgrades that will be necessary in order to power all of these electrocars.  Estimates vary by region, power generation from automobiles as a fraction of total is somewhere between 10% and 30%, which exceeds both the spare capacity of the electric grid in aggregate, as well as often exceeding local transmission capabilities.<p>All-in-all, the costs of electrocar adoption are nonlinear: the first few percent of the population who adopt don&#x27;t have to deal with the structural problems: a 100-unit condominium building can add two or three 240V chargers, the local grid can handle a handful of vehicles.  At scale, however, major infrastructure upgrades will be required.')
