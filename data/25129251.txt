Yes I do use issue tracking and the wiki, but my projects are relatively small and it would be trivial to write a scraper to get that out of there.<p>&gt; A mostly-imaginary threshold. It&#x27;s in your head. Think about it.. those with skills &amp; time, who can wholesomely contribute, will highly likely to already have email and perhaps XMPP (Movim) or IRC. It is not the facilities stopping them, it&#x27;s either skill or will to dedicate time.<p>I believe this is simply not true. Not every project is the Kernel and not every contributor is planning to become a long term contributor. Drive-by PRs are often of questionable quality, yes, but I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;re always worthless.<p>Where this really has value is the sort of project where someone writes something for themselves and then decides &quot;might as well push it to github, maybe someone else can use it too&quot;. Then someone else comes along finds this and is like, oh cool, using this as a starting point saves me a few hours, and then decides &quot;might as well open a PR in case they&#x27;re interested in how i extended it&quot;.<p>These are the cases where I do believe that githubs low friction does make a difference. Not everything is a proper project.')
