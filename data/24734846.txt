What&#x27;s clear, however, is that it&#x27;s a much higher standard than it used to be.  It used to be similar to the O-1 standard but now USCIS wants to see a lot more than just meeting the required three criteria; it wants to see external&#x2F;third-party evidence that the applicant is set apart from most of his or her peers through, for example, the purchase of a company founded by the applicant, the widespread use of a product developed by the applicant, the receipt of a major national or international award, publications with lots and lots of citations, extensive media coverage in major media, keynote&#x2F;major invited conference speaking engagements, very high base and total compensation, etc.')
