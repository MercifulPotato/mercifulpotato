All of their products were just whitelabeled machines from other vendors, available elsewhere cheaper.  They did nothing to differentiate their products and almost exclusively targeted wealthy hobbyists (c.f. products like &quot;Gamerbox&quot;).  System76 innovates (even if it&#x27;s just via an Ubuntu respin) and Purism tries to differentiate themselves at the hardware level.  EmperorLinux sources hardware from big-name vendors and focuses on software.<p>I am still waiting for the &quot;linux laptop company&quot; to arrive that actually takes advantage of Linux, instead of shoveling consumer-grade products in one-off sales.  Where is the company offering &#x27;managed fleet&#x27; for business workstations?  So far it&#x27;s just Google doing it with Chromebooks, but with modern devops tools it should be a pretty easy business model.')
