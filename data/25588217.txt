I&#x27;m well aware that it can export to HTML5, and even Haxe&#x2F;OpenFL, an open source project I&#x27;ve personally invested a ton of time and money into.<p>It&#x27;s great those initiatives exist, I&#x27;ve spent years of my career supporting them, but at replicating what Flash did in its prime, it&#x27;s still not quite the same. The abstraction leaks around the edges and the community and singular simplicity and straightforwardness of what Flash had is long gone and a tiny open source community always heroically struggling for funding and contributions can&#x27;t be expected to replicate it.<p>Also, RE: Animate, updates randomly break things with previous versions, and being proprietary I have no idea how long Adobe is going to let it continue existing and keep it compatible with anything I might want to use it for.<p>Anyways, the main point of the thread was just that the claims that HTML&#x2F;JS was this perfect go to replacement for what we really valued about Flash just rings hollow to me 10 years later.')
