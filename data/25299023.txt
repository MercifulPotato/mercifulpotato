Grass clippings, coffee grounds, liquid nitrogen (urine). This is bacteria dominant composting (hot composting is fast).<p>On the other hand if you want to do less work just make them in a pile and allow for fungi to process the leaves over a longer period of time. This is fungi dominant composting (cold composting is slower).<p>The soil life is already present on the leaves. Just keep the pile consistently moist but not soaking wet.<p>I have hot composting videos documented on YouTune, although they are from before I upgraded my camera so the quality isn&#x27;t as good as my newer videos, hopefully still informational.')
