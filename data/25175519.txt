You claim that landlords have &quot;enormous bargaining power&quot; and yet assume that they are too weak to charge higher rents based on the knowledge that their property is subject to rent control, so that they will be compensated for the risk of seeing a long term tenant.<p>How can this be?<p>Of course they will charge more in rent to adjust for the fact that a percentage of their tenants will be long term, and therefore short term tenants end up subsidizing long term tenants, exactly as I claimed.<p>I get that you don&#x27;t like landlords. But think this through and try to use reason rather than emotion.')
