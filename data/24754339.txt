I have a skylake i5-2600k and the iGPU is absolute dogshit. Not sure if it&#x27;s a hardware or driver issue but it still hasn&#x27;t been sorted out after all these years.<p>Typically the entire system will freeze (speakers will continue to play whatever was in the short audio buffer - pretty awful) for 10-15s, then the driver will detect the hang and reboot the iGPU. Happens much more frequently (every ~15m) when using more graphically intense programs. I can&#x27;t use blender because sometimes when it hangs it won&#x27;t reset and requires a full reboot.<p>There are dozens of issues about it and related problems in Intel&#x27;s drm fork of the kernel [0]. I (finally) posted a bug report about it months ago since it seemed to have gotten worse after 5.4 but never heard back from them.<p>All this to say - be wary of Intel graphics on linux.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.freedesktop.org&#x2F;drm&#x2F;intel&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.freedesktop.org&#x2F;drm&#x2F;intel&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues</a>')
