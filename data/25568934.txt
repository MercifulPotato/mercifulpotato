You say &quot;free&quot;, but not under what terms or what &quot;free&quot; really means here. In fact, &quot;free&quot; is not even mentioned in any other place than the website &lt;title&#x2F;&gt;.<p>As a suggestion, add a specific license to all the work (a Create Commons one or similar) and write out the terms explicitly, even if they are just &quot;Do whatever you want, no warranty included&quot;.')
