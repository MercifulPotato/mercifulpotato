I am not using whatsapp and recently I stumbled upon an iOS app that asked for a phone number to register and then tried to send OTP through whatsapp. SMS was a fallback option there which showed afterwards and was not active for 5 minutes because of the “timeout” between otp requests )))<p>2.A bottle of water advertised some lottery and had a QR code which was a FB link leading to a page that showed me a vague message about FB messenger which I don’t have.<p>It turns out that some people&#x2F;companies nowadays assume FB and affiliated&#x2F;owned companies to be a kinda standard for communication.<p>Boys and girls, write down and remember a simple rule: none of the commercial organizations will provide means of communication (apps, public APIs and SDKs) as standards unless those aforementioned means fit their business model.<p>Real standards belong either to public domain or to established non-commercial foundations with clear and transparent governance, leadership and policies.<p>Back on topic. I remember FB as a site that united students and alumni of major universities. This was probably the only period of fun in facebook history.<p>I remember VK.com being a Russian facebook clone with similar initial posture and user base which was also fun until its users started to go to jail for political reasons.<p>I would argue that this fate is waiting any “social” “network” after some point in their evolution.<p>A Cozy platform for chitchats and pic sharing gains more and more users, attention and money and transforms to a monster that starts eating its children and encourages all the deadly sins.<p>If you know an example of a social media that managed to escape this fate I will be happy to stand corrected.')
