Most of the largest wholesalers have microscopically thin margins (i.e., they&#x27;re not making much from you), whereas grocery stores tend to be a lot higher.  I&#x27;m not an expert in the food distribution business but it seems most wholesalers (McLane, for instance, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mclaneco.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;mclaneco&#x2F;en&#x2F;customer.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mclaneco.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;mclaneco&#x2F;en&#x2F;customer.html</a>) are happy to take new customers.  Maybe Sam&#x27;s club is offering a better deal than wholesalers on specific items because of coupons&#x2F;sales and whatnot?')
