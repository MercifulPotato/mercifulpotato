The GNU userspace and associated “mobile” paradigms within it are very much not ready for daily use.<p>&gt; Linux phones are definitely not yet ready to be daily drivers<p>Despite the author making this point twice and some of the negativity regarding Purism&#x27;s pricing - I still feel very good about the state of Linux phones and the incredible work these two entities are doing. We can&#x27;t lose sight of this.<p>It wasn&#x27;t too long ago that the mere mention of a Linux phone was pure fantasy. We now have two companies (and two passionate communities) that are helping move Open Source Linux forward. I&#x27;m still very excited about how things are developing and the trickle down effect it will have as we move forward.<p>&gt; One of the neat things about the Pinephone is the ability to boot and use a variety of Linux distributions on the hardware itself. It’s as easy as loading the distro onto an SD card, and then booting the phone. You don’t even have to flash anything to the internal eMMC in order to run it!<p>This is such a killer feature for me - while also providing a modern-ish platform for the various distributions and app developers to test their wares. It&#x27;s probably the biggest single most important thing about the PinePhone right now.<p>No more unsuccessful rooting, flashing and possibly bricking. No more nagging feeling that you are merely renting a device and are constantly at the whim of a corporate overlord (which never ends well).<p>I think, like the author, I&#x27;m a bit more excited about the flexibility of the PinePhone but acknowledge the importance of the work Purism is doing to try and bring a First Tier Linux phone to market. We all benefit from this.')
