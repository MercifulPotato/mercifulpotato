The philosophical books can be very persuasive for the beginner in the field, leading to many misconceptions. I would recommend to take part in some (university&#x2F;on-line) courses, but not in one, but at least two from different teachers.<p>As for the books, Plato (Socrates dialogues) is must have to understand the field. Also it&#x27;s fun to read, so it&#x27;s great to begin with :) The Nicomachean Ethics of Aristotle is another beginner friendly book which lays field for others to follow; it&#x27;s much more practical&#x2F;friendly than the Metaphysics, which should be approached only with an assistance of a good teacher (unless you&#x27;re a genius like Avicenna or Thomas Aquineas).')
