Despite the GOP candidate having won the popular vote for the nPresident once out of the last eight (now nine) elections, they control six of nine seats on the SCOTUS. Despite Trump having a single term in office, he’s appointed 30% of the Federal judiciary with judges who are on average several years younger than the judges Obama appointed.<p>If anyone has reason to complain about tilt, it’s Democrats. Trump lost the popular vote by four million votes. I know it’s only the EC that matters, but that doesn’t make the system any less fair.<p>Trump voters are complaining about a tilted field that exists only in their imaginations. In reality, the electoral process in the U.S. currently favors the GOP.<p>1. A particularly egregious example is here in NC where the GOP won 50% of the vote in 2018 but secured 10 of 13 districts.<p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;insideelections.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;article&#x2F;the-gops-long-term-structural-senate-advantage" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;insideelections.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;article&#x2F;the-gops-long-term-...</a>')
