It’s hard to imagine a program that you’d write in a language like JS in the first place where the small overhead of a look-up would be significant even for a feature as commonly used as enums.<p>However, there is a wider issue here than just whether to use one specific TS language feature or not. If you’re establishing principles that are going to affect thousands of developers working on thousands of different programs, which appears to be the case at Bloomberg from what I can see, then erring on the side of caution is a reasonable position to take. It’s difficult to objectively evaluate risk at that scale, whether from individually small but pervasive runtime performance hits or from potential future (in)compatibility with JS.')
