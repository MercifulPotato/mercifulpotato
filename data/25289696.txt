What&#x27;s the point of having fast cores if you cannot feed them?<p>We don&#x27;t know how lower yields for bigger chips on the newest nodes will affect their costs.<p>People act like Apple changed the game or is light years ahead of everyone but they literally haven&#x27;t made a proper desktop-class chip yet. It&#x27;s not because they don&#x27;t care about higher core  chips or chips with proper IO. They haven&#x27;t made them because they CAN&#x27;T (yet).<p>So yes, Apple does have catching up to do.')
