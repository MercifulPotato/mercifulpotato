The way they have it now, they get to use all the other LSP implementations “for free” while no other editors get to use their servers. You will note that the old one was open source–Microsoft deliberately closed this one. I really want to believe differently, but it really seems like they kept it open for as long as it took people to adopt LSP and then decided they didn’t have to promote it anymore.')
