Sure, they don&#x27;t have a monopoly in precise terms. But the power they have to push products in new verticals is just unfair to the competition as they can&#x27;t compete on equal terms.<p>Jabra&#x27;s parent company in total earns less than 10% of what Apple earns selling just Airpods. It would be really sad if we lose iconic companies like Bose to these &quot;want to own everything&quot; tech giants.<p>Sidenote: This downvoting pattern on critical comments on any threads related to Apple has been absurd for quite some time. Somehow we have entered into a territory where say a company like FB always is upto no good for most here but the opposite is true for Apple.')
