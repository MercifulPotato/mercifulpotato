But I certainly, trivially, know what the &quot;wrong&quot; amount of time would be: zero.  If a reporter doesn&#x27;t find <i>some</i> non-zero balance between those three perspectives, they have utterly failed in their role as a journalist.  Eliding any of those events doesn&#x27;t reduce bias, it effectively <i>maximizes</i> it.')
