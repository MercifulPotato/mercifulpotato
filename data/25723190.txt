They are, in most companies, the most misunderstood role. There&#x27;s an expression that basically says &quot;When things are going great, everyone wonders what sysadmin does. When things are going poorly, everyone wonders what sysdamin does&quot;. A good sysadmin team is amazing and, in many cases, vital to a successful business.<p>I think the only other role that gets ignored as much is the Executive Assistant(s). Much like sysadmin, good ones make sure everything runs smoothly, and should be prized like gold.<p>Being viewed as a value multiplier (like good instances of the above should be) is a fine goal in life.')
