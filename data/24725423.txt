They are unprofessional and I would ask them to stop such conversations. Should they persist, I will raise it and if need be - start thinking about working elsewhere.<p>If the first manager fires her because of her gender, we can take him to court for unlawful dismissal.<p>There are many mean individuals out there. Thatâ€™s because we all have capacity for discrimination and ultimately violence. The call to stop discussing politics at work might result in fewer such frictions and keep us focused on the job at hand. A more productive and socially cohesive outcome in my opinion.')
