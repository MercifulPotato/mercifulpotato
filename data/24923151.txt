And I couldn&#x27;t agree more with Dave Isay&#x27;s vision - this goal of creating a &quot;hope machine&quot;.<p>What we&#x27;ve found with Artifact (thus far) is that the &quot;do-it-for-you&quot; aspect has been important - that we set up interview guests with a professional interviewer, who helps guide guests through the things they want to capture.<p>We see this as a natural extension of the StoryCorps mission - with the idea of making capturing the important stuff in life even more accessible.<p>And btw, the Betty Jenkins 3-minute summary is amazing! Thanks for sharing!')
