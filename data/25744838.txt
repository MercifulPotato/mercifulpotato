Descendants of slaves and other poor minorities have been in the bottom rungs of society for a long time, but they didn’t have the voting power to affect change.<p>The white people who can no longer consider themselves middle class (and above the bottom rungs) are now seeking change.  But still not change for everyone, just enough change to help them maintain “class” superiority”.<p>President Lyndon B. Johnson once said, &quot;If you can convince the lowest white man he&#x27;s better than the best colored man, he won&#x27;t notice you&#x27;re picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he&#x27;ll empty his pockets for you.&quot;<p>Edit:  This probably doesn’t have anything specifically to do with white people, but it’s a tribal mechanic that exists everywhere, especially when the relative positions of power are changing.  No one likes losing power.<p>You don’t see this though when the whole pie is increasing in size, and everyone’s share is increasing, and relative positions are maintained.  But I would say automation and outsourcing are, at the least, reconfiguring the relative positions of various tribes.')
