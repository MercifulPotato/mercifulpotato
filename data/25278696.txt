Ultimately programming languages are just an alternate notative system for mathematics--formal language theory actually formalizes and generalizes this, it&#x27;s what us Computer Scientist&#x27;s specialize in generally.<p>Since the computer is just a glorified calculator with memory (sorry Apple), we can fit the whole thing into a formal mathematical framework.')
