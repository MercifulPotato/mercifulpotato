You couldn&#x27;t pay me to use Terraform or Kubernetes for my SaaS unless it was a much larger team.<p>My stack usually consists of this: A framework I am comfortable with that removes a lot of boilerplate (happens to be the one I know best in the language I know best), the database I know best, the memory store I know best, Turbolinks for load times, a theme from ThemeForest (with the commercial license), self-hosted analytics, Amplitude, and Heroku.<p>The author mentions &quot;lessons learned&quot; regarding Clickhouse and Kubernetes. I&#x27;m not sure what their original goal was when starting their SaaS. Usually mine is financially motivated more than learning things.<p>What I&#x27;m really saying is that just go with what you know best. Having to scale is a good problem to have.
