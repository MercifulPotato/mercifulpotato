I bought a pair of JBL LSR 305 that I placed at each side of the screen, roughly 120cm away from each other and at arms length from me. They&#x27;re about 30cm away from the back wall.<p>The problem I have is with the bass. Standing in the normal position to interact with my PC, the bass strength is low. Now, the moment I move back about 1 meter, the bass strength becomes great (the one I&#x27;d expect from this pair of speakers).<p>I really don&#x27;t know what to do :&#x2F;')
