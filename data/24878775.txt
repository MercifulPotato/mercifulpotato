Item(by='smileybarry', descendants=None, kids=[24878898], score=None, time=1603542614, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24872661, text='I subscribed to Google Play Music All-Access for years and wouldn&#x27;t have cancelled[1] if not for regional pricing making Spotify half the price. The music selection was far greater than Spotify and the like, I could upload and match my purchases elsewhere, and their radio algorithm was actually <i>really</i> good. (I sorely miss it after using Spotify&#x27;s)<p>But YouTube Music is just a mess. I migrated my library to YTM and my experience is like the rest, but worse:<p>* You can&#x27;t migrate to brand (aka alias) accounts. All of my likes, uploads, favorites, recommendation profile are on my alias but to listen to my music I have to switch to my real name account. Oh, but aliases can still <i>use</i> YT Music, so there&#x27;s virtually no reason for this restriction.<p>* Switching accounts is for <i>both</i> YT and YT Music. So if I switch back to my alias on [normal] YT, the already-open YT Music tab will stop the music and ask me to switch back or refresh.<p>* All of my music poured into &quot;Liked Videos&quot;. Except only about ~180 songs are there and I had over a thousand saved, if not thousands. No idea where the rest are.<p>* Some of the songs are &quot;not available in your country&quot; but if I search for it and find <i>the official music video</i>, that one is.<p>* This applied to GPM too, but: no desktop app. You can pretend the web app is a desktop app (and it&#x27;s a little smoother than GPM at least) but it&#x27;s still much more taxing than even a webview app like Spotify&#x27;s.<p>[1] Fun fact: if you unsubscribe from GPM All-Access, your liked&#x2F;saved songs that aren&#x27;t uploaded <i>disappear</i> but are still in the DB, so you can&#x27;t even see them. I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re part of Google Takeout, but when I moved to Spotify that meant I had to remember what songs I liked.')
