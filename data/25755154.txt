Item(by='phs318u', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610492097, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25752984, text='&gt; but I do not see any of the advocates of limiting free speech having the courage to tell what they really think in the face of those whom they want to protect.<p>It&#x27;s not them I want to protect (though I don&#x27;t have any explicit desire for them to _not_ be protected). It&#x27;s me I want to protect. Your right to swing your fists ends at the tip of my nose, and your right to yell &quot;Fire!&quot; or &quot;Stop the steal&quot; or &quot;Storm the Bastille!&quot; are likewise constrained when they infringe on my rights.<p>The practical implementation and realisation of rights is always a trade-off of rights vs rights. What is under discussion is where the balance of those trade-offs lay.<p>Having said that, there is a very strong case to be made that we need to address people&#x27;s propensity to listen to, invest in, and act on, obvious bullshit (e.g. flat-earthers, reptilians etc). More than education is required. My brother-in-law - a highly functioning, tertiary educated small business owner and nice guy - is a dyed-in-the-wool conspiracist, believing the most outrageous things. Having a rational discussion with him has not budged him from his beliefs one iota. I believe it&#x27;s a psychological condition as common as depression or anxiety.<p>There are no easy answers nor quick fixes for this problem.')
