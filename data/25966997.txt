But then on Google in difference to Apple it&#x27;s still possible (but less reliable) with the right setup and fully possible with a &quot;proper&quot; de-googled phone.<p>So depending on your setup you might either:<p>- not get notifications<p>- get them unreliable<p>- only get them if the app is open<p>- get them just fine<p>Also this might change from app to app, there clearly will be apps which will not have any 3rd party notification broker fallback, but given how Google doesn&#x27;t have 100% delivicery guarantees they still should have (potential delayed) message syncing when the app is open.')
