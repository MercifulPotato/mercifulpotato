It seems equally possible that the attractive draw for angels (and all VCs) of a red-hot scene like SF is simply too powerful, so all the &quot;good&quot; angels flock there rather than waste their time in a less productive market.<p>The same phenomenon he describes where liquidity events propagate the cycle of early movers becoming angels could easily take place on a larger scale where an exodus of &quot;good&quot; angels from SF seeking value in other markets disseminates this model and evens it out a bit. This could also dampen some of the externalities created by this feverish form of capitalism i.e. ludicrous real estate prices, crushing income inequality, etc.<p>Of course this would take some rather weighty exogenous event taking place to make either SF or the US unattractive locations to start a business.')
