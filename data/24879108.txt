Lack of support for nested routes is what&#x27;s keeping me away from Next.js too. A tab view that doesn&#x27;t rerender the whole page requires jumping through many unofficial hoops with Next.js.<p>Even standard patterns like having seperate components for page header, sidebar that doesn&#x27;t rerender the main content section feels very hacky with Next.js, and that too after digging through many people&#x27;s blogs to read how they accomplished that.<p>I guess next.js really wants you to ditch the whole SPA idea atleast when it comes to routing.<p>I hope folks also explore more moderate patterns like server rendering <i>only</i> the first page load (either with react dom or using state hydration) or exploring better separation of client bundles too, and figure out what works best for them. Rather than sticking to whatever next.js or CRNA are set up for by default')
