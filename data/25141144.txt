In other parts of the thread, people are saying you need to have a good team to run your own infra, but you also need to have a good team to run on other people&#x27;s infra, and debug their bugs without visibility, so that you can guide their techs to fixing your issues, so I don&#x27;t think that using other people&#x27;s services absolves you of having a good team.<p>Really the issue isn&#x27;t age of company or number of engineers. It&#x27;s the number of servers you need, and how stable that is. If you can&#x27;t predict your server count 3 months out, you need to host with someone who has stock on hand to buffer your growth. If your server count is small, you get better geographic redundancy picking up an instance here and there from around the world from a single vendor; colo space is available everywhere, of course, but you would likely be dealing with different vendors in each locality.<p>If you can take advantage of growing and shrinking your deployment throughout the day in response to load, and there&#x27;s a dramatic difference between peak and trough, it makes a lot of sense to be somewhere that you pay by the hour, instead of by the month or have to buy for the peak and let it idle.<p>[1] Or Google Cloud, or Azure, or Oracle Cloud or whoever.')
