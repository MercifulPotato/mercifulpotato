Also better for consumers would be decoupling the charging network from the manufacturers, like ICE cars and mobile phones do (cables aside, in the latter case). No one is arguing otherwise, the discussion is about why this isn&#x27;t better for <i>manufacturers</i>.<p>One way to make it better for manufacturers is to mandate a standard, leaving manufacturers who don&#x27;t use the standard in violation of statute.<p>But <i>another</i> way is to wait until there are enough manufacturers of EVs, who <i>actually care</i> about their EVs and not just making compliance vehicles, and who <i>actually care</i> about building EV charging networks and not just building them to comply with consent decrees they&#x27;re subject to thanks to past illegal behavior, and who as a result <i>actually care</i> about having a useful, usable, reliable network of fast charging stations for cross-country trips.<p>Right now, only Tesla cares about this.<p>Eventually, other manufacturers will too. Then, one day, it will make sense for both manufacturers and consumers to use a single shared plug, and all new installations will have it, and old installations will be retrofitted. It will take 10+ years here, but it&#x27;s already happening in Europe thanks to mandates. In the meantime, mandating everyone follow some terrible standard and support other manufacturers&#x27; vehicles is just punitive to the manufacturers who do care, and punitive to future consumers who would like to use a functional system and not be stuck with the garbage that passes for fast charging outside Tesla&#x27;s network in the US today.<p>&lt;&#x2F;soapbox&gt;')
