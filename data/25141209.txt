Write old school circa 2008 CSS.<p>2. Oh shit, it&#x27;s a real pain in the ass to do layout and make a responsive grid. Let me use a framework. Sweet!<p>3. Hmm.. its kinda painful to write css selectors all day long. They&#x27;re reusable but I am having to get out of comfy JS IDE setup to go change some CSS properties in a different file.<p>4. Tailwind arrives. OMG. This is awesome! Never have to leave the context. Just stack properties as you like and compose your components!<p>5. HTML looks completely unreadable. It&#x27;s a goddamn mess.<p>6. I want to go back to 2005. No frameworks. Just write non-responsive CSS, one for each screen (yeah, you read that right. I don&#x27;t want to compromise the layout for responsiveness. I&#x27;d rather handcraft one for each device size give or take a few pixels). Custom crafted like a piece of fine art. CSS grid&#x2F;layout is a lot better with css grid and flexbox. Things have improves since the 960-grid days. No frameworks at all and its fucking liberating.<p>Edit: I currently use reset&#x2F;reboot css to clean up default rendering + sass (only use variables + mixins). I am happy like a daisy.')
