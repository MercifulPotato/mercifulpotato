Because Iran is the country which threatens other countries publicly? Because the Pakistani bomb is enough of a problem and nobody really needs another such problem?<p>&gt;They are a regional superpower and the United States invaded and destabilized their neighbor causing widespread chaos throughout the region. Civilian casualties from violence in Iraq following the destabilization of the &#x27;03 war have been estimated at around 200,000.<p>How many of those are the result of Iranian involvement? For that matter, how many civilian casualties are the result of Iranian &#x27;stabilization&#x27; in Syria?<p>&gt;The US did shoot down an Irainian civilian airliner in 1988 and refuse to apologize about it.<p>Read your own cite, there was an agreement and compensation.<p>&gt;And then assassinated one of their generals earlier this year.<p>Who had been involved in attacking American soldiers.<p>&gt;They [SA] don&#x27;t need them. They can do whatever they want in the region while the U.S. looks away and sells them the weapons to do it.<p>SA couldn&#x27;t even respond to the attack on their oil facilities. I was talking about the Iranian nuclear problem though.')
