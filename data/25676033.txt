Most things were one click away from the home page, which was just a bunch of colorful icons. You clicked one icon and could see schedule, grades and attendance. The teacher could edit grades and attendance of the whole class in a single screen.<p>There were no special requirements to drop JS. We just removed JS at some point and never added anything again.<p>Frankly it worked pretty well. The design was made by a professional rather than using off-the-shelf stuff.<p>What killed it was a migration to Bootstrap around 2015 after I left. For no reason. The layout ended up looking outdated compared to what we had, and the animations and javascript dropdowns were too heavy for the University&#x27;s ageing computer fleet. The extra whitespace from default tables made everything too big to fit in a screen. Kind of a pity.<p>But by this point everyone was moving to phones anyway, so the university spent a couple million in an iOS&#x2F;Android app.')
