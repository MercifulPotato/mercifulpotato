The paragraphs starting with &gt;&gt; are written by me.<p>&gt;&gt; How to open links in external default browser directly<p>&gt;&gt; Details: For the last few updates, when I click links in an email, Outlook app first opens the links in an embedded browser, which then has a menu command to open in (an external) browser. I would like to open in the default browser directly like it used to be before. Thanks.<p>Due to the new Edge Webview feature that is rolling out, links open in the app, but we are listening to your feedback!\nFeel free to help us make Outlook better by suggesting it as a feature if you think that would be a nice addition.\nJust go to Settings -&gt; Help and Feedback -&gt; Suggest a Feature. Developments are made based on the statistics generated by the users in this area, so don&#x27;t forget to voice your wishes there!\nThanks! Bye!<p>&gt;&gt; Edge webview may be rolling out, but that is no reason for Microsoft to impose Edge browser onto users. My preferred choice for browser is not Edge.<p>&gt;&gt; Why should this thing even be under suggest a feature? I am not asking for a feature. I am asking what Microsoft is imposing as a &#x27;feature&#x27; onto the users to be taken out.<p>&gt;&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;outlook.uservoice.com&#x2F;forums&#x2F;293346-outlook-for-android&#x2F;suggestions&#x2F;39984514-add-a-setting-to-disable-this-new-built-in-browser" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;outlook.uservoice.com&#x2F;forums&#x2F;293346-outlook-for-andr...</a><p>&gt;&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Outlook&#x2F;comments&#x2F;hndgxn&#x2F;outlook_for_android_web_links_not_using_default&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Outlook&#x2F;comments&#x2F;hndgxn&#x2F;outlook_for...</a><p>&gt;&gt; I guess it&#x27;s getting into the old habits, hmm!<p>Sincere apologies for any inconvenience this problem has caused you. At the moment, all the links will open in the &quot;Edge Browser&quot; an inbuilt browser of the Outlook Mobile app.\nTo view the links on your default web browser you need to tap on &quot;3 Dots&quot; at the bottom and tap on &quot;Open in my browser&quot;\nHowever, I believe this is a great suggestion hence I do recommend that you suggest this feature on the direct channel which directly reviewed by the development team. Developments are made based on the statistics generated by the users in this area, so don&#x27;t forget to voice your wishes there! Just tap the App Settings  Help and Feedback  Suggest a Feature page. Vote it up!<p>We might not have all the features you are looking for but we are getting there slowly.<p>&gt;&gt; No, Outlook for Android was already opening links in the browser of my choice. It&#x27;s getting &#x27;away&#x27; from that. Just because Edge browser is rolling out!<p>That has been changed, but we may have the feature back per users&#x27; requests!')
