It simply implies that the music will eventually stop and leave someone with huge loses.  There doesn&#x27;t need to be a mastermind behind that.  The length of time the music has been playing shouldn&#x27;t be any solace to anyone participating if they can&#x27;t come up with other legitimate reasons why a $20k value is valid.')
