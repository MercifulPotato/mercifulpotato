Its better that a few innocent people sit around for a few days than one guilty person getting out and killing someone.<p>Firstly, pretrial detention <i>averages</i> 50-200 days, with some sitting in jail for <i>years</i> without trial.  Secondly, the vast majority of those in pretrial detention are there for <i>non-violent</i> crimes.  Thirdly, about 60% of the population of jails in the US are in pretrial detention.[0]<p>Remember, these are people who have not been <i>convicted</i> of any crime.<p>Calculate how long could you keep your job, your house and&#x2F;or custody of your children if you were sitting in jail? Two months?  Six?  A year?<p>After you do that, consider that a large segment of Americans would have a hard time scraping up $400 for any sort of emergency -- especially if they can&#x27;t work because they&#x27;re <i>in jail</i>.<p>If there is a genuine flight risk (much more likely for those who can afford bail) or evidence that the accused may be a danger to the community, they should be held until trial without the opportunity to be released.  But <i>only</i> if there is actual evidence that this is so.<p>Otherwise, you&#x27;re essentially criminalizing poverty.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pretrial.org&#x2F;get-involved&#x2F;learn-more&#x2F;why-we-need-pretrial-reform&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pretrial.org&#x2F;get-involved&#x2F;learn-more&#x2F;why-we-need...</a><p>Edit: Reorganized for clarity.')
