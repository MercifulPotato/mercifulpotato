Item(by='pisteoff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610584021, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25761353, text='&gt; From what I can tell, there&#x27;s very little enthusiasm for online education, on the part of either professors or students. Pretty much everyone is eager to get back to normal, and I&#x27;m fairly confident that this is exactly what is going to happen.<p>This is probably true from a faculty and student position. However, as an IT person for a university, nothing would get me to quit faster than being forced back into the office. I would leave this job in a heartbeat and go make WAAAAAAY more working a remote job in industry. Given current hiring freezes, budget shortfalls, and low, uncompetitive salary ranges, I don&#x27;t think universities are in a position to lose many IT personnel.<p>I&#x27;m not the only staff member who thinks this. Universities should prepare for a mass staff exodus if they try to get us back on campus.')
