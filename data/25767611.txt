So, in principle, when you reverse the computation, you recover the entire energy you input into the system.<p>However, in order to read out the output of computation, or to clear your register to prepare for new computation, you do generate heat energy and that is Landauer&#x27;s principle.<p>In other words, you can run a reversible computer back and forth and do as many computations as you want (imagine a perfect ball bouncing in a frictionless environment), as long as you don&#x27;t read out the results of your computation.<p>[1] NOT gate is reversible, and you can create reversible versions of AND and OR by adding some wires to store the input.')
