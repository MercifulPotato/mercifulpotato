What matters is the actual diameter of the aperture, not the ratio<p>It&#x27;s actually the f stop that matters for diffraction, not the absolute diameter. Roughly, this is because the light spreads more with a longer focal length because it has a longer distance over which to diverge. If you crunch the numbers this exactly compensates for the larger absolute diameter of the aperture.
