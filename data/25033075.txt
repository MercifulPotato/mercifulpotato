I am embarrassingly weak at squats. I have done 140kg for reps (I&#x27;m 78kg), but it just doesn&#x27;t feel  right. Eventually the mental load just became too much so I stopped squatting.<p>But deadlifts I seem naturally good at. I did a 200kg deadlift (2.5x bodyweight) which I&#x27;m proud of, but honestly I think I could go much heavier if I really wanted to train it. But I decided to leave it there as the risk of injury becomes too high after that. Nowadays I don&#x27;t train it regularly but find I can still deadlift 160kg (2x bodyweight) at any time. It really helps my back and my shoulders.')
