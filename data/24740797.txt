It has his usual insight into what really are the rules behind the rules, and what are the true incentives beneath the surface.  It has some of that same sense of resignation, and even goes a bit into where that comes from.<p>---<p>Programming note<p>I don’t know. Mostly I am dazed and heartbroken all the time, and it\nseems trivial and disrespectful to write a column about finance these\ndays. But this is a financial newsletter, and like a lot of my readers\nI like having a mostly safe space for finance, so here we are.<p>A theme of this column over the past few years has been legal realism,\nthe idea that “law,” really, is just what officials do about\ndisputes. Rules, the written laws, the constitution, are all “law”\nonly insofar as they predict or explain the actions of public\nofficials, or persuade those officials to do things. “That is all\ntheir importance, except as pretty playthings,” as the great legal\nrealist Karl Llewellyn put it. If this column sometimes seems cynical,\nit is mostly Karl Llewellyn’s fault.<p>It seems to me that one central argument of the past few days has been\nabout whether people with power should have to follow rules at\nall. America has good rules about freedom of speech and assembly and\nreligion; it has a president who violently dispersed a peaceful\nprotest and drove priests from their church so that he could pose for\nphotographs outside of it. America has good rules against unreasonable\nsearches and seizures, about the right to a trial by jury and due\nprocess of law; it has a long history of police killing black people\nwith impunity.<p>A message of the protests is that the police should have to follow the\nsame rules as everybody else, that when they break the law they should\nface consequences. A message of the response to the protests is: No,\nthey shouldn’t. Is the law what it says? Or is it the raw fact of what\nthe people with the guns and the tear gas do? I think I know the\nanswer and it makes me sad.')
