The first is that MSTR can get really cheap loans because they&#x27;re essentially a profitable business that can service those loans. Although I would caution that the &quot;But it&#x27;s got a track record dating back to 1989&quot; stuff - the only reason MSTR is in this position is because it hasn&#x27;t really grown in pace with the market. They&#x27;re an income stock not a growth stock, and their business analytics experience tells you nothing about their investment experience.<p>The second part though is - does investing in bitcoin make any sense? Well in my opinion no. MSTR has no strategic advantage in buying BTC. It&#x27;s also extremely worrying that they&#x27;ve crossed the rubicon, they are now leveraging up to buy more. You don&#x27;t just have to factor in whether this current debt looks like it&#x27;s servicable. You have to question whether this company is going to continue levering up to buy bitcoin. Also, the down side risks the article mentions are like &quot;Let&#x27;s assume no downsides&quot;. Ok <i>assuming</i> that BTC goes down they can service the debt with other income. Fine. As long as they don&#x27;t issue more debt which they likely will. Also, even if they can service the debt that doesn&#x27;t change the fact they&#x27;ve made a bad investment of several hundred million dollars.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t include downsides such as &quot;Someone hacks you and all your BTC are gone&quot; or &quot;The US issues a new regulation changing the tax regime massively increasing your tax exposure&quot;.<p>The reason people are bearish on this move is because it&#x27;s a guy with no busines in investing just punting everything he can onto BTC, which is fine for him to do, but it&#x27;s not a particularly smart thing for him to do.  I mean one obvious concern is that this company is probably trading at a significant discount vs it&#x27;s assets now, so what&#x27;s going to stop someone coming along and saying &quot;Hey, $X a share, I&#x27;ll liquidate the BTC and hand it back to investors&quot; when BTC has it&#x27;s next dip?')
