Item(by='baobabKoodaa', descendants=None, kids=[25127949], score=None, time=1605608528, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25119359, text='&gt; Because it is not legitimate for a court to treat something that was not intentionally (ie, with something other than DKIM) signed as a signed contract. If one party did not sign that contract, a DKIM &#x27;signature&#x27; doesn&#x27;t change that. Conversely, if you have a argument that the document should be treated as a valid contract despite not having been signed, the lack of DKIM &#x27;signature&#x27; is obviously irrelevant.<p>Not legitimate where? In Finland, where I live, there is no restriction on the form that a contract must take. A contract can be scribbled on a napkin, a contract can be oral, and yes, a contract can be written in email. You&#x27;re claiming that a document should not be treated as a valid contract if it has not been signed, but Finnish law is pretty clear that a signature is not required for a contract to be valid. Furthermore, you claim that if a signature is not a requirement for a contract to be valid, then the lack of signature is &quot;obviously&quot; irrelevant. This is not obvious at all, and in fact is not true at all. As you surely know, sometimes the parties to a contract dispute what was agreed upon. Having a written contract is superior to an oral contract, because it is harder to dispute what was written, than it is to dispute what was said orally. In the same vein, it is harder to dispute a written contract with signatures, than a written contract lacking signatures. And in the same vein, it is harder to dispute an email that is DKIM validated, than an email that is lacking any sender validation.')
