Which Kurds? Istanbul Kurds? Black Sea Kurds? Eastern border Kurds? South-Eastern mountain Kurds?  My neighborhood in Beşiktaş is 30% Kurd, and 70% of the neighborhood voted HDP (the Kurdish party), including my atheist, liberal family of scientists and engineers.<p>Kurds hate Tayipp too. That&#x27;s why the HDP won 13% of the vote which finally gave them parliamentary representation in 2015, then again maintained the in the post-coup election.<p>I know Kurds in my neighborhood who <i>RAN</i> down to the bridge to fight the Gulenist tank drivers with their fists. They stood in the streets and screamed at the F-16s flying over the city all night long, and they throw rocks and shot at the black helicopter which hovered over Fulya looking for a place to land. When they realized the helicopter was going to try and land at the BJK youth football field in Dikilitaş, no less than 50 of them went to that field and started shooting at the helicopter, which eventually went down and landed in Besiktas stadium.<p>This isn&#x27;t a Hollywood movie. The good guys cannot just snap their fingers, fire a few bullets, and win liberation.<p>Tell me exactly, why did Obama and Trump harbor Gülen? Did you know that the secretary of education, DeVos, has thrown fundraising events with Gülen, because he is a fellow billionaire who made his fortune running religious charter schools (Türk lisesli) throughout the world, scamming voucher programs, just like DeVos.')
