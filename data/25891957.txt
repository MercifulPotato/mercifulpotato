We tried to look for platform similar to codecademy or freecodecamp but with visual programming language so students do not need to worry on the programming syntax. Eventually I built this for our own use and now turning it into a SaaS product to see if other cs teachers would find it useful.<p>There&#x27;re still a lot of work in progress and I plan to add more interactive activities related to different computer science topics. Love to hear any feedback from the HN community!')
