I&#x27;m positive they&#x27;re going to change policies again in the future and fuck over people who decided to go with this zero monetary cost RHEL offering.<p>&gt; When we announced our intent to transition to CentOS Stream, we did so with a plan to create new programs to address use cases traditionally served by CentOS Linux.<p>This is a load of bullshit. If that was their plan they would have announced both of these changes together. It&#x27;s not like they were under time pressure to get the announcement out.')
