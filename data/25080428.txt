The last thing I want when I&#x27;m trying to get work done is: an unsolicited notification that OS updates are available, with no direct option to decline to update and dismiss the notification. I&#x27;d much rather update my system by issuing &quot;pacman -Syu&quot; on my own terms, and I consider Linux distros to offer a superior user experience in this regard.')
