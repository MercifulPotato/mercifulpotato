Item(by='stiray', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610617826, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25769570, text='&gt;  I got my higher education for free. I expect to save nothing for my children or their education. I expect to have to put aside very little for retirement.<p>Exactly this. European social democracy allows people to have relatively calm life without burden to start their careers with huge school debt. Or worrying about health insurances. Once you will have family (OP), you will see that not saving for their health insurances and school also helps a lot and I wouldn&#x27;t change this for USA system. On the other side, it is very simple for software engineer to get a job anywhere in the world, but do take into account pros and cons.<p>Anyway, to the topic, the way of raising salaries in any sector has always been the same. Form a syndicate, get enough people to join and go on strike (and if you live in EU you are very well covered and protected regarding syndicate activities).')
