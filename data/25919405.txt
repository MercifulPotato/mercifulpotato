For instance, the Asus TUF Dash F14 lasted a similar amount of time at 6:32. This is a fairly significant drop from the Zephyrus G14 from last year, which ran for 11:32, though it has a lower resolution display.<p>For a 62Wh battery, it isn&#x27;t particularly impressive. One would have to wonder if a larger, cooler chassis would help with battery life.')
