Item(by='Karrot_Kream', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604859232, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25024746, text='&gt; Nearly every consequential state fell at, or beyond, the tail end of 538&#x27;s confidence interval<p>While I haven&#x27;t checked each and every individual state, I&#x27;m pretty sure they all fell within the CI. Tail end yes, but within the CI.<p>&gt; (BTW, who uses 80%? and not 90-95%?)<p>... The left edge of the 80% CI shows a Biden loss. The point was 538&#x27;s model was not any more confident than that about a Biden win. So yeah, not the highest confidence.<p>&gt; Deny it all you want, gaslight, cover your eyes, whatever -- but clear, convincing, overwhelming evidence of a systematic flaw or bias in the underlying polls is right there in front of you.<p>Posting a bunch of media articles doesn&#x27;t prove anything. I&#x27;m not saying there isn&#x27;t systemic bias here, but your argument is simply that you wanted the polls to be more accurate and you wanted the media to write better articles about uncertainty. There&#x27;s no rigorous definition of &quot;systemic bias&quot; here that I can even try to prove through data, all you&#x27;ve done is post links. You seem to be more angry at the media coverage than the actual model, but that&#x27;s not the same as the model being incorrect.<p>Anyway I think there&#x27;s no more for us to gain here by talking. Personally, I never trust the media on anything even somewhat mathematical. They can&#x27;t even get pop science right, how can they get something as important as an election statistical model correct.')
