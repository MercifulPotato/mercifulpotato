He wanted to get away, maybe from something and maybe from everything.<p>&gt; Everyone who goes into the woods is trying to get away from something.<p>&gt; Everyone, at some point, has wanted to put their phone in a garbage can and head off with a fake name and a wad of cash.<p>Since you are here I want to mention how off-putting this rhetoric is to me, a person who likes being outdoors, who doesn&#x27;t have problems around spend all day refreshing the NYT or twitter or instagram, a person who genuinely likes solitude. It&#x27;s almost as if urbanity is now synonymous with a neurotic steady state of over-exposure and any act of finding a moment of peace in the outdoors is itself a futile act of desperation -- an attempt to flee modernity. It just doesn&#x27;t ring true to me.')
