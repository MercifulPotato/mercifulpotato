Thank you for the pointers.<p>That makes me really happy.<p>I&#x27;ll narrow my request to a suggestion for something easier (indeed, easy enough I can do a bit myself): more documentation and tutorials. I think I&#x27;ll get on that (although on my own pages; I&#x27;m not ambitious enough this month to contribute upstream). I did a fair bit of searching at one point, and didn&#x27;t find this stuff. Now, I can try to come up with good kids activities.<p>I will also mention: Most kids can do pretty advanced stuff, if introduced correctly. We&#x27;ve been wedded to a particular order of teaching math for a very long time, which places things like convolutions as late college-level math, and long division as late elementary. In fact, convolution is a lot easier than long division. That&#x27;s true for a lot of &quot;advanced&quot; math.')
