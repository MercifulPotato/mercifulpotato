A medical treatment for the caused damage would be called a cure in this case. Vaccines that stop the auto immune response are not cures. A somewhat helpful example is pancreas transplant for type 1 diabetics: the person with the transplant would be &quot;cured&quot; (ie they&#x27;d have their own insulin production) but the auto immune disease will destroy the donor pancreas eventually. Hopefully in the future we will have complete, synergistic treatments that take care of both.')
