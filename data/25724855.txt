There is a massive difference between biased reporting and openly distributing lies.<p>You may have missed it being in Germany, but for 3 years CNN, NYT, MSNBC, et al reported 24&#x2F;7 that Trump colluded with the Russians to win the election.  The Justice Dept spent millions thoroughly investigaing that claim and it turned out to be all lies.')
