Because of this I did all the programming, but I made him draw the main hero and all the monsters. He&#x27;s got an interesting style. You can see the game here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;1226170&#x2F;Forest_of_MATH&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;1226170&#x2F;Forest_of_MATH&#x2F;</a><p>Of course, the game itself is meant for him (and other kids) to play and practice basic math.<p>I hope he&#x27;ll get to program his own games in a couple of years.')
