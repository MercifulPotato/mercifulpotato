The evidence that has been presented for fraud is ordinary and could not have affected the outcome of the election. That&#x27;s consistent with what every one of the ~3000 county clerks in the U.S. will tell you about every election.<p>A much bigger issue is election fraud including voter suppression. What has pissed off Republicans this time around, is expansive mail-in balloting as a result of COVID mitigation. It managed to expand the voting pool against their wishes by making it generally easier for people to vote. It&#x27;s difficult for judges to look at this and go, &quot;ok so your legislative intent is to make it hard for some people to vote, but these are still legally cast votes per the legislature&#x27;s own legislation, and you just don&#x27;t like the outcome so you want me to disenfranchise them?&quot; That&#x27;s a no. A judge isn&#x27;t going to do that.')
