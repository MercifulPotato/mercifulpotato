What we noticed with a lot of other systems is that you end up with a situation where you&#x27;re creating content, and then at some point want to share it with a friend&#x2F;co-worker&#x2F;lover. With systems structured as you describe, what usually happens is the user just copy-pastes the content into their messaging app of choice (or email or similar) and that&#x27;s that. The problem with this is that the info then immediately becomes stale. If I edit the content at some point down the road, in order for you to get the updated version I would need to send it to you on Signal again. With Supernotes, because you&#x27;re sharing the actual card object on the SN platform, any changes you make to cards are reflected in everyone else&#x27;s system.<p>In my case I think the simplest example is recipes: I have a sister that is a pastry chef, and we like sharing various recipes with each other. With the way Supernotes is structured (around cards + multi-parent hierarchies), she can share recipe cards with me that I then integrate alongside the recipe cards that I&#x27;ve made myself. If at any point she updates one of these cards, it&#x27;s updated for me too. But unlike with a shared folder&#x2F;file system, with a multi-parent card system I can easily hide her content or move it somewhere else on my system while on her system it continues to look exactly how <i>she</i> wants it to look. This was difficult enough with a centralized system and would&#x27;ve been practically impossible with a &quot;bring your own dropbox&quot; structured system, which is why we went with the former in the end.<p>But absolutely, we want users to still feel like they wholly own their own content (because they do[1]), which is why we eventually plan to add E2EE capability for your cards as well as continuing to build out our API[2] (want users to be able to easily get at their content without having to go through our interface) and export functionality.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supernotes.app&#x2F;terms&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supernotes.app&#x2F;terms&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.supernotes.app&#x2F;docs&#x2F;swagger" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.supernotes.app&#x2F;docs&#x2F;swagger</a>')
