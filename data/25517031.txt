To be honest I have no idea what the implications of that are - but I guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s research!<p>Re: effect system.<p>The reason that I think algebraic effects are so cool is that they allow for trackable, side-effectful, and powerful abstractions.<p>To me it sounds like Flix&#x27;s Pure&#x2F;Impure effects offer a fine-grained form of taint tracking. Why do you think I should be excited about this? For example, why not Haskell&#x27;s monad solution?<p>I hope I don&#x27;t come off as confrontational, I&#x27;m genuinely interested :-).')
