The winter is incredibly harsh, and the wind was like nothing I&#x27;ve ever experienced. In the course of days otherwise non-eventful winter driving, I counted at least 3 trucks that had been blown off the highway. It&#x27;s super remote, and some of the locals I met were not particularly friendly. I&#x27;m sure this all appeals to some folks, but man - it does not appeal to many of the folks I know. There&#x27;s a reason why the population is so low.<p>If you&#x27;re actually the kind of person who is leaving a solid blue start and cares about &quot;tipping&quot; the balance somewhere else, you&#x27;d be much better off going to a state that&#x27;s already purple or trending that way. Ie, Texas, North Carolina, Virginia.')
