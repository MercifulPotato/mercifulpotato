Modern federated systems don&#x27;t have a different server for sending and one for receiving. ActivyPub implementations are usually a single application with a database (like Pleroma) or a single app plus db&#x2F;reddis&#x2F;elasticsearch(optional) like Mastodon. Mastodon has official Docker containers, and it&#x27;s not difficult to build one for Pleroma.<p>So you can make something &quot;like e-mail&quot; that isn&#x27;t as bad as SMTP&#x2F;IMAP&#x2F;SPF&#x2F;DKIM&#x2F;etc... I&#x27;ve been considering hosting my own Gogs or Gitlab or one of the other locally hosted git platforms. I&#x27;d like to see something that allows pull&#x2F;merge requests between them (you&#x27;d need some spam prevention of course; maybe require a message and a follow before people are allowed to push an request to your server).<p>This project ... doesn&#x27;t seem like it does that at all. It&#x27;s a desktop application .. with no real web view into your projects. I feel like it&#x27;s missing a component, a service run in a docker container that you can program with your Device ID and push your public repos to for others to see.')
