But you need multiple nodes for etcd... So you currently have either a shared database for all control processes, or 3 nodes per control process, or 3 processes per control node, etc. Either way it seems weird.<p>I get that SQLite wouldn&#x27;t work, but it also doesn&#x27;t make sense to have one completely independent database per process. So I imagine you&#x27;re using a shared database, at which poitlnt etcd starts to make more sense. It&#x27;s just not that widely understood in production as sql databases, and has limitations which you might reach in a few years.')
