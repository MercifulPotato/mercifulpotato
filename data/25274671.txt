Even Google isn&#x27;t the driving factor behind a likely military invasion.<p>Actually there&#x27;s one other possibility: that this is an audition before Google acqui-hires eFabless.<p>Can&#x27;t say I blame them.  Running MPW shuttles is an incredibly tough business; of the three leading shuttle providers (MOSIS, IMEC, CMP) two are non-profits affiliated with universities and the third used to be.  There isn&#x27;t a lot of profit in it.<p>And I can&#x27;t really blame Google either...
