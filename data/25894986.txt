There are picnic areas along the water that are nice. On the other hand, Slab City is more of a disaster than he writes. The residents seem to be of the mind to treat journalists nicely. Maybe they expect something good to happen in return. When I visited there Salvation Mountain had been taken over by acid casualties who put up threatening signs reading &quot;keep out.&quot; When I stopped to take a picture they came towards me car and I feared I might be shot, expecting to hear the whiz of a bullet by my ear. Slab City is a disgusting homeless camp, full of mental illness and anger.')
