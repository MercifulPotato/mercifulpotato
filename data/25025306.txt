I couldn&#x27;t take screenshots, use the camera, or use any functionality in any apps that would rely on the photo gallery. Now, that&#x27;s me, a long time Android app developer, and it took me an hour to figure out what the hell happened (wiping the data for said content provider fixed everything, obviously). Imagine what would a regular user do if they encountered this issue? I had a fully-stock installation too, didn&#x27;t even unlock the bootloader.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why modern software has to suck so much. If you can&#x27;t perform some operation for some reason, for the love of god, at least show a sensible error message so people who haven&#x27;t spent ridiculous amounts of time reading the source code of your product as part of their job can troubleshoot their systems. Not &quot;something failed, go read logcat, maybe it helps, good luck&quot;.')
