And so they configured their system so that before I can use Citrix (which works perfectly fine on Linux) their piece of crap written for Windows or Macos (no Linux version) must run and report what is installed and running on my machine for their own silly needs.<p>No, that is not &quot;reasonable&quot; and for that my honest middle finger.')
