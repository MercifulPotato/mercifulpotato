Item(by='J-dawg', descendants=None, kids=[25790247], score=None, time=1610712301, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25789427, text='The UK took a wrong turn when it gave the police their own extra-judicial justice system.<p>The system of police cautions, warnings and fixed penalties allow the police to administer punishment with none of the due process that a court would provide.<p>The idea of a &quot;police caution&quot; is a misnomer that implies it&#x27;s just harmless warning, when in fact it can affect the course of someone&#x27;s life many years later.<p>Furthermore, people are blackmailed into accepting these cautions under the threat of going to trial and potentially receiving a more severe punishment after conviction.<p>Even more outrageous is the retention of records from the PREVENT programme and &quot;non-crime hate incidents&quot;. These are people who have not even committed a crime or been arrested.<p>The whole system stinks, and given that most people manage to avoid interaction with the police it is sadly unlikely to get the scrutiny it deserves.<p>The outrageous behaviour of (some of) the police during recent lockdowns actually gives me a little hope, as it as drawn widespread attention to the way they routinely abuse their power.')
