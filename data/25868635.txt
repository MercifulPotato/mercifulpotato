Idk how you can deny that?<p>80+ million of us Americans voted in record numbers for the left leaning candidate, our biggest media platforms promote left leaning message, right wing individuals have been censored, etc.<p>Maybe not everybody in the United States is left leaning, but I wouldn’t call this a politically right leaning country.<p>Also, the only irony I see is that this thread continues.
