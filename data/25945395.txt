If the US or China start mass producing advanced autonomous drone swarms you can be 100% sure no amount of grapeshot will save you.<p>Think about kamikaze vs US ships back in ww2, but you have hundred times the number of drones, they&#x27;re smaller, faster, quieter, more lethal and you can barely detect them before they&#x27;re on you. The grapeshot might work if you have 100 soldiers vs 1 drone, not in 100 vs 100 or 100 vs 1000')
