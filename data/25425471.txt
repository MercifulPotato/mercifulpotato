Key to success likely were:<p>- a population that had experience with prior pandemics and was thus willing to play along<p>- a strong centralized government (this is a guess, and I&#x27;m not just talking about the power, but specifically the centralization - other nations that have states&#x2F;provinces each implementing their own policies showed the dangers of that approach, e.g. USA, Switzerland, Germany)<p>- extremely aggressive contact tracing and enforced quarantine (for high risk cases, they were put in hotels or barracks, not told &quot;please stay home&quot;). Not just contacts but also contacts-of-contacts (the latter were only ordered to home quarantine).<p>AFAIK they didn&#x27;t even have much of a shutdown, because the quarantining was so effective.')
