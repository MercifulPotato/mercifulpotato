It was the car owned by my driving instructor.\nThe car was small(needed for reversing between slaloms 6 inches from the side minors without touching) with cheap and available parts even in the Caribbean and easy to replace the clutch after students burnt it out learning to drive.<p>My girlfriend&#x27;s mother even bought one for herself after I recommended the same diving instructor.<p>I had the car for a few months after a hurricane ripped us a new one, smashing the rear glass of the car in the process. The island was shut down for the outside world for weeks and it wasn&#x27;t for months until a replacement glass could be import from the Suzuki dealership. Being that is was a flat glass I simply cut a big piece of plexiglass and used that for the time being. \nThe rear hatch was also big enough to fit a sizable generator I needed to pickup that could not fit in my family&#x27;s Corolla or Sentra.<p>The 3 cylinder engine surprisingly had enough power to climb 45-50 degree hills(needed when your island is all hills), albeit slowly.')
