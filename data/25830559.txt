I&#x27;m now against the second amendment. Not the school shootings, not the movie theaters; I&#x27;ve shot and handled many guns, but seeing this total disconnect from reality shows me that Americans cannot responsibly handle the option to elect somebody, accept the results either way, let alone carry a firearm.<p>The whole notion of it takes just one good gun owner is total garbage. This is the law and order crowd, this is the crowd of &quot;Just one good guy with a gun&quot;. Total garbage.<p>Trump lost. Get over it.')
