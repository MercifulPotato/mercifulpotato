The pipe dream that technology can absolve humanity from unavoidable need for trust and faith is perhaps improving our material situation in the short term. But human psychology is not easily augmented by technology. Deep down, to face the uncertainties and the inevitable lack of full knowledge of reality, we strive for the safety of faith and trust.<p>Trying to eliminate it will push a massive amount of humans to reactionary action.<p>And when humans can&#x27;t get safety out of trust, they get it using force and control.<p>The art is to balance these, not to imagine you can eliminate it.<p>BTW: I&#x27;m far from being religious. My idea of faith is more abstract than the religious one.')
