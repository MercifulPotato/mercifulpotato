(i.e. give statistics per-dimension)<p>I&#x27;m going to assume yes, they would need to disclose that. That scenario sounds awfully similar to some of the terms the FTC uses when discussing the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA):<p>&gt; Under traditional credit scoring\nmodels, companies compare known credit characteristics of a consumer—such as past late payments—with\nhistorical data that shows how people with the same credit characteristics performed over time in meeting\ntheir credit obligations. Similarly, predictive analytics products may compare a known characteristic of a\nconsumer to other consumers with the same characteristic to predict whether that consumer will meet his or\nher credit obligations. The difference is that, rather than comparing a traditional credit characteristic, such\nas debt payment history, these products may use non-traditional characteristics—such as a consumer’s zip\ncode, social media usage, or shopping history—to create a report about the creditworthiness of consumers\nthat share those non-traditional characteristics, which a company can then use to make decisions about\nwhether that consumer is a good credit risk. The standards applied to determine the applicability of the\nFCRA in a Commission enforcement action, however, are the same.<p>&gt; Only a fact-specific analysis will ultimately determine whether a practice is subject to or violates the\nFCRA, and as such, companies should be mindful of the law when using big data analytics to make FCRA covered eligibility determinations.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ftc.gov&#x2F;system&#x2F;files&#x2F;documents&#x2F;reports&#x2F;big-data-tool-inclusion-or-exclusion-understanding-issues&#x2F;160106big-data-rpt.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ftc.gov&#x2F;system&#x2F;files&#x2F;documents&#x2F;reports&#x2F;big-data-...</a>')
