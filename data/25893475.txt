Item(by='gregmac', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611507199, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25892297, text='When I&#x27;m coding, I generally have code on one, and the other has a browser with documentation, notes, issue tracker, or just used for searches etc. Usually that monitor is split and also has chat visible.<p>When I&#x27;m testing&#x2F;debugging, one monitor might be the web app I&#x27;m working on, the other is the code I&#x27;m stepping through. Or I&#x27;ll be tailing a log file or watching something in a database while using the app.<p>I do lots of client&#x2F;server stuff, so sometimes I have a monitor showing the server-side (web UI and&#x2F;or logs) and the other showing client-side (cli, logs, and&#x2F;or local UI). The key useful thing is seeing the client do an action and send something to the server, and seeing the server instantly react: that&#x27;s not possible when you can&#x27;t see everything.<p>In some cases, I&#x27;m debugging remotely, and a monitor will be partly or completely dedicated to ssh&#x2F;rdp&#x2F;vnc to the remote system(s), with the other used for browser or cli app I&#x27;m testing. Usually chat, documentation, source, issue tracker is mixed in there too.<p>There&#x27;s a couple things I work on that have long running builds (10+ minutes) or integration tests that takes a bit over 30 mins. Both are long enough that I&#x27;ll do something else while waiting and suddenly 2 hours pass before I remember, so I like keeping the build status page visible somewhere to avoid that.<p>Even for non-work&#x2F;coding sometimes I just have YouTube or Netflix open (either 1&#x2F;4 window or full-screen) while I&#x27;m browsing the web on another.<p>To me, working on my laptop is doable, but feels like having one hand tied behind my back when compared to working with multiple monitors and a proper keyboard and mouse.')
