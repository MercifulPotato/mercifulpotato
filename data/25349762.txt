Item(by='na85', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607453689, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25349010, text='&gt;The real problem that was never addressed is the FAA&#x27;s complete lack of competence when it comes to certifying the safeness of flight control systems. The same incompetent group of people that approved the planes in the first place are still in charge.<p>Your belligerent tone is probably what&#x27;s netting you the downvotes but this portion is more or less true.<p>The FAA has clearly demonstrated they cannot competently evaluate systems like MCAS, whether because of a lack of technical expertise or because of too little staffpower, or some other institutional reason.  I suspect a mix of both; as we saw from the crashes the interplay between MCAS and the rest of the aircraft has subtleties that were obviously not considered.')
