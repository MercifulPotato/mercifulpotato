Gore on party lines back in 2000. But when the people who are partial towards you reject your case, that&#x27;s a sign that your case is really bad. If they could find a believable way to let you win, they probably would, but they just can&#x27;t.<p>So the case against Trump&#x27;s election claims isn&#x27;t undermined by the partiality of the judicial system, it is actually strengthened by it.')
