They have an entire system where returns are handled and are either placed back on the shelf slightly marked down or sent to be refurbed. There&#x27;s nothing &quot;shady&quot; about what I described. It&#x27;s exactly what they want you to do.<p>I would need a source for that.  I don’t see how selling 1 item and having to mark down 4 others to refurb price results in a profit.<p>It’s also been in the news that stores keep track of people returning items, and ban them if they cost the store too much money.')
