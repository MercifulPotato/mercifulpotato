If I take it too early into the migraine it sometimes doesn&#x27;t work.  I will intentionally sit with the migraine for around an hour, or until it gets bad enough, then take sumatriptan and wait the 1h30m to 2 hours for the pain to go away.  2-3 hours of a headache is far better than a day of a full on migraine.  Once I take it and it doesn&#x27;t work it builds up resistance for at least 12 hours, so I&#x27;m stuck.  I&#x27;ll take the headache.')
