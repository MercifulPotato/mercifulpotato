It seems to me that lidar has a consistency in its ability to detect objects that computer vision based techniques just don&#x27;t have. While cameras may eventually be able to achieve the same thing, I would argue that lidar will always be as safe or safer, and for that reason I think it will be the only acceptable version if self driving breaks out in the next few years.')
