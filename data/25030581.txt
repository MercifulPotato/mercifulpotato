Now redundant since R3D decoding on GPU was released. RED&#x27;s overpriced, unreliable hardware is my #1 gripe, but not really relevant to this discussion.<p>&gt; I was there when Whitmore got the email about redcode, and not using the official SDK. That we &quot;had illegally reverse engineered proprietary code&quot;.<p>I didn&#x27;t know that a non-SDK-based REDCODE integration was ever in Nuke. If correct, to be honest that was an unwise move anyway; RED have always warned against reverse engineering in their licence agreements (and yes, reverse engineering <i>was</i> necessary to read R3Ds without the SDK, it was <i>never</i> plain vanilla JPEG2000 and didn&#x27;t use the tar format at all). If Whitmore allowed it, he should have expected RED&#x27;s response.<p>The legal grey area is that reverse engineering a <i>file format</i> isn&#x27;t the same thing as reverse engineering proprietary executable code by disassembly. However, after having had a similar run-in with RED regarding reverse engineering, I have no doubt that Jannard&#x27;s legal team would have persisted and come out on top.<p>&gt; I was there looking at the RED forums where they were sharing the cracked version.<p>Sure, some end users pirated Storm like other Foundry software because the licence manager had been cracked long before, but that wasn&#x27;t RED&#x27;s fault.<p>&gt; RED saw the software, stole the interface and made a free version.<p>The interfaces were no more similar that any two &quot;pro&quot; video apps (REDCINE-X looked particularly awful at launch). RED built a competing app with an overlapping feature set. This happens all the time.<p>&gt; &quot;it turns out they like storm a lot, but not enough to pay for it&quot;<p>And why should they have? RED established a team that could develop their app without charging end users (a loss leader, I suppose), while still remaining profitable. The Foundry failed, or declined, to do so. Storm could have been expanded to cater for the needs of the DSLR (and later mirrorless) filmmaking communities; a much bigger market than indie RED shooters that was crying out for reliable and affordable post software. Instead, Storm was assimilated into Hiero with a big price tag for a handful of customers.<p>Years later, Bill told me that Storm was ultimately killed &quot;because we didn&#x27;t understand the low-end market&quot;. They could have just asked.')
