If I hit dark mode content, it just has to wait until I&#x27;m indoors.  But usually I&#x27;m looking for something because I need it at that moment.  If I can&#x27;t view on potential illustrated video, I will try the next one I can view.<p>People taking the time to produce content often do care about attracting and keeping viewers&#x2F;subscribers, and this is a case where an accessibility issue will reduce the number of viewers.<p>I highly appreciate the effort people put into sharing their knowledge, but I find it really disappointing when I can tell that their effort is wasted on some potential viewers.  I may be weird (no, I am, but that&#x27;s not necessarily a negative), but I know I&#x27;m not the only person with this opinion.')
