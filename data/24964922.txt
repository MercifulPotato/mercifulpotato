We are too far down the rabbit hole in that sense. What does it bode for mankind? I don&#x27;t know, but I suspect that the future won&#x27;t be bright. It&#x27;s frightening.<p>I sometimes feel like everything is burning around me, as in, on this planet. Everything is burning and yet we pretend it isn&#x27;t because we are frightened of the possible consequences of acknowledging things aren&#x27;t doing too great. We are frightened of real change because it might cause everything to come down. So instead we let our lives spin out of control and hope for the best. At this point I&#x27;m not even speaking about technology, but this troubles me deeply.')
