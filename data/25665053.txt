Lockdown causes people to lose their jobs, children to miss school, and others to suffer problems with mental health (although to use your phrasing, this would just be &quot;a few percent&quot; of the population) but it saves people&#x27;s lives and health.<p>I&#x27;m also really disappointed that people don&#x27;t get the idea that people dying and having long-term health issues doesn&#x27;t screw the economy too.')
