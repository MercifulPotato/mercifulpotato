Which is why USB-C docks with video worked (2 lanes for USB, 2 lanes for DisplayPort) and why 2x2 isn&#x27;t supposed to require new cables.<p>Thunderbolt still works at 20gbps over &quot;normal&quot; superspeed USB-C cables; the markup you&#x27;re paying is generally for cables rated for 40gbps.')
