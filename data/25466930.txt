Massive amounts of hate from gamers, bad reviews, bad press, on and on.  They overhyped and under-delivered.<p>Four years later, they&#x27;ve released half a dozen major updates, fixed hordes of bugs and have seriously made the game 10x better than it was at launch.  It is now fully the game that was originally promised and more.  It&#x27;s also gone on sale with a major discount several times.<p>Now that may be an extreme scenario, but if a little shop like Hello Games can do it, I think CDPR at least has a shot.  I will be happy to wait.')
