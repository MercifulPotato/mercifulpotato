It is inspired by my frustration with developing UIs in the traditional desktop toolkits (Qt, etc) and with web tech (HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JavaScript).<p>My experience is primarily in C++ (Keywords: C++17, C++14, C++11). Also comfortable working with straight C (Keywords: C89, C90, C99, C11), although less experience with The C Way™. I have working knowledge of Python, and have piddled around in Common Lisp and Haskell but nothing non-trivial unfortunately. As I type this I&#x27;m playing with embedding Mono in a C++ project I&#x27;m working on to script in C#')
