I never thought I&#x27;d see that on HN...<p>My PhD and PostDoc were on SAR and ISAR imaging, doing maximum likelihood phase corrections before the FFTs to reduce motion blur.<p>I was sponsored by the Australian Defence Science and Technology Organisation. My summer holidays were at the Edinburgh airforce base near Adelaide, with a van full of radar gear snapping stepped-frequency radar reflections from aircraft coming in to land.<p>(If anyone from my time as DSTO sees this, say hi... my email address is in my profile)')
