One professor may drone on and on for a few hours during the lecture and have no &quot;showmanship&quot;. Another may refuse to put his lectures online and demands that you he there at 8:30 am to watch the lecture live and only live. Some professors just refuse to change with the times. Too many educators want to try and fit an in-person education style into an online format. That&#x27;s the wrong way to go about it.')
