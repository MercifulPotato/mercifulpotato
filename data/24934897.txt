Or do you think that food and shelter just appears like magic in front of everyone?<p>Yeah, essentially.  We need so few people dedicated to this line of work because of the wonderful scientific, technological and logistic discoveries of the past century.  The fact that we have people that starve today is a failure of culture and politics and nothing more.  With such a rich soil in which to build an advanced society, the fact that we haven&#x27;t produced the creativity to produce a more advanced society is not exactly alarming.  It says more about the human mind and condition than anything else.<p>Uhm, we already do all of that stuff that you mentioned with a tiny subset of the population working on all of it, hence the concept of a &#x27;service&#x27; economy.  We could replace &#x27;service&#x27; with any number of alternative concepts that could advance humanity far more significantly.')
