There are also failed&#x2F;broken items. Assess all this, orbit some bigelow\nhabitats, say 4, one pair at the Russian end and another pair at the NASA end - start a progressive rebuild, orbit new parts and use salvaged as needed. Some old sections will remain as mechanically robust (docking rings etc) and over a few years create the new station. The lessons of the past will create an inherently longer lived new structure.')
