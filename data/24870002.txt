I think I&#x27;ll stick with paying $90 a month, thanks. For an education visa you need to be registered with a university. This being Vietnam, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s someone you can pay to make that happen, but I&#x27;ve never heard of someone who&#x27;s not a genuine student doing that. Most common beside tourist visas is a business visa, but in case you&#x27;re thinking of buying a fake one, agents do check nearly everyone at some point and you can get fined and blacklisted. Also you technically have to leave the country to change visa type (although maybe they&#x27;ve waived that at the moment).')
