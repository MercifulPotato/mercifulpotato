One would at least plan what do do in case components suddenly become unavailable due to unexpected events.<p>E.g. when the AKM plant recently burned down this already was havoc for a lot of audio applications. I&#x27;d guess that at least 15% of all cars in the &gt;35kUS$ range use one or more AKM ICs. Unless car manufacturers (or their suppliers) have enough stock of AKM ADCs and DACs (or assembled ECUs), they have to either stop delivering they&#x27;re more expensive cars - or adapt their hard- &amp; software to use other ICs (or get questionable stock at inflated prices, which might be an expensive option if you&#x27;re building millions of cars, and expensive again if those IC have a higher failure rate due to bad storage&#x2F;being recycled&#x2F;...). With the tendency to do as much as possible as jit, I doubt they can bridge the duration until the production ramped up again.')
