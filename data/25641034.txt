In some countries you will avoid prison entirely for a whole range of offences including even some &quot;heavy&quot; things. It&#x27;s not impossible that in countries like Norway or Denmark, people who are in prison are already statistically part of the people less likely to be rehabilitated.<p>On the other hand, prisons entirely create problems they&#x27;re supposedly there to solve. Just ask people who&#x27;ve gone through juvenile detention if it&#x27;s not a breeding ground to make some contacts and learn the ropes..<p>You&#x27;d almost need a compound unit like (reconviction rate at x years) * (prison population&#x2F;total population) in order to figure out what is going on, with the idea that you&#x27;d want both reconvictions and proportion of population in prison to be low numbers.<p>For reference, the US has 655 prisoners per 100k, Norway has 60 per 100k.')
