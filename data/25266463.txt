Mentions, an NYT article citing a 2008 Pentagon plan to &quot;destroy&quot; wikileaks.<p>2. States his agenda of exposing &quot;corrupt power centers&quot; in America.<p>3. Proposes wikileaks was a good thing, driving accountability&#x2F;transparency.<p>4. Names the “Red Cell Memorandum,” a leaked CIA document discussing how to manipulate the European public support of wars in the middle east.<p>5. Highlights that this CIA document recommends using Obama&#x27;s public appeal as a tactic to reduce public dissent about the Afghanistan war in France&#x2F;Germany.<p>6. Refers to this as &quot;deep state&quot; (presumably because it&#x27;s an intelligence agency using a president, rather than vice-versa).<p>7. Proposes that the CIA hated Trump, because he didn&#x27;t pretend the US was morally superior.<p>8. Provides an example of inviting &quot;Abdel Fattah el-Sisi&quot; to the whitehouse, a dictator we had supplied arms to in private but didn&#x27;t publicly acknowledge.<p>9. &quot;Few things infuriate U.S. foreign policy elites more than those who, unwittingly or otherwise, show the true face of the U.S. security state to the world.&quot;')
