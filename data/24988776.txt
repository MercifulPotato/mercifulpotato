I cannot see how this could help with anything. They should rather do a physical switch that would 0 the data lines from these devices, so that camera or the microphone would be seen as working, but not sending any signal. Even better if you could pre-program some kind of ambience sound and pre-recorded cam video, so that once you turn it off, the perpetrator will think that they are still getting something.')
