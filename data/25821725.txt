I got access by playing around with a QR code generator, and the way I showed that it was insecure was to talk him through the process of getting in.<p>I almost ended up in a cell. Until the boss came. I could see directly that he was my tribe. The hacker kind. I talked him through it, after which he gave the others a stern talking to, shook my hand and bought me lunch.<p>He said they were a bit shaky because apparently people were getting into the checked in area with the same technique. Up until very recently you got in to &quot;secure places&quot; by presenting any qr code that was in the valid format.<p>&quot;Does this look valid? Well, yes. Let&#x27;s not bother actually validating it&quot;.')
