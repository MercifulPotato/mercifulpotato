I&#x27;ve driven a few vehicles that would have trouble at some dispensers. With my vehicles, I was able to make it usually work by holding the handle up a little and avoiding stations with dispensers that didn&#x27;t get along with my vehicle.<p>It seemed to me that sometimes the angles would mean the gas splashed off the filler tube in the wrong way and confused the dispenser. There&#x27;s a bunch of different ways to run a filler tube, and different dispenser handles, so I adapt.<p>In my case, my first vehicle was older than me, so you don&#x27;t exactly complain to the manufacturer that it has trouble filling at some stations. When newer vehicles acted the same way, I already knew how to jiggle the handle to fill up, so I just wouldn&#x27;t get to wash my windows at the same time as I filled up, if I went to the wrong station. I wasn&#x27;t ever one to buy stuff inside while the vehicle was filling, so not a big loss of functionality.')
