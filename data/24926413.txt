Item(by='chrxr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603938298, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24906634, text='TTS is great for 40k, although moving a large amount of pieces can be a pain. There are a huge amount of model scans available, and the community has put an immense amount of effort into building battlefields. I have mixed feelings about the morality of getting this stuff for free. I say mixed because the price of actual GW models is criminal. However, I don&#x27;t think this takes much profit from GW. It certainly hasn&#x27;t prevented me from wanting to paint models and play in person. But with that currently being impossible, TTS and Warhammer Total War are my only outlets.')
