But I have to say, in this situation, a fairer contract would probably still let Amazon drop Parler.<p>&gt; Was Parler filled with hate and bullshit? From what I&#x27;ve seen, absolutely. But so is Twitter, and they&#x27;re incoming, not outgoing.<p>From the sound of it, Parler was not responding well to requests for moderation and didn&#x27;t show signs of improvement.  Twitter might be better at it.  And, for contracts, it shouldn&#x27;t matter if one party lets some parties slide but is a stickler for others.  The contract was the terms on paper, not &quot;These terms or the most lax behaviors for any parties agreeing to the same terms.&quot;')
