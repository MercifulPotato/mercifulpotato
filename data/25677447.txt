Platforms are way too full of themselves these days! It&#x27;s shameful that SV is now the biggest censor there ever was! And platforms need to learn from the past - by silencing voices, they actually create the image of a martyr, of a persecuted person giving him even more power among his followers! I have people post vulgar and offensive stuff on my Facebook wall - I never block or delete them, never attack back, etc. The stoicism of being able to tolerate people you don&#x27;t like is the thru humanism and the true liberalism, not the opposite! The Commies used to pull out the tongues of people who they didn&#x27;t like and who they turned into existential enemies. And let me express this type of mentality by quoting Stalin: &quot;When there&#x27;s a person, there&#x27;s a problem. When there&#x27;s no person, there&#x27;s no problem.&quot; This is where we ended up! No civil discourse! We no longer agree to disagree! And this applies to both sides, of course! And if we look in the past, this never leads to a good ending!')
