Without it, either the infringements would not be discovered,.<p>I concede that there might be other tools out there that do the same work as Content ID, but do they work as well?  How much do they cost?  If there is a cost, then what would the ROI be?<p>It is also important to note, Muzzey did discover his music (through YouTube search) being used in infringing ways, but ways that he was OK with:<p>&gt; Muzzey recalls [YouTube&#x27;s] algorithm surfaced 20 or 40 videos. The majority were fan compilations that teenagers obsessed with Glee had painstakingly put together to memorialize their two favorite characters&#x27; love story—and they were all soundtracked to the full version of Muzzey’s music.<p>&gt; “It was really kind of cool and validating, especially for someone who was a complete independent, to have a kid finding a piece of instrumental music, which is the most uncool kind of music for a kid to find, and to make a tribute montage using it,” he explains. “It was stuff nobody would have a problem with.”<p>I think this is an ideal example of how Content ID is supposed to be used: The rightsholder (that is, the rightsholder directly, not a contractor) should review when uses of their works are flagged, and then make the call on what to Content ID claim, what to DMCA takedown, and what to clear.')
