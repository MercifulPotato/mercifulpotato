I am no American. I don&#x27;t need to be ashamed of the mess that USA has become. By the look of it you voted for Obama. So you should be ashamed of a President who had the gall to receive a Nobel Peace Prize and then went on to bomb foreign nations with impunity causing millions to die and be displaced. My country has never invaded other nations and will never do that. I don&#x27;t need to feel any shame. You need to. On the contrary we fought back tyranny and created a new country called Bangladesh. Could have easily occupied that captured area after overthrowing a tyrannical, oppressive regime and re-integrated it back into our country. We did not do that. That is what separates us from the imperialist developed World.<p>&gt; I see what you’re doing - you point out someone else’s flaws but avoid the matter at hand and under discussion.<p>Well it is quite easy to point fingers at someone while forgetting that three fingers are pointing back at you. If you can criticize Trump I can criticize Obama. I don&#x27;t need to follow your script of how to respond. I can respond in my own way. Thankfully, the place I come from isn&#x27;t authoritarian where I have to respond in a certain way else I am shamed&#x2F;cancelled&#x2F;rejected&#x2F;boycotted or worse killed.')
