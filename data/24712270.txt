It just means involving a second untrustworthy, poorly managed organization with its own goals in my contract negotiations.<p>Some might say that unions are better, but that has not been true historically in the US - they have a long history of corruption, power-grabbing, leadership with incentives that aren&#x27;t aligned with the best interests of their union members, extreme resistance to change that would fix problems, centralizing so that your workplace&#x27;s specific concerns are irrelevant to the union (since your workplace makes up such a small percentage of the union), protecting crappy employees based solely on seniority, and generally stagnating the company (sometimes making it less competitive).<p>When I think of strong unions in the US, I think of police, teachers, federal employees, and professional sports. Not exactly examples of unions as positive forces.<p>Europe has a totally different union model that is interesting and seems to work better, but it isn&#x27;t really an option in the US.')
