If the user hasn’t demonstrated a reproducible problem and more information is required, the user has a week to submit said information. If not, the issue is cleaned up automatically. I don’t see why the maintainers should have to manually revisit each ticket if the OP fails to respond.<p>And auto-closing doesn’t mean the issue can’t be reopened. If OP posts additional information after the grace period, the maintainers will be notified and the ticket can be reopened.')
