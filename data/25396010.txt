Item(by='H8crilA', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607753348, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25395703, text='I&#x27;ve recently gone for surgery for the first time in my life, and was treated with the standard cocktail of fentanyl+propofol for anaesthesia, making it also my first time on an opioid (and a strong one at that). The way it works is that you get the fentanyl first, and then shortly after the propofol.<p>It wasn&#x27;t exactly pleasant. In fact in the time before propofol kicked me out I even said out loud something to the tune of &quot;Hmm, so that&#x27;s what opioids are like. I do not like them&quot;. It was exactly as the OP describes, you just kind of cease to exist &#x2F; reduce your presence, if that makes any sense. It was more like the 2001 scene when HAL says that &quot;my mind is going, I can feel it&quot;.')
