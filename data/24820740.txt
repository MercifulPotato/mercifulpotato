When I was in high school, I wrote some software to denoise datasets with a genetic algorithm (it&#x27;s what we had before deep learning was a thing ;).  I showed it to my math teachers and they were horrified; they told me that you cannot change data once it&#x27;s been collected.<p>I realize now that their take is kind of wrong -- pretty much every instrument in the world performs filtering on what it samples before it presents you a number.  Saying you can&#x27;t filter data kind of misses the point, because almost every real-world system is bandwidth limited and acts as a low-pass filter.  But sometimes there are different noise sources, and you can probably write an algorithm to attack them without being &quot;inaccurate&quot;.  (For example, ever measure very low voltages at relatively high frequency?  You&#x27;ll see a nice 60Hz component in there, because you are surrounded by a 60Hz electric field.  That&#x27;s noise, not data.  Apparently averaging through multiple power line cycles is fine, but writing a program to do the same thing is wrong.  Seems weird to me.)<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m still bitter about it.  (That, and how in 4th grade I got a C in science because we had to make a flipbook about earthquakes that had to be titled &quot;quakin&#x27; shakin&#x27; earth&quot; and I spelled &quot;quakin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;shakin&#x27;&quot; wrong.  Still don&#x27;t know how to spell either of those contractions, or what flipbooks have to do with science.  They don&#x27;t come up in real life much.  But I sure am bitter, 26 years later.)')
