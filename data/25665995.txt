How do you represent that as a program and reduce the complexity?<p>How you view software engineering ? and explain it to others what is the method of representation you use to encode  software as plumbing? is it text based? time flow graph node based? stack based ? binary based ?<p>Software engineering as a team sport, how do you get a bunch of developers to reduce the cognitive load manage the relationships and data in the code and how do you measure that like a science.<p>I am also sure there is a lot of valid advice here as well. This is how. I see it from a mathematical &#x2F; science perspective that pushes pragmatic narrative.')
