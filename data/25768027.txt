If, big if, they had <i>something</i> positive to look up to outside of work, they&#x27;d be less inclined to put all their energy into work. That&#x27;d be the case even with multiple negatives they couldn&#x27;t control. In other words, it&#x27;s the total lack of any and all upside outside of work rather than the existence of downsides that makes people feel powerless and depressed.')
