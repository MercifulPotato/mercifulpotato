Yes this will incur a performance penalty, and is similar to what &quot;pdb&quot; introduces(if your are familiar with pdb). Most of the python debugger did single step or breakpoint feature in this way.<p>And it&#x27;s a little more than inspect and frames. Note that it is much easier to do watch(&quot;a&quot;) than watch(a), but it&#x27;s slightly less intuitive. So I also did some AST hack to make watch(a) possible :)')
