In compiled languages, if for example denominator can be computed at compile time, it will almost certainly be optimized to use tricks, the easiest one is to just convert it to a multiply.<p>A division instruction can take a variable length of cycles to solve depending on the complexity of the division, it has terrible throughput and can be 100x slower than something like an addition, and that&#x27;s on modern architectures!<p>Did you ever notice how a calculator can sometimes take a visible amount of time to compute something, and sometimes it was instant? Some instructions are more expensive than others!')
