Why would I take the time to learn an api like its a sdk, along with the pains of trying to shunt openapi&#x27;s libraries in to my application without requiring the creation of a composer build step, further complicating deployment, when I can make 5 methods in the time before lunch to do the bits i need as rest queries and deployment of my php app remains as simple as `git pull production` on the nfs share all the workers read from?<p>The benefit of compile validated symbols is moot in the days of test driven dev, so the benefits gained from that can still be realized without creating build complexity or making competent engineers re-learn something they already know only re-abstracted in a way that almost always makes it harder for somebody who understands the low level to learn the new way compared to a new dev.')
