So fastest they can do 5nm is in 2023(Seems unlikely though when they couldn&#x27;t even manage to do 7nm).<p>ARM is not only threat to Intel. AMD caught up with Intel with Zen 2 and surpassed in Zen 3. Zen 4 5nm is planned for end 2021. If they can manage IPC gains same as Zen1-Zen2 or Zen2-Zen3, Intel is in serious trouble.')
