Shellcheck helps as a safety net, but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily save me a lot of time and cognitive load.<p>If I&#x27;m writing a new script from scratch and I realize there&#x27;s going to be some branching or prompts or complex argument handling, I just write it in Python. It saves time and effort, it lets other people on my team more quickly modify and debug it, and it&#x27;s more predictably portable (&quot;oops, only sh, no bash&quot;). And if it ever needs to do something more advanced in the future, it&#x27;s way easier to extend.<p>Or put much more succinctly, by &#x27;kristaps in another comment:<p>&gt;Or I can use a sane language that let&#x27;s me get my stuff done faster and with less opportunities to shoot myself in the foot.<p>It&#x27;s nice for quickly writing something that&#x27;s just wrapping multiple commands, though.')
