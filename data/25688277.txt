I wonder where you get your news from.<p>The UK&#x2F;EU deal isn&#x27;t perfect but Norway and Switzerland already pricked their ears up and senior politicians in both countries are now publicly questioning why they can&#x27;t have the same sort of deal. The EU backed down on many things they&#x27;d previously claimed were requirements, like the ECJ. And the UK has signed over 60 trade deals in preparation for leaving.<p>There&#x27;s a sort of assumption here that might makes right.
