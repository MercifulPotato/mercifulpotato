(b) is certainly not true<p>On the contrary, I just posted real world data that clearly demonstrates that mask discipline isn&#x27;t very important. Maybe it&#x27;s important under lab conditions but in the real world it&#x27;s not.<p>&gt; Indeed, if the primary transmission mechanism is aerosol, masking could and likely would worsen transmission.<p>So why did the reproduction rate fall and not rise after masks were introduced?')
