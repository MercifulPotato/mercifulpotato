By just unfolding it, it pairs with my Android phone and the on-screen keyboard disappears. Folding it up triggers the phone keyboard to reappear. I take it with me whenever I expect to write anything about as long as this comment.<p>Being generally a luddite when it comes to devices, I&#x27;m honestly shocked at how seamless the pairing process is.<p>I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t sell these in North America.')
