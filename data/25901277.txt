Ryanair competes almost entirely on price, to the point of removing literally everything they can in order to stay the cheapest option. A decade ago they considered removing the seats from their planes (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;money&#x2F;2010&#x2F;jul&#x2F;01&#x2F;stand-up-for-ryanair" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;money&#x2F;2010&#x2F;jul&#x2F;01&#x2F;stand-up-for-r...</a>) as well as plans for things like making passengers pay to use the bathrooms. More recently Ryanair refused to remove middle seats in order to help stop the spread of Corona virus.<p>I would be very reluctant to believe Ryanair believe in the 737 Max for any reason besides cost. Safety is not a priority for them beyond meeting the absolute minimum requirements necessary to fly.')
