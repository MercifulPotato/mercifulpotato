Letting someone else yoink a connected input device in a hypothetical coffee shop or office with 50 people nearby is a recipe for annoyance or even for privacy-invasion. (Even if it only lets you grab devices you&#x27;ve previously been paired to, that&#x27;s still an easy thing in an office where a lot of the equipment is more communal.)<p>My recollection is that the magic keyboard &#x2F; trackpad insta-pair if you connect them via wire. Would plugging them each in to a lightning cable for a second to switch their allegiance work better for you than manually unpairing? Obviously it&#x27;s still a hassle.')
