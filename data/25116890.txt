But nor is there any reason to believe our immune systems can&#x27;t deal with this virus like they deal with any other virus.<p>&gt; Are you ok with 250k deaths a year from covid every year going forward?<p>250k&#x2F;7.8 billions = 0.003%. Yes, I&#x27;m fine with that.<p>&gt; Why risk the lives of tens of thousands of people when we can just all wear a mask and get vaccinated?<p>That&#x27;s a hypothetical question considering we don&#x27;t have a vaccine yet and masks are hardly the only restrictions.')
