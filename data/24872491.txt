If you believe I&#x27;ve made such an argument, please politely point that out about a specific statement and I&#x27;ll try to understand my biases and correct it.<p>&gt; do you really believe the there&#x27;s no meaningful difference between China&#x27;s vision for the future and the West&#x27;s?<p>If we were comparing to Mao, Stalin, or Hitler, then, yes; but, modern states, no.<p>The U.S. imprisons millions of people for petty drug crimes and kills millions of people in imperial wars. Is that so different than the treatment of the Uigers, Taiwanese, or those in Hong Kong?<p>The social credit system and Great Firewall are being implemented through different means: social ostracism and social media oligopolies. I&#x27;ve personally experienced it.<p>&gt; No difference between the future each will create for you?<p>I&#x27;m actually generally optimistic. If we take the evidence of the past few hundred years, we are likely to innovate and grow despite such excessive governance. It&#x27;s the innovators that will make my future better. As far as the government goes, the practical difference seems minimal: I will meticulously pay my taxes and follow the laws so as not to receive the glare of either of the Saurons.')
