If anything is lowering the level of discourse here it is parroting a politically-loaded factual claim (&quot;Up to 70% of drivers are like me and ... would like you to vote yes on Prop 22 if you are in California.&quot;) without citing any independently verifiable data to support it.<p>Asking how we can know the OP is not a shill just seemed like a less long-winded way to make that point.
