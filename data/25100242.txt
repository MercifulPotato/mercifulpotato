This is how all fitted units (fridge&#x2F;freezer, dishwasher, oven, ...) work.<p>It makes even more sense to use a common model for microwaves and ovens than it does for the others, since they don&#x27;t need or want fixings for mounting a door over them.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to find out a lot of e.g. fridges sold with (cosmetic) doors are actually the same model just with that extra part using the same fixings as the fitted cabinet doors.')
