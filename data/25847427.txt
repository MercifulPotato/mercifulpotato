As disappointed (and angry) as I am to see the Republicans steal the Merrick Garland appointment and then replace RBG with someone who has flaunted her enthusiasm for overturning Roe v Wade, I&#x27;m glad Supreme Court justices can&#x27;t be held politically accountable for their decisions.  It means that power ranges from being accountable to the public on very short time scales (legislators in the House) to slightly longer (the president) to pretty darned long (senators) to extremely long (the Supreme Court, which reacts very slowly through presidential appointment after retirement or death.)')
