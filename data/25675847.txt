Item(by='pimterry', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610047118, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25674967, text='They&#x27;re not explicit about this, but I suspect part of the reason they don&#x27;t offer health insurance is that their remuneration is intended to be location independent.<p>Moving any fixed X of remuneration into health insurance will be wrong in many locations (in many places, standard health care doesn&#x27;t require employer insurance, so the expected X for most jobs is 0, and any X &gt; 0 is undesirable). Doing wildly varying custom health insurance setups for each employee according to their current needs seems complicated. If every &#x27;employee&#x27; here is actually an independent contractor, can&#x27;t they just pay for health insurance themselves from their remuneration however they please, and do so tax free as their own business expense?')
