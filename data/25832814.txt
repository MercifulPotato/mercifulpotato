My dream job is to be a pilot which I accept I will never do and can imagine the aspects that make it “just a job”.<p>More relatable, in my experience, is the dream company. Accepting that you are committed to software development as a career different companies then take the place of a dream job. Google with all their perks of working on site. 37Signals &#x2F; Basecamp and the remote culture. Fog Creek and “everyone gets an office with a door”.<p>What I’ve found is that at the end of the day they are still just jobs. It’s the management and the coworkers that make a place great.<p>I wish I could figure out how to interview for that because it is far more elusive to detect accurately than all the technical interview hoops we all love to complain about.')
