I poured into learning everything I could about nutrition. I got down to about 11% bodyfat—167 lbs &#x2F; 76kg with a good deal of muscle—before mellowing out a bit. It&#x27;s simple:<p>1. Self-propelled motion to get around. Ski, bike, run, or even walk. Don&#x27;t own a car. My friend sold his and bought a huge bike that his kids and groceries fit into. Yes it is possible. I&#x27;ve biked in -30C weather. It&#x27;s not that bad.<p>2. Fiber, protein are your best friends. Some fats are kinda friends too, especially from veggies or fish. Sugar is the enemy. All other carbs treat like acquaintances, except for starch which can be safely eaten if it is cold where it acts like a fibre. Potato salad with bacon bits and green onions: Yes. Hashbrowns with pancakes: No.<p>3. Body weight workouts at least once a week. They&#x27;re a bit fanatical over at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;bodyweightfitness&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;bodyweightfitness&#x2F;</a> but the program is good. Follow it but don&#x27;t push your self too hard. I got wicked tennis elbow when I was approaching a muscle up and had to take a year off.<p>That&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s simple. I don&#x27;t understand why Weight Watchers even exists. Just cut out the sugar, move around, and eat more plants.')
