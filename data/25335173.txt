I work at one of FANG and recently relocated to Asheville from the Bay Area (sooner than I expected; we have a newborn and wildfire smoke was getting pretty bad).  Compensation adjustment is surprisingly less than I would have expected, although it&#x27;s hard to say if this trend will hold over the next decade or not.<p>Our rent is 1&#x2F;4 of what it was in the Bay Area for one more bedroom now. I do miss California a lot though; the weather, food, and culture are very hard to beat (although Asheville isn&#x27;t too bad in this regard, but at perhaps 1&#x2F;20 of the scale).  Ironically, with the amount that I am able to save from not living there anymore, I plan to save up and buy a house somewhere in the Bay Area in 15-20 years.  But this is assuming my income will remain at Silicon Valley levels.  If companies change their mind about embracing remote work, it will drop quite a bit since we are definitely not moving back any time soon.  Personally, I feel that I am more productive working remotely than in person, but I do miss all of the office perks.')
