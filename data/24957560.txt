The real problem is bad incentives.<p>For IoT manufacturer a device which fails to work due to blocking is far worse than a security flaw. The first directly leads to chargebacks and bad reputation. The second leads to.. nothing.<p>So long as IPv4 exists, they have to at least use NAT, and their tracking is limited by IP pooling. But when we switch to IPv6 only, there&#x27;s no good financial reason for devices to even have a &#x27;deny all&#x27; stateful firewall.<p>It&#x27;s more profitable to not bother with a firewall (just blame the client if he doesn&#x27;t install a firewall to shield the device), than to deal with creating the right exceptions for firewall policy - even a single policy error would have a much stronger financial effect than opening up the device for the entire world.')
