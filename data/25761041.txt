Initially, in the UK, that phrase referred to the FCA&#x27;s implementation of the PSD2 requirement for banks to allow a secure mechanism of access to third parties. I think that this definition of open banking has already regressed post-Brexit, from the absence of passporting. UK firms and banks are no longer able to interoperate with EU firms and banks, and PSD2 no longer applies to them.<p>Another definition may be domestic API access to bank accounts, which I agree will continue to be policy in the UK. It won&#x27;t be PSD2 open banking, though.')
