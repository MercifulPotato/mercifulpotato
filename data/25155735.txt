The population at large, who have their freedom restricted if they do not meet the guardian&#x27;s conditions that demonstrate competence<p>2. Everyone who would want to interact with members of the public to sell certain classes of products or services, who now have to conduct due diligence to ensure they are not dealing with something akin to an adult child in the law&#x27;s eyes, because rather than the surrogate guardian supervising their ward, the guardian attempts to make the entire world a safe space, by imposing some of the obligations of guardianship onto society at large.')
