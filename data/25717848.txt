It&#x27;s not that difficult to season cast iron cookware. Just cook on it. Same thing with soldering - there are countless videos of people teaching others on how to solder. If you can wear clothes that morning, you can solder.<p>Also, what if I told you its ok to use soap on cast iron pans? The hardened coating isn&#x27;t prone to soap interaction. It removes all the grime and gives you a clean non-stick surface if you use soap.<p>I blame all this on hipster culture which is based on nothing but making things more complicated than it should be, getting viewership and generally misleading people into thinking something is more difficult that it really is. In turn, making people spend more money on useless shit that they don&#x27;t need.')
