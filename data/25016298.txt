I do try to blog about it and I do have a reddit called r&#x2F;HealthWorks where I keep hoping -- someday! -- people will join and talk with me and yadda.<p>But in a nutshell (and this is very quick and dirty -- I have been doing this nearly twenty years):<p>1. A comment by my physician friend -- who minored in parasitology -- convinced me that I was correct that my husband had brought a parasitic infection back from Saudi and infected me with it sexually. So that same day, I said to my husband &quot;You are never touching me again without a condom.&quot; My condition stabilized about two weeks later (after another round of antibiotics was prescribed) and I began slowly getting better thereafter.<p>2. He and I later divorced and I have been celibate for more than fifteen years while working on my health. Sex is germy and it was too much of a health risk for me for a long time. This is also part of a more general principle I have followed: If you have a chronic or recurring infection, figure out what the damn source is and resolve that piece. You don&#x27;t pick up infections randomly from the ether or some nonsense.<p>3. I took about $300 worth of supplements for a few years to redress a huge backlog of nutritional deficiencies.<p>4. I got really picky about my diet. Among other things, I looked into fat chemistry and I avoid or limit long chain triglycerides and favor medium chain triglycerides. (Medium chain triglycerides have long been medically prescribed as beneficially for my condition and for other serious gut issues, but limiting long chain triglycerides is not anything I have ever seen recommended and it makes a really huge difference for me.)<p>5. The standard medical recommendation for my condition is a high fat, high salt, high calorie diet. The result is that the standard advice is to pursue a junk food diet. I do not count calories and I make an effort to get more salt than most people consume, but I got super picky about dietary quality and focused on nutritional density instead of calories per se.<p>6. &quot;An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.&quot; Or several pounds if you have a compromised immune system. I work hard at avoiding exposure to germs, etc. and I currently work from home to help me have control over my environment and limit my exposure to germs, chemicals, etc.<p>There&#x27;s no doubt more, but that&#x27;s what occurs to me off the top of my head.')
