A complement is like peanut butter and jelly -- buying both makes life that much better. Clearly this isn&#x27;t the case here. So let&#x27;s drop the misapplied definition for &quot;substitute&quot; and move on. Your point is better made by identifying perhaps unjustified cost increases in purchasing (i.e. Toyota unionizes and causes a 0.002% increase in the car price, analogous to the increased difficulty in communication these insurrectionists now have in communicating with their proto-terrorist cells).')
