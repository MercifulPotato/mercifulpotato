The tech hubs grew in a self-fulfilling cycle, attracting nearly the entire supply of competent developers.<p>Now that supply is spreading across the country because remote work is easier, but that doesn&#x27;t change the number of developers that these companies are competing for. I doubt that the supply&#x2F;demand curves will move much at all.')
