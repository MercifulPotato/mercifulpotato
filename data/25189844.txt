Item(by='Exmoor', descendants=None, kids=[25190507], score=None, time=1606155948, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25189143, text='&gt; I&#x27;ve also mentioned the cutter polio vaccine and the 1976 swine flu vaccine which seems to have caused an uptick of GBS.<p>That Polio vaccine wasn&#x27;t a side effect of the vaccine though, it was an issue with people accidently getting injected with a live virus. Since no live virus is even remotely involved in any COVID19 vaccines it has zero relevance here. Even if they were, we have 60+ years of history with no similar incidents since then.<p>&gt; I suspect if I go research I will find more<p>You really won&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve been reading about this extensively during this period and those are the only examples where there <i>may</i> have been long term effects that anyone can point to.<p>I qualified my original comment with &quot;in most people&#x27;s living memory&quot; and didn&#x27;t include the &#x27;76 swine flu vaccine because, frankly, I don&#x27;t think pointing to an issue that happened 44 years ago in a field that has seen pretty significant technological advancement in knowledge, methods, and manufacturing processes really makes sense.<p>&gt; why it is hard to acknowledge and discuss the risk profile of vaccines<p>My issue is not that there&#x27;s isn&#x27;t <i>some</i> theoretical risk, it&#x27;s that it just isn&#x27;t put in context of how minute it is. In all likelihood your risk of facing long term effects from a car accident happening on your way to get vaccinated are higher than anything that could happen from the vaccine. And both those risks are, of course, many orders of magnitude less than your chance of suffering long-term effects from catching COVID19.')
