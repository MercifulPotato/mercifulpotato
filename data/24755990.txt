The way I define that term is that it&#x27;s a political concept expressing the desire for people to be allowed to express themselves however they want to the largest extent possible&#x2F;ethical. An example of law embodying free speech would be the 1st amendment of the US Constitution.<p>Based on context, I think you are using free speech to mean &quot;speech that is protected by the doctrine of free speech&quot; in the vocabulary I described above. Though that&#x27;s ambiguous, because to be able to talk concretely about whether speech is protected or not you would need to say what it is covered under. So do you mean speech that is protected under the 1st Amendment, or some other law?<p>Presuming you mean the 1st amendment, it isn&#x27;t necessarily true that threats and harassment are not protected, depending on the specifics.')
