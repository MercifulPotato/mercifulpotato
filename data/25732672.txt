(It&#x27;s not one that I hold personally, in case anyone is thinking about downvoting for &quot;extremism.&quot;)<p>You know what&#x27;s linked with terrorism?<p>Terrorist acts. That is: sporadic acts of intense, spectacular violence and devastation designed to rock and destabilize some existing political order. Usually but not always from &quot;below&quot; (sometimes it&#x27;s literally from above, like from a B-52).<p>I&#x27;m concerned pretty deeply, but very, very far from being terrorized by the pathetic spectacle at the Capitol. One reason for that is I don&#x27;t take the extremely hyperbolic US press as literally as so many seem to.')
