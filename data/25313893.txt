The parent company decided to merge two of their children companies together since they operate in the same market. Sadly the two companies provide two different things in the same market and very few things overlap. When they did the merger and then COVID struck they decided they needed to get rid of developers, they took the approach that seems to be that the PHP developers were the weaker developers. So they got rid of the majority of them leaving only the ones they legally couldn&#x27;t get rid of. The result, they now need to rewrite a system with only the Java and Kotlin devs who lack the fundmental business understanding of the system they need to rewrite. They also are stuck with a group of developers whose code is of a lower qualtity, that fear deploying anything at anytime on a Friday, that lack the understanding of how to build distributed systems while operating a distributed systems, who wrote systems that the day they went into production were scheduled to be rewriten because they simply weren&#x27;t up to scratch with the requirements, and with a system that is labelled as scalable but can&#x27;t scale as well as the system written in PHP it&#x27;s meant to replace .<p>Trying to evaluate the needs, skills, and undestanding of developers based on what language they&#x27;re currently writing in is not the wisest of moves. Evaluating a system base on the language it&#x27;s written in is equally unwise.<p>Overall, I think PHP can compete with many languages and beat many languages in the web development area. In the areas such as data processing, concurrency, and system processes it&#x27;s generally lacking due to the fact it&#x27;s main selling point is building websites.')
