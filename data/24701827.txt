I.e. I type &#x27;, and then s, which normally causes the digraph &#x27;s to appear, but here neither the &#x27; nor the s afterwards register.<p>Chrome 85, Windows: The key sequence registers as just one letter, but apparently not as the &#x27;, which thus is marked as an error. This was also what I&#x27;ve seen in Edge (Chromium-based, probably similar version number).<p>Internet Explorer 11: Same as with Chrome. However, with the added bonus that typing a space seems to be impossible. No idea whether that browser is even on the compatibility list for that site, but it&#x27;s all I have lying around here right now.')
