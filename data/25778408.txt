Item(by='spacedcowboy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610642161, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25778051, text='This.<p>I&#x27;m pretty convinced the proportion of people who would be likely to expect Apple to be able to recover from a lost password, <i>even though</i> they&#x27;d specifically opted out of that, would tend to ~100% of any group of users (not just Apple users).<p>Many people think &quot;The Internet&quot; is their browser (Oh, mum, [sigh]). Try to explain public key cryptography consequences to them, I dog-dare you. If Betty (Oh, Betty, [deep sigh]) from next door said it was &quot;better&quot; then they&#x27;ll go for it anyway, and only pay attention to the consequences when it&#x27;s too late.<p>The article is a year old, and I think Apple could do some stuff around what they already do (if you forget your password on one device, you can typically reset it using the password from another device, all the while maintaining the cryptography chain). There&#x27;s some interesting avenues that could be explored there, but until they have a solid-as-they-can-make-it public release-candidate, we won&#x27;t hear anything about it.')
