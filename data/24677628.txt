Minor is the first alt-culture in key signature.<p>However, the next step to get a major minor like, is the major 7th, or other half tones, like the 6th. Then, you have the converse, making minors major like, such as the melodic minor scale, or the minor 7th.<p>Interesting songs, especially in popular culture, make use of this dualistic view. Examples are Wicked Game by Chris Isaak (in a mode, where you don&#x27;t regress to tonic, giving it an incomplete and spooky theme), Clocks by Coldplay (major chord, minor on 5th rather than major; major on 4th).')
