It is very transparent. I seldomly agree with his conclusion(s), but since he is so honest (he is not trying to deceive) in listing his arguments it is just a matter for me to find where he is wrong... or where I am wrong. I find this style so uncommon and stimulating that I hardly can stand the regular &quot;opinion&quot; held by most people. At least it is hard to be intrigued by arguments that doesn&#x27;t even try to be precise.<p>When PG writes something I pay attention to the words, because I know they were chosen with some care. If I can force open a crack in his arguments I get wiser, and if I don&#x27;t... the same thing happens.<p>I wish more people wrote like him, but preferably less about startups. They don&#x27;t interest me as much as attempts at honest discourse.')
