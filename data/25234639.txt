In the past, race riots and protests were often blamed on Northern abolitionists, communists and Jews, basically &quot;white agitators who aren&#x27;t from here&quot;.  You see this same trend today, when protests are blamed on Soros-paid white agitators from &quot;out of state&quot; and Antifa.<p>It&#x27;s intended to mollify any concerns of well-meaning whites that POC might actually really be upset with racial discrimination, and actually want significant change beyond superficial proposals.')
