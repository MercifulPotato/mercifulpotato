I downvote anyone who uses broad brush strokes especially when using traits like race, sex, gender, political ideology, etc... These days that ends up meaning if you are anyone who takes and espouses a strong political cultural leaning, you get my downvote. Anything that&#x27;s bad faith, like complaining someone has a perspective of &quot;both sides&quot; immediately gets a downvote. I have voted independent since I could vote and constantly having these camps attack me for my unique perspective and life experiences has taken its toll on that way.<p>I&#x27;ve been all around the world by now and I&#x27;ve realized <i>people are rarely what you think they are</i>. Even when you can point to stated political ideologies, I&#x27;ve argued and debated with enough people to know that the box almost never fits. I can judge your comments at point in time, but I&#x27;ve often found myself scrolling someone&#x27;s post history on here and saying, &quot;They&#x27;re not so bad, they just lack perspective or experiences in this area.&quot; It&#x27;s also possible they&#x27;ve had overwhelmingly negative experiences in that area, but a bad opinion nonetheless gets a downvote.<p>The whole point is I can rarely bring myself to judge a person as a whole. That takes some overwhelming information about them for me to do. I can judge individual criterion and that&#x27;s exactly what the downvote gets used for on this account. I don&#x27;t expect people to change and I don&#x27;t really expect my fraction of an opinion to matter much.')
