But if those approvals can be reversed, why bother requiring them to begin with?<p>Most of those deals had pre-conditions and promises by Facebook.  Facebook has ignored most of the obligations with basically a &quot;what are you going to do about it&quot; attitude.<p>For instance:<p>&gt;The FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a letter to the two companies on Thursday, said WhatsApp must adhere to its current privacy practices after the merger, including a promise not to use WhatsApp users’ personal data for targeted ads.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-facebook-whatsapp&#x2F;facebook-says-whatsapp-deal-cleared-by-ftc-idUSBREA391VA20140410" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-facebook-whatsapp&#x2F;faceboo...</a><p>So they directly ignore that requirement and try to claim &quot;well it&#x27;s in the T&amp;C!&quot; which they <i>KNOW</i> users don&#x27;t read.  And even if they did, end-users accepting a T&amp;C doesn&#x27;t give you some magical power to ignore a government mandate.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;08&#x2F;25&#x2F;whatsapp-to-share-user-data-with-facebook-for-ad-targeting-heres-how-to-opt-out&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;08&#x2F;25&#x2F;whatsapp-to-share-user-dat...</a>')
