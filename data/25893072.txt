If I was opening a very expensive bottle, I would invite people over to share it.  Most wine I buy to drink or cook with costs $10-$20&#x2F;bottle.  Hardly worth making any effort to preserve it if I forget to drink all of it in a few days time - worst case, I toss half a bottle or mix it into some salad dressing.')
