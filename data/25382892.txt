There is a point that money is not used anymore to purchase services and goods but it is just raw power. Let money accumulate and an oligarchy will run your town, city or country.\nCapitalism needs many business to compete to be effective, duopolies and other concentrations of power will kill capitalism. Tax the mega rich if you want a capitalist USA, because the alternative is an oligarchy running your business and a death sentence for the USA competitiveness.')
