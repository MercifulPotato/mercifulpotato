I don&#x27;t see a security flaw in this specific use-case, but why dance with the devil? If it&#x27;s about shorter hashes, it&#x27;s safer to truncate a sha2 or other hash.<p>If it uses a public key to encrypt to, can a malicious server overwrite your data with encrypted values or is the data also signed using a private or symmetric key on the client side?<p>How does that local sqlite database grow, e.g. for a regular amount of files for a 1TB drive, do you get a bunch of gigabytes of state like Duplicity? (I gave up on duplicity because it ate too large a chunk of my ssd while restic didn&#x27;t need local state at all.) What if the local file is gone, can it (albeit slower I guess) still run normally or do you now need to do full back-ups?')
