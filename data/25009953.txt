How does Nature fit into Stoic thought?<p>I haven&#x27;t really read any Stoic philosophy so I don&#x27;t have the context, and this excerpt seems to attack a word that wasn&#x27;t covered in the linked article. Or at least it&#x27;s not clear to me how the ideas discussed in the article fit into this idea of &quot;a being like Nature&quot;. Can you give a bit more background?')
