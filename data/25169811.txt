The point of being in the office is to get work done. You&#x27;re being paid to do work, and in the past, part of that was a requirement you be in the office some portion of the time. You were in the office _to work_. It&#x27;s not to say you may not have other things you like about the office, but the reason the company bought an office and requires you to be there is to work.<p>Which leads to the other side of this. I want my time in the office to be about work. I don&#x27;t mind socializing some, and I like my coworkers well enough, but we hired them because they were good at their jobs and didn&#x27;t seem like bad people to be around. Not because I thought they&#x27;d be good friends, or have similar hobbies to me. Because of that, given the choice, I&#x27;d rather spend social time with the group of friends I have cultivated myself, instead of having my coworkers try to force a connection just because we sit near each other at the office.<p>I don&#x27;t go to work to support someone&#x27;s else&#x27;s lack of a social life outside of work, and just because I was required by my job to be in the same room as you doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x2F;should expect me to like you as more than someone I work with. There&#x27;s plenty of coworkers I like and some I&#x27;m actually friends with, but also plenty of people who try to use the conditions of our mutual employment to fill in for friendships they didn&#x27;t develop outside of work.')
