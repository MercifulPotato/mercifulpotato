I mean, all companies already do have a software expenditure budget for commercial software.<p>But I guess it is not simple to just put OSS projects in the same budget bucket as proprietary software. Companies have a special aversion to unexpected expenses. I’ve done business with companies that would rather pay a known monthly fee for all their licenses than only pay for the licenses that get used every month, simply because they can’t account for what it will cost in advance. Practically speaking, always paying bounties for changes would turn OSS into pure commercial software from the buyer’s point of view.<p>There are a ton of OSS projects that are supported by the author’s day job at a for-profit company. I guess I’m not convinced that if software is offered for free in the first place that it always makes sense to <i>expect</i> money to be offered without asking for it. If an OSS project needs funding, maybe it’s best to just offer it commercially in the first place?<p>I just don’t necessarily agree with the hyperbole that unpaid labor is “wrong”, because that undermines the initial OSS transaction. The software was offered for free-as-in-beer in the first place, and that is unpaid labor. It’s perfectly fine to request pay for changes, so isn’t that better and more straightfoward than not asking for money but complaining when none comes?')
