Last time I checked, TwitFace is not the government. The government has no right to tell them who they can censor. That is also an infringement on free speech.<p>&gt; the dignity of being officially persecuted.<p>What persecution? This is just the free market at work. Forcing a private company to carry their views would be tantamount to communism. I thought &quot;these people&quot; (your words) abhorred communism.<p>&gt; Either that, or you&#x27;ve already decided to use it to keep yourself in power.<p>Get out of your bubble. Not everyone thinks like that.')
