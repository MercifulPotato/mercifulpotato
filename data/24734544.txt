The complaint is that VERY specific software isn&#x27;t available.<p>There&#x27;s Gimp, Krita, and Darktable for image- and photo editing, but people still keep asking for Photoshop. More often than not the very same people, mind you, who also complain about Adobe&#x27;s subscription model and pricing in general!<p>They don&#x27;t want to be able to do the same work - they want to do the same work the exact same way using the exact same software. Same goes for video editing as well - there&#x27;s kdenlive, OpenShot, DaVinci Resolve, Lightworks, and yes, even Blender can do it. But, nope. People want Premiere, Sony Vegas, and Final Cut - the rest doesn&#x27;t even cross their mind.<p>That&#x27;s the issue at hand - not lack of software. It&#x27;s unwillingness to learn (pros don&#x27;t count - they have different needs and concerns) and all to often just plain ignorance of alternatives.<p>The big ecosystem of smaller utilities is met by FOSS - here marketing and communication (as well as terrible naming in most cases) are the biggest factor.<p>Plugins and special drivers can be a problem, I fully agree with that. The question is however, whether this is relevant for hobbyists and people who just want to get started.<p>Seeing as special drivers are only required for special hardware (graphics cards and studio equipment comes to mind) and that plugins can easily exceed the cost of a small workstation, we&#x27;re starting to leave hobbyist territory again.')
