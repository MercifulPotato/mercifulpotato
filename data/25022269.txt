Please, go listen to his words- they&#x27;re on YouTube. Read his tweets.<p>He&#x27;s saying things like that he would win if it weren&#x27;t for all of the illegal votes being counted. That &quot;bad things&quot; are happening in Pennsylvania as his lead was closing. He said, months ago, that he didn&#x27;t think votes should be counted after election day, which is absolutely absurd.<p>He&#x27;s literally trying to sow doubt about the election process and trying to make people think that Biden closing and overcoming a vote gap is suspicious, when it was totally expected.<p>I don&#x27;t throw the term around lightly, but I don&#x27;t know what else to call a blatant undermining of democracy like that other than fascism. Maybe we can discuss whether or not fascism is all that bad, but I find no way you can argue in good faith that what he&#x27;s saying about the election is &quot;ho-hum. Nothing to see here.&quot;')
