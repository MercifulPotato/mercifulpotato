If someone cares enough about it, they should submit a (non-breaking) patch along with a patch for the documentation. There are no costs to people who don&#x27;t find it a valuable change.<p>&gt; My experience talking to black (one African, one European) coworkers is their reaction is &quot;That&#x27;s the problem you&#x27;re going to fix?&quot;.<p>Obviously this isn&#x27;t fixing any of the fundamental issues, but it does bother some people. My preference is to respect the people who have problems with it. An easy policy is to simply avoid creating new software which uses that terminology and to accept any patches which fix it. That way the people who feel the change is important bear the burden of the cost (which is likely small some thing like this).')
