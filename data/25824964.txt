The old internet saying &quot;There are no technical solutions to social problems&quot; comes to mind - it doesn&#x27;t mean that technology can&#x27;t <i>contribute to</i> the solution (many social problems have solutions that require statistical models, cookies, higher-performance internet connections, Spanner, whatever), it just means that the technology doesn&#x27;t solve the problem on its own. Wikipedia, for instance, would not be what it is without the wiki, but it is certainly not simply the wiki - it&#x27;s the decades of writing that happened on the wiki.<p>Many people set up their own wiki, in the wake of Wikipedia, hoping to see the same success. Very few of them ended up working.<p>Technical-component-of-a-social-solution-ism is not technosolutionism. The article defines technosolutionism as follows: &quot;<i>Technosolutionism is a way of understanding the world that assigns priority to engineered solutions to human problems. Its first principle is the notion that an app, a machine, a software program, or an algorithm offers the best solution to any complicated problem.</i>&quot;<p>All the projects from March to build 3D-printed ventilators at home, for instance, were technosolutionism. There&#x27;s a lack of a physical item; we have 3D printers. Obviously we can 3D print our way out of the problem!<p>I&#x27;d argue that <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vaccinateca.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vaccinateca.com&#x2F;</a> , for instance, is <i>not</i> technosolutionism in the definition above, despite it relying on a website and Airtable (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;patio11&#x2F;status&#x2F;1350539166296100864" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;patio11&#x2F;status&#x2F;1350539166296100864</a>), because they&#x27;re not saying &quot;We can build a platform for pharmacies to enter data,&quot; they&#x27;re saying &quot;We&#x27;re going to call up pharmacists, ourselves, and type what they say into a spreadsheet.&quot; Of course there&#x27;s a lot of technical work that went into Airtable. But the difference, I think, is that they set out to solve a problem, and along the way they found a place where technology can help; they didn&#x27;t set out to find a use for technology.')
