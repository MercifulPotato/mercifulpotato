I guess I assumed incorrectly that the original design of ESNI would not require DNS be in the flow for the validation, meaning that if I had local DNS, or &#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts entries, then nobody would see the name.  But if special record types are required, then &#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts or local DNS won&#x27;t suffice.  Just my opinion, but it feels like this was made unnecessarily complicated.  Feels like some concepts from SSH (host keys, caching host keys) and web servers (default _server_ name) could have been used for this, since I don&#x27;t really need to validate <i>who</i> I am talking to for passing the name.')
