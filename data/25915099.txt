I made a site intended to have (((&#x27;statement&#x27;, &#x27;response&#x27;), response), ... response) structure. Bunch of problems, including user input interaction.<p>After some time that&#x27;s how I explain what I&#x27;m building:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25788274" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25788274</a><p>if there&#x27;s some way to contact you, I&#x27;d be super happy to send you an introductory video and some alpha version.<p>For the original problem, I think the flatter the ontology, the better. I find short videos to be great explanation tools for example - 3Blue1Brown is absolutely insane. But it can be just linked in text after someone asks specific question. I think what is being attempted here is kind of doing philosophy and philosophy is done by giving responses (often: &#x27;you are having wrong argument&#x27; responses).<p>I&#x27;ve seen approach of making argument follow some traditional form (like enforcing using predefined logic to structure points), but I would like to have it as an emergent application. Extension from some subcommunity. It&#x27;s just a very costly solution - it works perfectly fine when you need to explain management methodology in corporate setting, for example. Lots of resources, expensive mistakes. And I&#x27;ve seen some attempts at providing just that, for example (warning, in Polish) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mysljaknaukowiec.pl&#x2F;dyskusje" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mysljaknaukowiec.pl&#x2F;dyskusje</a><p>In a way, that is a methodology debate. Making a tool for checking &#x27;what is&#x27; is one approach, making smaller tools that let people fail&#x2F;iterate upon ideas faster is another.')
