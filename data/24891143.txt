I&#x27;d love to see (or one day write) the equivalent of Practical Common Lisp (which itself needs an update at this point) because MftWP is sooo dated. But I can see how it&#x27;s a decent enough intro.<p>Regarding your points:<p>1. Yeah editor support sucks. I normally edit in text mode with my own minimal keyword highlighting or ocaml-mode.<p>2. Poly&#x2F;ML can definitely generate binaries! Most distros ship with `polyc` that will build the binary for you. But this is just a shell script around opening the REPL and calling some dump image function (like how you build a binary on SBCL). MLton and Poly&#x2F;ML definitely allow you to build binaries. I don&#x27;t know about SML&#x2F;NJ.<p>3. For sure a pain. I use rlwrap [0] to work around this, which is ultimately simple enough!<p>4. Interesting! I personally find Haskell-style decorations so much more a pain since they&#x27;re not inline. SML is very much like other major languages in the way it does inline types (TypeScript, Go, C#, etc.).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hanslub42&#x2F;rlwrap" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hanslub42&#x2F;rlwrap</a>')
