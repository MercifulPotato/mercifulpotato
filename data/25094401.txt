Say whatever about Intel, I am hoping that they get back on their feet in next few years with 5nm manufacturing.<p>Since when is competition and choice a bad thing? If you&#x27;re a chip design firm and you have a 8-month backlog to get your masks made at TSMC, what do you do then? TSMC can be world&#x27;s best fab but we need to address the SPOF condition that is so close to the political hot zone in the APEC region.<p>Intel should spin off its Fab division as a separate company, hire some top executives to rejuvinate the workforce, make it the coolest Fab company in the world to work for and leap ahead. Intel TMG&#x27;s Sohail was the biggest borderline criminal executive that was forced out a couple of years ago and was responsible for the 10nm delays.<p>It is enormously difficult for any startup to get into this space - you need billions and years of expertise to start a Fab. Or may be YC folks can? I worked in the Fab but don&#x27;t have a birds-eye view of what it takes for a startup to get into this space. It would be amazing to see startups trying to <i>manufacture</i> semiconductors... you know live up to the <i>Silicon</i> Valley&#x27;s name. You could have billions of dollars of economy built on services - US, EU and most advanced economies are shifting towards services; but they all rely on semiconductors. Imagine something were to happen to that... It is a juicy problem. We don&#x27;t need Uber&#x2F;AirBnb unicorns out of SV, we need Fairchild of the modern world from SV.<p>Edit: To see what kind of a beast EUV litho is, this is a good short documentary on it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=f0gMdGrVteI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=f0gMdGrVteI</a>')
