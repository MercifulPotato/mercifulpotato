Even consumables and small items are problematic. Just in the last year, I encountered many issues including:<p>* Showerhead that came without box, and clearly used. It still had a lot of water inside!<p>* Underwear from a brand that sells items inside a sealed bag and discards returns came used, without bag (yuck!)<p>* A module of Samsung RAM had visible wear signs and didn&#x27;t work<p>* Cycling glasses came without box and several missing items<p>The underwear thing upset me so much I emailed Jeff Bezos. After lots of emails forwarded around, nothing happened.<p>It&#x27;s sad because they used to be good. But the number of returned and counterfeit items sold as new is mindboggling.')
