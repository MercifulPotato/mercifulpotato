But if I want to know how much pink there is in the rose, I need a better descriptor than “very”.<p>So in that sense, Math is made up. It’s just the language we use to describe stuff when spoken&#x2F;literary languages are imprecise.<p>But it also isn’t made up because there are objective justified truths behind its symbols. Aliens would probably have the same concepts, they’d just use different symbols.')
