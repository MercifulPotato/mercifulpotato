Item(by='NoPie', descendants=None, kids=[25979796], score=None, time=1612107423, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25979411, text='I agree that AstraZeneca should have been communicating better. It is not the first time they have caused public outrage due to communication issues. On the other hand, this is pandemic and they are trying their best with the vaccine. Is it really the time to criticize them for minor faults?<p>They really believed that they will be able to manufacture all the doses in time. They had a bad luck. But again a year ago most didn&#x27;t even believe that such vaccine is possible, so they deserve credit for their efforts. Their vaccine appears effective â€“ most importantly the vaccine completely eliminated hospitalizations and deaths. The value of their product is very high and they are not even making profit from it.<p>&gt;&gt; Then maybe AZ should have made arrangements, or asked for help, if they saw they weren&#x27;t going to be able to fulfill the orders - or maybe they were expecting to move orders from UK, yet they were blocked? Who knows, right?<p>I don&#x27;t think there is any conspiracy. From AstraZeneca&#x27;s point they want to produce as much vaccine and as fast as possible and to give it to all countries. Taking manufactured vaccines from one country and giving them to another doesn&#x27;t magically increase the amount of available vaccines, so the value of that is low so they are not going to do it unless really necessary.<p>Maybe the argument is that the UK has already vaccinated their risk groups and their urgency is lower, so they could give more vaccine now to the EU. This is the argument from the WHO as well. I even partially agree to this, although I am a little bit suspicious about the WHO as they haven&#x27;t been very efficient during this pandemic. But at least it makes sense unlike all these talks about sanctity of (unclearly written) contracts.')
