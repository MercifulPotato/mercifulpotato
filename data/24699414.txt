When I think of New York City, which I would say is not only vibrant but nearly  <i>vibrating</i> with energy, it&#x27;s some combination of the following:<p>* A ton of different languages being spoken within earshot at any one time<p>* Lots of different smells at any one time, some delicious and certainly some much less so<p>* Lots of music where you do and do not expect it, all sorts of different genres sometimes complementing and sometimes juxtaposing the surroundings<p>* People physically moving and speaking faster<p>* The physical tightness of the city probably adds to all of the above<p>But most importantly, I think the above compose into an overall sense of serendipity. The phrase, &quot;in the city, anything is possible&quot; is frequently interpreted to mean, &quot;you can achieve the highest version of what you want to achieve!&quot; I think that&#x27;s actually incorrect. It means exactly what it says: anything is possible. Relative to suburban or rural areas, you simply have no idea what is coming next minute-to-minute. That, I think, gives a sensation of constantly anticipating serendipity, which we round out to the word &quot;vibrant.&quot;')
