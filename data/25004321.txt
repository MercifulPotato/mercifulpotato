At least not one that make sense beyond the context of my own life.<p>That being said, I like to think of everything in life as a means, rather than an end. The people I surround myself with, the material possessions I bring into your life, the food and water I consume and the ideas I exposed myself to can either enhance my existence or become clutter and crutches. The old saying &quot;the things you own end up owning you&quot;, applies to all of the above. It is your decision if these things are tools or toys.<p>So while you&#x27;re out there figuring out what the meaning of your life is, take stock of the &quot;things&quot; you&#x27;ve introduce and ask if they are enhancing your journey. This has been my criterion for abandoning bad habits, cutting out toxic people and getting away from social media (your question compelled me despite my better judgement).<p>The flip side to that is whether you are enhancing the lives of those you are around. Are you a coworker that elevates your teams, are you a supportive friend, are you a kind neighbor? You&#x27;re presence is a gift you give to others.')
