They&#x27;re also often in regular contact with practitioners on the field and can speak to the situation there, probably more so than random people on the street.<p>Here in Germany, virologists have very much been at the center of media attention (and not only of the media: the first PCR test for covid-19 was co-developed by Prof. Drosten who leads the virology department of the Charit√© clinic in Berlin).<p>&gt; By all means, have blind faith in the credentialed classes. Just remember these are the same people who came up with critical race theory, every replication failure in the field of psychology, the decades of 180 degree turns in nutrition, etc.<p>As well as with countless examples of genuine scientific and technological progress. It&#x27;s not that credentialed scientists are always right, it&#x27;s that <i>the scientific community</i> (not so much individuals) is much more likely to be right than random people. And that doesn&#x27;t mean that publication bias isn&#x27;t a thing, but I&#x27;m not gonna hedge my bets on what some un-credentialed people are going to say because they looked at a bunch of papers.<p>edit: and I&#x27;ll also mention that it seems you imply that scientists are a uniform bloc or that they all propose the same measures but that&#x27;s not even true. But they do, largely, agree on some key issues, most notably, that this is a dangerous virus. It is my understanding that not even Tegnell (from Sweden) denies this.')
