I do not see a lot of need for writing much new infrastructure. <i>Someone</i> needs to create and manage Kubernetes and its ilk, but the people doing this will make up a similar percentage of our society (and tech ecosystem) as people who generate electricity and grow food. Most of what we build amounts to modern shell scripts and crontab entries. The vast majority of what we create is mortar to cement together other people&#x27;s bricks. This is a great victory. I love programming but I also love getting things done quickly.')
