Typescript is inching closer and closer to the Haskell-ish land of turing complete type systems where the type system itself is nearly it&#x27;s own meta-programming language with each version.<p>(A recent example was the &quot;SQL engine&quot; written using string template literal types to type safe &quot;query&quot; an in-memory database. That&#x27;s quite more advanced than anything C# is capable of, albeit a strange hack and unlikely to be specifically something useful in production anytime soon, though still built out of things that make Typescript useful to some JS projects.)')
