All it would take is a little mistake and then you&#x27;d be lost already.<p>The code was written in 6502 assembler, it was a lot of fun to write. My buddy who wrote his own in Pascal was quite ticked off that my very straightforward &#x27;dumb&#x27; program would beat his extremely elegant program hands down simply because it would look on average two ply further ahead. That&#x27;s a lot of extra moves to analyze but the speed difference between machine language and Pascal (at the time, today this would definitely no longer be the case with our much better optimizing compilers) on an 8 bitter made this an uneven match.<p>On the plus side: his code was <i>far</i> more readable than mine.')
