The jury, so to speak, is still out.<p>Wrong again, you can violate anti-competition law without being a monopoly. You&#x27;re correct that it hasn&#x27;t been decided in a court of law.<p>I&#x27;m saying that I think they are engaging in anti-competitive behavior, you are saying &quot;actually it is okay because they haven&#x27;t been judged to engage in anti-competitive behavior in a court of law&quot;, which does not seem contrary to my claim, which is that I think they <i>should</i> be judged to engage in anti-competitive behavior.')
