Item(by='q3k', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607373463, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25334928, text='&gt; and we also are exploring using TPM remote attestation<p>I can already tell this is very likely not going to work fully, or even work for a sizeable chunk of Linux installations out there. Many platforms don&#x27;t have TPMs, or have TPMs from unknown CAs. Or firmware that you&#x27;re not aware of. Or even worse, people might just be running a Linux distribution that you don&#x27;t know about. Or a patched kernel. Or a bootloader that doesn&#x27;t measure the next stage into TPM. Not to mention, even the most popular distributions allow you to do anything with root access, things that you just won&#x27;t be able to measure, but that might allow people to cheat.<p>TPMs really only make sense for _very_ controlled environments if you want to prevent hardware tampering at this level. The diversity of Linux distributions (and PCs in general) truly works against you here.')
