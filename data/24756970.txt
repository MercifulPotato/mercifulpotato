I&#x27;m not alone so it does seem like people are having fewer meetings (positive!) but the idea that we&#x27;re all going to be remote knowledge workers after this seems to be a fantasy.  I think the remote workforce will grow 2-4x, and certain nonessential knowledge work will become remote (and therefore cheaper) but the best and brightest knowledge workers will continue to all congregate in high COL cities for career development and things by and large will not be that different.')
