The first element is <i>at</i> the start of the array, so the offset is naturally zero—there are zero elements prior to the first element. Like the markings on a ruler, array indices are cardinal numerals (0, 1, 2, …) counting the distance from a reference point, not ordinal numerals (1st, 2nd, 3rd, …) representing rank in a  sequential order.')
