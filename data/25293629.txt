Item(by='effingwewt', descendants=None, kids=[25294922, 25294056, 25296570], score=None, time=1607024574, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25293108, text='I think this isn&#x27;t nearly so bad as forcing an early termination of two weeks notice.<p>I had a job pretty recently, was senior tech and was eager to please, which ended up meaning having to take the hard&#x2F;after hours calls no one else wanted to handle. It also meant I eventually became the only on-call tech for over 4 months straight. This in turn meant I knew the most about all of our accounts, knew the most about their systems, scheduling for jobs as well as subcontractors, I handled it all, right down to installing the CCTV systems at our new location, single handedly.<p>When I decided I&#x27;d had enough of being taken advantage of and being lied to, I gave my two weeks notice.<p>They assumed I was going to work for a competitor (I wasn&#x27;t I was taking some much needed personal time), and they fired me on the spot. While walking me out they also informed me that since they had my resignation letter if I tried to claim unemployment they would use it to claim I had resigned. I didn&#x27;t care as I wasn&#x27;t in need of unemployment I was just even happier now about leaving. They were rude, talked down to me and belittled me all the way out.<p>2 hours after I left the calls began &#x27;how do we&#x27; &#x27;how does this&#x27; &#x27;this job&#x27;s permits&#x27; &#x27;how do we log into&#x27;. I politely told them to fuck  off. They even went so far as to have other workers call&#x2F;text me asking the same questions ver batim.<p>I will never again give 2 weeks notice unless I have in writing they must give me 2 weeks notice upon release for any reason other than something illegal.<p>This person offered an ultimatum and their employer made a choice. I just don&#x27;t think its as bad as early termination of 2 weeks notice.')
