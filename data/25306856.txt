Item(by='hiq', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607111392, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25301032, text='Again, you can make it a newbie question by just accepting any sort, including one you come up with on your own (so no need to remember). I&#x27;m sure you can design your own sort given enough time, granted 10 minutes might be too short to get it nice and clean, but with a bit more you&#x27;re on the level of difficulty of fizzbuzz.<p>To make my point clear, you can implement a dumb and inefficient sort by implementing a min function, taking this min, then iteratively call it on what&#x27;s left of the array and append the values to a new array which you then return. That won&#x27;t get you into FAANGM, but maybe that&#x27;s enough to get some discussion started in an interview at a company that&#x27;s not too much into leetcode and is trying to evaluate other skills like communication. And I do think that 99% of people who write code every week could come up with something like this or better fairly quickly.')
