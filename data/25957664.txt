Item(by='zinekeller', descendants=None, kids=[25965566], score=None, time=1611931263, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25957528, text='&gt; Seems to me this article is swaying to some type of narrative someone wants to propagate rather than aiming to be somewhat objective regarding current events.<p>Note the &quot;If&quot;. Left had indeed <i>claimed</i> that there were attacks on his personal peers, and I agree that if it were true it is overstepping their right to privacy and probably life if the <i>claimed</i> attacks were death threats.<p>HOWEVER, if it turns out that Left is lying I will agree that Left have commited defamation against a group of possibly hundreds of thousands of people and I would really suggest to him at that moment (apart from what the law thinks appropriate, which is a somewhat long prison time) to really apologise and permanently stay outside of the stock market.<p>He is English and I knew from reading their (in a country sense) opinion pieces that they tend to put distance in unsure or unverified information, possibly because of the <i>much</i> stricter libel&#x2F;defamation laws there (see as an example <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;z49LjJj3VTI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;z49LjJj3VTI</a> that discusses why there is avoidance on the phrase &quot;tired and emotional&quot; which acquired a different meaning in UK). I guess that this is just an unintentional carryover especially that American opinion pieces don&#x27;t really delinate fact from opinion in their writing.')
