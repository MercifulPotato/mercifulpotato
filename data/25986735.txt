Now it’s $1.29&#x2F;pound.<p>I’ve seen other basic food commodities also increase 50%. This is the fastest rate increase that I’ve seen in quite a while, if ever.<p>The only saving grace is that I’m not commuting to work. But the savings from gasoline, just went straight into groceries. Hence, practically no savings at all.<p>I’m not looking forward to when we must go back into the office, and then everything still remains at the higher prices.<p>I would need to demand a raise or a promotion to match up with the inflation.')
