I would never read either, but likely Nabokov before Lawrence, because I have enjoyed other Russian writers... Chekov, Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, I expect having completely unrelated subject and content. I&#x27;m simply not interested in reading stories about love, do not appreciate that every movie has a gratuitous love scene and thin subplot dedicated to it, though I have read all of Rilke&#x27;s love letters, and I read Gibran&#x27;s chapters on love, marriage, children and friendship many many times, and will continue to do so.<p>I did enjoy the article, like how Wilson writes, and am satisfied to learn I am in complete disagreement with Lawrence as Wilson has revealed him (e.g. Plato&#x27;s dialogues are neither queer nor little.)')
