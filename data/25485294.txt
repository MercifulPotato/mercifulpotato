I have no problem with startups building a functional prototype without getting an army of lawyers involved. But you should then have a good gut sense that you&#x27;re doing something that&#x27;s pretty safe. This business model, as broad as it&#x27;s positioned, clearly isn&#x27;t. How can that ever be so much of an afterthought as here demonstrated? Does that also mean that the pricing is based on not factoring in the risk (penalties, legal costs) of selling copyrighted or restricted materials? Does it factor in the moderation that needs to happen?')
