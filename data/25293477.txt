Perhaps there is a need for discussing the Google Brain project specifically from a woman&#x27;s point of view.<p>But when I hear about a &#x27;Google Brain Women and Allies&#x27; distro, I&#x27;m more thinking about peers which discuss things which impact them. I wouldn&#x27;t get too hung up about the &#x27;Google Brain&#x27; portion of the distro; it&#x27;s likely just a way  to self-select a group of peers which share a common interest.')
