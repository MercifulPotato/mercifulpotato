TL;DR I know more about AWS now without actually having worked in it.<p>That said, I wouldn&#x27;t go for any of the other certifications without actually working &#x2F; having worked professionally in AWS. Or anything you can get certified for, for that matter.<p>I mean iirc I&#x27;ve got some cisco certifications as well but I and everyone else cheated on the exam and don&#x27;t remember anything of it.')
