Not just from the point of view of comp, but from the point of view of democracy.

They&#x27;re not the only way and they&#x27;re not infallible, but when they do work they&#x27;re guaranteed to better than nothing.<p>They not only redistribute income, but they also give individuals collective pushback against corporate bullying and abuse.<p>Or perhaps you&#x27;d rather continue to grumble that HR is always there to take the company&#x27;s side, but do nothing about it?')
