All I&#x27;m saying is that, whether the TCP&#x2F;IP stack is in kernel or user space, the specific HTTP(S) handling is always in user-space in all OSS that I know of - so there is no choice to be made for HTTP itself in this regard. You can put any HTTP 1, 2 or 3 implemention that you like over either DPDK or the traditional Linux TCP&#x2F;IP stack.')
