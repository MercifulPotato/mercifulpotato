Apparently, most hedge funds are actually doubling down on their short positions, believing people who are holding will sell. GME is still shorted more than 100%, so it&#x27;s basically a game of chicken between short and long gamers.<p>The problem is the shorts have to pay interest, so they need an out ASAP, while the sentiment of the longs is that they will hold indefinitely.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m not a financial advisor, and I don&#x27;t even have any of the shorted stocks. I&#x27;m just following the news.')
