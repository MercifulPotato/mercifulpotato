I think you are reading too much into the &quot;once been famous&quot; bit.\n&quot;insa&quot; is a word from the same root that means &quot;forget it&quot;.\nI actually think both words are still in usage. Probably the more accurate translation is, &quot;it was once known (i.e. known to all within the community) but has now been forgotten&quot;. Famous is less accurate.<p>It is used for mundane things. For example, the location of an abandoned water well.')
