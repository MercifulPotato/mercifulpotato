For example, the last 24hr bitcoin is up like 10%.. Let&#x27;s call 5% below the current price the 24hr average.. are you suggesting that the exchange rate is 1% above the 24avg, or 4% below the current price, meaning the seller is eating 4% of the current price? That certainly does not make any sense.<p>That was based on how I remembered some merchants handled conversion a few years ago. I just did a test with coingate and the spread between their rate and the market rate is under 0.05% (yes that&#x27;s a fraction of a percent, not 5%).<p>&gt;I agree the seller can&#x27;t really get scammed, but the buyer has --zero-- recourse<p>I don&#x27;t disagree that credit card protections are good for the consumer. The problem is that there&#x27;s no opt out (eg. horror stories about people&#x27;s paypal accounts being frozen because of a surge in donations), and you&#x27;re forced to use the bank (or credit card company) as the escrow.')
