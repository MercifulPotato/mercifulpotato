You are free to argue we should be paying more for energy so its sustainable, but unless you are going to bring some serious evidence you can&#x27;t just claim the problem is easilly sorted and wind + solar grid would be cheaper than nuclear.<p>Current and projected cost of storage is relatively high, the most cost efficient storage is hydro and compressed air, they are not showing any kind of fast decrease in cost.<p>Maybe there is potential in energy grids that span continents and have large over-capacity - then you dont need much storage.<p>I am assuming we are talking about imminent future, in 50 years maybe math is different, but thats too late for climate change.')
