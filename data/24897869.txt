Think of the extreme leftists of May 1968, who were fighting against what they saw as insufficiently punished or even resurgent fascism. Since advocating for sexual minorities was not a central part of their struggle (even feminism or gay men’s issues were at the margins), we are supposed to assume that those anti-fascists were themselves fascist. That’s absurd.')
