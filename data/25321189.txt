Fatalities from other causes would increase too (as they&#x27;re already doing due to people avoiding medical care due to fear of infection at hospitals).  The absolute number of dead would also rise were the lockdowns not in place.  Just how many people do we want to sacrifice to keep restaurants open?<p>Also, fatalities aren&#x27;t the only thing we have to worry about.  People who survive can have very serious complications.<p>Finally, why should we only look at the effects on people younger than 70?')
