Growing appreciation for this kind of stuff often requires a level of understanding that a lot of the people in the industry lack. You can&#x27;t miss what you don&#x27;t know about.<p>I&#x27;ll give some examples:<p>You cannot appreciate the extreme simplicity of Pascal or other Wirthian languages if you never wrote your own compiler. For the average developer, it is just a procedural language with weird excessive syntax, annoying separation between interface and implementation and way too picky about where you declare your variables.<p>You cannot appreciate Forth if you don&#x27;t know how the machine works and see the beauty of threaded code. Forth then just becomes this reverse Polish notation thing that some crazy people love. They really must be nuts, as I&#x27;m solving my problems with C and JavaScript just fine. Why do they like RPN so much and why can&#x27;t they just shut up about it?<p>So the same goes for Lisp and Smalltalk. These are not regular languages, they have operating system aspirations. What a small group of people were doing with Lisp Machines when everyone else were using line editors is completely unknown for the average developer, they just see the parenthesis and run away.<p>As you mention it is also the reason why I&#x27;m partial to Common Lisp over something like Scheme and Clojure. I mean, I like those a lot as well, but they don&#x27;t offer me much over plain JavaScript and I&#x27;d rather use APL :)')
