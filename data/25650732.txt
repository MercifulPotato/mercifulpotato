The coup is unrelated (would you support bombing a different country over something that happened 60 years ago when both countries had very different governments?), and quite funny when one remembers the Islamists also supported the coup.<p>&gt;It seems to me like they tried to be constructive with the Iran Deal<p>If you define being constructive as taking hostages over and over than yes they were.')
