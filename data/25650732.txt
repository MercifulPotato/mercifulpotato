The coup is unrelated (would you support bombing a different country over something that happened 60 years ago when both countries had very different governments?), and quite funny when one remembers the Islamists also supported the coup.<p>&gt;It seems to me like they tried to be constructive with the Iran Deal<p>If you define being constructive as taking hostages over and over than yes they were.<p>&gt;There&#x27;s little credible evidence Iran is trying to actually build a bomb.<p>Apart from weapon drawings, direct recordings of one the key architects discussing weapons[1], mass uranium enrichment.... SA has nothing remotely comparable.<p>[1]\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.timesofisrael.com&#x2F;israel-has-tape-of-slain-iran-nuke-chief-talking-about-building-five-warheads&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.timesofisrael.com&#x2F;israel-has-tape-of-slain-iran-...</a>')
