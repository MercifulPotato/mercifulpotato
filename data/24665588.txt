One told me he believes his olfactory senses are about 70% recovered, 5 months later. He&#x27;s lost weight from losing the desire to eat, which is terrifying. Hopefully it&#x27;s just a matter of time and they recover fully - there&#x27;s a lot about the virus we still don&#x27;t fully understand, and there is a chance of permanent effects even with mild symptoms.')
