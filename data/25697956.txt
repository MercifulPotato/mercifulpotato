Trump&#x27;s comments about &quot;very fine people&quot; came <i>after</i> the deadly white supremacist rally, so it&#x27;s misleading to imply that those comments were in encouragement of the killing.<p>However, it&#x27;s perfectly valid to construe Trump&#x27;s comments as <i>praise</i> after the fact for the white supremacist rally, even though he specifically condemned the killing that resulted. Because Trump&#x27;s assertions that there were &quot;very fine people&quot; on both sides and that there were many people on the alt-right side of that event who were <i>not</i> neo-Nazis or white nationalists are simply not credible claims. Trump was praising <i>somebody</i>. Even praising or encouraging the kind of white supremacists who don&#x27;t get violent is abhorrent conduct on the part of the president, but the comment upthread exaggerated beyond this.')
