Going to the basics of say energy production, heat engines are already close to theoretical limitations.  We already have  60+% efficient power plant so nothing  can double future efficiency, and even in theory hitting 100% is never going to happen.  The world has better technology and more infrastructure than 10 years ago, but itâ€™s almost entirely evolutionary not revolutionary.   Even the tantalizing self driving cars in the near future come with a massive downside of congestion from cars driving without people in them.<p>As to nanotechnology, we already design molecules to interface with biology via synthetic drugs, so essentially biological nanotechnology is going to be about creating larger structures not smaller ones.')
