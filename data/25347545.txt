If there is determined to be harm, I see no reason to protect them.<p>But should the US government, given the current developments, ban Twitter and&#x2F;or Facebook? That is what I&#x27;m asking.<p>Because they are quite literally doing the same as TikTok. Now, is TikTok spying for China? Except for a few reports, there is no proof of it. In fact, the US government would <i>not</i> ban TikTok if they sell their business to US companies.<p>So either TikTok does not spy on their customers for China, or they do, and the US government wants to have control over data illegally harvested.<p>Either way, forcing TikTok hand is not a move made to protect US citizens.')
