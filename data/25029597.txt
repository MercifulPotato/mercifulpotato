On one hand Element (the company set up by the core Matrix team) depends on government work to keep the lights on for Matrix work, but on the other hand we feel a clear responsibility to push back on backdoors, given backdoors are intrinsically flawed and dangerous.  This is why we&#x27;re proposing a (hopefully) better alternative instead (and this is also why we&#x27;re soliciting funding to support reputation work via the Matrix.org Foundation at funding@matrix.org, just in case any YC billionaires happen to be reading this...)')
