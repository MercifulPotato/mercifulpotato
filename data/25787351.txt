They&#x27;re disproportionately likely to be folks who bear greater burdens under the ACA--like small business owners. Or the majority of people who are happy with their private health insurance.<p>I don&#x27;t understand this at all.  The ACA has been a godsend for myself who over the last 8 years been an owner(for 4 years) and employee(for 4 years) at a small business.  It allowed me to work for a small business(as both an employee and an owner) because I could get insurance.  I tried getting insurance before the ACA and was denied because my testosterone levels were 5% under the cut off for normal.<p>And second it&#x27;s been super helpful because the biggest barrier to recruiting for a small business is healthcare.  Specifically many developers are willing to take a 30k+ paycut to get premium healthcare(which isn&#x27;t providing 30k of value but is unpurchaseable for small clients) and this problem was worse pre-ACA.  If we had a Medicare option the job market would be more efficient, and small businesses would be better able to compete with enterprise.')
