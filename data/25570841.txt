Feels snappy. One thing I&#x27;m missing (maybe it&#x27;s the mobile UI layout) is a search.<p>I&#x27;m using pinboard.in for years and the search (either by tag or by URL&#x2F;description) is by far the most useful to find anything later on. Nobody wants to click through dozens of pages of tags to find the one you&#x27;re looking for :)')
