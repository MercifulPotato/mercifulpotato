If you happen to be on a machine that doesn&#x27;t have your usual setup, please consider using our platform. It&#x27;s super useful if you work with other people remotely as you&#x27;re able to work on the same notebook in near real-time[0], see each other&#x27;s cursors and changes, etc.<p>[0]: I&#x27;ve received some remarks about the fact I say &quot;near real-time&quot; and not &quot;real-time&quot;. We have too many people from an Electronics Engineering background, including myself, on the team to dare use the term &quot;real-time&quot; for a web service. That&#x27;s why we say &quot;near real-time&quot;.')
