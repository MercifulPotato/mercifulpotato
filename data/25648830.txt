As I pointed out in another reply, unless the amount of information the aliens can possibly get about chess games is severely limited (excluding, for example, information that would allow them to see that games between specific pairs of players are rarely even-odds) then chess does not actually look like a random process - but if they are limited to that extent, then they are not going to determine that it is a game of rules, no matter what their philosophy and no matter how much they suspect that it is.<p>There is nothing unrealistic about random processes, and if the aliens take chess to be one, they are simply mistaken on account of their inability to get sufficient information to falsify this view.<p>There is a pretty well-known historical example in the opposition by Ernst Mach and the logical positivists to Boltzmann&#x27;s work. I hope it is safe to say that the simplistic philosophical notions behind that opposition are now outdated and superseded.')
