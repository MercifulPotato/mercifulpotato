RIAA advances three theories:<p><i>(i) [to] circumvent the technological protection measures used by authorized streaming services such as YouTube</i><p><i>(ii) reproduce and distribute music videos and sound recordings owned by our member companies without authorization for such use.</i><p>Third;  <i>We also note that the source code prominently includes as sample uses of the source code the downloading of copies of our members’ copyrighted sound recordings and music videos</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20201025095539&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;github&#x2F;dmca&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;2020-10-23-RIAA.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20201025095539&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.co...</a><p>#1 Falls under §1201, for a maybe-anticirc tool created by a third party for whom RIAA&#x27;s standing is likely nil.  The anticirc use &amp; claim itself is weak.<p>#2 is ... at best vague, but seems to aver contributory infringement, which ... is not related to any Chapter 1 rights or Chapter 5 penalties that I see.  Users of a tool might be liable, but not its developers or manufacturers.  Otherwise, a very weak §1201 claim.<p>#3 Fails to identify an infringement in the work but instead in its use.  The infringing  party given Github&#x27;s CI&#x2F;CD process would actually be RIAA member Microsoft.  Use of works is <i>de minimis</i> and passes at least three of the §107 Fair Use affirmative defence tests, as well as §117 (computer program), §512(a) and&#x2F;or §512(b) (Transitory Digital Network Communications).<p>As to YouTube works&#x27; copyright status, under Berne (US copyright since 1976), copyright exists &quot;in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression&quot;, with very limited exceptions, <i>automatically, with no action required of the author.</i>  US Government works and expired copyrights are the principle exceptions.  Some authorities dispute that works can be put in the public domain otherwise (I&#x27;m not convinced).  While <i>some</i> YouTube content is in the public domain, the overwhelming majority is subject to copyright.')
