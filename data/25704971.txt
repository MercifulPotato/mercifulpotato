By suppressing the sharing of that information people are actually less likely to be aware that&#x27;s what they were chanting (I know I would be less aware because that&#x27;s where I learned about it).<p>Now I guess there&#x27;s the potential they weren&#x27;t actually shouting that and it was dubbed, but it seemed credible based on many of the sources discussing it on twitter, some of whom were 1 degree separated from the source of the video.<p>Aside: there are so many landmines in me writing this that I don&#x27;t know how to qualify my comments well enough to not be accused of something. Guess no one has to say to me &quot;may you live in interesting times.&quot;')
