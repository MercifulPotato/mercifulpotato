The decline of java may be the saddest story in computer science.\nIt was just before my time. </i><p>Java is far from the only object-oriented language. Does the author suggest that C# and Python are of only historical significance? It&#x27;s unsubstantiated to associate the decline (?) of Java with the decline (?) of object oriented programming, and even moreso to associate either of them with the implied decline (?) of composability, which can be achieved in many ways other than object orientation. For example, Go and Rust do not implement OOP in the same way as Java, but many people think their modifications <i>improve</i> composability, far from contributing to its decline. What we have in the quote are three dubious facts (it&#x27;s not clear how much of a decline any of those have undergone), associated through nonexistent connections (they are not related).')
