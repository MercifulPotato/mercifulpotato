It is an awesome language for prototyping, teaching and scripting<p>2) If you want speed, it likely means you are doing math operations, for example ML. In that case, you&#x27;d better learn to use state-of-the-art math libraries, made of decades of hardware and mathematical expert knowledge you will never beat.<p>It would serve you better to :<p>- learn about existing state-of-the-art compiled librairies and tools in your problem space<p>- learn to profile your Python code<p>Python is a great orchestrator to glue libraries and external systems together. If you are reinventing everything in Python, you are not solving actual problems. It&#x27;s matter of using the right tool for the right task.<p>Python is a mean to achieve something greater, it&#x27;s not an end by itself.')
