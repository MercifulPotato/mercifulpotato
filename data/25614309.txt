Marvel has a huge universe but it&#x27;s mostly derivate, trite, n-th repeatitions of same-old under different names and guises. Star Wars had a cultural significance in a way that Marvel movies never had (but Marvel comics, in their heyday, did, albeit for a smaller niche).<p>Plus, the Star Wars world was such a good fit for building upon, that it was expanded vastly by hundreds of comics, books, and so expanding &quot;the canon&quot;.<p>&gt;<i>and constantly just microwave and serve the leftovers of the old movies</i><p>Funny coming from someone who enjoys Marvel.')
