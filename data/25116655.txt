I&#x27;ve had desktops &#x2F; laptops like this that have worked continuously for over ten years. EOL for these machines is usually a migration or a replacement.<p>Yes, little things do break every now and then, just like they do on your Mac. These regressions are rare, and they&#x27;re usually easy to fix. Once you&#x27;ve gotten past the initial install, blanking displays and fubared bootloaders aren&#x27;t nearly as common as the doubt peddlers would have you believe.<p>Major upgrades are a pain no matter what software you&#x27;re running. But commercial vendors like Apple and Microsoft are incentivized to make these updates flashy in order to sell you stuff (new hardware&#x2F;software), or to market themselves (&quot;look at our cool new&#x2F;repainted stuff!&quot;). You&#x27;re always going to get big updates from these companies, and installing them never going to be boring.<p>But for the most part, these rolling release Linux machines end up being just that... boring! They chug along looking and acting the same for 5, 10, 15 years straight. If you wake up one day feeling like you want something flashy, you can always change your wallpaper. But for most days when you don&#x27;t, there&#x27;s really no good reason to have these big, catastrophic updates every year or two. They&#x27;re a waste of everybody&#x27;s time and energy.')
