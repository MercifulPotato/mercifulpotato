He said, dismiss 230 for anything that is negative algorithmic amplification. I think you get rid of 230 for any content that is seeing any algorithmic amplification. Once you’re amplifying it, you’re making editorial decisions, right? It doesn’t matter if it’s automated, right? Because someone had to build the automation and incorporate and build those weights and balances. And so once you start amplifying it, regardless of how you got there, now you’re a publisher. You’re making choices on what content to present to people. You’re making choices that — this person leans right, and so I’m going to keep on giving him more, and his friends lean right, so they’re all in this bubble and this particular type of content.<p>This is a brilliant idea.')
