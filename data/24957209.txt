Almost a meta-understanding of understanding. Which starts with self awareness and understanding of categories and taxonomies, what they are, who defines them, that there exist more than one, and that they are just models that serve practical needs.<p>That said, it isn&#x27;t always easy, I feel like it was only 5 years ago I started to realize this myself as I got more interested in models, categories and taxonomies. And I feel this is a common mistake people make prior to being experts themselves (in any field), is confusing the abstraction for the concrete.<p>A very simple example is how tomatoes are both fruits and veggies, in reality, tomatoes are tomatoes, but in culinary science, it is more useful to consider a tomato a vegetable, because most recipes that call for fruits wouldn&#x27;t be good with tomatoes in them. On the other hand, in botanical science, it is categorized a fruit, as fruit describes the category of seed-bearing structures in flowering plants.<p>This shows how various studies will use different models, categories and taxonomies to work with that is best adapted for their end results.<p>The beauty of such models is that they can help innovation, by allowing us to reason about more than we can at once. That&#x27;s the benefit of any abstraction. But in doing so, we also reduce reality to a simplification, albeit one that ideally allows us to figure out something which meets our requirements and provide us the practical benefits we were looking for, like say figuring out how to build a machine that can fly.<p>So my advice would be to stop arguing semantics, because so often people will debate what is what: &quot;no tomatoes arn&#x27;t fruit that&#x27;s ridiculous they are vegetable&quot;. Well who cares, they are what works best, and if you&#x27;re baking, its better to consider them a vegetable, but if you&#x27;re gardening, you&#x27;ll be better considering them fruits. So instead start arguing about the models, it&#x27;s better they be fruits when gardening because of x,y,z practical reasons that apply to gardening.')
