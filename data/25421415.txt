That&#x27;s time spent on productive tasks directly tied to my projects, not time spent in meetings, commute, and other wasted desk time.<p>I usually manage 5-6 hours of productive time each day. 7 hours on a good day. 8 hours if the problem is interesting enough.<p>I used to feel inadequate when I would hear stories of founders and geniuses working 16 hours&#x2F;day. But now I&#x27;m convinced that outside of prodigies, specific mindless tasks, and &quot;outside help&quot; (like amphetamines), it&#x27;s impossible to get more than 8-10 hours of <i>real</i> work done in a day over an extended period.')
