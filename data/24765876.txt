Item(by='pimterry', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602599424, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24763734, text='With my open-source product I&#x27;m in a very similar place, and I do _mostly_ the same thing.<p>My product (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;httptoolkit.tech" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;httptoolkit.tech</a>) is a debugging proxy app. The codebase is broken up into a few modules: a desktop shell, a UI, a backend component for the UI, plus a standalone proxy library and a bundle of smaller libraries that do everything from detecting &amp; launching browsers to reparent react components around the DOM (if you&#x27;re interested, they&#x27;re all on github: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;httptoolkit&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;httptoolkit&#x2F;</a>).<p>All of this is open-source, with some premium features behind a subscription (but even those are open-source, it&#x27;s just you&#x27;d have to fork it to remove the subscription checks, and it&#x27;s not worth the time of any professional to maintain their own fork of the whole project).<p>The core product is AGPL, but nothing else. More specifically, product-unique components are AGPL (the UI, the backend, etc) where there&#x27;s no clear case for ever reusing them other than duplicating&#x2F;forking the product, but everything else is kept under permissive licenses, mostly Apache 2. This is mainly because AGPL really limits practical freedoms in business contexts: It&#x27;s harder to get sign-off to contribute to (A)GPL libraries, even in a one-off script nobody wants to risk using an (A)GPL library and it would become much harder to find contributors.<p>So far I&#x27;ve found this has worked pretty well for me, and I&#x27;d recommend it to others, including Plausible. Put only the core product-specific components under AGPL, but keep everything that might be useful to somebody building a completely different product under more relaxed licenses wherever you can to ensure you can fully engage with the open-source community.')
