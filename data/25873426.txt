That&#x27;s an invention of yours.<p>I do make the verifiable claim that they lack the configurability of Windows 3 as regards font and color choices throughout the UI, and further that this is in fact an accessibility feature in itself.<p>Windows 10, for instance, only allows you to change the &quot;accent color&quot; and select either &quot;light mode&quot; or &quot;dark mode&quot;. While it does allow a change in font size, if there&#x27;s a place in its settings dialogs to change the default font itself I couldn&#x27;t find it, although I did find a place to change it in the registry.')
