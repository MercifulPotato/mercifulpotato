Consider music: people listen to music for a lot of reasons, like lyrics, lack of lyrics, beat, ability to fade into the background...  Many options will satisfy, and the simplest signifiers are adequate.  That&#x27;s why popular headphones emphasize bass these days, for example.<p>And there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that!  In the case of wine, people who aren&#x27;t really into it will simply look for signifiers for what they&#x27;re in the mood for (I&#x27;m in this group): more acidic, more sweet, bubbly-and-I-don&#x27;t-care-otherwise which will naturally cause the popular wines to &quot;cluster&quot; around one of these factors.  The product is essentially a commodity.<p>There will be a small number of people who really get into it (&quot;sophistication&quot; is the technical term but unfortunately it has terrible connotations) and can parse out the differences, and who might seek out a second order factor they like.  But those people are always, by definition, going to be in the minority.<p>The second factor of course is Vleben.  This also applies well beyond wine, such as the whole &quot;prosumer&quot; segment, &quot;SUV&quot;s build on automotive chassis, etc.')
