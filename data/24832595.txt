In a very real sense, it is their platform to administer as they see fit. That includes sending notifications.<p>In that sense, why is a popup window so upsetting. Is the issue somehow related to voting ( as in, my company probably shouldn&#x27;t send a mass email saying to vote for Trump&#x2F;Biden ) that makes people so upset? That I could understand, but that does not appear to be a complaint here.<p>What am I missing here?')
