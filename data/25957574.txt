WSB has promoted a cartoonish version of Wall Street where hedge funds only hold rich, evil people&#x27;s money. That&#x27;s not really how this works.<p>A lot of people are also going to be disappointed to learn that some Wall Street firms profited massively from this situation.<p>And finally, a lot of retail investors who were late to the party are going to lose a lot of money on this. Some of that will flow to early Redditors who got their exit timing right. Some of that will flow to hedge funds who cleverly scooped up the naive money in the chaos.<p>I&#x27;d go so far as to bet that journalists are already working on articles with all of these angles. They&#x27;ll start to trickle out just as soon as the market euphoria wanes.')
