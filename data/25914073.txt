They typically have some great support acts too, with friends from the US and Canada often coming across to tour like Richard Shindell.<p>England and Wales in particular have a habit of losing the history of the countryside, and folk songs are one of the only ways it seems to persist. And I love how current artists are both falling back on their experiences but also doing their own research into old, forgotten tunes and songs to bring life back into them and make them relevant again.')
