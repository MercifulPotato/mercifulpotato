Chinese people do not use the word boba in Asian countries because in Taiwanese, it means “big breasts,” which is how they got the name for the drink to describe the little tapioca balls. The drink just recently in the past few years became popular in America and mostly everyone knows what it is. Boba used to only be used in the Asian community and has now spread to a word used by all ethnicities.&quot;')
