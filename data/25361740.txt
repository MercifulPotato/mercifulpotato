Excess mortality from Covid-19 may be less pronounced than previously perceived in Sweden, and mortality displacement might explain part of the observed findings. We hope that these findings can pave the way for a less polarized and more open-minded discussion about pros and cons with less compared with more drastic measures against the Covid-19 epidemic.')
