I&#x27;ve sent a 1000+ in the last year.<p>I try to make them really personalized. Like if your website is acmewidgets.com - I&#x27;ll put &quot;Acme Widget Help?&quot; as the subject.<p>My own takeaways:<p>1. Plain Text for sure<p>2. Super short - my standard sort of email is now about 3 sentences.<p>3. Ask a question - in my case there&#x27;s a couple of driving reasons to sign up so I try and make sure they&#x27;re doing ok.<p>Even with all of the above I still maybe am only getting a 30% response rate.')
