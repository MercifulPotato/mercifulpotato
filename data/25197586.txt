SBSettings, basically control center before Apple added the control center.<p>2. Flux, before Apple added Night Mode (or whatever they call it)<p>3. Winterboard, for theming the phone in ways<p>4. Gameboy emulator, though now I think this can be done without jailbreak.<p>5. Unlocking the carrier.<p>6. File explorer<p>I&#x27;m sure there was more too.<p>For me jailbreaking is partly a philosophical goal, but also I just like seeing all the stuff people come up with when they aren&#x27;t restrained by the walls of the garden.<p>If you read above you&#x27;ll see most of the good jailbreak tweaks were brought into stock iOS at some point, which is great too. Let jailbroken users&#x2F;devs try new things and if they work well bring them in with some Apple polish.')
