But other molecules, such as carbon, can crystallize in multiple ways, leading to graphite or diamond. This is called polymorphism and no one has seen the early stages of the nucleation that leads to it. I hope our study provides the first step in understanding the mechanism of polymorphism.”<p>I&#x27;m amused that Chemists &#x2F; Physicists also have the word &quot;Polymorphism&quot; and that it means something completely different from the programming term.')
