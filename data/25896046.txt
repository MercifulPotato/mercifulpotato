This is natural since space isn&#x27;t exactly accessible to general public, but it can be frustrating for enthusiasts, especially since unfounded claims spread much more widely and quickly than corrections do.<p>Well said.<p>&gt; All that said, no company is above criticism<p>Agreed.<p>&gt; and I do not encourage fanboyism.<p>Nah man, it&#x27;s cool to be a fanboy of SpaceX. But I think the point is that we&#x27;re not overly sensitive to criticism of SpaceX.')
