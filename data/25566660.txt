Can just put whatever like?&quot; Etc etc.. even if you baby people through all of that, you still end up with a device that needs to be backed up, isn&#x27;t available when the powers out at home etc..<p>Not knocking the nas&#x27;s btw, I really like them because they do make it relatively simple to do a whole swathe of the common services, but it&#x27;s only simple to me because I know how to do it by hand. A non technical person won&#x27;t even understand the terminology.<p>That said.. I did wonder whether the deployment of solar and batteries to many homes might eventually also enable the deployment of edge services to per home servers. Right now the power draw prob makes in unworkable, as do maintenance costs.. but won&#x27;t someone think of the reduced latency?')
