Item(by='acituan', descendants=None, kids=[24736228, 24734783], score=None, time=1602278983, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24733002, text='&gt; I want to applaud this, because it&#x27;s clearly a good move.<p>Itâ€™s not that clear to me that this is a net good move. Exposure to out-network content, depending on what is exposed, could be good for preventing echo chambers and confirmation bias too. Twitter likely went the other direction and promoted out-network tweets that only increased engagement, and blaming the feature itself for this is naive at best.<p>Second issue everyone seems to be missing is the potential partisan-ness of these feature changes. Do the usage of any individual feature distribute equally among all demographics? If not, feature-shaping a near election could be construed as an underhanded way to hamper the discourse of certain demographics. Of course this is very easy to dismiss as <i>conspiratorial thinking</i>, but I think ideally any intellectually honest discourse engine would have gone the extra mile to demonstrate the neutrality of their election specific changes.')
