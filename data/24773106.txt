This is quite important because the terms used somewhere can mean very different things elsewhere.<p>I go to the table of contents and start with the most interesting part. You don&#x27;t always have to begin on the first page or the easiest one. If I feel bored or forced, I move to the next.<p>Keep reading different interesting bits. The concepts will naturally link to one another. The more concepts you have linked to a new concept, the easier the new concept is to understand.<p>Some here say learn by doing, and that&#x27;s basically the same thing, except that sometimes the easiest to learn bit isn&#x27;t practical. Knowledge is usually delivered in abstract chunks, with no relation to something else, and having something you plan to do will relate it and make it easier to learn.')
