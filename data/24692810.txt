It&#x27;s ok for showing 10 nm scale object violence, but I&#x27;ve never seen anything good for 1 nm or 100 nm scale violence.  And for concentration enhancement, I&#x27;ve only ever seen nice slides in research talks.<p>Given how pervasive related misconceptions are, it&#x27;d be interesting to have a page to point to where the best available misconception antigens are slowly accumulated.')
