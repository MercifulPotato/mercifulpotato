It caused issues with the multiplayer parts of the game.<p>We were forced to disable support for Proton a few months ago. We posted a bug in the Proton GitHub repo and got a great response from the Devs. The issue was resolved in the very next patch and we were able to enable Proton support again.<p>Other than that issue our players very rarely come to us with Proton specific issues.')
