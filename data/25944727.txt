It&#x27;s only good if you stay where you rent, but if you move, it&#x27;s market rent. You can&#x27;t adequately control market rent because there are so so many variable on what market rent is for every individual unit, location, type, etc. I&#x27;m all for the eliminating zoning restrictions though.')
