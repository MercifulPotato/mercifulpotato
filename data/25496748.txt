Okay.. really stretching here..<p>Lets say decoherence is no longer an issue. You&#x27;ve got your qbits suspended in some sort of fancy diamond lattice, and for some reason you really want your scheduler and all your hardware IO to be running via quantum algorithms. So you&#x27;ve got your fusion core crystal loaded into your compute crystal, and you really just want to eliminate any need for silicon at all.<p>So now we&#x27;re talking about a self contained smart-diamond, probabally embedded into a human forehead. It pretty much sits around doing its own thing, observing the world around it and computing out all possible fates of everything it sees, and every once in a while your tiny little monkey brain can reach out and ask it dumb questions like &quot;Hey, how much of my life savings should I dump into some random new cryptocurrency??&quot; and it will be obliged to look into it momentarily and respond accordingly.')
