But if you think this complexity away (to make it comparable to e.g. javascript), here are some reasons:<p>1) Better type-inference. In Java this has improved but is still much more clunky and boilerplatey. Good type-inference is important to not annoy the user.<p>2) Traits &#x2F; type-classes. They enable a way of programming that comes much closer to duck-typing and avoid wrapping your objects in wrapper-classes to support interfaces like you are forced to do it in Java.<p>3) Better and less noisy error handling (looking at you Java, Go, C++ and most other languages)')
