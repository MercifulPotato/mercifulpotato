It&#x27;s super easy to find or create a forum for a topic. You don&#x27;t need to create a new account, and you can view threads from across your interests in a single view if you want.<p>On the other side, Reddit has many issues:<p>- Tree-style comments are not the best format for every type of discussion.<p>- Upvoting encourages content that gets votes: groupthink opinions, short funny quips, generic memes, etc. These can bury deeper discussion or dissenting views.<p>- Reddit as a whole has its own culture. If you don&#x27;t like Reddit&#x27;s culture, it&#x27;s unavoidable.<p>- The visual focus of Reddit&#x27;s recent redesign means that many hobby subreddits turn into posts showing off gear instead of discussion.<p>- Aggressive moderation on some subs makes it hard to post. Posts might be deleted for arbitrary reasons. Sometimes questions are sent to a generic &#x27;Ask a Question&#x27; thread, which isn&#x27;t great for finding questions later via search.<p>- Your post history is public across the site, which carries privacy risks.')
