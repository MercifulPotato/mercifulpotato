So far, (1) and (2) contradict each other&#x27;s goals.<p>Nobody has come up with a technology solution that satisfies both goals.  Yes, Fossil has has discussions built into the repo, but fossil is <i>not</i> a Schelling Point.  Yes, one can run Gitlab on a self-hosted Raspberry Pi from a home internet connection but that&#x27;s also <i>not a stable Schelling Point</i> because ISP like Comcast can shut that IP down for DMCA violation.[1]  And SMTP mailing lists also ultimately depend on a server that holds the discussion archive and a <i>well-known</i> address for new users to send a &quot;add my email&quot; request.  Thus, the <i>existence of a well-known</i> server becomes a <i>specific target</i> for RIAA&#x2F;DMCA takedown.<p>As for other &quot;uncensorable&quot; technology ideas such as IPFS, Freenet, blockchain, etc.  I haven&#x27;t seen any proof-of-concept from other projects that demonstrates similar easy-to-use collaboration of Github.  Remember, it&#x27;s not about the raw git repo... it&#x27;s about the Focal Point for the <i>collaboration workflow</i>.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Focal_point_(game_theory)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Focal_point_(game_theory)</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xfinity.com&#x2F;support&#x2F;articles&#x2F;comcast-dmca-compliance-policy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xfinity.com&#x2F;support&#x2F;articles&#x2F;comcast-dmca-compli...</a>')
