This caused some bugs but made other task a lot simpler. For example editing a file that existed in the Windows file system with a Windows application and then actually processing it with a linux binary worked really well most of the time.<p>With WSL2 you are expected to only interact with files in the linux filesystem with linux. I&#x27;m sure this made a bunch of easier for the dev team but it kinda ruins WSL for me.<p>I still haven&#x27;t figured out how to call a binary that exist in the linux vm from Windows or how to interact with the windows network from linux.')
