But the Wikipedia article has the following statement:<p>&quot;There are 11 pseudouridines in the Escherichia coli rRNA, 30 in yeast cytoplasmic rRNA and a single modification in mitochondrial 21S rRNA and about 100 pseudouridines in human rRNA indicating that the extent of pseudouridylation increases with the complexity of an organism.&quot;<p>So at first it shows, that Pseudouridine is not something completely new in nature. It exist for a long time already.\nAnd it seems a higher amount signals to the immune system, that this RNA is more human like and not coming from a virus. Since this mechanism seems to be established in nature I think one can assume it is safe. If it wouldn&#x27;t be safe, viruses would probably already exist, which would make use of this &quot;backdoor&quot;.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pseudouridine" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pseudouridine</a>')
