I used to occasionally climb w&#x2F; a guy in his 70&#x27;s.  I&#x27;m 56 now and hope I can climb for another 20 years.  The big problem is lack of access.  With the pandemic gyms are closed.  The few climbing spots around here are hours away.  I don&#x27;t have the space now, but the house I&#x27;m designing now will have space for a climbing wall or Kilter board.')
