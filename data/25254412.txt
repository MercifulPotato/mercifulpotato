They had to do some sort of &quot;backdoor deal&quot; with a McD&#x27;s employee, to get a bag of &quot;pre-fried&quot; chips, which they then examined, to find that they arrive at the franchise, &quot;pre-cooked,&quot; to a certain extent. It read like a Sherlock Holmes mystery.<p>Their fries, these days, are a shadow of the greasy pleasure sticks of olden days.<p>Same with their Apple pies. Anyone remember their originals, that were basically balls of fusion fire, cooked in lard, and came with a defibrillator?')
