It was also a few years before Visual Studio Code was a serious thing.  So I used &quot;programmer&#x27;s editors&quot; -- those cute things like Notepad++ which had syntax highlighting and on some days autocomplete but no real code understanding.  There was no middleware, no dependency-injection, and things like the database instance were globals.  More or less, the things you needed to know were in a single file or could be inferred from a common-libraries file.<p>My second job, they splashed the cash for full-scale professional IDEs, and they couldn&#x27;t get enough abstraction.  I suspect the conveninence of &quot;oh, the tools will let us control-click our way to that class buried on the opposite side of the filesystem&quot; made it feasible.<p>I wonder if there&#x27;s some sort of &quot;defeatured&quot; mode for IDEs which could remind people of the cognitive cost of these choices.')
