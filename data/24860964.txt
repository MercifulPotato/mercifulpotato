This allows for sharing of some code on GPU and CPU.  This isn&#x27;t uncommon in the game industry, for example header files that compile in both C++ and HLSL in order to share struct definitions for CPU code and GPU code, and CPU math libraries that use HLSL types and semantics.<p>Rust is different enough from GLSL and HLSL (most game engines use HLSL as &quot;native&quot; and cross compile to GLSL, MSL or use header defines to build PSSL) that introducing a new shading language compatible with Rust is probably worth the effort for them.')
