If a request or process comes in, and it hits 10 services to fulfill.  The entry service will be open for the entirety of the request, while billing a full 128MB even while waiting for other services and regardless of how much memory is actually used.  This is also true of every nested service, which multiplies the required resources.  Through the chain there will often only be one active lambda on the request though many are billing.<p>A monolithic design will only use the actual resources dedicated towards serving the request.  To put it another way, you change your memory and compute granularity from per-container scope to per-request scope.  The finer or microized your services the higher minimums you have on serving a request.  In my experience with such implementations this ratio is somewhere in the range of 2x-10x.')
