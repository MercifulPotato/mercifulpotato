It&#x27;s good to have things informed by lots of deals as opposed to speculation.<p>In my experience the conversation eventually has to be about the product you&#x27;re selling at the moment - preferred shares in a private company. It may be that for the founders you work with, your role is to sell the actual financial product.<p>&quot;This is how your preferred shares will increase the fund&#x27;s IRR and fit with the investment themes and click for LPs&quot; is really all people who actually write checks need to hear.<p>To some extent the preponderance of rich fools is the ultimate refutation of the very idea of a deck. You&#x27;re really selling a high-risk, high-reward opportunity via a financial instrument your buyer will repeat-buy, and you should focus on communicating these fungible aspects of what you do instead of what makes you special.')
