The staple experience all through my youth was of having to doodle with the dry pen for a few seconds before it begins to emit ink properly (my language even has a word for this act). Spare pens or cartridges were a must, in case the first one just gives up.<p>Then I discovered oil-based Pilot pens: those can lay around unused for months or years and then will write as soon as I need that. So after moving out, I bought a couple dozens of them and sprinkled them around the apartment and in my backpack. Never even knew if anyone else makes pens with oil-based ink.<p>I <i>did</i>, however, encounter one of such pens leaking. But one in about fifteen years seems pretty good.')
