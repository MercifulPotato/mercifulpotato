If it really works as well as it looks in that demo then they nailed it. I&#x27;m both envious and inspired. I&#x27;ll be surprised if YC does not fund them<p>&gt; I saw your short demo at BarCamp and I must say Dropbox looks great! Are you planning on having a Linux port as well, or is too early to talk about that? Also, as another SFP applicant I have to tell you that I really hope you get the funding - you deserve it.<p>&gt; You know, your app is something that I&#x27;ve been wishing someone would make for some time now. Congrats!<p>&gt; Cool stuff indeed. I would give 5 stars for such an useful application.<p>&gt; It looks great man. I know you&#x27;ll be accepted. The writing is on the wall. Posting your video here just seals the deal, and puts yourself out there. I didn&#x27;t apply to YC, but if I did, I&#x27;d be putting my stuff up here as well. I&#x27;m surprized nobody else has posted like you did. That takes some balls and self-belief.<p>&gt; Kudos from myself as well. In fact, just today I was having problems with ftp and samba, and was wishing for a more graphical rsync. Perhaps it is true that a good way to do a web app is to implement a unix command. :) Good job. can&#x27;t wait until it&#x27;s out for the rest of us.<p>&gt; Looks wonderful. You might want to check on the trademark &#x27;dropbox&#x27;. I know dropsend used to be called dropbox but had to change due to trademark difficulties. Otherwise excellent work.<p>&gt; Nice job! I was thinking something like this for a while and wonder why no one did it. It looks like dropbox just scratches the right itches for me.<p>&gt; Great job guys, hope to see you get picked up in the next session. Keep me posted for the mac version.<p>&gt; This definitely qualifies as Something People Want, and it looks nicely executed. Very cool!<p>&gt; Great demo, great product, great business, well done.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s hot!<p>&gt; I&#x27;m impressed.<p>&gt; brilliant!')
