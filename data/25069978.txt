Item(by='magnostherobot', descendants=None, kids=[25070025], score=None, time=1605190194, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25069839, text='There&#x27;s a short sci-fi story (whose name escapes me, but is mentioned in Cory Doctorow&#x27;s Information Doesn&#x27;t Want to be Free) in which the human race is given matter duplicators that can perfectly copy an item, including the duplicators themselves. It&#x27;s basically a more fully-explored version of the &quot;what if I can copy a car&quot; thought, in which I think the conclusion is that creativity would flourish because less effort is put into making many of the same item. It&#x27;s quite a far-reaching hypothetical, but it has strong parallels with digital rights issues.')
