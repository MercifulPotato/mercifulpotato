Item(by='vincentmarle', descendants=None, kids=[24976515], score=None, time=1604378502, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24976277, text='&gt; I honestly don&#x27;t even get what Taleb is truly arguing here. He is using a lot of statistical arguments but ultimately Silver is making a model to predict an outcome. It is like a weather forecast.<p>&quot;Making models to predict&quot; is precisely the fluff that Taleb is against. There is no &quot;if elections were held today&quot;, there are no do-overs, there is only one election. And you either win or lose (binary price [1]). So any prediction that doesn&#x27;t incorporate the events between making the prediction until the election actually occurs, is worthless, or to be more precise: 50&#x2F;50 (arbitrage free). The probability only goes up when you start counting the actual votes on Election Day.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1703.06351.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1703.06351.pdf</a>')
