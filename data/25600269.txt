The Juno chorus in particular is&#x2F;was notoriously noisy. Add to that some crappy audio cables to get the sound out of the machine and into your recording device, ground loop hum, nearby AM radio... No software emulation is going to include all that &quot;unwanted&quot; sound unless it&#x27;s deliberating modeling it as well.<p>Personally I&#x27;m from the camp that likes super-clean audio, so I was overjoyed when software synths fixed all the problems that we used to have with hardware, but there&#x27;s definitely a camp that really likes the &quot;warmth&quot; or unpredictability of the original machine&#x27;s output. Sometimes I think people spend more time adding plugins to dirty up their sound than they did making the original patch in the first place.')
