Not going to associate my ID with either of the Two you selected.<p>For the first 50 books, I&#x27;d read 38, wanted to read about 9 and couldn&#x27;t care less about 3. (William Faulkner and Thomas Mann. Probably, they are the ones I should read first!)<p>Of the top 10 it was 9:1 read:want. I think I found the result pleasing but also surprising. I expected far more to be unread and unwanted overall. Most of them I&#x27;d read before leaving Universty.<p>I got tired of clicking through your social capture. I&#x27;d have done more than 50 if you got rid of this burden.<p>So: what&#x27;s being harvested here? Explain to me how this affects SEO, or income, or anything specific. What was I doing in either clicking, or ignoring the social login?<p>edit: hmm. -2. is this bad karma because I sound boastful? I&#x27;m a 59yo, if you live long enough, you will read books on the classical canon of books to be read. Is it bad karma because I think Thomas Mann is boring? (I loved watching death in venice, but magic mountain was interminably, prosaically dull dull dull and I couldn&#x27;t finish it) or because I dislike William Faulkner?<p>Or maybe because I asked what the login focus on FB and Apple was, and if this is (organ) harvesting?')
