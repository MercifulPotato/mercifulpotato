It&#x27;s well-studied that abusive, grandiose people are people with intense anxiety that are very difficult to heal because of their grandiosity (see narcissists)<p>There are so many studies on this topic all trying to find the right words hoping to finally convince us: anxious&#x2F;grandiose people will never change inside (without years-long therapy), they will only change their tactics once they&#x27;ve been found out.  So if this happens in a work environment fire them immediately once discovered, or leave your company if you can&#x27;t fire them - you will <i>not</i> find a way to fix these people or learn how to cope with them yourself <i>just do it</i>.<p>Rewrote the first paragraph since it sucked.')
