Having myself no supervisor from the field, it was still possible to publish my ideas (ISWC, WWW etc), but it was impossible to connect to the people and be taken seriously.<p>I moved on from that field now, and I don&#x27;t expect to come in touch with any Semantic Web stuff in a open-world context any time soon.<p>I couldn&#x27;t agree more with you that the strong ideology that drives this community is one of the main reason that these technologies are not widely adopted. This, and the failure to convince people outside academia that solving the problems it tries to solve is necessary in the first place.<p>Good luck with TerminusDB, I think I listened to you at KGC.')
