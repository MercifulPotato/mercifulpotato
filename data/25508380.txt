There&#x27;s a big challenge with homeless autonomy and the impact on the community, people who turn away from shelters because of the restrictions and limitations of shelters, but then end up in almost lawless situations which lead to further trauma and don&#x27;t support recovery.<p>In the warehouse model (if it works!) people still have their own autonomous structures, locked doors, the ability to be somewhat secure. If they want to do drugs in there, then OK, we know deprivation doesn&#x27;t lead people away from drugs. In the larger area (the enclosing warehouse) there&#x27;s community expectations, infrastructure, support, and some degree of enforcement.<p>Fairly different of course, but also an attempt to balance autonomy with infrastructure.')
