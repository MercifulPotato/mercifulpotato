Nobody knows the real number and efforts to estimate it vary wildly in their outcomes.<p>Please read my comment again, what you quoted and also what I didn&#x27;t say. I am not asserting that confirmed == actual. Of course that would be silly to believe that. I am explicitly cautioning others from just fudging out numbers and then reasoning based on speculative numbers. I am not substituting a different number or different reasoning. I only quoted actual facts, and I am explicitly encouraging us all to stick closer to actual data, because we just wander into bad conclusions otherwise.')
