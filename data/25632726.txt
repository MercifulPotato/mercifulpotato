Item(by='saxonww', descendants=None, kids=[25633215], score=None, time=1609774922, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25632506, text='I have less of an excuse not to be more personally productive, but I can&#x27;t help anyone else (easily) if my primary method of communication is down. Not only because it&#x27;s harder to contact you, but also because it&#x27;s impossible for you to just ask in a channel and have me notice you.<p>There&#x27;s also this perverse incentive to Slack all the things. Lots of CI notifications are sent through it. Some org processes are implemented as workflows. There&#x27;s been talk of how wonderful it would be to hook up tasking and work tracking to slash commands. I and others often use Slack instead of the &#x27;official&#x27; tool to video call each other.<p>An outage like this is still really disruptive. It&#x27;s not like everyone realizes what&#x27;s going on immediately or at the same time; we have backup tools, but our turn radius is pretty wide. Some of us can&#x27;t even communicate effectively without memes, too, and backup tools don&#x27;t have a giphy integration.<p>EDIT: Do your CI integrations fail if Slack can&#x27;t be contacted? Do those failures fail your pipeline? Whoops!')
