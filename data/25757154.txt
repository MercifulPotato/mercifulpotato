It&#x27;s just to satisfy people&#x27;s curiosity. HN readers like looking at past threads.<p>HN allows reposts after a year or so, or if a story hasn&#x27;t had much attention yet. In cases where it <i>has</i> had significant attention in the last year (or so), we mark the repost [dupe] and downweight it. That&#x27;s not the case here (though I&#x27;m sort of playing the &quot;or so&quot; card with respect to May 2020).')
