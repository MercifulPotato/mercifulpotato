I finally got it at some point. It is a way of generating code on the fly. After I understood under what circumstances macros can abbreviate code, every other language will look unnecessarily verbose.<p>This is enabled by the fact that code in Lisp is also written in the form of lists. Code is data, data becomes code if you write a macro to process the data.<p>For example, is the following data or code?<p>(book\n (author &quot;Jonathan swift&quot;)\n (title &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot;))<p>It definitely looks like data. But it can be made into code using an appropriate macro.<p>What probably Lisp trails in is type inference and bleeding edge libraries.')
