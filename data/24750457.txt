[0] Even if there were lots of false positives, the recent spike in cases in the UK can&#x27;t be attributed to that because there is no reason the errors would be temporally correlated.<p>The concern over PCR cycle is that you will detect people who are not spreading the disease, but those people had the virus at some point. I&#x27;d like more evidence about this societal DoS - contact tracing doesn&#x27;t take medical resources and unmitigated spread consumes more medical resources, mean discretionary income (in the US at least) is higher than before the pandemic.<p>&gt; Are there any theories on the root cause of specific people being &quot;super spreaders&quot;?<p>Yes, there are quite a few papers on the fact that the large majority of Covid-19 spread is by a very small percentage of the people who are infected, moreso than other diseases.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7457918&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7457918&#x2F;</a>')
