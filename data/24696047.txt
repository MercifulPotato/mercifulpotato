Which meant that if you wanted to support writing to a file instead of a stdout then you had to re-implement print yourself.<p>In practice, I&#x27;ve also found that having print as a function adds functionality because I can do things like:<p><pre><code>    print(*data_values, sep=&quot;\\n&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nwhich is a quick way to print each value in a list on its own line.')
