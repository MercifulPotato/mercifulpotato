A persistent actor represented a sensor: state and history of readings. There was a great feature in Akka Persistence: if an actor went idle for a while - no new sensor data, it would be offloaded from memory to the storage (Cassandra). As soon as the sensor started to send new signals again or the sensor state was queried by a user the actor got loaded back to memory.')
