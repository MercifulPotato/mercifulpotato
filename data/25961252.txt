Item(by='alphabet9000', descendants=None, kids=[25961277], score=None, time=1611948316, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25959646, text='&quot;This post is the third installment of our five-part series on building GitHubâ€™s new homepage&quot;<p>Imagine the ridiculous amount of money that has to have been spent on the spinning globe thing. Enough not to have a random blog post talking about, it but a five-part SERIES!!!<p>The frontpage eats up almost 90% CPU on firefox on my computer[0] and not as much, but still high in chrome. Maybe that has something to do with graphics acceleration, or my computer isn&#x27;t good enough, or some other thing where it&#x27;s my fault.. But it&#x27;s ironic the situation exists for a site with a five-part series describing how &quot;performant&quot; it is.<p>Scrolling down the site loads up 4.5 MB of bandwidth transferred, 6.5 MB resources loaded, and 110 requests. Could be worse, but the fact this almost seems &#x27;normal&#x27; now is a sad state of affairs.<p>As an aside, I understand this is GitHub&#x27;s primary marketing vehicle to really Impress and Wow newcomers to the site -- hoping to blow them away with neon graphics and slick animation. But honestly, is this kind of dribbble.com-esque readymade really impressing anyone these days?! Have years of A&#x2F;B testing determined that a neon space adventure yields the highest level of new user signups??[1]<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;vSFxUO9.gif" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;vSFxUO9.gif</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;5IWdM3e.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;5IWdM3e.png</a>')
