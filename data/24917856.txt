It&#x27;s a terrible language, and that may be it&#x27;s worst flaw, but it&#x27;s still in every EDA tool. It&#x27;s kind of like how C is still around despite its foot shooting ability costing billions every year due to security and bugs due to buffer overflows, etc. If an EDA tool wanted to break the mold and use say python for scripting they would still likely need to offer a tcl option. It&#x27;s very ingrained in industry.<p>As for SV - a lot of your gripes are Verilog issues, and SV has tried to fix some of them. I agree the blocking &#x2F; nonblocking is a mess but most folks just learn the rules to avoid issues, but delta cycles can be a pain. The syntax limitations&#x2F;quirks you point out are intersting, though not enough to say the language is terrible, it&#x27;s extremely powerful with very good composability of types, constrained random is very powerful, the coverage is extensive, assertions again are very powerful. In a way its line a few seperate languages bolted together so sure there is some  duplication, but it works surprisingly well in the whole.')
