Item(by='csomar', descendants=None, kids=[25086852], score=None, time=1605287113, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25083956, text='&gt; Both the left and the right in the US have paramilitaries (antifa, proud boys).<p>They are both irrelevant comparing to the US military. Germany, when Hitler rose to power, had a bad economy and weak military but I think he did give up to the military choices at the end of the day. The US military is a behemoth who could decimate the left and right paramilitaries in a few days, and then go to invade Argentina.<p>Having lived in a region where countries changed regimes from dictatorship to democracy to dictatorship multiple times, it seems that there is one similarity: The military has the final shot; and a weak or no military meant chaos (Libya&#x2F;Yemen&#x2F;Lebanon) since every paramilitary now has a shot at power.<p>It&#x27;ll be much easier to predict the outcome by knowing the US military. Does it support Republican or Democrat values? Does it care for democracy? Is it fed up with current day politics?')
