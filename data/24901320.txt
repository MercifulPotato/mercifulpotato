Having ll the code in a project and dependencies be in one language has some really nice advantages!<p>Of course we do call things like C or Python whenever there’s a good implementation of something we want, and because of that we have some excellent FFI capabilities.<p>But yeah, all that said, I’d use Julia even if it was slow. It’s an amazing, powerful and fun language that has taught me a lot and made me enjoy programming.')
