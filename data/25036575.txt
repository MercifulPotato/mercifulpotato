Most consumer printer brands, though, are designed by computer hardware or consumer electronics companies who don’t know all that much about mechanical engineering. Meanwhile, Brother is a typewriter and sewing machine company—mechanical engineers make up the majority of their engineering competence.<p>So, IMHO, it’s no surprise that Brother gets design elements correct like “efficient use of toner” and “self-cleaning” and “optimizing for low wear on the print head” that other printer manufacturers struggle with.<p>(If anything, you’d fear that Brother’s <i>software</i> [e.g. drivers] would suck even worse than everyone else’s; but somehow, it doesn’t. Then again, hardware-headed companies do seem to treat drivers as literal drivers, while software-headed companies seem to treat them as a fat shim that value-adds and makes noise all the time.)')
