That&#x27;s just sales tax and already is recorded. Annual wealth tax on land&#x2F;property is easy, we already do it it&#x27;s just not done in a progressive manner. Again that&#x27;s already recorded. Annual wealth taxes on things like securities, stocks, bonds, can be accounted easily by any broker and reported. Again this is already recorded and goes to the IRS. So there&#x27;s not really any new privacy concern.')
