Item(by='mindslight', descendants=None, kids=[25380919], score=None, time=1607647191, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25378817, text='This is what you started off saying:<p>&gt; <i>But there are probably thousands of things that cost only peanuts and aren&#x27;t a priority. If you fix them all they add up to not peanuts and then you don&#x27;t have any money left</i><p>I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re just trying to argue a technicality that you didn&#x27;t &quot;suggest&quot; it, and merely condemned it. Or why you&#x27;re moving the goalposts to &quot;reduce their budget&quot;. But either way you&#x27;re not addressing the core of what I actually said. Since it seems to have eluded you, I&#x27;ll restate:<p>1. not spending 0.02% more to finish a job is foolish<p>2. multiplying a tiny percentage by the scale of the whole budget to imply some unreasonable burden is disingenuous<p>3. the real waste occurs at the scale of entire agencies (eg eliminate the DEA and save $2.1 billion <i>and</i> some of our freedom)<p>4. arguing about such deep cuts ends up inherently partisan.')
