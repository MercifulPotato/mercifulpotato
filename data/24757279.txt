It&#x27;s an appeal to emotion as well as an implication of stupidity on your opponent.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed this behavior among a wide range of mainstream scientists and public health leaders too- literally mocking people who disagree with their policies.  This will hurt the credibility of these scientists, especially if, in retrospect (when we have the time and luxury to study the public health response to COVID in detail), we find out that decisions led to suboptimal outcomes.<p>It&#x27;s far better to project humility, stand by your decision, but be willing to admit when you&#x27;re wrong, and adapt.')
