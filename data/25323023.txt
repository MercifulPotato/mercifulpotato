Can&#x27;t share the exemple but let&#x27;s say asn.1 helped generate saner code than the handrolled one AND allowed other languages to decode...<p>I understand what you&#x27;re saying though. Memories of using this were... unpleasant. I think the &#x27;best&#x27; alternative for me would be RecordFlux. Ada-like syntax, generation of AoRTE-provable SPARK code, and recently the expressivity of the tool has increased. And the whole thing is in python, easily extensible to build things from the type description: generators, fuzzers, advanced specific parsers (need only one field and want the control fields&#x27; positions and sizes), wireshark plugins, Postgres extensions...<p>I really like what they&#x27;re doing there. Might be the one of the low-effort (for the user!) lead-bullets for safer software.')
