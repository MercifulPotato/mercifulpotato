When I looked at RISC-V I was hoping I would be able to get something similar to ARM SoCs but without the large number of peripherals I don&#x27;t care about, like video decoders, jpeg decoders and what not. All I wanted was just a lot of ARM cores in an SoC, and if possible multiple I2S ports or at least a bus I can attach an FPGA to which can handle multiple I2S ports for me. Or perhaps an ARM SoC with onboard FPGA. That already exists but again too many useless peripherals and not enough CPU cores.')
