From the linked article:<p>&gt; TSD: What do you predict to happen in the coming months regarding COVID-19 in the U.S.?<p>&gt; ML: I think it’s going to end up with less deaths than what I thought. In March, I thought there would be a total of 220,000, but there will be less than that. Right now it is around 155,000 in the U.S., and I am expecting it to end up under 170,000 or maybe 175,000.<p>---<p>The article is dated August 2, and so these confident predictions are not looking too good at all.  I&#x27;m not cherry-picking, there&#x27;s a lot more in the article, like:<p>&gt; I think that when we come to look back, we’re going to say that wasn’t such a terrible disease.<p>This just doesn&#x27;t seem to be a person who has a good perspective on public health or public policy.<p>---<p>And finally, ML&#x27;s remarks about the Swedish death rate are not correct, as pointed out editorially in the article.')
