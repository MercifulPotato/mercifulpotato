Item(by='indigochill', descendants=None, kids=[25430934], score=None, time=1608043525, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25428767, text='I studied &quot;strategic communication&quot; in college (a mix of PR, advertising, marketing, whatever) and I distinctly remember a mentor saying, &quot;When you&#x27;re selling a drill, you&#x27;re not selling a drill. You&#x27;re selling the hole.&quot;<p>The point is, people don&#x27;t buy things for their own sake. They buy them for what they think the thing can do for them. Any car will get you to point B, but some people will go for a cheap, utilitarian car because they want to save money (or maybe the utilitarian aesthetic is their thing), while others will go for the flashy car for that feeling of sex appeal (even if women don&#x27;t suddenly fall all over a new car owner, the feeling of confidence is a social benefit to the buyer, even if that&#x27;s not worth the asking price).<p>More generally, though, all communication has this sort of color to it. We see anti-privacy legislation being touted as protecting children and fighting crime. Small talk is not really about sports. So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s realistic to legislate persuasion. I would probably be behind making formal logic a part of public school curriculum, though, so people are better equipped to discern for themselves when persuasion they&#x27;re exposed to is nonsense (among other benefits).')
