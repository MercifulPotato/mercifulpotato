The problem is that this virus is very contagious, so while your age group may be fine, it&#x27;s easy for you to pass it onto to someone who will not be fine.<p>I&#x27;m also so tired of this fake dichotomy of either live your life like there is no pandemic or hide inside. There is a huge gradient between the two with varying levels of risk.<p>&gt; Iâ€™m definitely not letting the government tell me whether I can have a family party or not.<p>It&#x27;s sad that so many people have forgotten what it means to be a good neighbor or citizen. Instead it&#x27;s all about &#x27;me&#x27;, and screw everyone else.')
