People prefer using `&#x2F;&#x2F; eslint-ignore` and trial-and-error over understanding what the hook actually does. This book aims to fix that, by explaining the hook&#x27;s use in data fetching.<p>By going through the examples, you&#x27;ll learn:<p>- how to use useEffect to fetch data, and avoid pesky race conditions<p>- how to take the guesswork out of using the dependency array<p>- how to prevent infinite re-renders through the use of useCallback and useMemo<p>- all of the above, while also keeping ESLint happy<p>I hope you like it, and feel free to contact me on Twitter if you have any questions.')
