I understand that you are using that latter as a way to establish the benefits of the former, or at least to show an absence of detrimental effect.<p>But can you can identify why you might be reaching for psychoactive substances in the first place?  Did you experience depression, anxiety, or trauma that you have been troubled by and need to blank out?<p>You mentioned &quot;group pressure&quot;, but that on its own doesn&#x27;t seem pervasive enough to warrant a lifestyle.  Do you have any ideas about why you want to consume psychoactive substances chronically?  I&#x27;m not saying you have to have a reason, or that you have to be aware of one, or that you have to share it here.  I&#x27;m just curious for more information as context for your anecdotal narrative.<p>Does anyone else in your family use psychoactive drugs as a lifestyle choice?')
