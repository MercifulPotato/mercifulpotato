Sure, some companies, like Samsung, try to offer some exclusive features. Just avoid them.<p>I have to use an iPhone for work, there are a lot of critical annoyances, like how poorly cursor selection works, and then some apps don&#x27;t support the space bar cursor. Everyday things like changing settings are so much nicer in Android.<p>My 3 year old Pixel 2 has been a fantastic daily handset, absolutely no complaints, before that my Note 2 was also excellent, though I was glad to get away from Samsung&#x27;s attempts at exclusive features (the Pixel is &quot;pure Android&quot;, albeit with some self-contained on-device &quot;AI&quot; features that are actually useful).<p>Although there are a lot of cheap Android devices to choose from that can drag down the brand reputation, I would really push back against the suggestion Androids are exclusively &quot;cheap&quot; in the pejorative sense. Most are Just Fine at least. Apple is generally much more conservative in rolling out features, and offers less configuration options, so I guess it&#x27;s a safer choice, but if Apple weren&#x27;t such a status symbol I think most people would be more than happy with the lower cost (3a, 4a) Pixel line.')
