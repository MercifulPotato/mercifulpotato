It doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;completely unmoderated&quot;<p>Systems such as the phone network are pretty darn unmoderated.  It is mostly unmoderated, even if common carriers are allowed to do a small amount, of highly restricted moderation actions.<p>&gt;  as you appear to believe<p>I have just clarified.  It means that there are very strong regulations, that ban many forms of moderation.<p>&gt;  so why shouldn&#x27;t they be allowed to perform moderation at the application layer?<p>I am saying that I would be fine if they were banned from doing most moderation actions, as is the case for common carriers.<p>And I am saying that I would be OK with them engaging in the very small amount of highly regulated moderation, that common carriers are allowed to do.<p>Common carriers have large restrictions on the amount of moderation that they are allowed to do.  I want those same restrictions to apply to other media platforms.')
