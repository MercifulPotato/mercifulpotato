Item(by='alanbernstein', descendants=None, kids=[24845023], score=None, time=1603256187, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24834596, text='I checked out the demo page, and I like it. I&#x27;ve been trying to do something similar for a while, but instead of a long-term timeline, what I want is a view for a single trip, incorporating geotagged photos (as well as videos and GIFs or motion-jpegs), captions, separately recorded GPS tracks, waypoints, map annotations, and an elevation profile display. I want this primarily for outdoor activities like hiking trips (the only acceptable form of vacation, these days).<p>I recently put together the first presentable prototype for this, a quick hack using lightgallery and leaflet.js, with most of the effort being collating the photos&#x2F;captions&#x2F;etc. Online here: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;alanbernstein.net&#x2F;trips&#x2F;pecos-2020&#x2F;#lg=1&amp;slide=0" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;alanbernstein.net&#x2F;trips&#x2F;pecos-2020&#x2F;#lg=1&amp;slide=0</a><p>Ideally, I would love to combine the features of both of these - an overview world map and long-term timeline, with thumbnails linking to trip-specific albums.<p>I&#x27;ve found that EXIF data is extremely inconsistent, at least as reported by exiftool, among the 5-6 different camera devices represented in my various trip albums. Managing this has been a significant portion of the effort in this project.<p>Your page design feels a bit clunky. Also, it seems you are facing the same UI design problem as me: since it&#x27;s fundamentally a photo album, the photos should fill the page, IMHO. But then that means you&#x27;re stuck with an obscuring inset for the map&#x2F;timeline&#x2F;whatever else. I was planning to add a widget to toggle the display of my map inset element. Perhaps a better solution is to have multiple views, one for full-screen photos (like mine) and one with a smaller photo next to the other elements (like yours), with an easy way to switch between them.<p>Another TODO item for me that you might also like to incorporate: a button on the map to select different layers. Mine needs labels for streets&#x2F;states&#x2F;parks; yours might benefit from a satellite layer.<p>I don&#x27;t really get the name. &quot;-ipedia&quot; is presumably borrowed from &quot;encyclopedia&quot;, so the name &quot;mapipedia&quot; would make sense for an encyclopedia of map entities, like OpenLayers. Your app is a photo album, slide show, time line, personal map viewer, ... none of those are much of an encyclopedia.')
