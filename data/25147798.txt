Maybe it&#x27;s getting worse, but still way ahead of the generic PC vendor quality. I have a 2009 MBP that still sees daily use, and still fulfills a purpose (not it&#x27;s original one). I can&#x27;t say that for any of my regular laptops. Just a simple thing as the touchpad. On my Mac it &quot;just works&quot; as i expect it to, and rarely gets in my way. I&#x27;ve yet to meet a generic PC touchpad that doesn&#x27;t annoy me in 30 seconds or less.<p>As for the software. I can&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s gotten worse. I rarely experience crashes on my Macs, and kernel panics has been maybe 3-4 times in a decade. Most of the time i open up my Macbook, do &quot;stuff&quot;, and close the lid again. It auto installs software updates whenever it&#x27;s charging and not being used, and automatically reboots and resumes whatever windows i had open (minus terminal windows), so from a user perspective i never reboot it.<p>It integrates well with my iPhone, Airpods, iPad, and even Apple TVs. Yes i&#x27;m aware competing technologies exists, and individually they may even perform better, but they don&#x27;t integrate fully with each other. As for Apple, it &quot;just works&quot;.<p>Apple may be a popular target, but they&#x27;re still a lot better than the alternatives, especially if you&#x27;re dug in deep in their eco system.')
