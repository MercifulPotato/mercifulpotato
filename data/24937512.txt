Greenwald didn&#x27;t say that editing in general isn&#x27;t ok. He didn&#x27;t argue that all editorial disputes at all times must be resolved with critical articles alongside controversial ones. He suggested it as a solution here. It&#x27;s not nonsense to suggest it, whether or not the editor accepts it.<p>Maybe they did see it the way you outlined: &quot;<i>garbage story dropped a few days before the election.</i>&quot; He clearly sees it as censorship of an article that needs to be published. This is a resignation, so sure, the dispute was not resolved. Calling it a nonsense argument though, that takes a good squint.')
