I&#x27;ve been following the sport for a little more than 2 decades, I was a kid when Ratzenberger and Senna died (and he was a hero for my dad and for my home country).<p>Watching this live I couldn&#x27;t believe it, I audibly gasped when I saw a fireball in F1 in 2020.<p>More impressive is how the thorough enactment of safety rules really played all out in Romain&#x27;s accident like you mentioned.  It&#x27;s easy to get complacent after a while without major accidents, in most industries, it was really heartwarming seeing how the preparation of years paid off to save a life.')
