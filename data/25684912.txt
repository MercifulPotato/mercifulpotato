At least many users, possibly even most users, would not understand the difference between Apple hosting a social network themselves and Apple promoting a thin client that views decentralized content. If you have an Apple Decentralized Social Networks app, and a parent sees their child viewing objectionable content through that app, a bulk of their ire is going to be directed at Apple; they will likely not even know the name of the entity actually hosting the content.<p>The &quot;we&#x27;re not actually hosting it so we&#x27;re not responsible&quot; argument, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s ever really worked. I don&#x27;t think it would work in this case. See: torrent websites.<p>I think the benefit to Apple also goes down. They give up control, and for what gain?')
