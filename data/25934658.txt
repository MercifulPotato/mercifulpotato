This can cause an effect like we&#x27;re seeing with the US healthcare market but the US does well in a lot of the more transferable industries (like software development) and I&#x27;m not seeing how the factors you&#x27;re highlighting for healthcare wouldn&#x27;t equally apply to all of those transferable jobs.')
