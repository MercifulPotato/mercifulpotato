Household-level driving&#x2F;shopping patterns are incredibly valuable in their own right, but it&#x27;s also easy for a dedicated company to tie your address to the personal identities of the residents (Apple&#x27;s internal customer records, public records, private vendors whose whole business is selling this info), and then it&#x27;s just profit all the way down.<p>Hypothetically, DDG could guard against Apple having useful navigational histories for your home by seeding requests with misinformation -- artificial navigation requests Apple can&#x27;t tell apart from your real requests -- but I&#x27;d be surprised if this hypothetical is actually happening.')
