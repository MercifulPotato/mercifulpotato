These are areas of mathematics that have connections with computer science, although my work in them is often purely mathematical. Over 2017-18 I formalized an approach to topos theory using Joyal&#x27;s Arithmetic Universes (AUs) as a substitute for Grothendieck toposes, potentially implementable on computers, and showed how to use it to obtain constructive, base-free results for toposes. My current work is on developing the techniques of this approach and exploring the extent to which it can capture Grothendieck&#x27;s original applications of topos theory.&quot;<p>&quot;I was a computer programmer for several years. I wrote the ROM and user manuals for two Sinclair computers, the ZX81 and the ZX Spectrum. Then with Richard Altwasser I founded Jupiter Cantab Ltd, which produced the Forth-based Jupiter Ace microcomputer.&quot;')
