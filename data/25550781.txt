For instance if this is an all-ascending paginated query:<p><pre><code>    select ... where row(c1, c2, c3) &gt; row(11, 12, 13) order by c1, c2, c3\n</code></pre>\nThen with c2 descending it would look like this:<p><pre><code>    select ... where row(c1, 12, c3) &gt; row(11, c2, 13) order by c1, c2 desc, c3</code></pre>')
