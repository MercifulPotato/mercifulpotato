The attacker is able to successfully log in to the development tier.<p>&gt; Our dev tier was configured to allow impersonation of all users for testing purposes, and the attacker eventually finds a URL that allows them to elevate their privilege level to that of a Community Manager (CM). This level of access is a superset of the access available to site moderators.<p>EDIT: clarified that the report was held back')
