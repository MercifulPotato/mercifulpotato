The Jade Cabbage was the headline attraction at the time.  The thing that stood out the most to me was a tea cup.  The date was ~1800.  I was impressed by a 215 year old tea cup.  Then I realized the date was 1800 <i>bc</i>.  A 3800 year old <i>cup</i>!<p>I had a similar experience in Japan last year when I learned the same family has ruled for something like 1500 years and trace their history back 2600 years.')
