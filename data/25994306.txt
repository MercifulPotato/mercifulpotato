Inspired by Chinese noodles, it is only about a century old, and it really took off during WW2. A sign of it not being of Japanese tradition is the fact it is most often written in katakana (ラーメン).<p>The fact it is not traditional is actually a strength. While more traditional Japanese food like sushi or tempura is highly codified, Ramen shops are free to do as they please, which result in a great deal of variety. There is no &quot;one true Ramen&quot;.')
