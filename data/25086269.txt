My point is that in many cases people get 15% improvements. Do you consider that a disappointing result? Are you disregarding other people&#x27;s results? or are you disappointed that they don&#x27;t apply in your specific situations? I originally gave you the benefit of the doubt by thinking it was the last of these, and speculated about how your situation differs. Now I don&#x27;t know what you want, except to show off how smart you are vs how poor a reader I am, regardless of accuracy. I&#x27;m not interested. Bye.')
