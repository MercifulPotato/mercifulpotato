Having the html downloaded for the link you&#x27;re about to click, and used by the browser if the user clicks on the link, is by far the most balanced and simple implementation of prefetching. Everything is handled by the http2 push technology. No excessive javascript nonsense, no altering the Dom, and no downloading and prerendering of everything behind a link you might not even click. Absolutely flawless and perfect enhancement to a browsing experience so long as the spec allows for this.')
