Its antecedent was the Licensing of the Press Act[0], which had the explicit purpose of restricting <i>the right to make copies</i> (i.e. to run a printing press) &quot;for preventing the frequent Abuses in printing seditious treasonable and unlicensed Books and Pamphlets and for regulating of Printing and Printing Presses&quot;â€”in a word, censorship.<p>Note that the Wikipedia article for the Statue of Anne says &quot;the first statute to provide for copyright <i>regulated by the government and courts, rather than by private parties</i>&quot; (emphasis added). It was not the first copyright, just the first one where the government handled enforcement directly. Before that enforcement (including, but not limited to, government-mandated censorship) was handled by the printers&#x27; guild, with the government licensing the printers.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Licensing_of_the_Press_Act_1662" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Licensing_of_the_Press_Act_166...</a>')
