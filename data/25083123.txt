Why would that make the chair manufacturer an employee of the retailer?<p>Moreover, how is this not available to the driver? They&#x27;re in the car with the passenger already. The driver and passenger could exchange contact info if they wanted to, how is Uber going to stop them? This doesn&#x27;t happen not because Uber is preventing it but because the passenger is. The next time they need a ride they don&#x27;t want to have to call five drivers to find one who is in the area and available, they want to open the app and have it find one for them.')
