However, I don&#x27;t think it is necessarily a bad thing. The reason we perceive it as bad right now is because it is unequal: you and I do not have access to the systems that make privacy an obsolete concept, and some other people (namely those in positions of power) have the ability to keep themselves out of that system. It seems likely that this will eventually no longer be true and society will adapt to a world where privacy no longer exists for anyone. I would wager that, looking backward, they will probably even wonder what all the fuss was about.')
