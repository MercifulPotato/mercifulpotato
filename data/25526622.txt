A UN-funded organization located on &quot;UN soil&quot;, ideally far away from the biggest powers (but then close enough to Internet nodes) – maybe Geneva, Switzerland ?<p>2.) A decentralized system. Freenet &#x2F; Tor &#x2F; Blockchain aficionados can have their field day.<p>In both these cases, the only thing that the organization could do is to keep just enough friction to keep domain scalpers at bay. No censorship whatsoever allowed, if a country wants to block a domain name, they will have to do it on their side.<p>Yes, this means that there will be pedo &#x2F; nazi &#x2F; terrorist &#x2F; copyright infringement ( &#x2F; &amp;c.) domains, but you can&#x27;t have both your freedom of speech cake and eat the censorship too : this is more important than Facebook comments &#x2F; YouTube videos!<p>(Hmm, I wonder why isis.org redirects (for me?) to species360.org ?)<p>Oh, also maybe this organization could keep a database of worldwide judicial decisions about the blocking of domain names.<p>Also there needs to be enough friction on domain name changes for the judiciary systems to be able to keep up.<p>Oh, and it would also be responsible for verifying that the .ngo&#x2F;.ong domains <i>really</i> belong to non-profit, non-governmental organizations.')
