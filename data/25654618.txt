Whereas other tools tend to just spam static predefined HTTP requests at a server (which is great when that’s all you need), Locust is great at simulating complex user behavior, such as users clicking through different pages of your site, or clients that make common sequences of API requests, perhaps to a variety of servers at different urls.<p>In my case, I was load testing a RESTful DNS management api over http and, as part of the same performance test, simulating DNS traffic to nameservers managed by that API. Locust is horizontally scalable and incredibly flexible since you can write arbitrary Python code to make it do whatever you want.')
