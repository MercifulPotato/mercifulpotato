There is a ton of change between version and very often new plugins don&#x27;t support old versions at all. Would sticking to one, say most progressive implementation (Net 5 at this point) help you feel more confident that the job can be done?<p>Although at this point Net 5 isn&#x27;t going to be documented because it&#x27;s so new, and next year they will release Net 6, which will be the actual long-term support version.... this is how their mess with docs happens in the first place.')
