The people who use what you refer to as &quot;coded language&quot; believe that as laborers, they create wealth which is stolen by those who don&#x27;t labor but instead merely own assets. They believe that wealth and value are created through labor, not by ownership, and therefore labor deserve a larger portion of the wealth than they are getting right now. Therefore it&#x27;s not &quot;redistribution&quot; of wealth at all, as those who currently hold this wealth had no right to it in the first place.')
