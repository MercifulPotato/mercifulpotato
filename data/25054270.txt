I&#x27;ve reread your comment and I don&#x27;t know where the disconnect is.<p>One of the things you commonly see is that men get divorced and don&#x27;t want to pay alimony or child support on the grounds that she isn&#x27;t sleeping with him anymore.<p>So I think for a great many people, there is a strong connection between &quot;he pays the bills and his expectation is sex.&quot; And I think this begins with our dating norms where he typically pays for the date.<p>I think the fact that this is baseline normal for most people is why it is offensive to point it out. People want to think their relationship is a good relationship and not transactional and the evidence seems to be that it&#x27;s much more often transactional than not.')
