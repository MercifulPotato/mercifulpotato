Whenever I try, I tend to trip over its relatively limited implementation of the concept.<p>In a language like F#, on the other hand, generics are the cornerstone of my business domain modeling. They provide a way to map everything out in a way that is much more concise, readable, type-safe, and maintainable than I find to be possible in many other languages.<p>I have yet to kick higher-kinded polymorphism&#x27;s tires in a good context, but I can see where a good implementation of it would move things even further in that direction.')
