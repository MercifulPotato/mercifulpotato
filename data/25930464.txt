I had to furnish my first apartment into livability. A family friend gave me a $300 gift card to IKEA. That gift got me a fully functional one-bedroom apartment that I could never have afforded at the time.<p>Now, as a well-paid adult advanced in my career, I can afford to buy high-quality things. I do this knowing full well that I&#x27;m buying status symbols. I&#x27;m a little skeptical that a highly skilled woodworker&#x27;s output would have been available to 2008 me, or the modern equivalent, but I would <i>love</i> to be wrong.')
