One had liver damage that tooks months to recover from. Another had colitis symptoms and they went away after stopping statins. A third became very weak, to the point of having trouble getting out of bed. He stopped the statins and was back to normal about a week later. All three of these people were extremely skeptical that the statins could be the problem and were astonished at the improvement.<p>It&#x27;s hard to say how mindset affected the symptoms and recovery. They all believed the statins would help them and were also skeptical that stopping them would help.')
