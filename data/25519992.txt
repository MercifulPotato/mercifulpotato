Which data was held back please? I would really like to know? I might have been fooled by the treasure trove of data publicly available.<p>Is it that the atmosphere overall have the same average temperature[0]? Its not held back. Is it that the low troposphere warming is causing the artic circle to break more often? Nah, i still found the raw data too.<p>What was really surprising to me about the climate change denial is that the most well-know of &quot;solar forcing&quot; was debunked by physics college students circa 2004, and that despite that (and the cycle ending a while ago) it is still the argument i found the most often. The better argument, low-troposhpere CO2 concentration have a low effect on radiation, i hav seen exactly twice. Without the corollary, a c02 surplus at the surface level take between 20 and 30 year to reach the hgh troposphere&#x2F;low stratosphere, so every emission right now will have almost no effect until 2040. This data is not held back, and is discussed quite often too.<p>Did i miss something important?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1029&#x2F;2018JD028901" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1029&#x2F;201...</a>')
