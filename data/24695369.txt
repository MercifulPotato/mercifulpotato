That&#x27;s a lie. There&#x27;s no way around it, this is a dishonest statement.<p>I&#x27;m in no kind of mood to explain why that is, for pretty predictable reasons this conversation goes to places I&#x27;m not fond of.<p>But it ain&#x27;t true, and I&#x27;m willing to explain why people might wish it was: 12 generations back, you have <i>absolutely no</i> DNA from some of your ancestors. That&#x27;s how recombination works, the deck is shuffled in a &quot;chunky&quot; way and some of your ancestors get shuffled out.<p>So all those Europeans have no (dig this: <i>zero</i>) genes in common with Sub-Saharan Africans that weren&#x27;t conserved 90,000 years ago either because: they don&#x27;t have an African ancestor (the answer) or because they <i>are descended from all Africans alive in 5000BCE and the genes all got shuffled out because reasons</i>, which is, not the answer.<p>It&#x27;s a nice story and I&#x27;d love to believe it, if it was true, which it isn&#x27;t.')
