There was some project to program an OS with Pascal in Helsinki, possibly the Russian MIR-computer. Anyways I heard a heated discussion where they wanted money for &quot;tens of man-years&quot;. Very annoying, so I wrote Pascal-compiler for 8080 just like that in few months. It was little restricted but quite usable. Then Very Strange Thing happened: the Finnish Army wanted it, maybe because it was not hampered by American Comecon-embargo and better than nothing (or assembler). I was ordered to write a short manual and forget all about it. Not a big deal, it was just a demo, and I was already interested in some other things.')
