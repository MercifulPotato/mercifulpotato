I&#x27;ve often felt tempted to build something like that. I&#x27;m disappointed by how overpriced and terrible commercial thermostats are - try finding one that can actually switch from cool to heat automatically, isn&#x27;t super-cumbersome to set up, and doesn&#x27;t cost several hundred bucks.<p>It&#x27;s also a bit sad how hard it seems to be to get Google Home to be able to control custom gadgets.<p>And combining Python scripts with a Spring Boot webapp - why? Seems like a good application for Flask. Why use 2 languages when 1 can do the job?')
