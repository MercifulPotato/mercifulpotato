BikeBoxAlan have a case you put a bike into and only need to remove the wheels[1].<p>If you&#x27;d discount that because of such minor disassembly you&#x27;d have to discount the minor disassembly of putting a flute or Sax in it&#x27;s box too.<p>As I said though, you don&#x27;t have to treat the bike like that but you could easily if you wanted to.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bikeboxalan.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;triathlon-easyfit&#x2F;?v=79cba1185463" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bikeboxalan.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;triathlon-easyfit&#x2F;?v=79c...</a>')
