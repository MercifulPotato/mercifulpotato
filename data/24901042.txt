If I know it is one of the scenarios you mentioned, or haggling is expected, game on!<p>I am fine with a haggle.  Lots of ways to see value.  Great discussion!<p>In your narrow scenario, I would compute needs plus reasonable wants, then add on compensation for any draconian policy and drop a number.  Hit or miss.

Get a deal, keep life funded and look for better as ones risk and cost profile permits.<p>One qualifier is whether the position has a sales or biz dev component. Deffo haggle.  Expected.
