Item(by='nske', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611075484, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25823546, text='a) I think BBC produces good content, but not good enough to warrant the current cost of a TV license.<p>b) Even if it did, I still would not pay for a license, as a reaction to its overreaching approach, obligatory character and dishonest reasoning. They are claiming that you need a license to watch any type of content made available in public in real time, with Youtube LIVE mentioned explicitly as an example -no particular reason this wouldn&#x27;t include even things like gaming video streams a school kid would share for fun.<p>I don&#x27;t think BBC should profit from the consumption of content it has contributed nothing towards. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s more absurd when that content itself is provided for free by its authors, or when it&#x27;s content you have already paid for.')
