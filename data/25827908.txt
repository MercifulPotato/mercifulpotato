His central point was that all speech (including hate speech) should be free because someone else is going to be deciding what speech shouldn&#x27;t be free, and therefore nobody should get to decide that.<p>This fellow seemed to not realise he was living in a democracy and had been doing so his whole life.<p>He provided some examples to prove his points, and they were all from ages ago. He didn&#x27;t seem to realise that the trouble we&#x27;re going through now is a direct result of allowing hate-filled people to form bubbles within which their hate festered until it boiled over.<p>Without Parler (or any other safe space for these bigots and racists), they benefit from a broader range of views, and that&#x27;s a better thing for society as a whole.<p>Conservatives seem to just not get democracy, and as a result see the Government as something distinct from themselves. In my country, the government is folk I (or my neighbours elected), and they enact policy I (or my neighbours) want. We can just as well change that policy in a few years time if we didn&#x27;t want to. That&#x27;s democracy 101.<p>If you live in a democracy, you don&#x27;t fear your government, and you can trust them to regulate speech, because they&#x27;ll do what you (or the majority of your peers) want... if not immediately, then in four years time at most.')
