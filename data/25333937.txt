They need to be unique. You could provide a function as well that returns the correct css for any given captured units in the class name so eg. &quot;mb-4em&quot; you have template &quot;mb-(\\\\d+)em&quot; declared. The tool recognizes it and either just puts the number there, uses a mapping (4 becomes 16), or calls a function to return the resulting css properties.<p>What I like about it is you could just as well create more advanced utilities and the parser never generates any classes in advance. It would need some kind of watcher though to detect any new class aded to templates that match the definition file.<p>Then there would be no need to purge anything. Kind of a vague concept I’ll admit, but for me starting with a figma or sketch where designer typically does <i>not</i> folow a consistent guideline, it means I can just start writing templates and keep declaring utilities as I go because in the real world you bet that happens.')
