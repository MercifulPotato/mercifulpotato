There are (at least) three groups though: for, against, and undecided. This is really a fight about how to convince the undecided, so solutions like &quot;go make your own platform&quot; aren&#x27;t desirable; undecideds aren&#x27;t going to know about the new platform, and won&#x27;t automatically appear en masse on it, so it actually makes reaching them more difficult.')
