For my web applications, requests spend most of their time waiting on the database, and an open transaction is at least as expensive as a thread in an app server for many databases. So I agree that for most applications async isn&#x27;t worth the complexity they introduce. In many implementations they also mess up your stacktraces, which makes debugging production issues harder.')
