If you have a good reason to skip a unit test (e.g. isolated all stateless code, where the remaining code is almost trivially correct but hard to test) then that&#x27;s fine (if it&#x27;s noted as such), but otherwise I&#x27;ll call it out.<p>It&#x27;s just that skipping unit tests without good reason is far more likely to &quot;destroy the codebase&quot; (or at least to cause more work down the road than it saves now, without there being a good reason to skip that work now) than not adhering to some style guide will, IME.')
