The fact that modern smartphones and notebooks don&#x27;t make changing them a trivial operation is condemnable.<p>At least you can install new batteries with different form factors now. Technically it would be trivial to just have a lid to install new ones.<p>Profit orientation is worse than customer orientation. It is also an ecological problem.
