Perhaps, on a philosophical level, they are. On a practical level, however, the death of an 85-year-old person from a preventable cause has cost them a few years at the end of life, while a 25-year-old has, on the same calculation, lost over 60 years of life, including their most active and event-filled years.<p>Every time I think about the USA, I get a strong feeling that the current structure of systems are designed for the old to flourish and at a heavy cost of the young. I would be surprised if my feeling is actually wrong and everything isn&#x27;t actually designed for the older population to continue flourishing the longest at the cost of the young. I&#x27;m curious what HN thinks. I personally think the value of the young should be set higher to flourish than the old and the systems of society should be designed that way.')
