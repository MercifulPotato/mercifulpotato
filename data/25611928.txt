I&#x27;m only focusing on one specific argument, though.  I am not ignoring what you are presenting but challenging an invalid claim on profit extraction.<p>A courier service is extracting profits no more than a waiter or waitress is.  Whether it&#x27;s staff (waiter) or contractor (courier), both are providing &quot;delivery&quot; services in exchange for fees.  A waiter offers internal delivery within the restaurant.  A courier offers external delivery to the home.  Counting the courier&#x27;s myriad cuts and how it monetizes its services isn&#x27;t revealing profit extraction.  You&#x27;re revealing how couriers are paid for their services (10% of the bill + market premium).')
