Being able to safely &quot;undo&quot; something as major as an employment change is a huge stress-reliever and I think more people should consider doing it.<p>Granted, this isn&#x27;t the same thing as actively working for both companies. However it&#x27;s possible the subject of the tweet was someone who was a vendor&#x2F;contractor at FB or GOOG - or vice-versa - which has certain appearances.')
