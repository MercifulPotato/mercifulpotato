Having only semi-recently seen an internal architecture diagram, I was indeed pleased to see that it&#x27;s <i>internally</i> a composition of parts that do one thing well, but that&#x27;s not really user-visible.<p>Interesting; it&#x27;d been claimed to me before that ZFS had its own NFS server (or I guess the OpenSolaris NFS server) included but that nobody used it because it was old&#x2F;buggy. A quick glance at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;openzfs&#x2F;openzfs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;openzfs&#x2F;openzfs&#x2F;</a> (the old archived version based on illumos, if I read correctly) implies that this <i>might</i> have been true at one point, but indeed <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;openzfs&#x2F;zfs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;openzfs&#x2F;zfs</a> doesn&#x27;t seem to do its own NFS so it&#x27;s not true now if it ever was. Thanks for correcting my understanding.')
