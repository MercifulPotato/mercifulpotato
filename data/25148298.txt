In capitalism theory, the basic idea behind the growth of capitalism is defined as &quot;land grab&quot;, i.e. the system ingests what is foreign and makes it its own. So land in that sense can mean anything that binds people to you. Nowadays this means money in order to pay rent, food, bills etc.<p>&gt; We&#x27;re seeing the teaming up of governments and giant corporations to control the narrative and tell people what&#x27;s true and what isn&#x27;t.<p>Now why do I call this feudalism? To be honest I could call it various other things, the most &quot;getting to the root&quot; would be &quot;class warfare&quot;. I chose to call it feudalism in this case, because feudalism was basically the last period&#x2F;time we chose to call it honestly what it is: Getting ruled from above. They want to implement censorship, because even though we always say &quot;one day it might work against you&quot;, but for them it does not. Ever.<p>So when we introduced parliaments we split law-making power from nobility to politicians, elected by the people. But if you are an &quot;accumulator of wealth&quot;, you can basically act as a modern fief. Especially if you work together with politicians.')
