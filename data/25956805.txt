I&#x27;m sharing it;  I still own the copyright.<p>The monk handing over the book in the park has done no work on the park, they are a user NOT a contributor.  In fact, probably a bunch of the trash I&#x27;m picking up are those pamphlets. I&#x27;m an atheist so the pamphlet is equivalent, at best, to a spam pull request.<p>&gt; The request for a donation is the cultural expectation of reciprocity.<p>This is a completely different expectation that the open source expectation.  I, personally, feel no guilt at all for telling people proselytizing to go away as I&#x27;ve done nothing to give them the expectation that their proselytizing would be welcome and most people proselytizing expect to be rejected constantly.  Contributing back to open source is expected and usually desirable so the expectation that the contribution will be accepted.<p>Also, the monk is ASKING FOR A CONTRIBUTION not giving one.')
