I hope it&#x27;ll help give my wife some time to herself and with our toddler. And it&#x27;ll be nice to cuddle an infant while writing code.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what kind of baby carrier to use, but will give cloth a try at first. I also like carrying my son on my shoulders but given how big he&#x27;s getting I&#x27;m starting to worry about what that fall would be like if something were to happen...')
