Organizations would use it to create _internal_ messaging systems, for employees&#x2F;members only.\nAt that stage it does not replace e-mail, and both systems are used alongside it.\nIf it is mandated to be used for internal communication, \nthis solves the problem of getting &quot;Open this immediately!!!&quot; e-mail claiming to come from your boss, but being in fact from scammers.\nIt also solves the problem of e-mail from your colleagues getting into spam folder.<p>Stage 2. If your clients, suppliers, etc. start to use mnm, you  can add them to your mnm network, and stop using e-mail in communication with them. When you reach this stage, you can severely reduce using of e-mail for your organization, at this point perhaps the only people who need e-mail are marketing, support, and perhaps developers (but the latter only for maillists).<p>3. mnm gets a critical mass, where it makes sense for organizations and projects start to offer mnm as an option to contact them, and later to require them. At this point &quot;general public&quot; starts to use mnm.<p>4. When it reaches critical mass among general population, e-mail can start to be phases out.<p>Don&#x27;t know how realistic is this, and some design decisions of the mnm team seem counter-productive, but to me it does not sound completely crazy.')
