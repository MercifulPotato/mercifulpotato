Quite the opposite: I bent over backwards to redundantly state it over and over again. More than I should have, and now I&#x27;m beginning to wonder why I bothered if it didn&#x27;t prevent me from being ignored.<p>The &quot;you can&#x27;t prove it&quot; objection must be checked at the door for the sake of keeping the speculation interesting. Nobody is arguing that you should walk through the door. It&#x27;s probably more respectable to refuse, on the whole. Once you walk through the door, though, complaining about proof is a bit silly, like walking into a speakeasy, ordering a drink, and complaining that they have served you illegal alcohol. It&#x27;s not wrong, but it&#x27;s also not helpful.')
