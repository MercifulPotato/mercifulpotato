So&#x27;s the world, and for many of the same reasons. Look at the average town ... yours, for example. Where -wouldn&#x27;t- you take visitors?<p>What matters to Wikipedia visitors is content quality (and managed depth) and reliability. All the rest is froth. Layout? Are you kidding?<p>Could it be better? Hell yes. It&#x27;d be great to see many articles, written by committee, visited by a professional editor with years of proven experience -in that category-. The Foundation&#x27;s got the money to pay one per category. Each has to visit 5 articles per day. Each they finish is locked and marke &#x27;pro-edited in (the year)&#x27;. Make that fact a search filter. (&#x27;Administrators&#x27; choosing? Brrrr.)<p>Then there&#x27;s Wikibestia.org. Every year, copy a limit of 1 million articles there. Chosen how? Poll the visitors, it&#x27;s  theirs! &#x27;Wikibestia ... the people&#x27;s choice!&#x27; 50 net downvotes? Guillotine! Big contest, media advertising, whatever.<p>Articles that can only be read by subject-matter experts completely miss the point. They&#x27;re just there for vanity or whatever. Flag them, give them one year to move to Wikiexpertia, while versions for non-experts are prepared (or not), then delete.')
