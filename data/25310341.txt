Secondly, the deal as I understand it is very similar to one proposed by Johan de Nysschen a few years back just to cull the dealership network and make it more exclusive. (that at the time IIRC most dealerships roundly rejected)<p>I didnt get past the paywall so maybe it explains better, but I believe the current deal will cost the existing dealers a lot of money to convert over to the new electric format which wont be worth it to smaller dealers or dealers that sell a mix of brands(also usually smaller dealers).<p>Honestly, it seems like GM is again mishandling its flagship brand and reacting to market conditions instead of trying to steer the market or push technology. They have been doing this for at least 3 decades now, and I dont understand why. Cadillac shouldnt be a volume brand, and they also shouldnt push for profit over everything else. Cadillac should be the GM Halo, with the most R&amp;D and engineering resources creating the tech and engineering that filters down to the volume brands.<p>Instead they tried to be more BMW and Mercedes Benz than BMW and MB was. They of course failed miserably at that. Some good cars were produced, but they ended up compromised in some way that would make purchasing that over a German competitor pointless. Usually this was in the interior quality which was and remains subpar vs competition.<p>Next they got &#x27;blindsided&#x27; by the switch in consumer preference to SUVs. I dont see how this was ever the case as the Escalade has been their bread and butter since ~2000. From what I understand the CT6 was going to become a RWD platform for a lux SUV(which would have probably been great) but GM got cold feet and instead adopted the C1XX FWD platform which while is serviceable is hardly class leading.<p>They developed a brand new ICE engine called &quot;Blackwing&quot; that was state of the art. They placed it in the CT6 for about a year only to cancel that car and realize the engine doesnt fit any other platform they make. I cant even fathom how much was lost in that deal.<p>Ok now they want to go all in on electric, with the only other electric being the tarted up Chevy called the ELR. I suspect that the result will end up being too expensive to recoup development costs, and if past performance is an indicator it will get canceled right as the bugs are worked out and it becomes viable. This is where Cadillac needs to actually commit to really going all in and get the freaking accountants out of the pipeline. Sure building cars is hard and expensive and risky. Cadillac used to be aspirational and forward thinking until the 60s. I suspect they didnt make a lot of money back then either. Of course maybe Im just an armchair quarterback here but from my perspective they are rudderless.')
