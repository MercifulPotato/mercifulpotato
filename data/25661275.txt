I would imagine that producing billions of consumer devices with these chips has helped give them a lot of experience in shortened time frame.<p>I also wonder if having the hardware and software both worked on in-house is an advantage. I mean, if you&#x27;re developing power management software for a mobile OS, and you&#x27;re using a 3rd-party vendor, then you read the documentation, and work with the vendor if you have questions. If it&#x27;s all internal, you call them, and could make suggestions on future processor design too based on OS usage statistics and metrics.')
