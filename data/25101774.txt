I&#x27;ve got many active filters in place, but in some cases, I&#x27;ve simply muted&#x2F;blocked some of them.<p>Done the same on Facebook, which I use mostly for family communication and posting dad jokes.  But again, as hard as I try to separate work &#x2F; family life, colleagues want to connect and they spew the same tired BS I see elsewhere.<p>So, on FB, I can permanently mute them.
