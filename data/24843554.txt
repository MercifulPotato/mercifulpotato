Artificial supply restriction leads to prices going up in desirable areas. Of course there is going to be a breaking point at which the area is no longer desirable, but I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re anywhere near that in SF despite what they doomsayers like to claim in 2020.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t you vote the same way if you could make one of your biggest assets beat the market consistently every year?<p>It&#x27;s the usual tragedy of the commons.')
