But is this enough to infect someone?<p>The answer is, AFAICS, &quot;unknown&quot;. I&#x27;m surprised a lot of studies of &quot;virus persistence on surface X&quot; don&#x27;t (yet) do animal experiments to confirm there&#x27;s enough to infect something else than cells growing in a monolayer (which don&#x27;t have physical barriers or other aspecific defense mechanisms).<p>OTOH, current (scarce) evidence still points at fomite transmission to be not very prevalent at the very least.')
