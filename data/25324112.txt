Prime was a very innovative company too.  But like DEC, they had built their business selling largeish minicomputer systems to largeish customers.  Prime tried to make a small Unix tower system, a PC, port their OS to Intel CPUs, etc., but they had to continue supporting their current proprietary customer base at the same time.  And when making new products like a Prime PC, it had to interface well with the proprietary systems or existing customers wouldn&#x27;t be interested.  That means more engineering work and a higher price tag.  Existing customers wouldn&#x27;t be interested because of the higher price.<p>It&#x27;s tough to build a huge business, continue to support that, and at the same time start a completely new business.  Company cultures usually can&#x27;t change fast enough to make the transition.')
