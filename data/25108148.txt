I&#x27;ve seen this type of thing happen very often: company makes it big, there&#x27;s a huge pot of money, founder has made plans about a year in advance and has already established domicile in a tax-free or low-tax jurisdiction, such as FL (very popular because of the lifestyle that is possible there) and TX. In this case, Joe Lonsdale is in TX, whereas his cofounders are also out of SV, with one in New Hampshire (Alex Karp) and another in LA (Peter Thiel, who also has citizenship in NZ). I wonder if the other founders of this company have also bailed.<p>Even if most of what&#x27;s written in the article is true, I feel that the motivations of this set are pretty clear: save tax money on what is clearly a huge payday.')
