But highly recommend the book Badass by Kathy Sierra[1]. It won&#x27;t necessarily tell you everything you need to know about product management. But it will tell you what you need to about really creating good product. Which is the core of the product management skill set.<p>Everything else that you build into the skill set will be built around this. So definitely worth starting with.<p>[1] - Kathy Sierra &quot;Badass&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Badass-Making-Awesome-Kathy-Sierra&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1491919019" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Badass-Making-Awesome-Kathy-Sierra&#x2F;dp...</a>')
