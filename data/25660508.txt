I&#x27;ve done really good friends in those places over the years, and it makes me happy to see what&#x27;s happening in their lives and even &quot;react&quot; to minor stuff that they post there after months of no interaction with them.<p>Before I had facebook (around 2004) I used to write an email every December to a list of friends I had from different places, just to make sure we had some contact.  And I also used to ping them in chat (Windows Messenger), but the problem there was that the conversation was just &quot;what&#x27;s going on&quot;, &quot;nothing here, what&#x27;s going on there....&quot; , &quot;nothing&quot;.   Whereas with Facebook, the moment one of my friends opened a tatoo place, I could write some small comment and we would &quot;virtually hug&quot; and exchange thoughts for a minute.<p>Regarding the &quot;conscience&quot; thing, Personally I don&#x27;t see anything terrible that Facebook is doing. As long as people understand that this is the internet, and whatever you upload in ANY place in the internet is inherently public, all is fine for me.')
