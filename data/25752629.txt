This is actually well-targeted to reducing the interactions of the likely-infected with the uninfected.<p>(If a city or state&#x2F;province even wanted to set up internal borders, &amp; require on-the-spot quick antigen tests to enter regions of actual or attempted-infection control, perhaps even anonymously, that&#x27;d also be a well-targeted intervention far better than the other theater we&#x27;ve been fed so far.)')
