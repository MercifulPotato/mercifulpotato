I&#x27;ve always wanted internal metrics to be this (or something similar). Like just measure company revenue and target increasing it. Goals and OKRs seem like distraction sometimes. Relying on people intuition of just how to make the product better, not with a specific targeted goal, just overall. It&#x27;s that kind of intangible thing, that&#x27;s hard to reduce sometimes to an OKR or a goal. Which means you can meet all OKRs and Goals and yet fail to have made the product better. I think it&#x27;s because OKR and Goals miss on the little details that add up, by having you focus exclusively on the big obvious things. Yes this is good in some way, get that 80% done, and initially it&#x27;ll mean success, but once competition shows up, it&#x27;ll be the little details and that extra 20% that you couldn&#x27;t capture in a goal or OKR that&#x27;ll make the difference.')
