You just need to deceive enough people (voters, really) to get 270 electoral votes.  In 2016, that turned out to be around 63M people.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing with your central point; I do agree that we don&#x27;t want some central authority deciding what&#x27;s true and what isn&#x27;t.  But 2016 showed that it was possible to deceive enough people with lies to elect someone who has not really delivered on any of his promises, and has actively hurt most of the people who voted for him.  (I won&#x27;t even get into the toxicity of his political platform as it&#x27;s not necessary to do so.)<p>How do we actually combat this?  &quot;The solution to bad free speech is more free speech&quot; did not work.  I agree that &quot;some non-negligible subset will figure out the truth&quot;; in 2016 that was more than 65M people, but that was not enough.  What other options do we have, that don&#x27;t involve central fact-checking authorities, or, worse, active censorship?  I really want to know what they are, because I agree that truth-arbiters and censors are unacceptable.')
