Item(by='sneak', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607694868, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25385009, text='Just about any federal dealer.  There is no permit required to purchase fully automatic weapons in the United States; you just have to pay a transfer tax.  Unfortunately processing the tax payment takes about a year, in their effort to turn it into a form of permit, but that&#x27;s not what it is.  Anyone (without criminal background) can pay the tax and buy one.<p>There is a ban on the import and manufacture of new ones (for civilian use) in place since 1986, so the ones available for purchase (by anyone, again, no &quot;special federal permit&quot; required) cost about 10-20x more than they would cost otherwise, which effectively restricts them to &quot;rich people only&quot;.<p>They&#x27;re freely available, though.')
