Signal&#x27;s value proposition is _secure conversations_ and it does that much better than other services. &quot;Fun&quot; is not part of Signal&#x27;s value proposition. More people want&#x2F;need fun conversations than need secure ones. Regardless of what people &quot;should&quot; want, Telegram serves people&#x27;s mundane everyday needs materially better than Signal does. &quot;It&#x27;s fun and the people I care about talking to already use it&quot; is a compelling value proposition, not a frivolous one, given people&#x27;s everyday needs.<p>The more someone cares about security and is willing to trade away other good things for security, the better a platform Signal is â€” but remember, this also flows the other way.')
