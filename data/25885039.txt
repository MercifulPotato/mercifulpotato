Taking the time to write a good question is important.  This is true in synchronous and asynchronous conversation.<p>A class of problem as big  as the &quot;No Hello&quot; problem is asking questions that are way too specific, like &quot;How do I get a list of which windows are on which desktops&quot; when the actual question is &quot;How should I move a window to another desktop&quot; and the person asking the question is too deep into what they assume is the right path.<p>The person answering your question is doing you a favor; please be respectful of them.')
