A moral statement with supporting facts is always, by definition, going to also have moral statements supporting it as well, and it&#x27;s turtles all the way down; the moral statement is ultimately going to be resting on at least one &quot;moral axiom&quot; aka value aka opinion. So of <i>course</i> focusing on facts isn&#x27;t going to be wholly convincing.<p>And personal subjective experience is an appeal to emotion. Those are convincing in the moment, but they&#x27;re rather ephemeral. Any moral conclusion needs to be recognized for what it is; if the reasoning is valid, it rests upon values that might just be different than yours.<p>One anecdote... I recently had an extremely disappointing multi-day discussion with an old friend who I discovered attended the insurrection. (Did not enter, but made it to the Capitol steps.) I was at first shocked and dismayed, but then through the bonds of our friendship we were able to empathize with each other&#x27;s emotional experience, why his community was important to him, etc. We thought afterward that maybe we really would be able to have a respectful exchange of views. But then after that it was just disappointment again - it became clear that he just wasn&#x27;t going to let go of the belief that it was all staged by Antifa, no matter how much I disproved his various meme jpgs. So at least in that case, that intermediate phase of sharing personal subjective experience only really went so far. (We&#x27;re not in touch anymore.)')
