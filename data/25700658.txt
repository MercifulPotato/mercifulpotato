Undergraduate life sciences has been a focus, and freshman science literacy.  But CREATE-like (Consider, Read, Elucidate hypotheses, Analyze and interpret data, Think of the next Experiment) strategies have also been used <i>pre-college</i>.<p>IIUC, pre-college has tended to blend in, or focus on, science journalism.<p>But I suggest there may be long-term potential to use research literature more extensively, and down towards primary school.<p>Parts of papers can be much more accessible than others.  A delightful paragraph in some paper&#x27;s introduction section.  Some photo, or diagram.  Some graph.  Or parts of a survey paper, or of a &#x27;context of these papers&#x27; column in a good journal.  There&#x27;s been work on using more papers, broadly and more shallowly, rather than diving on each.  Doing that pre-college, will be tech sensitive.<p>Tech matters.  Small-group collaboration tooling is important.  Annotation of papers, by group and instructors, is helpful.  Assorted stop-dead friction is amenable to tech fixes - &quot;what does this mean?&quot;, &quot;$40?!?&quot;, &quot;what parts of this text might I be able to understand [without having to skim it all myself]?&quot;.<p>So perhaps picture some years out, a small group of middle school students, with AR NPC peer support, surfing a content blend, of educational, outreach, journalism, and research literature, with assorted tooling support.<p>For now, apropos sci-hub... If <i>you</i> think hitting paywalls is frustrating, picture the impact on STEM-retention at-risk students, with little experience, and very uncertain they are welcome here.  Or you, now, surfing an HN comment, hearing of research literature being used to teach critical thinking to pre-service teachers, briefly intrigued, which might be gone in a moment, or become the seed a passion project - you google scholar, and... $40 to see more than a low-content abstract.  Or sci-hub.')
