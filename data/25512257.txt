You&#x27;re ahead in the sense you&#x27;re aware of it.<p>Usually, we sit down with clients and work with them to extracts problems they may have, and keep them talking about problems because they want to escape to shiny&#x2F;exciting&#x2F;buzzwordy things &quot;chatbots dashboards NLP&quot;. We drill down until we extract <i>problems</i>, not <i>solutions</i>. We then go through our usual processes.<p>One way to look at it with your background would be the following: what would be close to impossible to write a program for but that you do easily as a human. Make a list. How much they&#x27;re costing you (cognitive, time, money)? How frequently are they happening? This should get you started.<p>You do something similar but opposite with programming: you think of something that you can describe in clear steps that would be easy for a computer to do tirelessly and fast.<p>One other way to look at it is to open your eyes to the problems you have at work. If you work at an organization, apply the same thing. How much are these costing you? I&#x27;m asking you to think about selling to enterprise because I&#x27;m biased given that this is what I do, and because you want to build a business. Catering to enterprise would be, in my opinion, more interesting from a business standpoint.<p>What is the source of that data? Is it about a specific domain&#x2F;industry&#x2F;sector&#x2F;function? Who would find it valuable?')
