Based on what the article said a single core is about as fast as all cores on the Raspberry Pi 3 combined [0] while still consuming less power.<p>Why are there no other embedded processors with similar efficiency and performance? If you can get an edge through a bespoke ISA then there would be at least a few manufacturers producing such a highly efficient chip with their own proprietary ISA. Hardware companies would then try to make it work despite the proprietary ISA because the benefits are too great to pass up.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eembc.org&#x2F;coremark&#x2F;scores.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eembc.org&#x2F;coremark&#x2F;scores.php</a> search for Raspberry Pi 3 (exact score: 15363.93)')
