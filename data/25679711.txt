If you mean the actual magnetic media (not flopptical[2]) then the same drives could format a standard double-sided high-density 3.5&quot; floppy to 32MB, which is only an 8x difference.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SuperDisk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SuperDisk</a><p>2: The technical reason why these disks could have higher density was due to being able to use optical elements as a servo-mechanism, rather than just using dead-reckoning like a floppy would.  This required the disk to be printed with marks that had high contrast in the infrared range.')
