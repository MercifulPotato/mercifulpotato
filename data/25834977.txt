Find the most common path and fire a profiler at it as early as you can. The odds that there&#x27;s some trivial win that will accelerate the code by huge amounts is fairly decent.<p>Another bit of evidence developers rarely profile their code is that I can tell my mental model of how expensive some server process will be to run and most other developer&#x27;s mental models tend to differ by at least an order of magnitude. I&#x27;ve had multiple conversations about the services I provide and people asking me what my hardware is, expecting it to be run on some monster boxes or something when I tell them it&#x27;s really just two t3.mediums, which mostly do nothing, and I only have two for redundancy. And it&#x27;s not like I go profile crazy... I really just do some spot checks on hot-path code. By no means am I doing anything amazing. It&#x27;s just... as you write more code, the odds that you accidentally write something that performs stupidly badly goes up steadily, even if you&#x27;re trying not to.')
