If there had been lower mortality or ICU admission halting the trial early would make sense. With the only improvement being quicker recovery the value proposition of the treatment isn&#x27;t that great. From a practical standpoint remdesivir is expensive and had supply issues so halting the trial early doesn&#x27;t mean every American is going to start getting treated with it.<p>I don&#x27;t think the science is solid when a trial can pick from 2nd-tier endpoints and stop the trial once an improvement is found. It is quite possible that if the trial had gone on longer the one positive effect would be reduced or even go away entirely or that we would see a negative effect in a more important endpoint.')
