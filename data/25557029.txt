Item(by='wpietri', descendants=None, kids=[25559343], score=None, time=1609134465, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25556856, text='Yeah, this &quot;OMG CANCEL CULTURE&quot; shtick is tiresome right-wing hypocrisy. It&#x27;s true that what&#x27;s socially acceptable has been changing. But that&#x27;s always been the case. Take a look at this graph on the approval of interracial marriage as an example:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.gallup.com&#x2F;poll&#x2F;163697&#x2F;approve-marriage-blacks-whites.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.gallup.com&#x2F;poll&#x2F;163697&#x2F;approve-marriage-blacks-...</a><p>Has this been difficult for somebody who learned their opinions in 1960? Sure. But it was way harder for anybody in an interracial relationship, so although I&#x27;ve happily helped older relatives <i>process</i> changes, I don&#x27;t feel bad at all that they need to adapt.<p>I would have much more sympathy for the people freaking out about cancel culture if they had been fighting all of the canceling popular on the right. There&#x27;s an ocean of censoriousness directed at the left, of course, over perceived permissiveness, immorality, and upsetting the &quot;natural order&quot; though crazy things like women getting education and decent pay, or sometimes keeping gay people from being fired just for being gay.<p>But it&#x27;s true even <i>within</i> the right. Look, for example, at the way the US right has created and demanded a strong anti-abortion orthodoxy over recent decades. [1] [2] The center and moderate right has basically gone extinct in the US House over the same period. [3] All of this orthodoxy was driven under the cancellation of anybody seen as a &quot;RINO&quot;, to the extent that in the last month, Republicans get called that for trying to keep America a democracy. [4]<p>So if people like this actually want to turn to supporting freedom of speech, great. If they want to create a world where people of good faith can have honest dialog, great. But spare me the pearl-clutching over excess social orthodoxy from the side of the aisle that has for my entire life been foursquare for ideological orthodoxy and social conformance to their preferred norms. Change begins at home.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;06&#x2F;24&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;abortion-rights-republican-party-women.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;06&#x2F;24&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;abortion-rights-r...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.patheos.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;slacktivist&#x2F;2012&#x2F;02&#x2F;18&#x2F;the-biblical-view-thats-younger-than-the-happy-meal&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.patheos.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;slacktivist&#x2F;2012&#x2F;02&#x2F;18&#x2F;the-bib...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1127&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1127&#x2F;</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;realDonaldTrump&#x2F;status&#x2F;1335281344302104577" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;realDonaldTrump&#x2F;status&#x2F;13352813443021045...</a>')
