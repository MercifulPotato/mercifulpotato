You&#x27;re linking to ZDNet, and a random study that has no published data as far as I can tell. Note that I am not easily swayed by studies - I work in Vaccine R&amp;D and I read tons of research papers, and many of them are junk. A study doesn&#x27;t mean something is true. I&#x27;d trust Greenpeace knowing about the environment more than ZDNet.<p>&gt;The fact is repairability simply isnâ€™t a significant factor in environmental impact overall.<p>This is not a fact. Every single environmental group on this planet agrees that repair is significant component in reducing environmental impact. By definition it means fewer devices need to be re-purchased, fewer devices end up in landfills, more local repair jobs, more support-economy jobs, etc. I don&#x27;t think I will be able to convince you otherwise. I will let you have the last word. Have a nice day :)')
