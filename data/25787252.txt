Plus the fact that the portion sizes are double that of anything here, it&#x27;s no surprise to me that Americans are obese and Japanese people by and large aren&#x27;t.<p>For another anecdote, my wife&#x27;s friend worked at Starbucks in Canada and in Japan. She said the Frappuccinos in Canada use around double the amount of syrup than those in Japan.')
