However, they are blazing the trail.  They demonstrate what is possible.<p>There is a lot of churn in the world of online services.  It&#x27;s only a matter of time before someone else follows in the footsteps of Matrix and Mastodon, but figures out how to take it even further.  Or maybe someone else will break through by following in <i>their</i> footsteps.  Or maybe Matrix or Mastodon are just dark horses who haven&#x27;t hit their stride yet.<p>I don&#x27;t know, but I do believe the future will be in decentralized services over centralized ones.')
