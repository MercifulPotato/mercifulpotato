I think the #1 job of a manager is to hire, motivate and let go of people the right way. It&#x27;s up to them to keep working, and it&#x27;s up to the manager to figure out how to do that no more often than required.<p>If you do it right, it&#x27;s like 90% teambuilding and 10% line management, IMO. When that ratio is inverted is where you see mediocre management.')
