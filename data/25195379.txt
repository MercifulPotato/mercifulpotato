I know VSCode is more or less the industry standard. But coming from Sublime Code, the performance of VSCode is pretty mediocre. On top of big memory demands, the Code Helper uses massive resources and about once every couple days ends up spinning out of control causing the CPU to cook and the fan to spin constantly until it&#x27;s restarted.<p>I stuck with it until recently I found out how to configure VIM to do TypeScript code completion, refactoring, auto-imports, and goto definition. Every once in a while I pop into VSCode to refactor a file rename or some other little piece which I haven&#x27;t figured out in VIM yet, but I don&#x27;t miss the CPU and memory abuse a bit.<p>(Note: I suspect if I invested the same amount of time into Sublime, I&#x27;d have equally good results with fairly decent performance as well)')
