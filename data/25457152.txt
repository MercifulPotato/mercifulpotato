Item(by='LeonM', descendants=None, kids=[25457527], score=None, time=1608223011, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25455638, text='I guess this article sums up why we&#x27;ve had a rather bad experience with stripe so far: the API constantly changes, and the documentation or even Googling for a solution seems to be more confusing than ever since most articles you&#x27;ll find are about some older API.<p>It initially took us much more engineering hours to integrate Stripe into our processes then expected. Granted, we do worldwide sales, with multiple tax-flows and we accept multiple payment methods in both euros and USD. This was during the Charges&#x2F;Sources days.<p>Then this year we had to go through all that again to migrate from the Charges&#x2F;Sources model to the PaymentIntent model. This was a pain as the popular payment method in our own country was still very much in beta for the PaymentIntent flow. Documentation was all over the place and customer service often did not know answers to implementation questions (though I must say, they always followed up eventually with some good pointers).<p>Now we are receiving scary emails about how much money we&#x27;ll lose if we are not SCA compliant. But following the link in that email shows we <i>are</i> SCA compliant... Confusing stuff. Let&#x27;s just hope we don&#x27;t have to go through a migration again.<p>Disclaimer: I don&#x27;t have any meaningful experience with other payment providers, so a can&#x27;t really tell if Stripe is better or worse than others. I guess accepting payments is just really hard if you want to do anything beyond the &#x27;hello world&#x27; (which is: credit cards in the US only).')
