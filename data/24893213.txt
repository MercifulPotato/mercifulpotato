AFAIK (and the recent DMCA&#x2F;youtube-dl repo thing seemed to support) they didn&#x27;t include any VEVO videos in their readme. Instead it was used as a test case.<p>A substantial portion of his analysis relied on the readme misinformation. It could be taken as marketing material, and there are specific provisions for when the piracy capabilities are used as marketing.<p>However that&#x27;s not, as far as I know or can tell, actually what happened in this case. I was very interested in hearing how tests would be viewed legally, but he seems to have been working with the wrong information and so never addressed this.')
