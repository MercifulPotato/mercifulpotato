They&#x27;d praise Toyota&#x27;s conservativeness in engineering and use that as an excuse for not being up to speed with modern security practices.  It&#x27;s the only other brand that gets as much fanboyism as Telsa.  Ford, GM, Nissan, FCA for sure, would be raked over the coals in the comments though.')
