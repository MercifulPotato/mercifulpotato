She did as I suspected have to cull some of the warps in the densest part of the reed.  But she learned that on her own.  And she also learned that when tying in a new warp, you should use overhand knots.  But kids learn by falling flat on their faces and picking themselves up and reevaluating the experience.<p>People learn when you give them the opportunity to fail. This has been a tough lesson for me to learn because I&#x27;m used to successful outcomes being visible -- a feature is complete, a bug is fixed, a project ships. But when someone successfully learns, the outcome is internalized and usually only manifests the next time they take on a similar challenge, so I just gotta wait and see!')
