If your dev environment is stateless such that simply “opening the project” (for me, cd-ing into the project directory in my terminal) will automatically set up everything you need to start iteratively developing, you won’t have to focus mental energy on project setup.<p>This leaves you free to really only worry about the exact thing you were doing.')
