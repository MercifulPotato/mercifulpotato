For example, feel a strong nudge when you try and change lanes without signaling <i>before</i> you leave the lane, but with no input at all the car would be riding the line before correcting, essentially preventing hands free usage<p>It focused on correcting behavior without causing sudden hard to correct errors... like driving into a concrete barrier when your hands aren&#x27;t ready to provide counter-input')
