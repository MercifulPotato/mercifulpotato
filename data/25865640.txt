Every time I pointed my finger and asked, I got a response from such people &quot;you should know not all contributions to the open source are code&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not gatekeeping what &quot;real contributions&quot; are: You can fund development of OSS, you can provide Project Manager support, you can publicize and organize events (for the sake of the tech; not sales), do DevRel for something, provide UX&#x2F;UXR&#x2F;design support etc. They&#x27;re all real contributions.<p>But for some reason, AWS contributions to 3rd party OSS projects stops right at &quot;it works fine on AWS&quot;. It&#x27;s kind of a meme at this point.<p>Disclaimer: I work at GCP on Kubernetes&#x2F;OSS.')
