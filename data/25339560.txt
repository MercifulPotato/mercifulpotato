Starship has a much larger diameter though, at 9m vs 3.7m for Falcon9.<p>But Starship is just the second stage.  That&#x27;s what&#x27;s being tested tomorrow.<p>Eventually this will sit atop a massive new super-heavy booster.  The full stack will be 122m high, nearly 2.5x taller than Falcon 9, and with a dramatically larger volume.')
