If you want to create a basis of R you better choose irrational elements in your basis, otherwise the Q-span is contained in Q.<p>What I think you want to say is that &quot;any real number has a binary expansion&quot;. Which is true, but the binary sequences don&#x27;t form a vector space over R, but a Z&#x2F;2-module. And as a Z&#x2F;2-module, your { 2^i for integer i } isn&#x27;t even a basis because you need <i>infinite</i> expansions to express most real numbers. The span of a basis are only the <i>finite</i> linear combinations.<p>(FWIW, I think you&#x27;ve given a description of the dyadic rationals.)')
