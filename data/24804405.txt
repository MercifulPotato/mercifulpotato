Item(by='paganel', descendants=None, kids=[24804508, 24804677, 24804527], score=None, time=1602878100, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24804029, text='&gt; Rationalists seem extremely common amongst the $300k+&#x2F;year software engineers I know<p>I&#x27;m a programmer who lives on the other side of the world (so no chance for me to make $300k+&#x2F;year) and I must say that all this &quot;rationalism&quot; discussion makes me a little confused: do people really believe in this sort of stuff? Do they actually equate &quot;success&quot; with (mostly owning) &quot;money&quot;? Do they really think a &quot;rational&quot;(-ist) person would mainly think about how to earn (supposedly more) money? Why on Earth would he&#x2F;she do that? Money is just a tool. Holding an important position in society (CEO, founder, whatever) is just a hindrance, it keeps one away from actually thinking about the stuff that really matters.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure all this stuff was explained a lot better a long time ago by people a lot more smarter than me (right now I&#x27;m thinking at one of Plato&#x27;s works, maybe &quot;Symposium&quot;? I&#x27;m not sure, I&#x27;ve last read many of them ~20 years ago), point is this specific &quot;view of the world&quot; seems very US-specific to me.')
