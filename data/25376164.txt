My degree reshaped my brain. It forced me to be good at math. It forced me to think like a programmer.<p>I failed my first 3 CS classes, but I kept going and ended up graduating top 5% in my CS graduating class. I would never have learned how to program without this degree I am absolutely convinced. Like yeah maybe I could hook some stuff up to an array in python and struggle through a for loop.<p>The CS degree gave me confidence, expertise in solving CS related problems, and for better or worse the market expects me to have this degree and it helped me land a job where I already make 50% more than median household income in my city at only 27.<p>I would take that student debt again in a heartbeat.<p>Two of my friends with 4 year college degrees recently quit their jobs and went back to study CS. I told them to avoid bootcamps, why?<p>I&#x27;ve been a part of the hiring process and people from bootcamps are usually not very good, but occasionally they are. To me the bootcamp education doesn&#x27;t guarantee a CS related role. You could end up with nothing.<p>Even my friends who STRUGGLED through a CS degree and are AWFUL programmers were able to leverage their degree into roles like Project Manager or Product Owner which have great outlooks and solid pay.')
