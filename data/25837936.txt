You said that the difference between my speed limit example and (presumably) the article&#x2F;current events is that the latter is addressed by the Constitution. I disagree with that assertion â€” the Constitution specifically forbids abridgement of free speech by the <i>government</i>, not by private entities.<p>You can take the position that private entities should uphold the &quot;spirit&quot; of the First Amendment even though they&#x27;re not compelled to. But that&#x27;s a moral argument, not a legal one.')
