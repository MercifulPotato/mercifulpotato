IMO the enhancement part of the tech evolution equation has been much underconsidered.<p>Any time a tool evolves, it changes not only how a task is done but also why.  In the case of implementing a business process, the revision process is best served by reconsidering why what is done now and taking the opportunity to evolve the old role into making a richer contribution that introduces a new and improved path through the problem space.<p>That&#x27;s IA, and IMO, it&#x27;s the Great White Hope that AI might yet lead to a future world that engages humans <i>more</i> rather than the default dystopia where we&#x27;re all redundant and irrelevant.')
