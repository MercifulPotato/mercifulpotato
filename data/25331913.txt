A better long term investment with impact would be improving transportation network. Bay Area cities cannot handle high density due to infrastructure crunches like water, power etc. One of my farms is on land leased from San Francisco Water and also Cal Trans. I have a better idea what it takes for water to turn up when we open our taps than most here. What we really need to do is be prudent about water(and moving water&#x2F;water infrastructure) and be more pro active about what is more easily achievable..transport networks. Which means not building high density( translates to more water usage). The city could benefit from upgrading and they have been doing it, but (beckoning something my grandmother from India used to say) you can’t squeeze blood out of a mango. Unless you bleed cutting yourself, of course..the mango will remain a mango.<p>I saw youths parent’s HN profile and I see that they have mentioned other cities. Having worked&#x2F;lived in&#x2F;by all of them too, I noticed that PA&#x2F;Bay Area is the only one without a robust public transport system&#x2F;rail for inter&#x2F;intra city transport. Perhaps you are not aware how PA manages its water, infrastructure public works and school system. That’s why it’s one of the better cities in the Bay Area. Not being high density is part of it.<p>If Palo Alto had affordable housing, it would be Newark. Companies might as well work out of Newark. It doesn’t matter now anyways what with jobs going remote due to covid etc. High density demands is just code for ‘we don’t want to spend state monies on developing infrastructure because we need it to pay unfunded pension liabilities for the public sector’.<p>Developers bear the cost for building. Public infrastructure should be funded by our taxes that the state agencies have been diverting to other causes. More relevantly: It isn’t a coincidence that ABAG(where membership is mandatory. No Bay Area city can opt out of it. Strange club isn’t it? The penalty for not complying are fines. Strange ‘association of bay area’ cities. Investigate it. Can of worms.) mentioned in the article has merged with MTA, the transport authority. So now it’s easier to bury those accounting of tax dollars that should be under forensic audits.')
