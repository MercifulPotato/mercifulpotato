Mostly APIs with newer versions where Chrome is the only one to support the old API.<p>But just exploring web extensions a bit (this was my first time interacting it), it feels like supported features differ quite a bit between browsers. Chrome has the lead here, and Safari seems &#x27;minimal&#x27; in comparison. UI elements can also behave very differently between browsers.<p>Apple is dead-set on having you use the App Store to distribute even web extensions.
