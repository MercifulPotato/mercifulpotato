I&#x27;ve had good results using type annotations internally in a library for education and research. Static typing would be overkill for most of the users of the library but it&#x27;s useful for developing the library itself.<p>Aside from that, an advantage is that the type system is more expressive than that of Java or C#. Most common Python idioms work just the same way with or without type annotations, so you can continue to write functions that take either int or str arguments (for better or worse) and the typechecker will understand your use of isinstance and make sure everything checks out. (But there are other fully statically typed languages that are also more expressive than Java or C#.)<p>You can also continue to do weird metaprogramming and monkeypatching, and though the typechecker is not always able to make sense of it you can often wrap it in a safe interface so you can still get assurances for the rest of the project.')
