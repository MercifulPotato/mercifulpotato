He was referring to there being &quot;fine people on both sides&quot; of the political spectrum, protesters and counter-protesters, at the protest.  His point was that not all of those protesting the statue removal were white supremacists, some were &quot;fine people&quot;.  Of course, that&#x27;s the story the left went with anyway, because Trump fumbled another one.')
