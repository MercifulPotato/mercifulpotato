I&#x27;m only in my mid-30&#x27;s and already have RSI and CTS due to decades of mouse use &amp; bad ergonomics. I suspect I&#x27;m not alone.<p>Definitely a pattern I&#x27;m seeing on the Web, accessibility is becoming more and more important, and &quot;bending over backwards&quot; for the user&#x2F;client is on the horizon.<p>Furthermore, I think accessibility will be the breaking point between huge dinosaurs like Facebook and Twitter and small communities of dozens, hundreds, and thousands of members.<p>The big ones will have to choose between opening up the platform to accessibility, which inevitably also means opening it up to automation, abuse, and data flight -or- alienating an increasing number of accessibility users. Either way is not that attractive.')
