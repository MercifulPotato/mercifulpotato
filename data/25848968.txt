Item(by='gumby', descendants=None, kids=[25849211], score=None, time=1611162873, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25846899, text='&gt; I find it slightly offensive that someone would accuse me of discounting collaboration when 1. I never discounted it, 2. It&#x27;s obvious that society is full of people who collaborate. In what universe are the words &quot;zero sum&quot; apt for my response? None. I never described a zero sum game. Obviously, the replier added the description with his biased imagination.<p>You wrote, &quot;Winner takes all&quot; which seems pretty zero sum to me, hence my comment.')
