As long as being geographically close to them gives you a much better shot at making multi-millions a year, people will move back.  The junior engineers are moving to Vegas because it&#x27;s close and cheap and right now nobody&#x27;s advancing quickly in anything, so it doesn&#x27;t matter.  They&#x27;ll all snap back (or be replaced by other people who do) as soon as the <i>next</i> technology wave starts.')
