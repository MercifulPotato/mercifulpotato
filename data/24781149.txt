They said they shipped a billion chargers so they’ll just include the cable from now on. Well, the cable is Lightning-to-USB-C, not USB-A. Apple shipped nearly zero USB-C chargers and many people getting an iPhone will have to buy one. In the end, Apple removed the charger but didn’t lower the price, and people still have to buy a charger.')
