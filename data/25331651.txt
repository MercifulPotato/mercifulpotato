This doesn&#x27;t read as apolitical to people who actually live in the places these phrases are applied to and it seems to be characterizing the people in these places, &quot;liberal cities&quot;, as either fools or sub-human villains. Also, if you are one of the people demonized you don&#x27;t recognize yourself in the description.')
