Additionally, even if the developer is also able and willing to quit his job to bootstrap his business, that overhead adds to the cost of the software. On the other hand, it would be easy enough IMO to get companies to set aside $20K&#x2F;year (give or take based on the size of the business) and task a few principal engineers with divvying it out among their open source projects. That would be a pittance for companies but it would be a big infusion for open source.')
