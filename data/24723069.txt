Item(by='sequoia', descendants=None, kids=[24724706], score=None, time=1602186476, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24722964, text='&gt; &quot;Apolitical&quot; is ... another way of saying, &quot;The way things are is fine&quot;.<p>I disagree strongly &amp; think you&#x27;re dead wrong here. Apolitical in the workplace is saying &quot;we come to work to align on &amp; collaborate in working towards <i>shared goals</i> and <i>those goals</i> are what we should be focused on at work. People who share this goal (coinbase, make money, promote crypto whatever) may vote R, D, or not vote at all. <i>We can all still work together on our shared goal.</i>&quot;<p>It means people with different views can work together on stuff they <i>do</i> agree on rather than &quot;I can&#x27;t work with anyone who doesn&#x27;t vote the same as me&quot; which is what social-justice-in-the-workplace seems to lead to, for better or worse.<p>It is NOT an endorsement of the status quo, it&#x27;s a recognition that you and I might both oppose the status quo for <i>completely different reasons</i> that have <i>nothing to do with work</i>.')
