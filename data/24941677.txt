It&#x27;s got insane power, but comes with a relatively steep learning curve. Remember reading regex for the first time? What? But unlike regex, the number of people using it are few in comparison.<p>I avoided XPath until I couldn&#x27;t anymore. I could do a lot with CSS selectors, but eventually the DOM traversal became difficult to reason about w&#x2F; just CSS.<p>After taking the dive, it&#x27;s so powerful. Read a single XPath and like regex, you can fully understand what the thing is going after and how it will get there.<p>There are functions in XPath 2.0 that I would love to have, but Nokogiri for Rails is stuck in 1.0 world with no plan to go to 2.0. Sad, but I&#x27;ll live.')
