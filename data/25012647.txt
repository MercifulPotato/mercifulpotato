Not only that but they over bill me and I frequently catch it. Why don’t I switch forms - well, I’m scared I’ll have a worse experience with another firm<p>You could be making the classic mistake of throwing good money after bad money. If you try a new firm, you still have a chance of things going wrong. But if things are going wrong with your existing firm and you can&#x27;t pinpoint&#x2F;address the root cause, you can be a lot more certain things won&#x27;t change.<p>&gt; Big difference in big companies and small ones. If you’re not micro managing as a small startup, you will fail.<p>Success is a better teacher than failure, so are you sure you should be speculating about what kinds of management styles succeed or fail when by your own admission, your micro-management leaves you burnt out and without results? Based on my experience, it&#x27;s almost always the case that startups only succeed in scaling by avoiding it. It has to do with delegation.<p>Micro-managing is tacit acceptance of an inability to delegate. A team which fails to master delegation will fail to scale past the team lead&#x27;s individual communication bandwidth capacity. That happens really quickly if you hit hypergrowth. You basically guarantee failure in a way that will make it really difficult for you to learn how to run a team any more effectively.<p>It looks like that&#x27;s your experience. Could you consider the possibility that an alternate approach could get you mileage? Why not find a trusted advisor to help you select a better firm? Perhaps you might have difficulty selecting a good firm, but it&#x27;s possible that someone you know who has more experience with software could help you. After all, by your admission, you spend a lot of money on this purchase. Why not experiment with different approaches and see if you can get more ROI out of it?<p>I&#x27;d bet money that if you found a good engineering leader and delegated delivery to them, you&#x27;d save money, time and headaches. Of course, you&#x27;d need to be willing to take the risk to invest in that, which is something you could fail at. But running a business these days is all about figuring out how to take risks successfully and improve your ability to do so.')
