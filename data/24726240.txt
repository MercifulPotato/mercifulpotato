It&#x27;s the work of authorship implementing it.<p>But you can certainly produce multiple implementations of source code that are not only functionally equivalent in practice but actually generate identical machine code.<p>&gt; Copyright protects <i>how</i> code is written not what it does. And the <i>how</i> applies just as much to interfaces as implementations.<p>The issue is that the interface is strictly the what it does part. Given the implementation, or the need for compatibility with one, the API is purely a factual description of the call spec. You can&#x27;t rewrite it or it changes the <i>what</i>, which means there is no room to change the <i>how</i>, and the code correspondingly required shouldn&#x27;t be copyrightable because it&#x27;s purely functional and leaves no room for alternative compatible implementations.')
