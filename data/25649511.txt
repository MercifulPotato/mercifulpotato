I mean, to be honest, Android is literally &quot;easy mode&quot; compared to iOS even after this change, and just having access to execmem would be enough for any iOS app to write a very capable Termuxâ€“and that&#x27;s even without proot involved. I&#x27;m seeing claims of execmem possibly going away as a reason to not write their own loader (which is basically the only component they need) but that would require banning all alternative web browser engines from the store, which would be a much larger change in policy than banning exec from certain directories.')
