Even with dice, the fact of the matter is that you will roll dice with almost entirely Newtonian forces acting on it,  and it will settle on a number. This is not unknown to physics. It’s just unknown to us. And because we don’t have the data and computational power to know with any certainty where the dice will land, we call it random.<p>Everything I do is centered around creating probability distributions of where a stock will be in in the future. I don’t do this because it is fundamentally unknowable, but because I cannot access all of the data necessary to know.<p>So, I’ve come to regard probably measure as an interesting and useful tool, but one that has no connection to the reality of existence.')
