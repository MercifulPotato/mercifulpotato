So, personal story time: I used to have a pretty scarily good memory. But as I get older I find that I only <i>think</i> that I still have a good memory. Every day there is evidence that it isn&#x27;t nearly as good as it used to be and if there is anything that scares me about getting older it&#x27;s that.<p>Some parts of what you write remind me of stuff I&#x27;ve read about flying an airplane: never let the airplane get ahead of you. In music that would be &#x27;never let the music get ahead of you&#x27;, once it does the cognitive overload becomes overwhelming.<p>Then: I listen a lot to the pieces that I want to play, over and over again, until I have the music in my head and then playing piano becomes a lot more like singing, instead of memorizing the movements you memorize <i>the music</i> and playing then becomes actual playing, you now have time and braincycles to spend on making it sound nice rather than just what to play and when. I only have a few pieces in my very limited repertoire at that level but the difference is huge with the remainder, I can make them sound in whatever way I want, I can vary them when and where I want to play variations on the entire piece by changing style and so on. That is what playing piano to me is all about and I intend to spend a lot of time on reaching that kind of proficiency with more music to broaden the range a bit.<p>I wished I had some tip to help you, also, I&#x27;d love it if you gave the software a spin and let me know if there is a way that I can improve it so that it <i>does</i> help you, if that requires setting up a trial version then I&#x27;m all for it. Let me know if you&#x27;re up for this. best regards, Jacques')
