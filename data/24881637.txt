It puts pressure on us and if we take the correct view of death it empowers us into action. It&#x27;s funny I don&#x27;t really fear death and I don&#x27;t really understand the existential crisis that people have over it. I do however understand that living forever in this existence would soon grow old. All of my ancestors have lived for unusually long lengths of time. Most of them going to 100-110 years of age. My last great grandparent died when I was 30, until 2013 all of my grandparents were alive. The reason I bring this up, is none of them where in fear of what was coming after nearly a century on this earth they were ready to go. My last great grandfather was  107 when he passed, he was diagnosed with a treatable form of cancer. The doc told him it could be treated and that even at his age his chances of survival where close to 90%. He looked at the doc and said WTF are you going to give me 5 years? I am 107 years old, my wife has been dead for several years, I am going home to die. You see he saw death as mercy from a long life and the older I get the more I understand that. If there is something after and it is eternal then I would think it would be of a vastly different nature than the life we experience now. Simply put we are not designed mentally or physically to live forever. Now I have faith there is something else, and I believe that this existence is a learning experience along that path and one of those core lessons is learned via death and that is on our own left to our own devices immortal existence is a futile endeavor. I think that is pretty apparent just looking of the last two centuries of human strife and the state of current affairs. Without death, life would just be a default not something to appreciate and enjoy, it would be taken for granted and our very nature would be different. I have the benefit of if I am wrong well then I am just dead. Either way I am OK with the outcome, because I really have no choice in the matter. Worrying about it only distracts from what we should be doing and that is living in the time we have.<p>As a side note, I am not trying to be somber and I enjoy living, but living for eternity in this reality, based on what I have seen just in my lifetime, seems like a hell and not something I would strive for.')
