You have your vote, you cast it and that&#x27;s what really matters to your category: representation.<p>Sort of in agreement with you, but on this, I think there&#x27;s good reason to be concerned with something like this.  If people with social influence disagree with your position and are public about it, they are in a position to influence more people than you can, and your position is less likely to be heard&#x2F;adopted&#x2F;enacted&#x2F;etc.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s actually <i>why</i> people get upset&#x2F;involved when famous people hold opposing views - I think it&#x27;s probably something more visceral - but I can say I don&#x27;t want views in opposition to mine to get amplified favorable treatment in the media.<p>Perhaps secondarily, people get upset with famous folks holding opposing views because it ruins our perceptions of them.
