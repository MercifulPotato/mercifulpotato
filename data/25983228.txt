They are famously secretive about their operations so I don&#x27;t know how much power they use. The most I&#x27;ve found is that they have &#x27;multi-megawatt&#x27; datacenters, which means they probably use more than three megawatts and less than 100.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;fpmS0JYyCGs?t=66" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;fpmS0JYyCGs?t=66</a><p>Bitcoin uses about 8.5 gigawatts. Clearly it uses at least a few orders of magnitude more electricity than Visa. It can process four transactions per second compared to about 25,000 for Visa, so the energy per transaction is even worse by a few more orders of magnitude.<p>The inefficiency of Bitcoin is truly mind-boggling. If I were trying to write a hit piece, I wouldn&#x27;t have the guts to make up numbers as bad as the reality.')
