The tricky thing is that Coursera classes seem to get merged, re-mashed or otherwise re-branded.  And as such only one currently is listed in my &quot;Completed&quot; courses section of my profile.<p>Having said that and with the caveat that these probably changed since I taken them, I recommend the following:<p>- Cryptography - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;crypto" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;crypto</a> - great introduction to the fundamentals and math behind cryptography.  A lot of theory but also some practical exercises.  This is my top recommended.<p>- Machine Learning - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;machine-learning" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;machine-learning</a> - a good introduction to the basic of machine learning; focuses on octave&#x2F;matlab and does not dive into frameworks like scikitlearn or tensorflow<p>- Introduction to Interactive Programming with Python - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;interactive-python-1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;interactive-python-1</a> -\nI took a course from Rice University on Python programming through making games that was fun.  As far as I can tell, this is the modern incarnation in two parts.<p>- Software Security - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;software-security" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;software-security</a> - goes into stack &#x2F; overflow exploits, tools for testing, and web-based attacks<p>- Functional Programming Principles in Scala - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;specializations&#x2F;scala" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;specializations&#x2F;scala</a> - this was a good introduction to scala and functional programming - it got me thinking in a different way<p>- C++ for C Programmers - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;c-plus-plus-a" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;c-plus-plus-a</a> - I think this was the first coursera class I took.  This course dove into the C++ STL and a lot of modern features introduced in C++11.')
