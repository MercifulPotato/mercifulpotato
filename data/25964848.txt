It depends on investor sentiment. Often things have a V-shaped recovery and things are more or less &quot;fine&quot;. We had a few of those over the past few years.<p>But put it to you this way, if this statement of yours:<p><i>It has to go somewhere, and so it will come back into securities in probably a few weeks or max, months. The value represented isn’t exactly disappearing it’s still in the ‘system’.</i><p>...was correct, then we wouldn&#x27;t have crashes. But we do. When fear takes over the money doesn&#x27;t just come back into the market quickly. And then even if it could, it doesn&#x27;t because second order effects take over. Small businesses close en masse, etc, which magnifies the downturn until it snowballs into a legitimate recession.<p>I&#x27;m not saying a crash <i>will</i> happen because of this. I&#x27;m saying it very realistically <i>can</i> happen.')
