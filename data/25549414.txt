I saw one person doing it in my area and in the early times they &quot;traded&quot; for a vacuum cleaner but I am certain that was actually a vacuum that was being given away free. Not really illegal or anything, but it does give you an idea, people traded for something trivial because the thing they traded was something they were throwing away. People give away stuff that is worth hundreds of dollars. People would be surprised. But ultimately that makes the paper-clip to something worth a few hundred dollars relatively easy.\nI think it starts getting really steep really quick. You can&#x27;t increase the value of your object by 50% every time. You&#x27;re just increasing by a little bit. But the one I know of recently started getting trades that were actually companies who were benefitting from the social media profile. So even if they &quot;lost&quot; in a trade they gained promotion from being involved with the project.')
