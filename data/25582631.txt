It is a sign of a gravely malformed conscience.<p>I think that most of those people haven&#x27;t formed their own opinions, though, and mostly just regurgitate party platforms.  It&#x27;s not that they started from any reasonable base of knowledge and arrived at the wrong conclusion.  It&#x27;s just ignorance.  While they could have been studying the ethical philosophers who made meaningful contributions on this topic, instead, they allowed social media and mass media to form their opinions for them.')
