The few times I&#x27;ve given my analysis on some (trivially) technical material to a journalist, I was told that most people shy away from material they <i>think</i> is sensitive (it wasn&#x27;t. Technically it was public information). I saw this first hand another time when I tried to introduce a journalist to an expert on a subject, but the expert just wouldn&#x27;t want to get involved. And so they&#x27;re left with terrible OpSec and technical people judging them from the sidelines.<p>This is, of course, all based on my own experience from a developing country.')
