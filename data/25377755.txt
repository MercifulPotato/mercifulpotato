Item(by='timr', descendants=None, kids=[25378846, 25377999], score=None, time=1607630032, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25377045, text='&gt; I’d be interested to see how “normal” the kind of fall back options these founders had.<p>My history in SF weirdly intertwines with AirBnB. I first met them in 2007, at an &quot;unofficial startup school afterparty&quot; (this was before they were funded by YC). The party consisted of Brian and (IIRC) Joe, and a couple of bottles of booze and some soda in their apartment (the one they rented out to the first guests). Let me just say that they weren&#x27;t living in luxury: there were mattresses on the floor. The only notable piece of furniture in the place was a table, and a bookshelf filled with white, blank-covered book galleys that Brian had gotten for free from some print-industry connection.<p>I then worked at Justin.tv when these guys were getting advice from Michael and eating lunch with us on a regular basis. I bought them drinks because they were broke. The unsold Obama-O&#x27;s boxes were sitting around the office.<p>I&#x27;m as cynical as the next guy about the relative well-off-ness of a lot of startup founders these days, and I don&#x27;t have any personal insight into their finances at that time. That said, as much as anyone in SF in 2008 had no fallback plan, the AirBnB founders seem to fit the bill.')
