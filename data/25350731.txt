Operations over lists behave the same regardless of their length, and a 0 element list is not a special case.  Say you want to send mail to someone&#x27;s mailing addresses:<p><pre><code>    addresses = user.addresses()\n    for address in addresses {\n        send_mail(address)\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIf they have no addresses, the program doesn&#x27;t blow up.  If they have one address, they get mail!<p>Of course, it&#x27;s possible that having two addresses is just as annoying as having 0 addresses, in which case lists don&#x27;t help you.  Someone will add a second address, and then you won&#x27;t know where to walk to to go see them.<p>I&#x27;ll also point out that it&#x27;s the same number of lines of code as just handling null:<p><pre><code>    address = user.address()\n    if address != null {\n        send_mail(address)\n    }\n</code></pre>\nSo it&#x27;s kind of a wash, and I haven&#x27;t really thought about it since.')
