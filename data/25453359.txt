We seem to generally imagine that the biggest problem or challenge with AI is ethics because we frame ethics as being largely rooted in something emotional, like empathy or compassion, and not logic.<p>The movie <i>I, Robot</i> explores what happens when &quot;logic&quot; is taken to its logical outcome by an AI. It posits a robot with feelings as the antidote to this issue.<p>We tend to overlook the fact that humans themselves come in varying flavors with regards to degree of emotional affect, empathy, compassion, etc and how ethical they are. We haven&#x27;t gotten this sorted for humanity yet and when tech goes sideways and hurts many people, we like to blame it on the tech itself fundamentally lacking &quot;a heart&quot; or <i>ethics</i> instead of blaming it on the character defects of the architects of the tech.<p>We still haven&#x27;t really figured out how to do human intelligence well and that&#x27;s scary and not something we want to admit, so we project our deficiencies onto the tech and this incident is uncomfortably casting light on the fact that it&#x27;s not really clear cut like that. It&#x27;s really not the case that you can readily separate the people from the tech when it comes to things we label &quot;ethics.&quot;<p>&#x2F;Hot take')
