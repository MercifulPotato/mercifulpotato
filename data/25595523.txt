E.g. preventing users from seeing other users&#x27; PIDs, changing &#x2F;etc&#x2F;securetty, non-root X server... In real life, nowadays, a single system is likely to be running a single application, and once that&#x27;s owned there&#x27;s very little of the rest of the system to take over.<p>Owned a Web app with access to user accounts? That&#x27;s enough to steal all the credit cards flowing through it, and spy&#x2F;scam all the users in it. Becoming root, or peeking into other users, is usually unimportant because there&#x27;s nothing special happening there.<p>I guess Kubernetes is the one thing that sort-of brings back these concerns, but even that has its own more modern particularities (e.g. the guide doesn&#x27;t even mention cgroups).')
