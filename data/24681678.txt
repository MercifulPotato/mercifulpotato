I&#x27;m saying women can do something that a man cannot &quot;outside&quot; the workplace -- that is gestate, and to some extent bond with and grow, a child.<p>And I know it seems like &quot;Can&#x27;t the contribute more at the workplace? Imagine a woman with IQ &gt;= 120 What about research etc?&quot; Well to the extent that desirable traits are heritable is to the extent we want&#x2F;need these women to be mothers. And iirc the research indicates children grow optimally w&#x2F; their biological parents, both of them, and plenty of bonding time. This is in direct contradiction to the mother making deep commitments outside the home. Sadly it becomes a binary choice between being a fantastic mother or a fantastic contributor to a cause&#x2F;research&#x2F;business. I dont say this to denigrate anyone, but to recognize the real human limits of everyone involved.<p>IMO kind of like clean air&#x2F;water or stable food supply we under estimate the importance of the task because of it being commonplace.<p>Remove the ability (or actuality) of having kids and much of our society would collapse in ~20 yrs time. All the people involved with making goods for, teaching, training, sports etc around children would be unemployed. Housing market would have a massive shift because who needs extra bedrooms? Politicians + news anchors would just Say &quot;Women&quot; insted of &quot;Women and children&quot; etc. It would completely disrupt society.')
