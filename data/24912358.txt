I&#x27;d be interested in a published paper describing this structure.<p>Barring that, yes, experience <i>really is</i> just protein cascades and electrical impulses. A light bulb is orders of magnitude simpler â€” easily 10 or 12, maybe more; and, that&#x27;s just spatial; the spatiotemporal complexity might be another 10 or 12 orders of magnitude. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any stretch of the imagination to believe qualia arise somewhere between &quot;uniform black body emitter&quot; and &quot;human brain learning and experiencing over time&quot;.')
