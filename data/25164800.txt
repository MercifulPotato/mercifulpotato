The pacific NW had more &quot;renewable&quot; energy production than carbon sources for decades, its carbon footprint per MW is about 3x that of France.<p>Shifing to a pacific NW model is economically something that is happening on its own, and has been for the 30 years I linked above. But not because we are building &quot;Green&quot; because all those intermittent sources are 30%+ backed by NG generators which can be spun up&#x2F;down on demand and over the past 15 are super cheap to install. And NG has been super cheap due to fracking and the fact that the US can&#x27;t sell it internationally.<p>But its not about percentages, its about how much CO2 is being produced.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nwcouncil.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;northwest-carbon-footprint-low-and-getting-lower" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nwcouncil.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;northwest-carbon-footprint-lo...</a>')
