The two main camps I see are:<p>1) Covid19 is far more deadly, look at all these excess deaths!<p>2) The IFR is low, about the same as the seasonal flu, so we really didn&#x27;t need the lockdowns.<p>Both are half true.<p>Basically, we have decent herd immunity for existing viruses.  Even with an identical IFR, the viruses are acting differently because we lack(ed) any real herd immunity for the new virus - so everyone was getting infected at once, which means everyone getting sick at once and risking overwhelming hospitals (this is the part people in camp 2 miss).  On the flip side, because we do have decent herd immunity with existing viruses, either due to prior exposure or vaccine, seasonal flu doesn&#x27;t spread nearly as far (this is the part people in camp 1 miss).  A lot less people getting infected means a lot less people getting sick or dying, which explains the excess death despite the same IFR.')
