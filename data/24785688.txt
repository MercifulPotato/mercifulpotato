Compressed air is dangerous.  A full tank is basically a bomb.  While we have the technology to make this safe, it has to be regularly inspected.  If your homeowner slacks on the inspections they could come home one day to discover their energy storage has turned itself into a crater and flattened all nearby structures.<p>One thing to consider is that the heat generated by compressing the air could be vented into the home to warm it up in the winter, or simply allowed to escape outside in the summer.  When discharging the cool air would either be released outside or inside of the home, depending on if you want to cool it off.')
