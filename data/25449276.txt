I work in this one massive repo that Magit just can&#x27;t handle. Pulling up the Magit status window takes 15-25 seconds on a 2019 15&quot; MBP with an 8-core i9. It&#x27;s torture because I&#x27;m so used to Magit that I hate having to change my workflow for one repo. I hope lazygit is faster than Magit.')
