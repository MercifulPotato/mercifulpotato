So it&#x27;s not uncommon for hero assets in large-scale VFX movies to have 12-20 different sets of texture files that represent different portions of a shading model. For assets that are large (think the Star Destroyer from Star Wars, or the Helicarrier from the Avengers), it may take 40-50 4K-16K images to adequately cover the entire model such that if you were to render it from any angle, you wouldn&#x27;t see the pixelation. And these textures are often stored as 16 bit TIFFs or equivalent, and they are pre-mipmapped so the renderer can choose the most optimal resolution at rendertime.<p>So that ends up being 12-20 sets * 40-50 16 bit mipmapped images which can end up being several hundred gigabytes of image data. Then at rendertime, only the textures that are needed to render what&#x27;s visible in the camera are loaded into memory and utilized, which typically ends up being 40-80 GB of texture memory.<p>Large scale terrains and environments typically make more use of procedural textures, and they may be cached temporarily in memory while the rendering process happens to speed up calculations')
