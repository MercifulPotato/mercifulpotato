So it&#x27;s not uncommon for hero assets in large-scale VFX movies to have more than 10 different sets of texture files that represent different portions of a shading model. For large assets, it may take more than fifty 4K-16K images to adequately cover the entire model such that if you were to render it from any angle, you wouldn&#x27;t see the pixelation. And these textures are often stored as mipmapped 16 bit images so the renderer can choose the most optimal resolution at rendertime.<p>So that can easily end up being several hundred gigabytes of source image data. At rendertime, only the textures that are needed to render what&#x27;s visible in the camera are loaded into memory and utilized, which typically ends up being a fraction of the source data.<p>Large scale terrains and environments typically make more use of procedural textures, and they may be cached temporarily in memory while the rendering process happens to speed up calculations')
