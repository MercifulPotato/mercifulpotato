Roughly 37% overall do not want this at all.<p>Interestingly, Pew only asked the question of what the public wants, but not how much things cost and how they will be paid for. As always, the devil is in the details: Roughly 53% <i>do not</i> support raising income taxes on incomes above 250,000!<p>It&#x27;s clear that when we are asked whether we want something and then also asked if we want to pay for it via higher taxes, we have balked. Ultimately, if folks are not willing to pay for something, they can&#x27;t have it! And if they are unwilling to pay for something, they&#x27;re effectively saying they don&#x27;t want it.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2017&#x2F;09&#x2F;27&#x2F;more-americans-favor-raising-than-lowering-tax-rates-on-corporations-high-household-incomes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2017&#x2F;09&#x2F;27&#x2F;more-americ...</a>')
