Paradoxically, I&#x27;ve found that completely ignoring income&#x2F;clicks resolves this problem. Here&#x27;s what happened to me:<p>1. Try and make &#x27;the optimal thing&#x27;.  Something easy to create, and so lucrative that I won&#x27;t have to make anything else again<p>2. flail like the author describes<p>3. decide that no amount of money is worth feeling this way (or otherwise burnout via your method of choice)<p>4. make nothing for a while (~6 months for me)<p>5. start missing some aspects of what you used to do<p>6. gradually start making those things again, with the goal being to make those things.<p>Hopefully step 7 is profit, time will tell. If it&#x27;s not, I&#x27;m ok with that too :)')
