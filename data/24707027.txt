Item(by='xwolfi', descendants=None, kids=[24708031, 24707144], score=None, time=1602068441, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24703352, text='I emigrated to Hong Kong from France and I love the system here. It mandated a &quot;high&quot; salary of 2000USD that is low enough to allow noobs like me to join and try while high enough not to bring people who would just try to survive no better than at home.<p>They also mandate a master degree and low effort from the company, which can be negociated if really strong guy (bachelor with some effory, expert reputation with high effort).<p>Then they give a permanent residency after 7 years of taxes but no path to nationality so the only way to persist is to make children locally, another interesting point: you ll never be Chinese but your kids can, which makes also the immigration problem drama free.<p>I quite wish France tried that because we feel (might not be rational) we have so many issues with our immigration.')
