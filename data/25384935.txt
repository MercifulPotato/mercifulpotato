When it first won independence around 1920, it formed a parliamentary democracy based on a constitution. A little while later, one party took over, and a new constitution was written that was much more authoritarian. The same leadership a little while later than that wrote another new constitution that was halfway between the first and second constitutions in terms of mix of democracy and authoritarianism.<p>Then the Soviets invaded, and democracy vanished until the early 1990s. At that time they regained independence and created their present government.<p>This is a huge oversimplification, but the four separate constitutions and the evolution of the Estonian system is fascinating.')
