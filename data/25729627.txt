Cisco is not a small vendor or use case for creating a vpn bridge.   We moved from this to cloudconnect - essentially a network connection directly to aws.  Same instability issues only they moved to weekly&#x2F;monthly instead of daily&#x2F;weekly.  This was from a provider that had fiber to AWS.<p>I will also say that when putting particular load on AWS&#x27;s internal services from a single ec2 instance you can often see requests that fail (s3 being the one I see the most).<p>I can&#x27;t speak on the merits or lack thereof on Linode, but I will say vultr and DO have - by comparision to AWS - leagues better public wan stability.  I&#x27;ve had ssh sessions open for months on both and that includes to some POPs in europe.  I&#x27;m comparing AWS which is &lt;20ms away to something overseas... for reference that&#x27;s about 20 additional hops and trans-atlantic fiber in between.')
