I know plenty of people who do architecture, landscaping or design who use Dropbox precisely because most of the things they use it for don&#x27;t involve Office (much).<p>For lots of people, Microsoft 365 Personal is 70 $&#x2F;year for 1 TB and a bunch of things that might as well be Google Docs, which are free. 200$&#x2F;year for three times more storage space isn&#x27;t a terribly bad deal.<p>Edit: yes, I realize Microsoft 365 allows you to use the desktop apps. That doesn&#x27;t add much <i>if you already have the desktop apps</i>. Or if you don&#x27;t need either the web or the desktop version.')
