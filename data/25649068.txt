He&#x27;s had Snowden, Glenn Greenwald and Andreas Antonopolous on several times now, there is no excuse for not being some what informed given his general curiosity on the topic by now and making the most of those podcasts and having Moxie speak on such a large platform.<p>Honestly, I wish he had let him request Laura Poitras to come on as she can bring the topic to the massess in a relatable manner better than anyone I&#x27;ve seen so far--hell I remember first seeing CCC and Defcon videos being totally overwhelmed by the speakers so much I couldn&#x27;t follow any of it. This may be because she comes from a non-technical background as a film maker that has been around Cypherpunks for decades now but has also been at the center of so much of the polemics (Assange, Snowden, Wikileaks, Intercept etc...) of it all and likely saw how valuable it is in life and death situations very quickly.<p>My issue is with the dropped calls and poor call quality, but given how few people use the voice based calls they because Signal knows how vital to optimize for low bandwidth things like messages given its prime demographic in places with real reasons to use this app for its intended purpose. Again, totally understandable to me and something that they will eventually get to.')
