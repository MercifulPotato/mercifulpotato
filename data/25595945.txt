Item(by='jolmg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609441676, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25595825, text='&gt; but it is easy enough to fix by apply user CSS.<p>That doesn&#x27;t fix the bandwagoning issue mentioned. Though, personally I don&#x27;t think it matters in terms of points&#x2F;karma, though it is annoying to have that bias other readers&#x27; opinion on one&#x27;s comment. One starts off reading with the preconception that it&#x27;s a bad comment, even if the downvotes are from a disagreement. It&#x27;s also annoying to be silenced from a disagreement. Graying seems equivalent so responding to someone with a &quot;shut up&quot; which I think anyone would agree is rude.')
