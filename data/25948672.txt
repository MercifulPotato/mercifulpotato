Robinhood would try to sell the stock to someone on Robinhood buying the stock first. The big banks and brokerages have enough people buying&#x2F;selling within its platform that it has enough supply to trade within itself.<p>For a small brokerage, they would have to work with other brokerages to help them trade, as they wouldn&#x27;t have enough shares they already hold to trade them within their users. So Robinhood asks Apex for more shares, and Apex has to ask HSBC&#x2F;Fidelity&#x2F;JPMC&#x2F;Goldman if Apex doesn&#x27;t have any. At some point, all the other institutions also don&#x27;t want to give up their shares because they need to satisfy demand from their own users. Trading with other firms tends to be really slow too.<p>It&#x27;s a short squeeze too, by definition there&#x27;s not enough stocks available for everyone who wants to buy. So some firms ran out and couldn&#x27;t get more.')
