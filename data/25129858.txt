C# has some cool features like sequential StructLayouts.<p>C# is actually rarely used for making game engines, but it&#x27;s popular as an embedded scripting engine for games. I think C# has a better embedding story, because I&#x27;ve never heard of any projects embedding Java (I am sure they exist though).<p>Lastly, Java has a bit of a stigma for being a low performance language. While that may or may not be true, and there&#x27;s been many popular games written in Java, such as Minecraft or most of the Android games, the stigma still remains and jokes about Java being slow are very popular.')
