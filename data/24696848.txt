This is why they hate “built in” privacy protections in consumer software and demand ways around it, because they help protect even technically illiterate criminals.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say is, the important question is how much do we want to erase privacy for 99% of people who use normal consumer software in order to help police catch the ~1% or whatever the percent of criminals is that also use normal consumer software, and just happen to also be criminals. The 0.01% of people that are criminals and have the resources and knowhow to actively try to avoid detection by building their own systems are not going to be caught in trivial ways (like tracking their IP to their apartment, vpn or no vpn, or tracking them through correlation from using their personal social media account from the same connection they perform illegal activity from) anyway so they don&#x27;t matter.')
