And I say that as a somewhat prolific Acorn customer in the 80s and 90s. It was after all a quick hack because they weren’t going to deliver ARX. Some of the impedance mismatches between the OS and everything else in the universe are glaringly irritating today such as paths and file type metadata.<p>But a lot of the better ideas from the operating system should be carried forwards into something else. I’m not talking about sticking something on top of Linux but something completely different. Perhaps a resurrection of ARX and the UI concepts from RISC OS would be interesting.')
