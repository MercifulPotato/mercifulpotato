For a single great circle you can fit a significant number of satellites in a chain, but turns out you don&#x27;t want too many like that as all your satellites cover the same part of the earth.<p>All great circles on a sphere will intersect in two places, which assures a collision if you have satellites in them both (without active avoidance). So you have to separate the great circles on to different sized spheres, or add a little eccentricity to make sure the rings don&#x27;t touch.<p>There is still a lot of space, but comparing to the size of the surface of the earth is not very informative when dealing with orbital dynamics.')
