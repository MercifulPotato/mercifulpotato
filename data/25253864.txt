The market is competitive, and anybody making lousy frites is unlikely to survive long.<p>They really are amazing: about 1cm square in cross section crunchy and crispy on the outside, but not overly so, light, fluffy, and the perfect balance of dry&#x2F;moist inside. Never oily, always cooked fresh, and without exception, delicious. Though I will confess that I never got behind putting Mayo on top.<p>Anybody fooling around trying to replicate the original McDonalds recipe is shooting for the wrong target. Shoestring fries don&#x27;t have the inside&#x2F;outside texture contrast that makes for fry perfection.')
