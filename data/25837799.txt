We can do better than this.<p>As someone who makes money selling software, I think we should abolish copyright and let these companies give contracts to their users which bind them not to share the songs and movies they bought.<p>Then it&#x27;s up to the company to report when actual violation is occurring and bring, in a fair court case, whether a certain user shared the material or not, breaching their contract with the company.<p>If you access material shared breaching a contract you&#x27;re not doing anything illegal.<p>If you&#x27;re selling passively too many copies that enforcing all these contracts is too problematic or expensive, you can consider it a natural market tax on the huge profits you&#x27;re making.<p>We shouldn&#x27;t give shortcuts for companies to enforce their copyright, they have this problem specifically because they are the richest 1%.')
