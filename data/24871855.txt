I don&#x27;t think they can count ballots until after polls close.<p>But maybe we get lucky and there are enough in person votes, the margin is big, and polling shows no drastic changes in VBM then it will get called.<p>Even without Pennsylvania if Trump loses Florida and then loses the midwest, doesn&#x27;t flip Nevada etc it will be called quick.<p>Basically I&#x27;m looking at Florida asap and very very worried about it...<p>I would have bet Trump was ahead 8 weeks ago. Now I think maybe Biden by a point or two max.')
