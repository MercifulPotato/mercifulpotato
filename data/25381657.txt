The ftp files you download are typically &#x27;the whole globe&#x27; with a bunch of variable stacked like layers of images in a big image file. One of the problems is that a typical numerical weather prediction output has so much fucking data you dont need.<p>GFS for example. IT has maybe 200 or so timesteps in each forecast, runs 4x a day. There are a shit load of configs to run for the GFS. And each config + output has maybe 300&#x2F;400 variables in each file? So you download 200 files, each with 400 images in it, each image is pretty dense. Each file is ~200 megs, X 200 files. You do the math. Get that 4x a day. And that is just one forecast model. We have lots more, and many more that have higher resolution and denser data.<p>The biggest problem i think is they have a goddamn free-ass oldschool FTP server. They are allowing dimwit grad school scrip kiddies to code up whatever shit they want. Infinite loops to try and download gobs of data you dont understand? sure go ahead.<p>They dont even know how to trakc users. they want to keep an open server, and use IP Address as unique ID. I suggested to use fucking tokens, or username&#x2F;pass combo at least haha')
