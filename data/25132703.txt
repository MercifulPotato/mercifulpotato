It&#x27;s users that really gain from the competition.  Companies may gain in the long run because of better performance and features (but I think most the low hanging fruit for performance has been picked), but in the short run it&#x27;s a lot of risk just to help everyone, not yourself, which isn&#x27;t where public companies shine.')
