VLC remains one of the best pieces of software I&#x27;ve ever used. It just works, and while I mostly use it as a simple player, any time I needed some more advanced features, they were also there. Most unusually, VLC doesn&#x27;t get worse with time like so much modern software does. No bloat, no ads, no removal of settings, no inexplicable UI redesigns for the sake of redesigning. Truly the gold standard of software.')
