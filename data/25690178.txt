They were driven to another site, and I can say for sure the level of extremism was unchecked in comparison by their own community at that point. On reddit, they at least were exposed to more formalized community moderation as well as regular influx of more level headed people who often tried to talk sense into some of the more extreme members. I think <i>some</i> good faith efforts and ground rules were in place on the new site, but a lot of this insurrection shit seems like it would have gone very differently on a more public facing reddit subforum.')
