However Ron is saying that they were taken out of context. Authoritative news usually do that, that&#x27;s why 90% of the time they spread fake news. Some people may argue that authoritative news spread fake news 99% of the time, but i find that a hyperbole and i stick to the 90%. Point me if you so desire to the exact publication with the context around it. One or two pages would be fine. Thanks.')
