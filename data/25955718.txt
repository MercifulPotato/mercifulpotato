Some people, mostly those who get in and out early, will make money. The other people involved will lose money.<p>The circumstances at the moment are strange, for sure, but the end result seems all but certain to be the same: the patsies mostly end up giving their money to someone else. It just happens that this time, it&#x27;s a different group of market manipulators, who may or may not be acting legally and so may or may not get to keep that money anyway.<p>If nothing else, this incident has shown that maverick investment could be dangerous to our financial systems. These stocks do not exist in a vacuum and the people playing games with them are not operating independent of the rest of the markets. Their actions could hurt a lot of innocent people as well -- ordinary people who just have their savings and pensions invested in the market in normal, responsible ways -- at least in the short term.<p>If the same strategy continues, it must be a matter of weeks, if not days or hours, before governments begin heavy-handed regulatory interventions and even new legal restrictions, assuming that hasn&#x27;t already started behind the scenes and isn&#x27;t responsible for the interventions in buying certain stocks that have already happened.')
