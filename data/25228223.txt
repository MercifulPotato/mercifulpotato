If it&#x27;s a belief they hold, I&#x27;m interested in knowing the thought process and making my own conclusions based on something I might not have known. But the act of asking the question makes the person, who may not have put too much original thinking in; quite defensive.<p>There&#x27;s another drawback here too: which is that you can&#x27;t experience everything. I can&#x27;t live with the experiences of an American Black Woman who emigrates to England as a White English Man who lives in Sweden; it&#x27;s just not possible, thus it requires strenuous effort to empathise.<p>There will always be a line in which we just have to take things at face value, in computer terms &quot;understanding the contract&quot; between components.<p>Thinking for yourself is overrated as society is not built for it if you want to fit in.')
