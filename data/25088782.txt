Mac os ui is functional, easy to use, enough information density. And the animation, styling and graphics that looks great on a high dpi screen. And there is cohesive design and animation on the system and the apps. Apple&#x27;s design is both beautiful, fluid to use and functional. While microsoft&#x27;s design? It&#x27;s still non existent. Even app design is just... Like teams ui is clunky to use, has huge title and side bars, low information density.<p>Win32 ui just looks 90s, and some looks broken on high dpi screens. While microsoft&#x27;s new ui is just broken for the desktop use. Text size is different between uwp apps like mail, and win32 apps like word. They are even from the same company and same product team.<p>I don&#x27;t think ever mac will be touch based. They share design style with ios. But it&#x27;s going to be optimized for mouse and keyboard. And I love how you can search for commands in a app on the Mac in the help menu. It allow you to access app features all by typing what you want. You can use gui like a cmd.')
