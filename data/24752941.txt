I&#x27;m not sure I understand the question. Yes, you can flee, but you&#x27;re going to spend the rest of your life as a wanted criminal. It&#x27;s not exactly easy.<p>Letting people go home without bail would include the same risk of fleeing, without the additional financial incentive. So, if the concern is people skipping trial, how does that help?<p>Not a lawyer, but I believe police are supposed to collect evidence <i>before</i> they make an arrest, to provide justification for the arrest. If there are places they still need to search, they can probably lock them off, but I think most of the evidence should already be in police custody.')
