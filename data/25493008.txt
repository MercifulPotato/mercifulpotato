Recordings can then be shared between Audiopile users in private groups or re-downloaded at full resolution.<p>After years of playing in bands and struggling with large format audio, I’m finally starting to be satisfied with this solution. Plenty of tools exist to share large files, but Audiopile is designed to make sharing and previewing these files easy and fun. Transferring and previewing audio is clunky at best with current tools. You shouldn’t have to download giant files to your phone if you only want to give them a quick listen.<p>A side benefit of creating this app has been the endless stream of lovely new music that my friends are sharing with me every day. Sometimes the coolest music is the stuff that isn’t out yet, and I’m part of a few great idea feeds and rehearsal groups. The secret music being created and sent only to you and a few others in real-time makes this app a whole lot of fun!<p>Tech info: Client-side it’s React and React-Native. All core business logic for uploading and state management is fully isomorphic JS. for the heavier audio recording and playback functionality the app bridges out to native code on each platform (Swift &amp; Java). Then there’s a whole lot of Python, Terraform and GCP behind the curtain.<p>Audiopile is a totally indie, bootstrapped app with no outside funding, so please tell your friends!<p>-Brian<p>feedback@audiopile.cloud\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.audiopile.cloud&#x2F;<p>iOS: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;apple-store&#x2F;id1463418804?pt=118611681&amp;ct=SHOW%20HN&amp;mt=8<p>Android: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.audiopile<p>Web App: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.audiopile.cloud&#x2F;<p>Product Hunt: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;audiopile')
