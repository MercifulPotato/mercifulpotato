There are certified laptops from at least Dell and Lenovo, and probably the odd model from other manufacturers. While the certification technically only means the hardware is compatible with Ubuntu, and perhaps only as pre-installed by the OEM, in practice that probably means general Linux compatibility. I have trouble seeing any point in making Ubuntu-specific tweaks to an OEM install, as it&#x27;s easier to just send only the models with compatible components for certification (or to pick compatible components in the first place, which may be feasible at least for premium laptops).<p>But as a user, you do have to pick your hardware.<p>My ThinkPad X240 has been suspending and resuming reliably for the majority of the last 6 to 7 years. There was a time when the touchpad didn&#x27;t work after resume without tweaking (in Fedora), which was annoying and surprising and something that IMO shouldn&#x27;t have happened. But other than that there have been no issues.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;certification.ubuntu.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;certification.ubuntu.com&#x2F;</a>')
