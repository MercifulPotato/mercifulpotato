My understanding is that the project&#x27;s unique nomenclature (but more importantly the way it presented itself) was specifically adopted in order to select for a community of early adopters whose minds were open to novel concepts, and who&#x27;s initial investment to even begin engaging with it ensured a certain degree of loyalty, and created a somewhat closed community.<p>Urbit seems to be loosening up on a lot of that obscurity. Its elevstor pitch has really been refined, and its introductory posts do a solid job of easing you into the concepts and architecture of the project.<p>If you checked out Archive.org&#x27;s earliest records for Urbit&#x27;s website, it did a decent job of communicating the project&#x27;s goal. However, by early 2014 its website had been rewritten such that it you could be forgiven for thinking it was some spiritual successor to templeOS, so far as it went to justify or describe itself as anything other than a jumble of conceptually interesting software components.<p>Moldbug did something similar with his writing in UR, or at least that&#x27;s how he rationalized some of his rhetorical choices. He&#x27;s brilliant, but I honestly find his writing a little obnoxious because of it.')
