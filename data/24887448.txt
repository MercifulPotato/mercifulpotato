What are you going to do with this information?<p>* IQ is fixed; a test at, say, 16 will give you your intelligence for the rest of your life. (16 is arbitrary because I am uncomfortable with psychological testing of young children, but you can make the argument to roll this back to 6 or 8 if you like.)<p>* IQ is hereditary.<p>* Skin color (and ethnicity in general) is correlated with IQ. Sex is correlated with IQ variance.<p>(Am i missing anything here?)<p>Here&#x27;s a clarified from of Kantian categorical imperative: Would you like to live in a society based on those principles?  (I forgot to add, &quot;given human history&quot;.)<p>IQ testing is very valuable at the low end, to identify individuals that need some form of help.  I, personally, am a little uncomfortable with other policy extensions.')
