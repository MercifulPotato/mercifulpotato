For example, look at the Windows Sockets docs[1], which came out of that era. Here you see information architects working at the height of their power: Content is broken up into conceptual (&quot;About Winsock&quot;), task-based (&quot;Using Winsock&quot;), and reference (&quot;Winsock Reference&quot;) topics. They were doing this kind of structured documentation before DITA was a thing. It&#x27;s a pain in the ass to produce content this way, but the results are wonderful.<p>Then came .NET Core: a fast-moving, community-driven effort, where the philosophy seems to be to get it working and then scribble down some docs later. The result tends to be a huge wall of text with conceptual and sample topics jammed together ([2]), and you&#x27;re lucky if the API reference gives you anything beyond parameter names.<p>Azure docs suffer from a different problem. It seems they&#x27;ve tried to apply some kind of rough information architecture, but the quality isn&#x27;t great. I&#x27;ve looked at the GitHub history of some of the shoddier topics, and they&#x27;re often written by junior Product Managers who are fresh out of college. I encounter a lot of imprecise, colloquial English describing out-of-date screenshots.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to belittle the people who work on .NET Core and Azure. There&#x27;s a ton of content that needs to be written for these products, and it&#x27;s a thankless task for the devs &amp; PMs who do the heavy lifting now. I&#x27;d really like to see some dedicated technical writers come in and bring the quality back up to their old standards.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;windows&#x2F;win32&#x2F;winsock&#x2F;windows-sockets-start-page-2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;windows&#x2F;win32&#x2F;winsock&#x2F;windo...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;aspnet&#x2F;core&#x2F;fundamentals&#x2F;routing?view=aspnetcore-5.0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;aspnet&#x2F;core&#x2F;fundamentals&#x2F;ro...</a>')
