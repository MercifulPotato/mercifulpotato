TSMC (and AMD) has had trouble matching the frequencies that Intel has been attaining on their 14 nm node, so the only way they were going to beat Intel&#x27;s single threaded performance was to increase IPC enough over Intel that the frequency gap didn&#x27;t matter. Seems like they finally got there (the point where their IPC is high enough that a 4 point something GHz Zen part can exceed the single threaded performance of a 5 point something GHz Intel part).')
