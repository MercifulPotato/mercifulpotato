If you aren&#x27;t being an asshole, some people will upvote you back to neutral if they think you are being downvoted for the wrong reasons.<p>You just have to have a little courage of conviction and patience and not start editing your post in reaction to voting or complaining about it, etc.<p>HN does a much better job than most platforms of allowing people to genuinely express a minority view -- assuming they can follow the guidelines and not bitch about the voting and not get reactive and inflammatory because of baggage, etc.<p>It&#x27;s not an easy thing to do, but it can be done here, unlike most platforms.')
