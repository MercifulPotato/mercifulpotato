Thanks for the correction.<p>&gt; Parallelism is achieved using multiprocessing.<p>As I said in my previous comment (but used the wrong term), threads are a perfectly reasonable way of getting parallelism in Python, so long so long your application uses C-based libraries like numpy (or even some built-in modules like zipfile). In my experience, the vast majority of Python programs that might need parallelism fall into that category (or are IO bound) anyway.')
