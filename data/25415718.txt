Including PHEV, Tesla market share is even lower (~6% for 2020, probably lower as this is based only on the top 20).<p>The best selling BEV in Germany in October is the Renault Zoe, with a range of 300 to 390km (190 to 240mi). Second is the Volkswagen ID.3, with a range of 330 to 550km (205 to 340mi). These are compact cars, but perfectly sized for the European market, with decent range. Until recently the Model 3 had only 250km of range I believe.<p>I don&#x27;t think Tesla is going after this market, to be fair. And I&#x27;m not sure they should. But they can certainly make a dent in BMW&#x2F;Mercedes market shares. Which is already pretty incredible, frankly, as American cars have historically not been very competitive in Europe.<p>Unless, of course, that self-driving technology matures...')
