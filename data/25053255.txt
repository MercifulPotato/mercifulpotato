The same functionality, but non-distributed, will be available for free to all users.”<p>I can&#x27;t speak to what exactly the thinking was at the time (I wasn&#x27;t around yet) but as you mentioned, the community told us that the non-distributed functionality (DUMP) wasn&#x27;t good enough for the scale people wanted to run at. Makes sense, so we made the change.<p>If I had to take a guess DUMP was performant enough at the time for most of our CockroachDB Core users and their scale, but adoption has picked up since then, as have data sizes.')
