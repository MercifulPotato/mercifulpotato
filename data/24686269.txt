Sadly the paper is making it pretty hard to get an answer to that question - the least they could have done was to make it obvious over what time their study data was extracted (answer, I think: for all time up to 1st Aug 2020), and also when schools were shut down in India (answer according to UNESCO: partial closure from 2nd March, still fully closed). Anyway, it seems perfectly consistent to me that the superspreaders are adults, and that clusters of children who interact with each other also interact with the same adults.')
