The whole school nurse thing is more for legality and insurance issues (I imagine). As a kid, I always thought the school nurse was borderline useless. The only thing I can see as being useful, a school nurse knowing how to perform a tracheotomy. Not something I expect a run of the mill teacher (or average person) can do. There&#x27;s a relatively high peanut allergy rate in the USA amongst children due to our seriously flawed food knowledge and habits. Perhaps school nurses here do know how to do that well, amongst other &quot;seconds matter&quot; care before paramedics are needed. Though, I can&#x27;t confirm or deny if they do.')
