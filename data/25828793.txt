If your software allows patents with disease X to recover 5% faster and they spend a billion on disease X claims each year your software instantly has 50m value to them.  You should be able to find a bunch of examples of how much Americans spend on different medications a year, extrapolate the differences in recovery rates from correct and incorrect prescriptions to that value.<p>Additionally, I&#x27;m sure they audit Dr prescriptions, if you get the insurance companies to use your service in the audits the hospitals will also purchase it to pre-audit themselves.  Perhaps the drug companies can mandate its use.  If you can&#x27;t get a business to want your product, make them need it :)')
