It kills people too, just not as many.<p>Literally because of &quot;just not as many&quot; part. Yes, real world policies do some cold calculations about &quot;how many people die&quot; and have arbitrary lines. Arbitrary lines are actually ok. Better then arbitrary line on either &quot;never ever&quot; or &quot;totally all the time&quot; extreme. Also, we literally close schools when flu get out of control in some area - for a week or so and that is enough for flu to get under control. There is also huge push for flu vaccines each year. It is not true that no flu management is done, there is a lot of flu management going on.<p>Like, I dont know whether it is consequences of two party system, but the whole &quot;we either lock everything for every reason or never nothing at all&quot; and &quot;we cant possibly think in probabilities and death rates and nuance&quot; is frankly, idiotic.')
