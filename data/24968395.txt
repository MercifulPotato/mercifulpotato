Not just because of The Internet Archive&#x27;s fantastic work in recent years with getting these onto their website, but also the work put in by the Dosbox and ScummVM people.<p>These old games are more accessible now than they were back in the day, when you had to configure your AUTOEXEC.BAT, get all your IRQs in order and make sure you have enough memory and whatnot.<p>The accessibility and availability of this stuff is one of the reasons why we started DOS Game Club a few years ago over on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dosgameclub.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dosgameclub.com</a> - it&#x27;s like a book club, but instead of books we focus on a different DOS game every month and discuss it on our forums as we&#x27;re playing them. At the end of the month we invite some members for a chat and publish it as a podcast.<p>Turns out there are loads of people interested in playing these old games, some of them quite young too! And with how many games are available all over the place, it looks like we&#x27;ll have plenty of material to keep us busy for many years to come.')
