You see, in 1982 my family and the entire country was at war with an Argentinean dictator, when suddenly Margaret Tatcher, an unpopular Prime Minister at that time, saw the opportunity and instead of de-escalating the tension between UK and the dictator, she decided to go to war with him. What the media didn&#x27;t tell the Brits is that Argentina was already at war and fighting for democracy. For that reason, Argentine people felt betrayed by England. Both countries were close friends for more than 100 years, since 1810 when Britain and Argentina signed a treaty of friendship proposed by Woodbine Parish. His cousin, John P. Robertson, was a good friend of General San Martin.  Argentina and England had 2 enemies in common: Spain and France. Both countries were allies until the beginning of world war 2, when General Per√≥n became a good friend of Mussolini. The dictators and facists Videla a Galtieri went to war with the UK, US and NATO. There was no democracy in Argentina, no government and diplomats to stop the war. It was an illegal war because it was not approved by the Congress and Senate. The fact that Maradona scored an &quot;illegal&quot; goal against the Brits was seen as a revenge for loosing a war that no one wanted to fight, except for Tatcher.')
