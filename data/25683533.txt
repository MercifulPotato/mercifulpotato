I am someone who easily gets cold: I sit still 14 out of 16 hours every day, and I&#x27;m also way too selfish to let myself be cold all day every day.<p>It would neither be sustainable nor a good example for others.<p>No, I&#x27;m warm, sometimes too warm, and the room is currently at 17°C. Still a far cry from climate neutral of course, but a (to me) respectable percentage better than the 21-22°C I used to require as recently as last winter (I just hadn&#x27;t looked into layering my clothing before, it was surprisingly simple to lower my thermal need by 5°C).<p>&gt; <i>an individual</i> choosing to [do uncommon things]<p>Not only does it make me feel better, it also means I have first-hand experience to tell others what they could do and what impact it has had for me. The 2 extra minutes a 20-minute trip takes are mostly peanuts while saving a sizable amount of CO2 as well as money (most people pay for their fuel). I will still drive fast when I am in a rush, but for all regular trips you can choose to do this without leaving much earlier at all.<p>I think that perspective might help others consider their own choices. If nobody did this, it would be weird and abnormal. Now that they hear my experience, it&#x27;s less so. I&#x27;m still an outlier, but it takes only one more person to set a trend.<p>This is of course an optimistic view and I&#x27;m well aware of that, but the alternative is doom and gloom, saying we realistically won&#x27;t do anything anyway, why bother. I dunno, just seems nicer to me to try rather than accept failure beforehand. I can only do what I can do, and this is something I can do (walk the walk, then talk the talk).<p>(Anecdotal addition)<p>A friend became vegetarian for climate reasons. They drive on the highway at a literal 200km&#x2F;h (125mph). Knowing that I also eat less meat and do other things towards the climate, upon hearing how fast I drive and what impact a 25% speed reduction already has, I noticed that they at least looked rather thoughtful for a minute. Will they change their habits? That&#x27;s not up to me and I don&#x27;t ask after it, but they at least thought about it and it will be a more conscious choice now. They might also be less likely to boast about their driving habit as they previously did, less normalizing such things.<p>Perhaps also not, what do I know. I just notice that a lot of people around me are making better choices in one area or another. Some use more plastic to better preserve food; it&#x27;s often a trade-off. I use more clothing to preserve heat. I&#x27;m just happy that people are sharing ideas and trying new things.')
