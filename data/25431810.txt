Your ISP could generally know the domains you are communicating with (when and how much), but not about what. They also could not add metadata to requests. The ad tracking we&#x27;re talking about in this post really needs those details, so the ISP isn&#x27;t in a position to enable the kind of tracking Apple is blocking here.<p>You can go further and use a VPN. Then all your ISP knows is that you use a VPN, but would not be able to tell anything else. Of course, you need to trust your VPN provider (including to properly secure their service), but if you&#x27;re paying for one, at least your interests are aligned. (You pay your ISP, but they operate as semi monopolies and your privacy is not their primary business concern, so your interests don&#x27;t really align that well.)<p>I agree about not allowing ISPs to sell data, though I think it would be OK if properly anonymized.')
