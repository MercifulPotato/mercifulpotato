I believe that by declaring a whole category of person as intrinsically broken beyond repair (in this case, &quot;incapable of functional relationships&quot;), the inevitable outliers of such a bold claim will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. If sociopathy is a spectrum, and someone is on that spectrum who would still be able to find a happy and functional life, and they are told without qualification that they are incapable of loving or being loved, they are going to ostracize themselves and live out that story. Even worse is the case where someone <i>thinks</i> they might be a sociopath, or has been misdiagnosed as one, because as we all know psychology is far from an exact science.<p>Nobody deserves to be marked unlovable based on the way they are born. Period. If someone has already hurt you personally then that&#x27;s different: an individual is different from a category, actions are different from hypotheticals, and trust is different from compassion. I&#x27;m not saying a person&#x27;s past actions should be ignored. What I am saying is that everyone should be considered based on their own individual choices.<p><i>“We are all receiving Charity. There is something in each of us that cannot be\nnaturally loved.” ― C.S. Lewis, The Four Loves</i>')
