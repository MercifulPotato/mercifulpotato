In the country I was born in there was one correct answer for me (though the question was rarely asked); later that changed.  In my mother’s country the legally determined answer is printed on your ID card, which at least removed the need to think about it.  In the USA there is a very different “correct” answer, yet that is apparently wrong when I fill out a medical form.  If I fill it out one way I can be scolded by the doctor, yet the other way and it has more than once been “helpfully” changed by front desk staff.<p>Frankly it feels like visiting the Dell web site: are you a small business?
