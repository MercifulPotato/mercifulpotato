Your argument essentially says without bees then nature as we know it falls apart catastrophically - I am incredulous you could interpret this as obvious.  Species go extinct all the time and yet Earth is still doing just fine, apart from the damage humans are doing to it.<p>&gt; No pollinators<p>Bees are not the only pollinators<p>&gt; leads to decreased germination<p>A decrease is not the same as elimination<p>&gt; which leads to less food<p>A decrease is not the same as elimination<p>&gt; for the lower levels of the food chain and on and on<p>Your argument is a about knock-on effects, which certainly exist.  But you seem to think if any point in the chain breaks, it leads to ecological collapse.  Why do you assume nature is so fragile?  I am not a biologist and maybe bees are special or there is something I do not understand, but I certainly don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an obvious conclusion.')
