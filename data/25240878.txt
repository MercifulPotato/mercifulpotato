Item(by='usrusr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606600430, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25240692, text='500 would be 5000 km even at just 10 km&#x2F;h which would be generous (but doable) for a Shimano chain even under roadbike conditions (where this would be roughly 200 hours). Mountain bike conditions will increase wear level a lot and they&#x27;ll probably be a bit faster than 10 km&#x2F;h as well. I don&#x27;t know if it is really as bad 50h, but I&#x27;ve stopped mountainbiking when suspension forks ceased to be exotic. It also differs regionally: riding muddy in a place where the air is full of corrosive ocean spray will require far more chain replacement than riding in the Utah rock deserts.<p>If you ride a chain until it stops working you&#x27;ll probably reach those numbers. But then you will have to replace the entire drive train which is far more expensive. The chain is the cheapest part and replacing the chain a bit earlier than absolutely necessary will greatly increase the durability of more expensive parts. As a little bonus you&#x27;ll repeatedly get the joy of riding a new chain. Replacing at the right time is cheaper and more enjoyable at the same time.')
