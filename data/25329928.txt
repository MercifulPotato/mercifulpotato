There is a enforced conformity at most large companies in terms of &quot;approved&quot; politics, but Timnit was not fired for going against the grain here. In fact, by all reports she was disliked internally for disingenuously using progressivism to further her own career. Timnit was also not fired for criticizing Google&#x27;s stance on privacy and data collection.<p>This just seems like an offensive on a corporation in an otherwise unrelated topic.')
