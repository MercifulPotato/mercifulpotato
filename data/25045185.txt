And the people working with it pay good money to OCR those scanned documents to make the whole system usable.<p>This is sometimes referred to as the &#x27;five monkeys with a ladder&#x27; paradigm [0] (not to be confused with the &#x27;5 monkey experiment&#x27;). It basically comes down to: we must use paper format, because we have always done it that way, though nobody knows why we still do it.<p>Having worked on a paperless accounting startup, I though that paper was still used for legal reasons. It turns out that (for most countries) this is mostly a misunderstanding. Digital documents are just as valid (if not higher level of assurance) as its paper counterparts. Many businesses still insist on the &#x27;signature with a blue ink pen&#x27; thing, but again that is due to the 5 monkeys with a ladder problem.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;skeptics.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;6828&#x2F;was-the-experiment-with-five-monkeys-a-ladder-a-banana-and-a-water-spray-condu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;skeptics.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;6828&#x2F;was-the-ex...</a>')
