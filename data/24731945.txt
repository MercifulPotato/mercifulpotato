E.g., I&#x27;m interested in outputting some kind of 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional solution space on 2, 3, or 4 input variables to identify discontinuities and slopes. Any thoughts?<p>ETA: Diving into my thoughts on this a little: really what I&#x27;m describing would require (1) a dumb numerical analysis algorithm or (2) some CAS computer algebra system features, my preference. I don&#x27;t know all the keywords and concepts, but I think term rewriting and equation solving would get me towards the output I seek: a multivariate, piecewise equation with user-selected input variables and user-selected output variables: e.g., current year tax, n+1 year tax, etc. Seems too involved, but ai have hope.')
