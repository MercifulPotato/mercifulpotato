I can&#x27;t get it to connect to my computer and phone without having the app installed and, even then, the sound quality was garbage until I updated the firmware on the set. I don&#x27;t see how you can think that the Jabra is more seamless unless you only use 2 devices and don&#x27;t use the Airpods with iCloud. My Airpods switch from my phone, computer, iPad, and Apple TV so seamlessly that I &quot;donated&quot; my the Elite to my wife for work. She has to answer phones for her job and even she thinks the audio quality on the Elite is bad compared to her Airpods but she finds the headset more comfortable than the Airpods.')
