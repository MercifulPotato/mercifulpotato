The motherboard he&#x27;d picked had IR remote support, and it would be running XBMC.<p>Main problem was mainly price, as it often is. No way it could have approached the price of my NVIDIA Shield TV box.<p>But he did make a few and sold it to people he knew.<p>I helped him automate the Linux install and setup, so he could just drop a txt file with owner details and the image on a USB stick and boot from it to install a new box. This became my first exposure to XBMC, which I liked quite a lot.')
