Item(by='dxdm', descendants=None, kids=[25600553], score=None, time=1609438870, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25592199, text='&gt; the lack of explicit start&#x2F;end markers for code blocks is a very unfortunate choice.<p>&gt; It was a bold choice by Python, but in my experience it turned out to be a poor choice<p>Could you explain why? I&#x27;ve heavily used languages with explicit block delimiters as well as Python, in collaborative environments, and the significant whitespace in Python does not really cause me any trouble. There is some slight overhead of making sure of the indentation when copy-pasting, but a decent text editor will make fixing things simple.<p>As for the theoretical mixing of or trade-offs between tabs and spaces - that&#x27;s just not a practical concern that exists in my experience.<p>Of course that&#x27;s a matter of taste, but the whole thing just seems like a minor detail to me - especially when we have the option of code autoformatting now.<p>Am I missing something here that makes other people&#x27;s experiences much worse?')
