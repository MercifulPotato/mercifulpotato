We sat down and watched him playing Chopin, and they were suitably impressed.<p>We live in privileged times, where we can hear greats from over 100 years of performing history.  It&#x27;s a double-edged sword, though; in the old days, the guy down the street who played the fiddle was enjoyable to listen to, because you couldn&#x27;t listen to Heifetz or Kreisler on demand, where now, every amateur is compared to the greats of an entire century.  It&#x27;s made amateur music-making less enjoyable for a lot of people.')
