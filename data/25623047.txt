It appears you are doing a rewrite of Entity Framework. That said, you may have some specific requirements that justify this approach. Performance would be the most immediate one that comes to mind if you are planning on some domain-specific optimizations.<p>Regardless, if you are looking for a good way to build documentation, look no further than DocFX:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dotnet.github.io&#x2F;docfx&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dotnet.github.io&#x2F;docfx&#x2F;index.html</a><p>This is something that can be built-in to your CI&#x2F;CD toolchain and automagically refresh your static HTML docs each time you make changes. All of your actual documentation can live in XML comments above the relevant code members throughout. This is intended to work in concert with the default VS comment style (3 slashes starts XML comment section).')
