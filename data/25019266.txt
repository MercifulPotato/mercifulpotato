I&#x27;ve been checking SOS websites and have not run across this in the states I&#x27;ve checked...<p>Edit:<p>Thank you both (below, too) for the info. Yeah, so for the states that default mail ballots (WA, OR, CO), I don&#x27;t see an issue as these states have used this method previously.<p>What I&#x27;m focusing on are states that moved from &#x27;vote by mail optional&#x27; -- to &#x27;vote by mail, nearly default because of a recent pandemic.&#x27; Which changes the nature and security of the Ballot Request System in each of these states.<p>Normal implicit controls around ballot requests are out of the window in this new &#x27;mail-in majority&#x27; culture. Refer to my &#x27;bussing&#x27; example above.')
