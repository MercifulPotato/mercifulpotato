I work on an extremely large codebase that easily eats up several hundred GB of disk space.<p>This code lives on a workstation under my desk. I do my coding on a laptop.<p>I want only one feature: Low latency for typing, find&#x2F;replace, search over a wireless connection from my laptop to my workstation, possibly while I’m traveling.<p>Nothing beats ssh’ing into my workstation and launching vim. (Emacs will also work - I just prefer vim because I’m used to it)<p>I would love to use an IDE and the powerful features that come with it. But I wouldn’t trade off latency for those features.<p>Additionally, there are a ton of people who use the same workflow as me - ssh + vim. Any impact from changes to a network security policy will quickly be fixed because it impacts soo many of us.')
