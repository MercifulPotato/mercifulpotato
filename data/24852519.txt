And the &quot;golden age of TV&quot; we are in basically proves that people don&#x27;t really want shorter in scripted content. If anything, we want deeper stories. Novellas have never outsold novels. Movies were an outlier for a while, based on the fact it was so hard to produce content, but even movies are now becoming trilogy&#x27;s+.  Youtube is hugely successful because it satisfies niche content, the length is irrelevant.<p>They thought it should be &quot;mobile&quot;, but by limiting it to mobile they meant that you could only watch part of the time. Netflix is perfectly fine on mobile.<p>The switching back and forth thing feels like a novelty like 1 time then you just do whatever you want and stick with that. Its also hard for creators as you don&#x27;t know how people will use it, so you have to make it &quot;worse in landscape&quot; and &quot;worse in portrait&quot; so people can watch on either method.<p>I absolutely LOVE people taking big risks on ideas. This was just a bad idea from the start. I wish they would have blown $1.8B on some shoot the moon healthcare idea or something.')
