The 3rd world level dilapidation surrounding rich enclaves is very specific to liberal-run cities as far as I can tell (my favorite quote from a Nob Hill condo owner - &quot;It&#x27;s only nice here because the homeless are too lazy to walk uphill&quot;).<p>Even super depressed places I&#x27;ve been to, like Spokane, WA, or rural Illinois by Kentucky border, look far more orderly, safe and well-run.
