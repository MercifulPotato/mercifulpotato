It&#x27;s been a couple of years, but, IIRC, 100 or 200Mbps was $65&#x2F;mo and the same plan with cable TV was $60. I&#x27;ve actually never had any issues with the quality of their service, I just hate the scripted CSR&#x2F;upsell situation. But that&#x27;s the same everywhere.<p>I briefly had gigabit with them for $140&#x2F;mo, just because I could. (because I&#x27;ve complained for so many years that if I could get gigabit, I would). 1000 down&#x2F;50 up or similar. But eventually the novelty wore off and I downgraded to 250.<p>Currently for me, symmetric gigabit is $80&#x2F;mo with ATT, $90 resold by sonic, but if&#x2F;when Sonic brings their service directly it&#x27;s $60.<p>As a 2 person household, yeah, I&#x27;d have a hard time saying 25Mbps down is not enough. It&#x27;s a lot of work to use 100 down, forget gigabit. And there&#x27;s a bit difference between filling a 100mbps pipe, and actually being <i>limited</i> by it.')
