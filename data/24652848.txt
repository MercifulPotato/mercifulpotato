We’re the authors of Fullstack React, ng-book, Fullstack Vue and we’re looking to work with authors like you to write a few new courses this year. Our books &amp; courses sell very well because: - We go way beyond API docs and teach everything you need to know to build real apps. - We guarantee they&#x27;re up-to-date. - We invest in marketing the books (and have an active email list of over 100k) - We love the topics we write about and aim to create something remarkable every time. If you decided to self-publish, you may find the marketing is more than writing the course. We have an audience, and we know what they want to learn - so when your course is done, we already have people who want to buy it.\nIf you decide to go with a “traditional” publisher, you may be given a mediocre editor, write your manuscript in MS Word (ha), and earn 5-15% in royalties. With us, our editors (me) are programmers first, our tooling is dev-friendly, and our royalties on profit are split 50&#x2F;50. (For scale, the author of Fullstack Vue earned $20k on the opening weekend, Fullstack D3 even more.)<p>We’re looking to write the definitive guides on programming topics. Things like &quot;The newline Guide to Authentication with React and Node in 2020&quot; - But variations on that can be any major stack or task: Not only JavaScript, but also Rust, Go, Java, AWS, DevOps, Angular, React, ASP.NET Core, Serverless, Python, Elixir, Data Science etc.<p>If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, fill out the form linked below.
