When I&#x27;m off my meds I&#x27;m angry and mean and constantly frustrated by how slowly everything moves.  I enjoy being able to relax and take things easier due to this stimulant.  But I think that&#x27;s a big problem with over prescription of stimulants, a lot of folks that get put on them don&#x27;t need them and don&#x27;t respond to them in the intended manner - but healthcare is such that no one ever takes them off of them and tries other approaches.')
