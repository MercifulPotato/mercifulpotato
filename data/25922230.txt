It&#x27;s basically a PAPR built from hospital grade filters. If you are interested, go take a look: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.viralhelmets.com&#x2F;15-hoodie-viral-helmet" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.viralhelmets.com&#x2F;15-hoodie-viral-helmet</a><p>I run the non-commercial site <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;viralhelmets.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;viralhelmets.com</a>.<p>DETAILS &#x2F; WHY I&#x27;M POSTING<p>I saw a lot of people pwning the $199 and $300 viral helmets that have come out. (see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25848412" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25848412</a>)  Yeah, at those price points, it doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>The $15 design actually comes out of about 1000+ hours of engineering work (see bunnyPAPR.org). We tried to get interest to commercialize and get certified (NIOSH&#x2F;FDA). But medical certification in the US is a nightmare and hospitals are slow.  We couldn&#x27;t get much interest or backers.<p>So, I&#x27;m releasing the key parts of our research as a $15 free-to-build plan.<p>THE FILTERS MATTER\nOne big difference is that we use hospital-sourced PFT and HMEF filters. We don&#x27;t trust the supply chains that are pumping out special purpose filters for &quot;fad&quot; mask designs. After the fake&#x2F;underperforming KN95 scandals in April&#x2F;May, we stuck with supply chains that existed before COVID.  The Stanford pneumask and maskson.org projects took a similar approach.<p>UPTAKE&#x2F; MARKET FIT\nWe tried approaching some nursing home, school districts, and hospitals about this. They are so inundated by snake oil vendors, they weren&#x27;t very interested in being a beta tester. Same with CDC... inundated. &lt;shrug&gt;<p>We do have a few doctors using these, but not publicizing it.<p>CODA\nViral Helmets could protect all wearers. Could end the pandemic. But, that&#x27;s a hard sell since they are so &quot;untested&quot;. (Though we use PFT and HMEF filters in surgery, and PAPRs in biohazard scenarios... &lt;shrug&gt;)<p>*Not technically &quot;open source&quot;.
