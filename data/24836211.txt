I&#x27;ve always shied away from implementing notifications to not bother users. However I keep a passive activity stream for users to check for any engagements on their post and that is it. No notification bubbles or even emails.<p>I noticed HN doesn&#x27;t have a notification. I got into the habit of checking for activity by clicking `threads` too. I&#x27;m expecting to do the same on my application, but not sure if people will be able to get it.<p>What do you think about this?')
