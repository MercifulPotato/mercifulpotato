The coffee beans I used to buy through pantry would have a typical expiry date - 18-24 months out.<p>Once that product moved to normal Amazon, it transitioned to the standard jobbers and hucksters... youâ€™d buy a can of coffee whose best by date was 30 days out.<p>I think this segment is really being replaced by Whole Foods,  it is somewhat constrained by the more limited selection of Whole Foods vs normal grocery.<p>Also, I think Amazon is getting a run for its money with Target and to a lesser extent Walmart. The target drive-up service in particular is best in class. Every mom is hooked to it, and you see people waiting for drive up orders ordering more in the car.')
