Item(by='ethagknight', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604581301, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24996631, text='Yea that was my reaction. maybe, maybe not. I just decided to move along. I know it’s uncouth and against the rules to comment on downvotes on HN but, for the first time for me, I seem to have been downvoted several times here on HN in the last couple weeks. I can’t shake the feeling that I’m receiving downvotes as people want to suppress different views on certain issues. My comments here are substantive and thoughtful, I read this article, have discussed Nate’s projections at length with friends and have read all Taleb’s books except his latest. My initial comment may be wrong &#x2F; worthy of rebuttal, but it’s not downvote wrong. (DanG- I won’t comment on downvotes again! Sorry!)')
