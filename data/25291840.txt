Then the same applies to someone saying #KillAllWomen. We either judge everybody by the same standard, or not at all. Everything else is sexist (or racist, in the case of race, and so on).<p>By the way, personally I don&#x27;t care about somebody saying &quot;KillAllX&quot; regardless of who that X is, when it&#x27;s used in hyperbole. The problem is that, with some people, context gets disregarded. &quot;KillAllMen&quot; doesn&#x27;t <i>really</i> mean actually killing them, but if someone said &quot;KillAllWomen&quot; all of twitter would be arguing that they totally definitely absolutely one hundred percent meant it literally and should be imprisoned.')
