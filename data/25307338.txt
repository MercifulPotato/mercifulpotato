It&#x27;s sort of a geopolitical power move for them, plus they don&#x27;t have enough people domestically with the virus to run clinical trials anymore.<p>As well, there&#x27;s less of a potential PR-hangup for a Chinese company if they have to grease the local wheels with some cash &#x27;donations,&#x27; whereas Pfizer and Moderna probably wouldn&#x27;t want to be caught bribing people in the context of a clinical trial (I used to work for a Chinese immunodiagnostics company that did business in the developing world. It&#x27;s just how things work some places if you want to enter a market and don&#x27;t have the right political connections).<p>It&#x27;s not Africa-focused particularly, but they&#x27;re running tons of clinical trials across the developing world, and will give these countries early-access that they would not otherwise have with the Western vaccines.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencemag.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;global-push-covid-19-vaccines-china-aims-win-friends-and-cut-deals" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencemag.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;global-push-covid-19...</a>')
