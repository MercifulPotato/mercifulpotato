It contains a very basic index.html, a python script to scrape wikipedia on a cron hourly, and store the result in a file, which my flask app serves to the index.html.<p>I served my index.html on netlify which setup https, but I wasn&#x27;t able to get an nginx server up and running to setup a https connection to the server, so the browser is complaining. Alas, it was a fun Friday night project. Coffee and Python, a solid duo.')
