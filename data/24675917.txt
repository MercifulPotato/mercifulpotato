Other commenters have pointed out that Mars is rather distinctly orange&#x2F;red, and easily visible in the skies of North America now.<p>One example between stars right now is the two brightest stars in the constellation Orion. Where I am, in Indiana, USA, Orion rises around midnight EDT (~0400 UTC) tonight. It will rise earlier is you are east of me, and will rise earlier as we get into northern-hemisphere winter.<p>Betelgeuse (pronounced like the movie &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, but with &quot;bay&quot; instead of &quot;bee&quot;) is Orion&#x27;s right shoulder. Since he is facing towards us, it is the star in the top-left of the constellation. Betelgeuse is a red supergiant, so it is both distinctly bright and distinctly red when compared to the other stars in Orion.<p>The star I like to compare Betelgeuse to is Rigel, Orion&#x27;s left knee (bottom-right from our point of view).Rigel is a blue supergiant, similarly bright to Betelgeuse.<p>Here&#x27;s an <i>excellent</i> color-enhanced mosaic image of the constellation by Rogelio Bernal Andreo, which clearly shows the red-orange-ness of Betelgeuse compared to the other stars in the constellation:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;4&#x2F;47&#x2F;Orion_Head_to_Toe.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;4&#x2F;47&#x2F;Orion_He...</a><p>More information about the image can be found here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apod.nasa.gov&#x2F;apod&#x2F;ap101023.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apod.nasa.gov&#x2F;apod&#x2F;ap101023.html</a><p>To the naked eye, I (and other typically-sighted people) can distinguish these colors easily when looking for them. Their color ranges from red&#x2F;orange to white to sort of sky-blue. This is because starlight is black-body radiation, which creates a very specific scale of colors. Here is an image showing the typical colors of stars, and their corresponding surface temperatures:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Black-body_radiation#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:Color_temperature_black_body_800-12200K.svg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Black-body_radiation#&#x2F;media&#x2F;Fi...</a><p>Rest assured that to me, at a glance, stars are just bright white dots. Even knowing that the colors are there, I still have to stop for a second and <i>look</i> at them in order to see it.')
