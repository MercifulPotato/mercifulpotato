That war plays out like clock work every budgetary period.<p>Trump&#x27;s last minute monkey-wrench was really interesting for a whole slew of reasons beyond the scope of this, the flip-flop was crystal clear among the commenting proles.<p>The evidence, is of course that &#x27;large stimulus checks&#x27; had been pushed by the Dems for months (!) leading up to the final negotiations, and nobody thought they were a good idea until &#x27;Trump Said It&#x27;.')
