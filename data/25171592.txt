I&#x27;ve heard it referred to as &quot;geek knitting&quot;, and sitting in the garage for a few hours, carefully soldering together custom keyboards while listening to music is a great way to relax and focus. I just looked up some basic tutorials, got a few start kits from Amazon and just went with it.<p>This has lead to other interests too, like learning more about electronics and low-level coding with micro-controllers.<p>It also has the benefit that our kids now see me as someone who can fix anything. Most toys are simple enough to repair with basic tools and hearing the phrase &quot;daddy can fix it&quot; is worth it. Also there&#x27;s a slight hope that seeing physical\nSTEM skills (as opposed to daddy typing into a computer all day for work) makes an impression and it perks their interest in general engineering pursuits as they get older.')
