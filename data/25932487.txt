They all take the form of underestimating a person&#x27;s &quot;intelligence&quot; or &quot;worth&quot; based on that person&#x27;s understanding of one aspect of one system, e.g. computer virus vectors (&quot;only stupid people get viruses&quot;), social engineering (&quot;only stupid people fall for phone scams&quot;), etc. It&#x27;s poisonous, and pretty obviously immoral, but most of all, it&#x27;s indicative of ignorance. Experience with people will demonstrate that this sentiment, even stripped of its hatefulness, just isn&#x27;t factually true.')
