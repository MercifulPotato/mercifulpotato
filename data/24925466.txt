We had an influx of 100,000+ students from all over the country, with the completely predictable outcome that cases skyrocketed in the space of a week of their arrival.<p>We&#x27;ve now been put in the government&#x27;s &quot;Very High&quot; risk tier which, on paper, means pretty much a new localised lockdown... except all the schools and universities are still open. And all the bars and pubs have to close... unless they give you a plate of chips with your pint. And you have to wear a mask in public buildings and on public transport... unless it would &#x27;distress&#x27; you to do so.<p>Either don&#x27;t do lockdown at all, or do it properly. These half-arsed &quot;total lockdown... except... except.. except...&quot; are just going to keep things dragging on indefinitely')
