Think about it. It&#x27;s so mindboggling. But then again, I felt that amazon was a gigantic bubble forever too.<p>I&#x27;ve said it before and I&#x27;ll say it again: at this point tesla is going to be spectacular one way or another. It&#x27;s been bid up to such an extreme degree that it can&#x27;t tread water. So in 2030, we&#x27;ll look back and be amazed at what Tesla has become no matter what.')
