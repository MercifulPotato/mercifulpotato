I disagree and think for a user it&#x27;s great to have your visualizations and transformations work seamlessly.<p>My memory of Vega was that it mixed data transform code with vis code. So I didn&#x27;t have like a dplyr + ggplot2 combo. I thought design wise that was a mistake, because nailing the transforms from an edge case and performance perspective is hard and doing it 2x doesn&#x27;t make sense to me. So decoupling the vis code from the data engine I think is better.<p>But I took a fresh look at the Vega repo and it is indeed nicely decoupled, and the transforms look usable standalone. So maybe it sort of already has the Dplyr+GGPlot2 style decoupled architecture that I thought Arquero would bring.<p>I had thought of Vega as &quot;a monolith for datavis&quot;, but now looks like there&#x27;s lots of smaller usable packages in there.')
