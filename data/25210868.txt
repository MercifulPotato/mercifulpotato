I was primarily thinking of my own work development environment in macOS but comparing that to Linux is perfectly valid. Again though, I didn’t mean to say, “I bet you can’t name a single program that doesn’t use the Internet!”  I just meant to point out that programs using the Internet are probably a fairly considerable majority for most regular users.<p>I use KeepassXC on macOS and it definitely does check for updates. Does it not do that on Linux?')
