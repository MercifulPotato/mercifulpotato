That was uncalled for.<p>I think Sniffoy made some valid points but I don&#x27;t think they support his premise that &quot;Building circuits is neat, but [...] this has some problems as a game&quot;. Sure there are things that could be improved but I don&#x27;t think they take away from the game. I mean you said you did all of the levels with optimizations and enjoyed it. You didn&#x27;t let the subpar language stop you from enjoying it. But Sniffoy did. And I guess that rubbed me wrong - he&#x27;s blaming the game because he got hung up on a couple words.')
