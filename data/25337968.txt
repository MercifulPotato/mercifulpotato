But some of the ones I&#x27;ve been to, for internal positions no less, have been absurd ambushes.<p>I once had an interview for a front-end midlevel position. I had some prior front-end experience in another framework, but mostly worked on midteir and vendor products. I was notified the morning of my interview that it wasn&#x27;t just a regular interview but a code screen and I could use any language&#x2F;tools&#x2F;etc that I wanted. I got there and found out that was not the case - he was not following HR&#x27;s procedures. So he hands me a Mac (which I&#x27;m not familiar with), tells me to use Angular (which I&#x27;ve never used), in Webstorm (I played around with it once), and tells me to build a page to upload a CSV file and display the contents in a table on the page. I have 30 minutes to do it, and then I&#x27;ll get 30 minutes to dress it up in CSS. Needless to say, I bombed it. I was sort of impressed with myself that I had it <i>almost</i> functional,  but yet ashamed at my abysmal evaluation. He said I didn&#x27;t do well and that he was looking for an expert. Shouldn&#x27;t you open a senior posting if you want an expert? I asked him why he gave me an interview if my resume listed none of the technologies, with my cover letter stating that I was looking for a change and wanted to <i>learn new technologies</i>. His answer was that maybe I knew the tech from personal projects. I had Android personal projects listed on my resume, so why would I have left off other ones more pertainate to the position? My guess is he was too lazy to read <i>and understand</i> the resume and cover letter, not to mention ignoring HR&#x27;s instructions. What a waste of both our time (moreso mine since he was on his laptop most of the time).')
