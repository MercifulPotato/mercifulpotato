Its quite sad really, 20 years ago, any one of the headlines from this year would have prompted sanctions and denunciations...<p>I don&#x27;t think so. Nothing happened with Tibet, or after the Tiananmen Square event AFAIK.<p>20 years ago, the people that signed all the trade deals with countries such as China claimed it would lead to improving democracy and human rights there, obviously, it didn&#x27;t, People&#x27;s Republic of China has never been more autocratic. Ethical and moral concerns should have been addressed when China joined the WTO in 2001, irregardless China&#x27;s political structure. China got a very good deal, western industrials as well, but at what human cost?<p>I wasn&#x27;t interested in economy at the time, but I still remember clearly debates on talkshows between human rights advocates and people pushing trade deals and their arguments, it was a time where you could still publicly talk about the situation in Tibet. Today? Nobody would even dare.')
