If your argument is not that the new review process is unreasonable, just that people were hired under the expectation that there would be none, then I get where you&#x27;re coming from but it doesn&#x27;t sound very likely to me.</i><p>Here is my steelman position: I think the objection is that the old internal review was reasonable, and while the argument can be made that the new one does not seem <i>un</i>reasonable to many people under the principle of &quot;don&#x27;t bite the hand that feeds you&quot;, it&#x27;s reasonableness in a faux-academic setting is at least debatable, and in any case it is inarguable that the new one is more restrictive than the one that was in place when these researchers were hired.<p>So, at the very least, this seems like a unilateral bait-and-switch on Google&#x27;s part. The company is now reneging on the representations made to prospective employees regarding their academic freedom.<p>&quot;I have altered the deal; pray I do not alter it any further.&quot;:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;WpE_xMRiCLE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;WpE_xMRiCLE</a>')
