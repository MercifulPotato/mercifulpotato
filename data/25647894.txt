There&#x27;s been news about exchanges getting hacked, or suddenly vanishing with everything over night. Obviously that&#x27;s the only kind of news you hear if you&#x27;re not dealing with crypto currency in any way so I&#x27;m biased, and tbh I don&#x27;t even know if there have been lawsuits over this and how they ended, but even then it seems a requirement to only do business with domestic exchanges like you said, to even have a chance to hold someone accountable.')
