Support among independent voters was steady at 68 percent. However, support among Republican voters declined 6 percentage points over the course of two years, from 52 percent support in 2018 to 46 percent in 2020.</i><p>I doubt you&#x27;ll find many issues as fundamentally important and with as much bi-partisan support support as Medicare For all, and no politician is ever going to <i>actually</i> try to get that passed, despite what they may claim on TV or the campaign trail.<p>I am afraid we will have to find a way to be content with the legislation that is chosen for us by the Reality TV political system we allowed to form while we weren&#x27;t paying attention.')
