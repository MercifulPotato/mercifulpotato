It could do 256 colors with lower resolution (oficially 320x200, or &quot;mode-x&quot; 320x240).<p>VGA came with 256 kB RAM onboard. Then, in the early 90&#x27;s, SVGA came with 512 kB and 1 MB onboard, and it could do 800x600, 1024x768 and 1280x1024. The main RAM would be around 4 MB for the midrange computer. It took until mid-90, that you could get 4 or 8 MB SVGA, that could also do hicolor and truecolor.')
