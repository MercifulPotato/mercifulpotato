Between CWMP and DOCSIS, I just gave up. So now I put my own NAT device&#x2F;firewall behind the router, and treat that outer 192.168.1.0 subnet, DHCP, DNS, etc as if they were public. My home network starts at _my_ router.<p>In various periods of distrust for my ISP, I have also run the external interface of my NAT through a public VPN provider, and added monitoring to look for connection slowdowns or open ports on the router, as evidence of a compromise. So far it&#x27;s just been jumping at shadows, though.')
