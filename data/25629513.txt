With Ant you can get loans in 10 seconds. He also said the global financial regulation is for countries with financial sector, and China&#x27;s problem is not about regulation, is about there is nothing to regulate.<p>The new regulation on P2P financing requires Ant to put 30% of the loans with its own money. I can see from Ant&#x27;s point of view, their loan is super safe (with all the taobao data and AliPay data collected). Ant group will create a financial entity to put its P2P business under banking regulation.<p>Another interesting thing is that Ant&#x27;s loans mostly go to TaoBao sellers (small businesses), with their data, which are super safe from their point of view. The problem is that from regulators&#x27; point of view, maybe it is not obvious or it is hard to regulate it with one exception.')
