There always is the person who is last to sell and whoever that is stands to lose the most. It&#x27;s pretty insane how sustained the rally is. You might expect it to effect prices for a day or even two thanks to the coordination until people catch on and sell, but this has been a sustained buy from various people for almost two weeks. That kind of holding power or more specifically willpower not to sell when the stock already went up 400% is what is really impressive. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if by the end of this every single person that owns GME is from WallStreetBets. It&#x27;s inevitable that at least some people from WallStreetBets gets hurt.')
