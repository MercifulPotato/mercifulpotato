Item(by='dheera', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602354482, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24740821, text='There are lots of products I need to return multiple times before I get a good copy. Like my Dell 24 inch 4K monitor. Most of Amazon&#x27;s warehouses are duds with faint grey lines across the screen, so you have to expect to order and return 3-4 times before you get a good one. The ones you return will probably of course be sent to other customers instead of getting sent back to Dell.<p>And there are the Samyang&#x2F;Rokinon camera lenses as well -- you need to usually buy 3-4, test them out and keep the sharpest copy. Quality control issues on the manufacturer&#x27;s side but it&#x27;s a good deal if you&#x27;re willing to deal with it.<p>Some sellers just suck at packaging. There are numerous products that are too easy to damage just by opening the packaging -- I received one item completely wrapped in 8 layers of bubble wrap followed by an entire coating of packing tape over 100% of it. It was nearly impossible to cut open without cutting into wires because you really don&#x27;t know where the wires are under all that packaging.')
