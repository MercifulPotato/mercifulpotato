Bitcoin has been pushed as this revolutionary thing that&#x27;s going to fundamentally change currency and payments for everyday people.  It hasn&#x27;t.  It likely won&#x27;t.  Maybe some other blockchain-based currency will at some point, but I&#x27;m skeptical of that claim.<p>Beyond that, Bitcoin as a simple store of value is an incredibly risky proposition.  Someone upthread posted a link to an article claiming that Bitcoin has been the best performing asset over the last 10 years, but that ignores the gut-wrenching volatility it&#x27;s gone through.<p>And even if you stretch to suggest that Bitcoin has been a good investment, a good investment vehicle is generally not a great currency.  If I had a $100 bill that, a week later, was worth $50, I&#x27;d be pissed.  If another week later it was worth $200, I&#x27;d be pleased, but would feel very uncomfortable thinking I can rely on that &quot;currency&quot; to continue to pay my bills over the long term.<p>I&#x27;m not saying Bitcoin has failed or that it&#x27;s useless in general, but as a generic currency replacement I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pretty weak and unreliable, mainly only suitable for use by people at the margins, people who often can&#x27;t bear the risk that Bitcoin foists upon them.')
