Nice open source library but the Redis Labs stuff is pretty much a joke, because to get the modules like graphs, JSON, search, it costs thousands of dollars. And the “source available” license is stupid, “you can’t use this” - the Open Source equivalent of “look but don’t touch” ... not to mention they have so many different pricing levels it becomes a massive decision which one to use (high friction purchase) ... but hey, it’s fast, right?<p>FaunaDB is much more compelling than Redis Enterprise because of serverless pricing, but uses some custom query language, yikes. Likewise DynamoDB has nice pricing but way complicated &#x2F; proprietary interfaces. The Cassandra service could be cool.<p>Nice benchmarks will never make up for craptastic &#x2F; complex pricing models, lame license, bad docs &#x2F; examples. Too many nerds think if they post higher numbers, it makes up for massive failure at simple business. Need more nerds who keep it simple, documented, autoscaling, easy to sign up, etc<p>The fact there is no great serverless graph db and so few viable auth services in 2020 is a shameful travesty for the industry... &lt;&#x2F;rant&gt;')
