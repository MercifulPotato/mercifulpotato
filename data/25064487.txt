I still get carded and I&#x27;ve been a legal drinker for well over 20 years.<p>Many of them don&#x27;t.<p>And this is locale-dependent. I was carded 100% of the time during a trip to Colorado last year, but I haven&#x27;t been carded except a handful of times since living in California. I&#x27;m 35.')
