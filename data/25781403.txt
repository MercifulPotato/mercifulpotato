On paper yes, but that&#x27;s not a great metric. When I think of wealth, I think of what you can reasonably acquire.<p>Exactly. Stock wealth isn&#x27;t real money because it isn&#x27;t actionable. You can&#x27;t sell all of it without crashing. All personal wealth should be measured by how much liquid cash you could get for it in a short term sale.<p>That&#x27;s also the amount you could theoretically donate towards, for example, averting a short-term humanity disaster.
