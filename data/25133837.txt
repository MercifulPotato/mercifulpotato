A subset of those would also be into anime and enable their anime search preferences (probably more particular), and some of them will also like mountaineering, pottery, and baking, and will have such preferences configured as well. Yes that might be enough to identify you (just like searching for your own name would be) but those preferences don&#x27;t need to be attached to <i>you</i>, just your query, and you could disable or enable any of them at any time.<p>It would basically be like sending a search query in this form:<p>&quot;Python importerror help --prefs={mit_cs_club, studioghiblifans_new, britains_best_baking_prefs, AlpineMountaineersIntl}&quot;<p>If you like baking, anime, and mountaineering, it&#x27;s probably convenient to leave all those active for your searches, even your purely programming-focused searches. But you could toggle some of them off if articles about &quot;helping to protect imported mountain pythons&quot; are interfering with your search results, or if you want to be more anonymous. If you&#x27;re especially paranoid you could even throw in a bunch of random preferences that don&#x27;t affect your query but do throw off attempts to profile you. You could pretty easily write a script that salts every search with a few extra random preference lists, for privacy or just for fun, and make that an additional feature. The tool doesn&#x27;t need to maintain any history of your past activity to cater to your search, so I think it would be a good thing for privacy overall.')
