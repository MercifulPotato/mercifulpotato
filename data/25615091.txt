Also, you have to maintain that knowledge for however many things you have to do across however many providers.<p>The point of Terraform isn&#x27;t to add complexity, it&#x27;s to have a general way of interacting with a vast number of APIs that&#x27;s effectively the same and to abstract away the tribal knowledge of knowing how each individual API works.<p>On the same provider version, you generally can expect Terraform to work the same over time (okay this is less true for say Google provider...) as the CLI keeps evolving.<p>It&#x27;s still helpful to understand the providers and their CLIs, but Terraform is a substantial force multipler because of how generic it is across the absurdly long list of APIs that it talks to. That is what its value is.')
