Studies suggest up to 20% of Covid cases are asymptomatic - those people wouldn&#x27;t know to follow any guidance&#x2F;regulations on isolation.<p>The basic R0 is believed to be around 5.7, so even with precautions such as social distancing, masks, and hand washing (which won&#x27;t be followed flawlessly), it&#x27;s still trying to mitigate something outstandingly infectious. You need to bring the R0 to 1.0 for the number of cases to only increase at a constant rate, as for anything above 1 every 10 cases will lead to more than 10 new cases, which compounds as it spreads.')
