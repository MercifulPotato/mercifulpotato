Do you suggest all your family members and friends have lower value than your work colleagues and it&#x27;s okay to let them suffer? Or are you saying that all unemployed people should suffer the consequences of not having coworkers?<p>See what I did here? It&#x27;s called a strawman argument. You didn&#x27;t say that, but someone on the internet could easily do that to something you said and turn it into something you didn&#x27;t say, write, or mean.<p>What I am saying is that this pandemic is taking a toll on many people and has exposed crutches we relied on before COVID. What I&#x27;m also saying is that these give us hints on what we can try to improve.')
