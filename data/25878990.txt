Retro installs maybe, yes. But new construction, which I consult heavily on, most of the developers I work with are motivated to install them. Theyâ€™re revenue sources and attract the kind of tenants they want occupying their new building.<p>The answer to retro installs (which is always about money anyway) is to not force the hand of property owners, but make the install cost a no brainer with tax rebates and subsidies. Regulation in this regard would just cause negative effects I think, IF it ever passed a public vote (Cali maybe, but not much of the rest of the country).')
