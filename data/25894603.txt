Item(by='vosper', descendants=None, kids=[25894650], score=None, time=1611514396, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25894424, text='&gt; why not just use stevia or aspartame to get the sweetness without the calories?<p>I find the aftertaste of stevia disgusting, and really long-lasting,  but when I need to sweeten something I’ve had much better luck with erythritol. It’s cheap, widely available, and seems to be safe. That said, I generally avoid sweet foods anyway, so my use of either sugar or artificial sweeteners is relatively low.<p>But if you’re doing keto and you hate stevia, as I did, try erythritol.')
