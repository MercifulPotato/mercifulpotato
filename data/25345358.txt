Nanopore is the only technology (other than Pacbio) that you can solve the indexing problem with, which MASSIVELY lowers the cost per sample. Approximately $14 down to $2, which a LOT less manual work (or a lot less robot work)<p>With plasmids, you can also train custom models to get better alignment results.<p>It’s insane that nobody else I know of is doing this, since it actually works quite well!')
