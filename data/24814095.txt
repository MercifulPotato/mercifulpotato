Or are you the only person that is not basing your worldview on misleading information (or, maybe not alone, but others very much like you)?<p>If the answer is no (and how could it be otherwise) then you start to see the problem: where is the practical distinction between people spreading misinformation and people simply disagreeing with you? In every disagreement over fact, one person is wrong. One person is basing their view on some flawed premise or information. How is banning misinformation any different, tangibly, than banning dissent?')
