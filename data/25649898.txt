They also pursue nuclear weapons. Their handling of domestic affairs is also bullshit<p>The United States does all these things too, it just has nobody big enough to sanction it.<p>For the record, I am not a fan of the Islamist Republic, but banning access to GitHub does not punish the government, it puishes civilians. It also doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it&#x27;s the U.S. who pulled out of the Iran Deal or that medicine is impacted by the sanctions too.<p>I mean the U.S. is buddy buddy with Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt etc. etc. the behavior you&#x27;re describing is clearly not the problem here.')
