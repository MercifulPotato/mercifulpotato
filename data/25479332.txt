To paint these as altruistic is just silly - there is no chance on earth they would support Snowden if his leaks were about Russia rather than about the US.<p>To paint the SolarWinds hacking as &quot;showing the world proprietary systems are dangerous&quot; is intellectually dishonest at best.<p>You are not genuinely curious. You are not genuinely asking. You do not genuinely wonder if there is altruism involved.<p>GTFO with your doublespeak.')
