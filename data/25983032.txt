For example, set aside 20% of your assets in a savings account, maybe even some type of account where it&#x27;s not that easy to cash out, to limit the temptation of dipping into it. Then, as your assets grow (if they do), at various thresholds, you set aside preset amounts of money. This way, if you &quot;lose it all&quot; one day, you don&#x27;t get to &quot;walk instead of taking the metro&quot;, you get to afford a down payment for a smaller apartment instead of a bigger one.')
