I needed a tool like this, but also, I wanted to learn aside from my day job. \nThe project has been growing since then, and now, I know that I can create a business around it. \nI also get a lot of support or feature requests. So I kind of feel like I have to continue working on it (that&#x27;s the &quot;duty&quot; part :) ). \nFinally, I am very passionate about development, which helps a lot. \nThese are probably the three things that motivate me to work on this project.<p>Still, having a family with two kids, working during the evenings is not easy at all. What I tried was to set realistic, small goals. One feature at a time, one task after the other. Not trying to overdo it (most of the time).\nI also know that having only one to two productive hours in the evening, I need to be extra focused and avoid phony work. I try to ask myself &quot;why?&quot;, for each task. What is my goal? How does doing this specific task serves it? Thus, I manage to avoid working on useless things or procrastinating. With more or less success.<p>Having said all this, I still nearly burned out last September. Next month I will go full time on the project. It&#x27;s a big bet, and it&#x27;s partly about reclaiming my sanity and my free time.\nSo, your question is definitely not an easy one to answer!<p>(My side project: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mockoon.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mockoon.com</a>)')
