Some provinces of Canada prohibit such discrimination (in e.g. employment) but some don&#x27;t. As another example, German constitution at the very beginning (Article 3, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gesetze-im-internet.de&#x2F;englisch_gg&#x2F;englisch_gg.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gesetze-im-internet.de&#x2F;englisch_gg&#x2F;englisch_gg.h...</a>) asserts anti-discrimination for, among other things, political opinion.<p>Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 2 asserts that these rights shall apply &quot; without distinction of [...] political or other opinion&quot;, and European Convention of Human Rights Article 14 explicitly prohibits discrimination based on &quot;political or other opinions&quot;, which has also been applied by European Court of Human Rights in e.g. Redfearn v United Kindgom [2012] ECHR 1878.<p>That would forbid (for example) employers to fire people just because they were active members of Proud Boys or Antifa or the Communist party or KKK or whatever. However, IMHO this would not prohibit practical censorship of political opinions (free speech is not a core human right in either of these two declarations), it would still allow platforms to set rules for messages on their platform and kick out people who violate these rules - it would just disallow them to kick out people for <i>having</i> a political affiliation that they&#x27;re expressing outside of that platform, but that&#x27;s not what was happening here.')
