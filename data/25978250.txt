It&#x27;s only criminal when it&#x27;s done for commercial purpose with financial gain which is clearly not the case here.<p><i>US Copyright laws</i>, sure, this statement is correct. In some countries (especially in Europe and Asia) however, this is pretty much the opposite.<p>(Point noted however that Mr. Kelly is probably American, which assuming you&#x27;re American will be subjected to U.S. IP laws, especially DMCA provisions. Since that this is unprotected, DMCA circumvention is out and this infringement would be only a crime if this was specifically filed in court, and even them it might be argued that this is more of a civil lawsuit than a criminal lawsuit.)')
