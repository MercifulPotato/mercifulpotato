[0] Reconcile.<p>&gt; There are a number of countries that proved it doesn&#x27;t have to be futile - it&#x27;s just futile if people don&#x27;t do right by each other.<p>No, there aren&#x27;t.<p>There is not a single place on planet Earth where any of the COVID statistics showed any improvement after enacting a mask mandate or a lockdown.<p>That&#x27;s because neither masks nor lockdowns work.<p>Everyone wore masks during the BLM&#x2F;Antifa direct action that took place all throughout NYC in April and May. It led to a notable increase in infections. We can&#x27;t have it both ways - we can&#x27;t say the masks work AND that protesting during the pandemic was safe. If protesting during the pandemic WAS safe, then we don&#x27;t need lockdowns or mask mandates. Sorry to burst your bubble. Just like the GOP partisans in 2002&#x2F;2003 who yelled &quot;support the troops&quot; because they had their Republican identity tied to supporting a terrible war, you have fallen into the &quot;follow the science&quot; camp and appear to be doing everything you can to defend your chosen political identity in the face of overwhelming contrary facts.<p>Just remember: you&#x27;ve got to be a pretty intelligent person. People will be coming to you for greater understanding about these complex times, and you could be a source of immense truth-telling and could help restore a lot of happiness in peoples&#x27; lives. Right now, you&#x27;re filling them with dread - and it&#x27;s totally unnecessary. I impore you to consider re-examining your understanding of these issues. Watch &amp; read all the banned materials that tear these notions apart.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mediaite.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;whopping-84-percent-of-americans-wearing-coronavirus-masks-but-how-many-trump-fans-are&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mediaite.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;whopping-84-percent-of-america...</a>')
