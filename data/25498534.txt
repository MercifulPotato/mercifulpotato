But instead of as HTML its in a custom format (I&#x27;m guessing something very similar to virtual dom representation of a component).\nBut they are better than static HTML rendering because the components can maintain state even though parts of it are rendered on the server. \nI&#x27;m very excited for this and I&#x27;m just beginning to build a POC for Next.js from tomorrow. May be when this becomes stable we&#x27;ll be able to use it via Next.js.')
