This is essentially the Meteor architecture.<p>Synchronization is non-trivial and the storage abstraction options come down to NoSQL JSON document stores, GraphQL, and SQL. Browsers support IndexedDB while native iOS&#x2F;Android support SQLite. Iâ€™m not aware of any decent solution that synchronizes a relational database with client-side SQLite.<p>I too would prefer a SQLite Sync solution that just works and SQLite in the browser available from Service Workers but it is what it is.')
