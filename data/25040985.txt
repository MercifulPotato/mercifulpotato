You could get it repaired by LG (often free, even after warranty), but you&#x27;d still be out a phone for about 10 days and it came back wiped (IIRC), and then you&#x27;re still going to worry about it.<p>I&#x27;d consider another Google phone, but I just don&#x27;t trust them to have designed and implemented a phone that&#x27;s going to last as long as a phone of that price should last. From the latest round of phones though, motorola seems good enough, except the vibration is very hard to miss unless it&#x27;s on a table; nokia has bluetooth problems with one of my cars and isn&#x27;t pushing a fix worldwide, even though some countries have had the fix for months; ugh.')
