A model in the cloud is protected. Stored locally, that same model is potential shareware. If you&#x27;re seeking to maximize the number of true positive diagnoses, then a viable business with low marginal costs is a better bet than an open, stagnant research model. Further, as others have noted, this information may already be stored widely in other clouds due to patient post-diagnosis search and browsing activity. Thus, adding another surface is only a linear change to the patient&#x27;s privacy. Put simply, the incremental privacy change to the end user here may be worth it.')
