Item(by='tialaramex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611752799, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25925575, text='We see some pretty nasty ship Minds, e.g. one of the protagonists of Surface Detail, <i>Falling Outside The Normal Moral Constraints</i> is by its own admission psychotic. But it <i>is</i> a warship, and Veppers is, in fact, making war albeit one he can&#x27;t hope to win.<p>But we also see some that are much nicer, the <i>Bora Horza Gobuchul</i> takes a very balanced outlook on events and on its namesake; the <i>Sleeper Service</i> cares very much about just one pregnant woman even if it also has other reasons to be doing what it is doing; the <i>Lasting Damage</i> organises much of the events of Look to Windward, including a lovely music festival to celebrate its own death.<p>Writing about Utopia is hard, and Banks mostly avoids doing so. We see only fleeting glimpses, a woman&#x27;s apparent rejection from her chosen career, a game player&#x27;s frustration at not being the very best, a spoiled girl who wants an adventure she isn&#x27;t prepared for. They&#x27;re character backdrops, not focuses.<p>I think the Gaiman run of Miracleman (Miracleman, in some places and times called Marvelman, was a comic book, historically a pulpy knock-off, then made into something quite extraordinary by Alan Moore, and then Gaiman took over for an aborted run last century) is the best treatment of Utopia in fiction I&#x27;ve read.<p>Gaiman&#x27;s completed &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Miracleman zooms in on the brief period after Miracleman defeats the Adversary and before things go sour. This is an age of enlightened absolute government, nuclear weapons are destroyed (&quot;teleported into the sun&quot;), poverty and homelessness are eliminated, there&#x27;s wind power and something equivalent to the Internet, even the dead can be brought back after a fashion. But nevertheless, people are still people. The stories follow a woman whose husband is cheating on her, what has been done with all the now redundant spies, school children rebelling against... whatever you&#x27;ve got. Miracleman himself appears rarely, and his daughter gets one issue, sort of, through a story-within-a-story that allows Gaiman to sidestep the conventions of comic books.')
