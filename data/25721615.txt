I&#x27;m just saying many of the comments, I won&#x27;t pretend I know &quot;most&quot; let alone all.<p>It&#x27;s too late to stop the violence that&#x27;s already happened. That&#x27;s cheap and I don&#x27;t like it but it&#x27;s true sadly. There are real questions to be asked why the FBI weren&#x27;t all over this from day 1. They need to be asked because it&#x27;s (literally) their job to prevent this.<p>Im just suggesting really that we make the system work as it&#x27;s meant to:  FBI investigates, people plotting violence are intercepted before they commit it. Even if they are <i>right wing</i> nuts.<p>Im also pretty convinced parler isn&#x27;t &quot;responsible&quot; in the sense that if it didn&#x27;t exist there wouldn&#x27;t have been violence (that doesn&#x27;t excuse them for profiting off it). It would have been coordinate on r&#x2F;TheDonald or via Facebook or twitter or wherever. Parler wasn&#x27;t even a thing for most of the last 4 years and this has been brewing at least that long in my opinion. That&#x27;s actually why I would like the idea of prevention. Banning parler gives us all an excuse to go back to sleep till next time and then (again) say &quot;how did this happen?&quot;.<p>Thanks for listing to my rant!')
