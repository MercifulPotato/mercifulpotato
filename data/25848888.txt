Out of curiosity I strung one &quot;buyer&quot; along to see how much they would offer and they quoted $0.20 per user. With the amount of money being thrown about, as sad as it is, it&#x27;s no surprise that some devs end up selling out their users.<p>In my opinion extensions have to be one of the worst sources of spyware these days. I am now extremely conservative with what extensions I use, and definitely would only use extensions from open source projects or companies that I trust.<p>Something needs to change. As long as extensions have such weak sandboxing along with such poor app review, Google&#x2F;Mozilla etc will keep willingly shipping spyware unbeknownst to their users.<p>At least some mechanism of creating and verifying reproducible builds would go a long way.')
