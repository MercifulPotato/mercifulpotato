Write more books instead! Heck, write more tweets, if you prefer!&quot;) made me think of Neil Gaiman&#x27;s blog post [1] about George RR Martin:<p>&gt; George R.R. Martin is not your bitch.<p>&gt; This is a useful thing to know, perhaps a useful thing to point out when you find yourself thinking that possibly George is, indeed, your bitch, and should be out there typing what you want to read right now.<p>&gt; People are not machines. Writers and artists aren&#x27;t machines.<p>&gt; You&#x27;re complaining about George doing other things than writing the books you want to read as if your buying the first book in the series was a contract with him: that you would pay over your ten dollars, and George for his part would spend every waking hour until the series was done, writing the rest of the books for you.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journal.neilgaiman.com&#x2F;2009&#x2F;05&#x2F;entitlement-issues.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journal.neilgaiman.com&#x2F;2009&#x2F;05&#x2F;entitlement-issues.ht...</a>')
