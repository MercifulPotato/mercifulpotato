It seems to be more focused on extracting money than on being an actual good product. Signing up and seeing it just confirmed that for me. It&#x27;s not even optimized for mobile screens.<p>I&#x27;d be fine to pay such amount if the app was polished and had great UX. Not arguing with what you stated.<p>Seems like this is a common thing people need and I too tried to make an app for this. I gave up on it because the complexity grew fast, but my plan was to release it for free and have some sort of premium. I wanted to have a good product first before asking for money.')
