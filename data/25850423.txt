Before that we used XMPP (ejabberd + spark + XMPP.framework etc) and eventually decided to build a totally different architecture: one focused on syncing conversation history, rather than sending instant messages.  I don&#x27;t think it dilutes or splits the thin developer community: instead it&#x27;s increased interest in open comms enormously (as well as helping spur the XMPP community into improving their stuff).  Just as Linux didn&#x27;t somehow destroy BSD.')
