It <i>was</i> my approach to end my session by considering all the issues the learners did not understand; and to review them again.<p>However, this causes them to be aware of the limitations of the learning, and to frustrate them again with whatever was too complex. And thereby evaluate me lower.<p>Now I am forced into a &#x27;review&#x27; which convinces them they have learnt something (true), only because that feeling of accomplishment is better for the eval. It isnt better <i>for them</i>.')
