Some people just underestimate flu, as if it&#x27;s something not dangerous.<p><i>&gt; that the pandemic was faked</i><p>Technically all pandemics are faked, because what is and isn&#x27;t pandemic is more or less an arbitrary decision made by some official purely for propaganda and obedience reasons. It doesn&#x27;t actually matter if it&#x27;s called pandemic or not.<p><i>&gt; how the rejection of evidence and conspiracy-theorizing are harmful</i><p>Evidence based reasoning is not much different from superstition, it could be just as harmful as rejecting evidence to whatever you think rejecting evidence is harmful. To illustrate how faulty that reasoning is, here you are rejecting evidence that there was a literal conspiracy against general population with some officials and institutions telling people that masks don&#x27;t work, an evidence they are liars, but somehow you don&#x27;t want to consider that evidence in your evidence-based reasoning and suggest that others should not reject evidence from liars.<p>Of course you can&#x27;t just accept evidence if you want something more than a superstition level decision making. For that you need to actually think and calculate, with all those base rates and probabilities, use something like bayesian reasoning or whatever, do some science. Even just quickly estimating this is still better than &quot;accepting evidence&quot;.')
