Azul&#x27;s pivot to software only solutions came on the shoulders of Intel&#x27;s VT instruction set, which allows, among other things, for nesting of virtual memory. The Azul JVM essentially behaves as a VM.<p>[ETA] and some of the other GCs now leverage the vast open space of 64 bit addressing to alias memory addresses to give references 2 or 3 flavors, and use that to coordinate parallel GC activities.')
