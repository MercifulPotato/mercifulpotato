I think the point still stands if you include the time of the radiologist and tech, capital and employment costs for MRI in the US are substantial.<p>I agree that it is a very strange comparison between MRI and a plane, I was just chiming in on the capital and employment cost for each could be comparable on a per trip basis, not that MRI prices are where they should be.<p>In my personal opinion, a major problem with US healthcare is a race to the top, where the newest and best care is sought irrespective of the price. A judgement call needs to made somewhere on cost&#x2F;marginal benefit, and post-procedure reimbursement debates is the worst way to do it. CT machines can cost between 250K and 14 million, as I mentioned in a sibling post. Similarly, MRI costs can range from $170-$5,500 [1]. In the current system, almost nobody is incentivized to keep costs down. Doctors and insured patients want the best care, as costs are externalized to the insurance pool. Insurance companies want to maximize costs, because their profit margin is limited by a % of spending.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;turquoise.health&#x2F;service_offerings?q=MRI&amp;location=90210&amp;sort=cost&amp;page=1&amp;distance=" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;turquoise.health&#x2F;service_offerings?q=MRI&amp;location=90...</a>')
