The redesign is absolute garbage.<p>People have ben telling them this for years. They know and do not give a shit or at the very least they are powerless to do anything. The redesign is so bad I&#x27;ll stop using reddit completely if they ever kill the old domain. Its almost like they intentionally tried to make the least functional website possible.')
