I hear software folks say this sort of thing somewhat frequently, but I haven&#x27;t heard it from a _legal_ person. And my general sense and understanding is that although an FAQ style clarification is not _perfect_, it _does_ carry non-trivial weight.<p>Judges are not totally capricious people making arbitrary decisions: the notion that in a dispute they would just cast aside one party&#x27;s _clear and well documented intent_ to narrow the scope of the burden they place on another is... well, it doesn&#x27;t seem all that credible to me.<p>Of course by the time you get to that point in a legal dispute you&#x27;re already in some trouble.<p>But IDK, I&#x27;m just a software person speculating. Is there a legal person interested in giving their &quot;not legal advice&quot; perspective on this?')
