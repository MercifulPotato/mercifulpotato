E.g. Windows vs Linux viruses &#x2F; trojans - I&#x27;m not sure if Linux is so much more secure to justify the difference.<p>Also new tech stacks typically evolve faster and are quicker to fix bugs. It is much faster to fix a problem in a young, less complex product, without having to deal with things like technical debt, backwards compatibility with millions of apps or endless discussions between committers about how it should be fixed.')
