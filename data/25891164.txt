For many people the main reason to go into the office is to meet other people on your team. The more they choose to work from home, the less their team members are incentivized to leave home. I&#x27;ve seen this cycle lead to everyone working from home all the time.<p>Organizations can try to set policies to avoid this, e.g. require everyone to be in the office Tuesday through Thursday. But then you start to wonder why you&#x27;re paying for office space that you only use 3 days a week. You can try to save the money with hot-desking etc but that has its own effects.')
