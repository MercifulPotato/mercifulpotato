Item(by='kelnos', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605648288, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25128348, text='&gt; <i>At least 34,803 of the address change requests, or 28%, were to new addresses within San Francisco</i><p>So... not quite the &gt;100k number that the article starts off with.<p>Also not clear if there&#x27;s any data being considered about people moving into SF from outside.  Yes, I expect this to be a smaller number, but it&#x27;s still irresponsible to breathlessly talk about an exodus without factoring it in.<p>So looks like the total &quot;exodus&quot; is less than 89,328.  Which... is that a lot?  No data on a similar period for last year, so nothing to compare it to.<p>And just not sure why this matters?  It&#x27;s been pretty obvious to those of us here that a lot of people have been leaving during the pandemic, mostly people who&#x27;ve had to be here for work (and no longer need to be), but either never wanted to live here, or wanted to but have found the cost not to be worth it.  I will not shed a tear for the people who never wanted to live here.  For the people for whom it&#x27;s a stretch to afford living here but want to, that genuinely sucks, and we still have a lot of work to do to fix that, pandemic or not.<p>But it&#x27;s not like the city&#x27;s population or housing market is collapsing.  Rents have dropped, but they&#x27;re still unaffordably high for a lot of people.  Home sale prices have mostly held up.  There&#x27;s a lot of worrying around commercial real estate, and I think that&#x27;s a legitimate thing to worry about, but I don&#x27;t think the sky is falling just yet.')
