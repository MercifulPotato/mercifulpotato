Digital tools remain sub-par as replacements for direct human contact &#x2F; communication, and that isn&#x27;t likely to change soon.  (Mayyyyyybe mixed reality will finally make a dent here, but meaningful computer-supported collaboration is still a very active area of academic research.  Haven&#x27;t found any tool that comes close to the fluency and reliability of a quick huddle around a whiteboard.)  As others have noted, there&#x27;s also a lot of investment in commercial space - so there will be economic &#x2F; political pressure to return to office work.<p>Will this happen in 2021?  No idea.  Some workplaces have announced full-remote until mid-2021 at the very least, and any cure &#x2F; vaccine will take time to fully study, productionize, and distribute.  It might take a few years to fully return, and there may be a slightly higher proportion of WFH even after that.<p>For a historical perspective: consider that humanity has weathered <i>catastrophic</i> pandemics before, and look to what happened there in the longer term.  This time around, we have the further advantage of much better medicine &#x2F; logistics than, say, during the 1918 flu.  (We also, of course, have both the advantages and disadvantages that come with much faster communications channels.)<p>2. Absolutely not!  By working from home, I&#x27;m taking on additional office-related expenses that would normally be paid for, plus expenses related specifically to remote work (e.g. webcams).  If anything, I&#x27;d expect the company to help cover those expenses, and&#x2F;or bump my salary up to compensate for added setup and logistics on my end (or even just to reflect the reduced overhead on their end - if they save money having me work at home, why shouldn&#x27;t I see some of that?)')
