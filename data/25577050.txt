Well, that&#x27;s up for debate and I think I&#x27;d enjoy hearing pros and cons.<p>Some cons I could think of are:<p>* These are inmates, serving a sentence as punishment for a crime they were convicted of.<p>* Most of their living expenses are already provided.<p>* Alternatives include doing nothing all day instead of a job.<p>* If inmate labor cost what non-inmate labor costs, why would anyone hire inmates?<p>* The labor programs are largely voluntary.<p>* The money earned is used as a reward for participation, good behavior, and showing a willingness to work and get along with other inmates. Misbehave and you don&#x27;t get to work, and don&#x27;t earn money.<p>Now maybe it is time to step up some sort of minimum wage for inmates... but that doesn&#x27;t distract from atrocities the CCP is committing in present day.')
