Item(by='CarelessExpert', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604003869, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24935040, text='&gt; Ironically, I canâ€™t actually read this blog post because it has become unavailable. I suspect that undermines his entire point.<p>I know people are really enjoying dunking on this guy for his web service outage, but I really don&#x27;t think this is the right takeaway.<p>On this topic specifically he notes:<p>&gt; All major commercial services such as reddit, Facebook and so forth keep everything a secret that is not ultimately necessary to use their services. Their software is a secret, they don&#x27;t offer open APIs or only very crippled ones, you don&#x27;t have the possibility to get to the raw data. So no luck there. You do have a lock-in situation.<p>This is an issue, not of availability, but of <i>control</i>.<p>Yeah, okay, his blog might be experiencing an outage right now.  But he can move it.  He can shift the content to another medium.  He can back it up and retain ownership over it.  As he very rightly points out:<p>&gt; without very good support for data export, service duplication, open standards, any content you provide in closed web-based services will be lost just as MySpace already lost twelve years of content just so, just to mention one big example.<p>But, hey, let&#x27;s ignore that and joke about his blog being down.  After all, who doesn&#x27;t enjoy a little schadenfreude from time to time, right?')
