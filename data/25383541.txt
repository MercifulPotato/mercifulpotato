I wish just like DxOMark Score for mobile cameras, there is a Search result quality index that makes us take more informative decisions (not sure how feasible is that though).<p>P.S. - I realize even DxOMark scores and ranks may be disputed, but that&#x27;s still <i>one</i> (close to objective) index and it&#x27;s used just as an example here.')
