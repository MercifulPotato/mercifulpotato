Both Twitter and Instagram started pushing non-chronological sorting on previously chronological feeds in 2016. This is a transparent effort to take advantage of the slot-machine-addiction of reward and disappointment brought about by a refresh of content -- requiring you to refresh the page and load more ad impressions. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I tried to use facebook&#x27;s search feature, but eneded up scrolling down the timeline trying to find a post I saw earlier, how many dozens of ad impressions were bought and sold while I scrolled, all because facebook couldn&#x27;t be bothered to write a useful timeline search?<p>The places where people spend most of their time online (social media, youtube) are designed to act like quicksand, information is re-arranged every time you hit the back button, just because they need to mix some payola in and keep you on the site.<p>&#x2F;rant<p>I think there is still a log of creativity to be had with computers, for my part I&#x27;m building a WYSIWYG CMS that frames all of its data into polygon &#x27;tiles&#x27; that fit together into a mosaic in 2 or 3 or more dimensions, just something to get away from the rectangles and single column timelines that make everything look the same. I can&#x27;t even remember what website I saw something on because I can&#x27;t tell one from the other. So, see also another great piece on web design from 2016 [1] relating to design trends in physical spaces, the trend of cafes and airbnbs to ignore any of its local context in favor of a bland Le Corbusier-meets-Edison-Bulbs style, a full on mcdonaldization of service so that you never have to try anything new (except even mcdonalds adapts the menu to local taste)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;8&#x2F;3&#x2F;12325104&#x2F;airbnb-aesthetic-global-minimalism-startup-gentrification" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;8&#x2F;3&#x2F;12325104&#x2F;airbnb-aesthetic-...</a>')
