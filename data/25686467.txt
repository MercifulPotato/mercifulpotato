It’s supposedly illegal in the US.<p>Historically, “interference” has  broadly included things like providing financial support to candidates, running news stories about candidates (or running news stations in the US, at all), and so on.<p>The lifting of these restrictions led directly to Fox News (which is an Australian company), which has long been a mouthpiece for the Republican Party.  All of this happens despite the fact that it would be illegal for the Republican Party to take campaign donations from Australians.<p>We need to reinstate media ownership laws in the US.')
