So, in principle there should be little trouble having two or even more providers.<p>Furthermore: fibers provide overwhelmingly more bandwidth capacity than (almost) anyone needs, and hardly nobody needs two fiber connections. So, different providers can share the same fiber installation, either renting to one another, or renting from local government.<p>Finally, maintaining fiber is much less costly than, say, sewers, they last much longer, and are way simpler to manage, so local governments can operate them directly, and provide service more cheaply by dispensing with billing activity, folding costs into the tax base, as with sewage service.')
