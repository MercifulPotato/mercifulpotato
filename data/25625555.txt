This would keep the rest of the UI snappy.  It could also tint those portions of the UI so users can see which app is the culprit of UI slowness.<p>I hope that Rust can someday be used as the basis of an OS that does not rely on sandboxing for security, but instead uses the compiler to enforce security.  Such an OS could use cooperative multitasking and use a lot less energy and less expensive hardware than our current multi-core CPU + MMU + kernel ring model.')
