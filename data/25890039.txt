What they mean is that people when they quit have to pay back the cost of equipment ans training, and if they can&#x27;t pay it becomes a debt. This kind of scheme is common in trucking. A company gives training and a truck in exchange for working for the trucking company. But then they charge an interest and a truck rental fee, and the driver ultimately can&#x27;t make enough money to pay off the loan [1]. The result is that the driver ends up filing for bankruptcy.
