It&#x27;s what prompted me to visit Arecibo in the late 90&#x27;s -- there wasn&#x27;t much of a visitor&#x27;s center, but, I was still able to get a tour by someone who was working that day.<p>I tried to get into OSU&#x27;s Electrical Engineering Program (my mentor went there, and I had made a lot of friends through him), but, my military service made it impossible for me to find a path forward at OSU, and managed to go to a small private school&#x27;s engineering school instead.<p>Radio Astronomy (and, broadcast&#x2F;ham radio) really helped me shape my engineering prowess to who I am today.')
