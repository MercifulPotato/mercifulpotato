Especially when it comes to the US. Where even the overly rigid minutae obsessed military take pride in being considered unpredictable madmen who don&#x27;t even pay attention to their own doctrines consistently and are at home in chaos. The people of the US aren&#x27;t even consistently individualistic and would make herding cats look easy - you can get them to follow you with a tin of tuna.<p>There isn&#x27;t &quot;the&quot; Man. Why would there be when even positions of petty power are contested for so tightly and dirtily and there are so many  striving to rise? Consequences are not a strong deterrent - if they were the world would look very different.<p>Wealthy individuals may have power but nobody has control over the a process of contention across all layers with nominal goals served imperfectly with cargo-culting and skewed priorities.<p>All of this and there is nothing inherently special about the people - human nature and control oppose each other.')
