Indeed, enormous regex based rules used to be common in the early days, but seem to have fallen out of favor. I&#x27;m guessing that it turns out that they were slower, or one of the major extensions did not support them or something.<p>There is some form of complexity limit for regex based entries, and only 1000 of them are allowed per extension&#x27;s static list (an additional 1000 are allowed for the dynamic blocklists). But I&#x27;d be pretty surprised if they were so limited they could not bring EasyList back within the 30k limit.<p>So basically, if there is no global limit being applied, one would probably need about one extension per major blocklist, with smaller blocklists potentially being able to be combined into shared extensions.')
