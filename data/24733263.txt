My friends that are Democrats are likely to loudly fight for gay rights, but are less loud about government programs getting cut (they may still be vocal about that, just not as loud). My friends that are Republicans are typically worried about government waste and socialism. Sure, some may be pro-life, but that&#x27;s not their top priority.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say there aren&#x27;t Democrats passionate about fiscal issues (Sanders wing), or Republicans passionate about social issues (religious right), simply that it is plausible these camps are &lt;50% of each party, which could imply there is more agreement and&#x2F;or tolerance between what the two parties stand for than disagreement.')
