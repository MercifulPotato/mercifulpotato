Leaving aside the sophomore dorm room discussion about whether public bodies should consider fines as revenues streams: when I did a similar analysis (with Matt&#x27;s help) in the village I live in, I found a multiple-orders-of-magnitude difference in attributable fees between the lowest-fined blocks and the highest-fined blocks; the more heavily ticketed block brought in 5 figures of revenue (that&#x27;s a lot, for Oak Park). Something is going on there! It should be incumbent on the village to figure out why that&#x27;s happening, and how to keep it from happening.<p>(Like Matt, I also found that if you look at the raw data, you&#x27;ll find citations that are facially invalid; in my case, I found &quot;overnight parking&quot; citations issued in the middle of the day --- 50+ of them).<p>Last thought: I don&#x27;t know about the state you live in, but in Illinois it is <i>shockingly</i> easy to FOIA a public body, and the law is to an extraordinary extent on your side. I just flattened Oak Park in a FOIA dispute with just a couple of emails. If you live in a state with Illinois-or-better FOIA (short statutory time window for public bodies to respond, fee recovery for successful legal challenges), you&#x27;re almost certainly not FOIA&#x27;ing enough.<p>Also, if you&#x27;re in Illinois: please FOIA your local police general orders, and let me know when you get them; I&#x27;m collecting them.')
