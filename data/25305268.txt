I&#x27;m not sure if that was two weeks or a month. Instead, Google layed her off on the same day.<p>Firing her much sooner than the date she requested seems really foolish on Google&#x27;s side. Arguably, one of the primary reasons a profit-oriented company would hire someone for this kind of job is for the good PR. If they offer to resign why would you not simply accept the terms of resignation, why would you rush it to happen faster.<p>Even if she is acting in bad faith Google could have saved themselves a big headache by at least giving her a month or something, even two weeks, to exit the company.')
