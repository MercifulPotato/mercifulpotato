So I can&#x27;t possibly see it as a disability. It certainly makes some aspects of life more difficult for him, but my experience is that he generally figures things out in the end, even if it&#x27;s many years later than his peers. On the other hand, some things &#x27;normal&#x27; people struggle with come very easily to him. Really, I think &#x27;difference&#x27; is the best way to put it. Some &#x27;good&#x27;, some &#x27;bad&#x27;, but I think they play a very important role in society.<p>As an aside, I&#x27;m really disappointed it&#x27;s all under the umbrella term of ASD now. People are generally more aware of the differences now but no thanks to that.')
