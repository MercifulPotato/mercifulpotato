Even if it&#x27;s possible to arrive at somewhat okay-ish position performance using vision based feedback, the control system can&#x27;t really cope with dynamic issues (imagine an end effector on a thin, long piece of wood: even if you can move it around to a certain position based on vision feedback, once you change the load on it, the piece of wood bends, once you decrease the load it snaps back etc).')
