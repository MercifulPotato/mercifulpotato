As someone who doesn&#x27;t usually actually need it, I can understand the motivation for less people to use it until they know enough to realize they need it, but also don&#x27;t understand people who ignore valid needs of larger teams and projects where something like Redux makes a lot of difference and is necessary. Again, unless those people consider themselves and their projects to be the biggest and most complex that can ever be, which is very likely to be false.')
