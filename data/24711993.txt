Item(by='TinyRick', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602100288, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24711722, text='&gt; Where I can get in a position and just say &quot;i&#x27;m good here&quot; and simply maintain my position.<p>In my experience, large companies outside the tech industry can offer this.  I have worked at a Fortune 500 company in a B2B industry for all 7 years of my career so far, and while the work isn&#x27;t the most interesting, I&#x27;ve never been expected to work more than 40hr&#x2F;week (and often can do my job with 30-35 hr weeks).<p>There are still opportunities for steady career advancement, yet no one is hyper-competitive to the point that it affects others&#x27; work&#x2F;life balance.  Pay&#x2F;benefits are decent, but I&#x27;m definitely making less than my more competitive friends from high school&#x2F;college who went on to work for big tech or other prestigious companies.  I would argue I am much happier overall than they are, though.<p>There&#x27;s a lot more to life than working.  Do what makes you happy.')
