Few things in life are certainties. But I know there are many paths for my next action: some which involve self-modification and others which involve world-modification.<p>In all but few cases, self-modification is the superior strategy. And I find that self-deception gives me the ability to perform self-modification much more easily.<p>And after all, my objective is success by my own metric. If the parameters of my life are constrained by outside factors, it hardly changes the actions which I take where I have agency. Imagine my objective as ending up in the top right corner of an infinite plane. You say that the universe actually constrains me to the rectangle whose corners are (-500, -500) and (+100, +100). Well, now all my actions to reach the top right corner will now target me into (+100, +100). That is adequate. That will do.<p>In any case, I&#x27;m fairly certain that those who don&#x27;t work hard and who don&#x27;t believe in their ability to achieve success (by their own metric) will outcompete in survival metrics all those who don&#x27;t. If societies choose to overempower the latter, they will eventually be outcompeted by societies that empower the former, c.p.<p>My limited experience has me fairly convinced about this. But it doesn&#x27;t matter, because if I&#x27;m wrong, I&#x27;ll be outcompeted in turn.')
