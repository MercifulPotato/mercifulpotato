So that was good (although we weren&#x27;t wearing masks -- the level of concern and associated precautions with H1N1 felt high at the time but now seems pretty trivial compared to COVID-19).<p>I recently went to my doctor&#x27;s office for a seasonal flu shot and the office had separated spaces in the waiting room, lots of air filters going, and all patients and workers wearing face masks. And I think they wouldn&#x27;t allow more than 4 or 5 patients in the office at a time. So those same precautions would feel pretty decent to me for COVID vaccination.<p>Edit: I guess I&#x27;m reflexively thinking of San Francisco in imagining this -- the outdoor line-up seems perfectly fine here, but it might be pretty unpleasant in January in New York or St. Petersburg or Edmonton...')
