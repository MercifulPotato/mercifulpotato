Item(by='mlyle', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609702210, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25624225, text='&gt; Is there a metric to look for to understand what power consumption is at &quot;idle&quot; or something close to that? That is what confuses me. I don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on something that will be always on, and usually idling, and finding that its power usage is way higher than I thought.<p>Community benchmarks, from Tom&#x27;s Hardware, etc.<p>The vendor numbers are make believe-- you can&#x27;t use them for power supply sizing or for thermal path sizing.  If you look at the cited TDP numbers today-- it can be misleading-- e.g. often Intel 45W TDP parts use more power at peak than AMD 65W parts.<p>On modern systems, almost none of the idle consumption is the processor.  The power supply&#x27;s idle use and motherboard functions dominate.<p>&gt; Also, even though the CPU may draw less, can still the power supply waste more, just because it is beefy?<p>Yes, having to select a larger power supply can result in more idle consumption, though this is more of a problem on the very low end.')
