Item(by='haidut', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606097428, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25182842, text='Ooh, ok, thanks. Since the numbers in that column were preceded by the &quot;$&quot; sign I thought they were in dollars and referred to something else. Speaking of that something else - the numbers you had in Column I are strikingly close to the officially projected amounts of what a &quot;wealthy&quot; person in each one of those cities would be (in dollars). I mean the US cities only. For example, for the Bay Area that number is in the $4m-$5m range, for DC it is in the $2m-$3m range, etc. I am guessing it is just a coincidence but it drew my attention and since I did not know what the column stood for I asked. It turns out it was not what I thought :-)')
