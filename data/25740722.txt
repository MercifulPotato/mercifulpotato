It&#x27;s just models your brain puts together from some sensory stimuli (photons hitting your retina), but they aren&#x27;t real, they are mere concepts that happen to work well enough that you may manage to live long enough to procreate... they were made by evolution, and evolution doesn&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s real so long as it works well enough.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meaningful to say that the electron described by QM doesn&#x27;t exist in nature... something exists in nature and all we can <i>ever</i> do is describe it with a model.')
