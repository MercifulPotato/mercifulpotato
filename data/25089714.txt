It will be openly developed with intermediate milestones visible to the open-source community and a complete open-source Linux driver will be delivered by Q2 2022. Imagination will work with RIOS to run the open-source GPU driver on the PicoRio open-source platform.<p>It sounds like the proprietary driver will be available when the first phase 2 devices ship, but an open source driver will be available ~6 months later. If it does materialize, this will be quite an open platform. I will not purchase a phase 2 or 3 device until it does, though.<p>Regardless, I will probably purchase a phase 1 device (which is headless &#x2F; has no GPU).')
