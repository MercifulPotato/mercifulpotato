There&#x27;s still a narrative here in Germany that the big bad USA &#x2F; trump is wrong for demanding we spend money on our military when we literally signed a contract agreeing to do just that. At the same time, we&#x27;re in a bit of a unique position where our defence is also in the best interest of the USA.<p>4. Yes, technological reliance on the USA when it comes to the internet is amazing and terrifying at the same time. Mind you, there is no lack of European alternatives, but somehow these big companies injected a brand-oriented culture into the web-development world on a scale I&#x27;d usually expect to see in regards to clothing, not software.<p>I&#x27;ll risk sounding ellitist, but I do believe this only works because of the recent influx of newcomers to the world of web and their mentality of doing only what gets them employed. This is a way bigger problem that I could write many pages about, but in this context the important detail is that these people often choose to learn products rather than methodologies, buzzwords and brands rather than theory and logical principles.')
