I&#x27;m referring to gray comments that don&#x27;t seem to be particularly hostile, but are just, say, conservative (for example) in nature.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;ve forgotten, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve complained about being downvoted.  Today doesn&#x27;t count.  It&#x27;s not a complaint, just an observation in  a thread about free speech and censorship.<p>Thanks for the feedback.')
