Caused me to accidentally upload something I definetely didn&#x27;t want to publish.<p>In fact I have never since directly uploaded anything from my own personal file directories, instead I make a copy of it under &#x2F;tmp for the upload process.<p>Not sure if this is the same bug you are talking about')
