Total frontend load is less than 95kb (transferred, uncached).<p>I&#x27;ve been incredibly pleased. I&#x27;ve done a lot of AngularJS and React, and a fair bit of Vue and a little bit of Angular, and compared to those, it&#x27;s been fantastic. Sure, the ecosystem is missing some things here and there, but all the built-in things more than make up for it. The documentation is incredibly simple to go through, and you can read everything in half a day (plus do the tutorial).<p>For future projects, I don&#x27;t expect to or have a reason to go back to React (or Vue or...) unless something huge happens.')
