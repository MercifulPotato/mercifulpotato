It&#x27;s incredibly annoying to talk with people like that except if you like being a pedant back. So it has its place, but it undermines teamwork.<p>I see it as a property of nerds, which I say as a nerd myself with a PhD in physics. I still do it and feel the tug to, but I&#x27;ve worked hard to learn to listen and reflect with more empathy and generosity.')
