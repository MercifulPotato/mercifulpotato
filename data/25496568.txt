On what basis do you say that people are underestimating the seriousness? Are you a doctor? An epidemiologist? Do you have any medical education?<p>2. Do you have any supporting evidence for your claim that it’s obvious that something was “off” about Kent and that there is a spread attributable to this? Or are you just drawing lines between dots? You source nothing, so it’s impossible to know.<p>3. On what basis do you claim that this strain “probably” has spread to tens of other countries? Who are you, and based on what do you make this guess?<p>The pandemic is taxing enough on everybody as it is. We DO NOT need “educated guesses” from armchair epidemiologists that do not identify themselves or what sources they are drawing their conclusions from — and I could expect as much from a random comment field on the internet, but not as the top voted comment on HN.')
