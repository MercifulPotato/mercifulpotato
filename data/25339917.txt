In a good and functioning democracy there exists other democratic institutions to ensure that the government cannot abuse the powers granted to them.<p>&quot;Vote with your wallet&quot; is a disingenuous argument were all the corporates work together like a cartel towards a particular business model that maximises profit for them to the detriment of us consumers. Regulations that bind all business to certain rules and standard also benefit the businesses as it creates a level playing field for them too.
