Yes, it is a whole book, and it goes to quite a level of detail, as you can imagine, but it is written really nicely and engaging.<p>If you don&#x27;t want the full level of detail, just skip certain parts! You will still learn a lot. I know many people are reluctant to &quot;read a book&quot; and then skip 80% of it, but it is a really great technique for non-fiction.')
