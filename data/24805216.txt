I don&#x27;t pay attention to how I chew food and hadn&#x27;t noticed chewing more than anyone else. Hmmm, strange! You would think being an older person and having been born, raised and still living in the corn belt and therefore eating LOTS of corn I would have seen the kernel shells <i>sometime</i>! Who knows? Maybe I&#x27;m a mutant who can digest cellulose better than most! :)<p>P.S. - In all seriousness maybe that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve been able to be a vegetarian for 30 years without suffering from the ill effects people typically suffer, such as excessive gas. Maybe I really <i>do</i> digest cellulose better than most.')
