Something that&#x27;s actually reliable and not propaganda itself? It seems extremely difficult to be able to differentiate between an ad letting people know that a product exists and it directly influencing your decision. Or you could consider letting people know about the product existing as influencing the person, but then it&#x27;s hard to argue that ads are actually bad.<p>With tobacco it&#x27;s far easier to show a correlation, because people can just not smoke. People can&#x27;t just avoid the effects of advertising, because it&#x27;s all around us. Even word of mouth can be an ad campaign.<p>Also, tobacco probably is too regulated. It should be regulated to stop other people from experiencing the negative effects of somebody smoking. Limiting what flavors cigarettes can have and <i>enormously</i> taxing them seems like it has gone too far. People should be allowed to make their own choices in a free society.')
