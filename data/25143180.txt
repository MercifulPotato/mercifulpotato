I do as well :)<p>Angular has botched the first 3 years of its existence with breaking changes every major release and catastrophic bundle size. And it shares the name with angular.js - one of the most dreaded frameworks of the past for mostly anyone that had to maintain a few years old angular.js projects. And it&#x27;s the most frameworky of the bunch, thus it comes with a heavy stack.<p>Vue &amp; React were better, leaner, easier alternatives. Angular just survived, because it&#x27;s super heavy in use inside google. I guess it will never catch up to vue or react again. Maybe with rebranding. But maybe they don&#x27;t want to as it serves google well already.')
