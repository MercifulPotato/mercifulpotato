A 3-torus would be like that, only in 3D.<p>On the other hand, one could imagine the universe as a 3-sphere, which I believe would mean it would be both locally curved and finite in volume. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;3-sphere" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;3-sphere</a><p>There are also other possibilities, like something analogous to a Klein bottle with an extra dimension.<p>There are a bunch of possibilities for &quot;flat and finite&quot; as well as &quot;positively curved and finite&quot; that I can&#x27;t begin to visualize.<p>There is even supposedly such a (hypothetical) thing as a negatively curved, (commonly described as saddle shaped) yet finite universe.<p>But regardless, the current belief about the real universe is that it is at least very close to flat, but not known to be finite or infinite.')
