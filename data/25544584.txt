There is Computer Science, Software Engineering, and then Application Programming.  SW engineers work in OSs, drivers, firmware, and applied areas likes comms and robotics, where &quot;move fast and break things&quot; isn&#x27;t the theme, at all.  App programmers use established and trendy &#x27;stacks&#x27;, and are often superficially knowledgeable of the details of the underlying tech -- and there&#x27;s nothing at all wrong with that.
