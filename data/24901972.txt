In the U.S, with conventional 30-year fixed mortgages, amortization and term are the same (30 years).  There are also adjustable-rate mortgages which have a different term, eg. a 7&#x2F;1 ARM has a fixed rate for 7 years, adjust annually thereafter, and is paid off in 30 years.  Although ARMs are occasionally pushed by banks, most finance sites recommend against them and savvy buyers usually steer clear, because lots of buyers got in a lot of trouble from 07-09 because of them.<p>I gather, from this thread, that this is not the case in Canada and some other locales.  But in the U.S, if you have a fixed-rate mortgage, your interest rate is fixed for the full length of the loan.  It sounds like the OP is from Europe, where I guess things work similarly.')
