I dropped out originally due to running out of money and having to take a full time job. Or rather I told myself I&#x27;d continue school part time, but never did. Lack of a degree was never a problem professionally so there was no reason to go back and spend a pile of money and a lot of time.<p>But then I got to the point where I wanted to advance my knowledge of various topics and a master&#x27;s degree would have been a great structured way to do that. For example I did the MITx MicroMasters in Supply Chain Management. After that I would have had an option to finish the master&#x27;s program on-site at MIT with 1 additional semester. But I couldn&#x27;t pursude this due to lack of completed undegrad.<p>So this finally motivated me to look into some options, and I also found WGU very appealing due to the rolling start, low cost and ability to quickly blaze through the classes I know and only spend time on the ones I need to learn something new.')
