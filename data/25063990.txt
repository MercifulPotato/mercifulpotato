I always find it strange when I see something about “linear algebra” that never mentions linear maps, vector spaces or bases. Perhaps the mechanics of computing with matrices is better for an introduction for people who are only interested in machine learning but the mathematician in me feels like it is important to get across that in some specific sense the numbers in a matrix are arbitrary and that the essence of the thing is simpler.<p>I’m a bit surprised that this doesn’t mention suffix notation, especially as multilinear maps are so common in machine learning and suffix notation is such a good way to work with them.')
