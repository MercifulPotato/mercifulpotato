If we are in a simulation, our observed universe is also a simulation. Even if the real world revealed itself to us Matrix style, this &quot;revelation&quot; could also be a simulation.\nThere is no way to tell. We can not falsify either of the contradicting statements &quot;we live in a simulation&quot; &#x2F; &quot;we do not live in a simulation&quot;.<p>(Edit: Technically, I don&#x27;t agree with your &quot;application of probabilities to non-discrete systems&quot; statement, but I think we get the intended meaning here.)')
