My understanding (from a 2010 conversation with a friend who was deep in btc) was that there was a time where bitcoin scripting could cause transactions to appear onchain that would look valid to a novice but would not actually perform the actions described such that a scam could be perpetrated. I have not done the work to validate these claims. I stand by my comments on Eth and Satoshi Dice.<p>The crazy thing is: bitcoin was ethereum.<p>The community killed scripting because it was antithetical to the thing that makes money in BTC: trust. The constant flow of n00bs coming in who got their transactions reversed by OP codes and said &quot;BUT I THOUGHT BITCOIN TRANSACTIONS WERE IRREVERSIBLE!!?!?!!?!?!1111&quot; was eroding trust in the ecosystem.<p>Really, I think the beginning of bitcoin jumping the shark was Satoshi Dice: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coindesk.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;satoshidice" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coindesk.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;satoshidice</a>.<p>Anyways, Bitcoin off-chain scripting won&#x27;t replace Eth anymore than any other off-chain scripting system will replace Eth. If this kills Eth it will be because people don&#x27;t want on-chain scripting, not because people want off-chain scripting on bitcoin (ergo, the meta problem is that on-chain scripting doesn&#x27;t scale in every sense of the word scale; fees, tx speed, finality, etc).<p>Caveat emptor: it&#x27;s entirely possible this company could work or take off. In crypto, sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.<p>Edit: Just to be extra clear, the problems with ethereum, to me at least, aren&#x27;t actually on-chain scaling; that feels solvable. What feels unsolvable to me is two things: 1) turing completeness and 2) compilation malleability (if the compiler&#x2F;machine can change but the code can&#x27;t, guess what, old code&#x27;s behavior becomes less predictable over time... computing systems with longevity gain minimal entropy over time).<p>Edit 2: The only rational way I can make sense of turing completeness and compilation malleability as features is if the ecosystem is engineering ecological behavior in, that is to say: old programs should become less valuable unless they accurately predicted the future. Maybe that&#x27;s rational?')
