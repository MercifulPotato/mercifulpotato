They evaluated the ~90 that got covid. There were equal amounts who got the placebo vs the vaccine, so if the vaccine doesn&#x27;t work you would expect ~45 of that ~90 to have got the vaccine.  However only 5 of that ~90 got the vaccine, that implies that the vaccine works.<p>You can cherry pick it if you want: the full data isn&#x27;t released so they can hide something. There is no reason hide anything though: all the data will be given to the FDA (and other national equivalents) so you aren&#x27;t hiding anything for long.  There is every reason not to: this release is legally binding to the SEC, so if they are hiding anything there are legal implications: CEOs go to prison for less.')
