We have a massive economic problem where the young and the economically disadvantaged face massive challenges achieving financial security. And without the spare funds to contribute non-trivial amounts regularly (and the financial education to buy-and-hold through thick and thin), even somewhere like Vanguard isn’t going to wildly change people’s fortunes.<p>I don’t know what the answer is (although I have some educated guesses) but what I know doesn’t really help is glorifying a gambling regime where one in millions gets filthy rich, one in tens of thousands gets kind of rich, one in hundreds does maybe a little better than the market, and everyone else is effectively donating what little they do have to the Wall Street elite.')
