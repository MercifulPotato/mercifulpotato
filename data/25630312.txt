However poor the experience of the standard signup&#x2F;auth process is, users have already learned the complexity, and the risk is super high when you&#x27;re showing people a totally new type of hurdle they have to jump to access your product.  Even if it&#x27;s less complex objectively, if they fail the first time there&#x27;s a high chance that user is never coming back.<p>But I think authentication in general is a problem which really needs to be solved, and in a standards-based way.  For instance, with connecting to public wifi networks (i.e. at an airport), it&#x27;s absurd to have to go through a web page every time to log in.  Also with the proliferation of IoT devices, it&#x27;s always painful to go through the process of connecting it to my bluetooth and&#x2F;or wifi.  There should be some kind way to handle trust systematically through my smartphone without having to manually type a bunch of passwords.')
