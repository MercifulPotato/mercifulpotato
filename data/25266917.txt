I&#x27;m torn between &quot;will it just sit on the counter&#x2F;will I use it&quot; as I use a Moto 5 already(low end phone with 3GB ram). Still it is a dream of mine to have everything on a phone as far as dock&#x2F;develop on it. I mean I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;d ever be able to do vms but if you could run generic environments, pull down a repo&#x2F;work on it, that would be pretty cool. Also will try to get more into Linux specifically I&#x27;m after some kind of i3-wm toggle for performance gain. Mostly hoping my support can help speed up the 8GB device ha.<p>A bunch of my old phones are sitting around doing nothing.<p>Edit: I guess maybe part of it is a &quot;future development&#x2F;emerging market&quot; thing maybe I can develop apps people would want on Linux phones in the future.<p>In particular Qt&#x2F;some native GUI&#x2F;hopefully cross platform and to get more into C++ as I&#x27;m coming mostly from JS &quot;wHy CaNt I uSe DyNaMiC tYpInG&quot; ha that was a struggle.')
