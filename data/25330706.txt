But above that weight air shipping costs get really expensive. On the other hand surface ahipping is already cheap at 2 kg and get even cheaper per unit of mass as your package gets heavier, up to 30 kg max (or some fairly genwrous size limits).<p>So thats why I used surface mail for those books - they were mostly second hand and shipping them by air would be quite a bit more expensive than theor price in many cases! :)')
