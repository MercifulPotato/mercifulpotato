We&#x27;re accumulating more in debt every year than we need to feed the kids born that year for the rest of their lives.<p>Our debt is unsustainable and our country is drugged up on a perverse cocktail of conspiracies, Christianity, cowboy mythology. Glad to be one foot out. Good luck and god bless.')
