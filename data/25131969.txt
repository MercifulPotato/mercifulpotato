Democrats were more likely to be at home (due to white collar skew, taking pandemic more seriously, and being in places with more restrictions) and also more likely to respond to polls.<p>That is, in practice, a &quot;shy Trump voter&quot; problem. It&#x27;s not that their ashamed of Trump, but rather that they didn&#x27;t answer polls at the rate they were expected to.')
