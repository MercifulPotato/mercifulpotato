It works but it&#x27;s not integrated with Windows: it goes directly to the audio interface, bypassing stuff in the Kernel.<p>This bypass causes some limitations, such as not being able to use the system mixer (which prevents from using media players or multiple audio apps), or sometimes having different audio-interfaces not work well with each other.<p>There are workarounds to those issues, but they have to be handled by the interface manufacturer when writing the drivers. Also, you can&#x27;t have low-latency with built-in soundcard unless you use something like ASIO4ALL, which is not super stable IME. This sucks when you want to work on-the-go with headphones.<p>Of course, it can be very stable when you use the right combination of DAW, drivers and sound interfaces, but when you don&#x27;t you have problems.<p>On macOS and iOS? CoreAudio is native and it has super low latency by default. It&#x27;s mostly plug and play and all apps use it. It even provides APIs to use Audio Plugins or reroute Audio, so DAW writers don&#x27;t even have to write it themselves (unless they want to). Do you have multiple Audio&#x2F;MIDI interface? In macOS there&#x27;s a built-in app to &quot;link&quot; them together.')
