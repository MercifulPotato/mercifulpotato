Network  backbones are relatively cheap making total land area mostly a meaningless limitation.  4x land area increases average distance between cities by ~2x so that doesn’t change much. Thus while truly rural areas are an issue wiring every suburb and midsized town in the US is roughly as difficult as the UK.<p>The difference mostly comes down to corruption as the US government heavily subsidized network deployments, but without any requirement they actually build networks.  Add a lot of anticompetitive legislation in the US and things really slowed down. It’s slowly gotten better over time, but many areas still have terrible internet availability.<p>PS: I pay ~66$ per month for 20&#x2F;20 and live in a 22 story building so density isn’t the issue.')
