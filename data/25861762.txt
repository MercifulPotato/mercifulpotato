And given my level (two levels above Senior Developer) I estimate I was paid better than at least 90% engineers.<p>Where I worked in R&amp;D the doors were constantly revolving and many people admitted they wait to register enough of prestigious time at Intel on their CV to get hired at a much better rate for another company.<p>--<p>I don&#x27;t see these moves as encouraging, more like signs of complete and utter panic. You go to these moves when whatever you do isn&#x27;t working and you don&#x27;t have strategy to do something new so you try to default on what has worked in the past (this both for the choice of CEO as well as bringing retired people).<p>This doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it is a wrong move (see Steve Jobs coming back to save Apple as a proof it doesn&#x27;t have to be bad) but I wouldn&#x27;t call it encouraging.<p>Rehiring retired people to me signals the new CEO has no trust in people that already are there. And that is usually bad news.<p>Add to it outsourcing <i>CORE</i> competency to competitor (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eenewseurope.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;intel-TSMC-5nm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eenewseurope.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;intel-TSMC-5nm</a>) and it seems that if there is a plan it is to keep the ship afloat for a little while longer.<p>Hopefully the ship is going to be afloat for as long is necessary to reshape the organization, but I think we haven&#x27;t yet seen any concrete moves to see what is the strategy.')
