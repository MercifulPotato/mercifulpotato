There is one line I don&#x27;t understand though:<p>&gt; Second, you can no longer assume that the important companies and products themselves are American. Both of these are captured in Tiktok.<p>Is Tiktok an &quot;important&quot; service? I may very well be out of touch, but a social media app used primarily by teenagers to share trendy videos doesn&#x27;t seem all that important to me. It&#x27;s important in the sense that it&#x27;s shaping regulation, but I don&#x27;t believe that&#x27;s what the author is referring to when using the word.')
