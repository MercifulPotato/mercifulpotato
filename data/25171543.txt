Embedded side is slightly less constrained but heavily weighed by those as well. Whether it would technically make sense to start a new OS has only peripheral relevance unless there are giant, overwhelming advantages (and few disadvantages) vs incumbent ones.<p>Any credible attempt will have to be designed from the start to focus on comatibility with whatever it replaces, have huge investments to the ecosystem transition from the corporate owner, have credible commitment to the phaseout of the superseded OS, and be prepared for a very long transition period.<p>Will be interesting to see what happens with Fuchsia. Its success might be a big loss to open computing though.')
