Look how much Signal has improved in the last 6 months.<p>I agree with this, but I’m starting to worry if that time will ever come. I thought messaging apps had basically all the features they’d ever need years ago. But I was wrong. I use voice messages in signal and WhatsApp daily now. If it were up to me, we would have made a federation protocol years ago and these features would have to have been figured out through endless meetings in a standards process.')
