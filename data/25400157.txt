The sender and receiver just need to have IPv6 connectivity.<p>Every email provider that supports IPv6 will also support IPv4 (for the time being). To use Gmail as an example:<p><pre><code>    aspmx.l.google.com. 293 IN AAAA 2a00:1450:400c:c0b::1a\n    aspmx.l.google.com. 293 IN A 173.194.76.27\n</code></pre>\nThere is both an A and AAAA record. You can send emails over IPv6 or IPv4 to Gmail addresses.<p>Did you mean you can&#x27;t exclusively use IPv6? Because that is also true for browsing the web - because so few websites support IPv6, a lot of links will just not work.')
