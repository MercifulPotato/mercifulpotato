They could say &#x27;the limit is $X&#x27; on an intro call. But I tend to take that as an early negotiation tactic. Because if I say X+Y% during the offer-letter phase of the pipeline, and they say yes, the first limit mentioned was a fabrication.<p>In other words, there is no way to truly know the limit until you&#x27;ve reached the end of the funnel. Maybe the company&#x27;s struggled with finding a candidate, and now has decided to shell out a premium upon request. You&#x27;ll never have that context. But true cards will only played at the end, not the beginning, of the conversation.')
