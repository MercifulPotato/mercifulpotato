It can&#x27;t be done in many normal text-based searches, it can&#x27;t be done in face-to-face conversations with real people, so there should be no expectation that a voice search would yield any better results. Having actual data that exists to answer the question, as with the mask example, is also an essential requirement.<p>If you expect more, than your problem does not lie with voice assistants, it lies with search technology itself. &quot;Expecting&quot; these questions to be answerable is unrealistic given current capabilities. Working backwards from the UX would produce nothing better because your expectations are thwarted not by poor design, but by the limits of state of the art technology.')
