Item(by='randomdata', descendants=None, kids=[25563595], score=None, time=1609184393, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25562312, text='<i>&gt; Around here, cheapest option for a decent actual meal is ~8-10&#x2F;eur&#x2F;person.</i><p>Same here, but always coupled with a value of entertainment at that price point. You cannot directly compare the entertainment experience to your home kitchen, as already mentioned. You, at least, would have to include some of the cost of your living room, TV, Netflix account, etc. or whatever analogs of entertainment you have in your home. At which point 10 eur is going to look pretty cheap.<p><i>&gt; &quot;starter&quot; ( recommended if you&#x27;re going to let or for first buy) are at 2k, everything included.</i><p>Whoa. I&#x27;m not sure you could even put up one wall of a kitchen for $2k in North America. Maybe if you&#x27;re buying a stove and cooking under the stars you could get in for that amount. That&#x27;s not what anyone I know would call a kitchen. Definitely not what is being referred to as a kitchen in this thread.')
