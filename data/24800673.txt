And it&#x27;s not saying what you state.<p>&quot;no link&quot; literally means no <i>link</i>.  It&#x27;s the straightforward meaning of (an ordinary, not symbolic) &quot;link&quot; in Unix filesystems.  They cannot cross devices.<p>And on disc, &quot;..&quot; in the root is a link to the same directory.  (POSIX allows for it to be this, which is the conventional Unix behaviour, or not to exist, which is the case on some non-Unix filesystems and operating systems where conceptually there is stuff &quot;above&quot; the root.)<p>Executing &quot;cd ..&quot; ignores what is on disc at a mount point, and traverses the mount upwards.<p>Remember that &quot;filesystem&quot; has three meanings: the on-disc format of a DASD volume, the overall tree abstraction presented by the operating system, or what is presented by an FS driver.')
