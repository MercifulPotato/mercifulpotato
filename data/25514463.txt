I also agree that Google probably has similar chops as Apple for pulling something like this off. So the fact that Google essentially failed does speak to the point of Apple&#x27;s success not being a sure thing.<p>A couple of things I would say to this, however:<p>1. Wired connection to home internet wasn&#x27;t really in a period of disruption when Google entered the Fiber market. Google didn&#x27;t really have an angle into the market. I think this was more typical Google arrogance driving this than strategic thinking. In this case, I would actually believe the purpose was to influence other players rather than capture meaningful market share with a unique product offering. It&#x27;s quite an invisible product.<p>2. Apple doesn&#x27;t run the business looking for revenue and margins. Apple looks for opportunities to build a substantially different product that fits Apple&#x27;s values (privacy, safety, security, design, ease of use, etc). Everything about the car as a product experience, including its distribution is in massive transition right now. On a small level we see this with Tesla on the dealership vs direct to consumer model. On a larger scale we see this with ownership model altogether (ride hailing apps vs. the car in your driveway). The car is about to get rebuilt with microprocessors at the core, including machine learning, literally driving the whole experience.<p>Anyway, this is just a way of saying, we shouldn&#x27;t take a financial snapshot of the car market today and try to fit Apple&#x27;s model for success into it. The only reason they are getting into it is because everything about cars is going to change dramatically over the next 10 years.')
