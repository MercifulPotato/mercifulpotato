I think a lot of the kickback against apologising that we&#x27;re seeing is coming from the numerous public examples of this tactic and the follow-up where any good-faith apology will be used to make a further example of the heretic.<p>Well said. It&#x27;s just a big witch hunt. If you don&#x27;t apologize, you&#x27;re in the wrong; if you do apologize, clearly you are a bad person because you were in the wrong, and the onus is now on you to demonstrate you&#x27;re no longer that &quot;bad&quot; person. It&#x27;s guilty until proven innocent and either way you lose.<p>Not to mention how many of these witch hunters have never said or done anything wrong themselves, ever? If you&#x27;re a saint, then sure, by all means call out people for their wrong doings. But I have a hunch that 99% of progressives would be EXTREMELY uncomfortable if someone said they were going to pull every tweet, post, interview, statement, etc that they&#x27;d ever made and scrutinize them for harmful statements.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s completely biased and partisan. The most famous example is Alyssa Milano, who really brought the Me Too movement to the spotlight, defending Joe Biden because he was &quot;a good man&quot;. If you&#x27;re not their friend, you don&#x27;t get the same benefit of the doubt. The hypocrisy is unbearable.')
