Raising prices to compensate for more demand seems like a rational thing to do, the 3000-series did have stock problems.<p>I&#x27;m not sure $450 for the only 8-core is value though, hopefully there is a 5700 65W SKU coming.<p>The Big Navi number for Borderlands 3 4K seems inline with a 3080, so if priced right, AMD&#x27;s going to run the table.')
