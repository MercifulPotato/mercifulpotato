Part of it was lack of interest from the inside, where it competes with people just wanting to use or keep using google docs &#x2F; github &#x2F; confluence &#x2F; a few holdouts on google sites and who will always complain about Quip. I suspect core Slack will remain about the same and the focus will turn towards Salesforce integrations that most Slack users won&#x27;t know or care about.')
