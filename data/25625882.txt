I don&#x27;t think this will slippery slope if well done:<p>- I choose the TV channel, website, etc. to visit, but public space I might have to walk through because it&#x27;s the only option\n - In that public space it may be impossible not to see the adds\n - sight lines in public spaces are public property<p>Now, one may ask &quot;what about paying someone to verbally advertise in public space&quot;. I think that should remain legal, because that does seem like a slippery slope. I&#x27;m willing to risk that society won&#x27;t collapse so far that that highly inefficient form of advertising became cheap enough with destitute surplus labor.')
