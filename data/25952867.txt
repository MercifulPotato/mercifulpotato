You can&#x27;t hear that voice again, or relive that conversation, except through memory.<p>Text on a forum combines the worst of phone calls and books.<p>Not only is it easy to create and respond in real time (Like a phone, and unlike books or letters), but it is also persistent so people can read and participate in that moment of emotion repeatedly (like a phone call).<p>These are great and greatly bad depending on how they are used, but they are dramatically different from the way a phone call impacts human beings.<p>Which brings us to the second point - it isn&#x27;t only the information, it is the emotion, or in combination the &quot;content&quot; of speech on forums&#x2F;social media that matters.<p>Having actively tried to push for free speech and then managed speech, I can guarantee that without moderation, forums&#x2F;social spaces collapse. They fall victim to our neurology, and the scale of people on it.<p>So you can&#x27;t avoid the use of force here, the question is the amount of force being used, and whether it is commensurate to the specific event it is being used to mitigate.')
