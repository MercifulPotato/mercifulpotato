Just as D50 is red tinted.<p>That really depends on the viewer’s adaptation state.<p>&gt; So if users will view your rendered image surrounded by an rgb-white screen, if&#x2F;when the resulting small red&#x2F;yellow&#x2F;green&#x2F;white shift is problemaic, you might consider rendering using a non-standard 58K whitepoint. Just saw someone burned by this the other day, with a &quot;supposed to be white with a localized tint&quot; object (the Sun), which D65 then confused.<p>Isn’t that what the ICC’s relative rendering intent is supposed to take care of, if I understand what you mean?')
