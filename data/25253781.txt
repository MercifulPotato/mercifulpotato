I agree a 10 minutes walk might be considered far. Me though, for example, according to Google Maps I&#x27;m 20 mins from the 3 different stations (so not sure which one is closest) but I live just off a major street with 12 bus lines and I only live 2 mins from the bus stop. There&#x27;s a bus every ~2 min so I can get to the station they&#x27;re all going to usually in 6-8 minutes total travel time (though I haven&#x27;t ridden train or taken the bus since March). Many stations also have bike parking garages and you can get a monthly space so your 10-20 minute walk could be a 5-10 minute bike ride.')
