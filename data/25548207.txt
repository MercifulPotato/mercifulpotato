The problem was that it had to work for a very wide range of SQL statements, with arbitrary order clause, where clause and at least one join.<p>Offset pagination works fine in this scenario. But something like `where id &gt; 42 limit 100` fails with an arbitrary sorting order on non-unique columns. All I could do would be to generate the unpaginated result, then find the cursor within it, and take the limit after that. Which is too inefficient to be practical.<p>If I missed a decent solution, please tell.')
