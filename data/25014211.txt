Coming from .NET Go feels like a huge breath of fresh air and brought the fun back into programming. What I enjoy the most is the simplicity (not to be mistaken with the language being “simple”) and the vibrant OSS ecosystem. With Go I feel like I’m actually programming again and solving problems. My focus is to deliver value. With C# I feel like 50% of the time is spent understanding everything around it and mastering .NET with the anticipation that the next project will benefit from my expertise, but before the next project has arrived the .NET landscape has changed significantly enough so that I’m yet again spending 50% of my time mastering the language rather than building something cool.')
