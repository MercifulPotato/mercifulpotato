But nobody asked me.)<p>BLM may claim that it is in their rights to fight law and order if it causes harm to individuals.<p>Trump may claim it is in his right to complain about law and order when (in his opinion) it was not lawful.<p>(IMO, this is a finer line. He certainly can legally complain. Riots are over the line for either right or left)<p>Stripe processes payments for BLM, and Twitter allows their posts, etc. So IMO the line they walk is fine and biased.')
