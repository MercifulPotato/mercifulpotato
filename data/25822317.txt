COVID has been a persistent nightmare for many localities for the past 10 months. Nobody planned for this?<p>I can&#x27;t help but feel that the media is responsible for this also - when being informed that vaccines were on the way in the 2nd half of last year, they resoundingly pooh-poohed it and refused to consider the possibility, instead preferring to wallow in the world&#x27;s misery. It&#x27;s good for their advertising!<p>Really shameful all around.')
