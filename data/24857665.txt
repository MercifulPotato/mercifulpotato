I got a call purporting to be from Dynata that was a &quot;push poll&quot;, meaning they were basically using it to present really unflattering questions about a particular candidate. It had a pro right-wing, somewhat obliquely conspiratorial bent - &quot;How concerned are you about child sex trafficking?&quot; It also had more overt stuff, in the vein of &quot;Given that Joe Biden&#x27;s plans on the economy would destroy it, does that affect your preference for the two candidates?&quot; I asked them who was funding the poll, and they said they didn&#x27;t know.<p>I find myself curious about how that world works, but cursory google searches didn&#x27;t help, and I imagine it&#x27;s pretty murky. Would love to know who is funding those sorts of polls.')
