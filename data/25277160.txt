It exposed a problem you otherwise wouldn&#x27;t notice.<p>You were deploying offline artifacts to customers without giving the customer the version of the new artifact. Regardless of backend consistency, the customer will not be able to tell (from the URL, anyway) what version they are downloading. Nor will they be able to, say, download the old version if the new version introduces bugs. By changing your deployment method to use unique URLs per version, your customer gains useful functionality and you avoid having to depend on strong consistency (which actually removes expensive requirements).<p>If you design for weak consistency, your system ends up more resilient to multiple problems.')
