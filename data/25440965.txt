Thank you developers! It&#x27;s easy to configure and well documented, plus there are many nice extensions (like status bars).<p>With tiling window managers, for me it really is the predictability of where things are (e.g. emails are always on desktop 2 for me, browser on 1, etc.), keyboard navigation and the ability to configure all window related things in a single place &#x2F; config file. Not requiring to think much about how to organize windows to quickly have a useful view lowers the cognitive load for me (possibly not a problem for others). It also allows me to quickly build pseudo-IDEs, e.g. have a left pane with vim to edit a latex file while having a split pane on the right where in the top terminal I&#x27;d call &quot;lualatex &lt;file&gt;&quot; and have the evince&#x2F;zathura output of the file visible below and live-update.<p>Some random config details I use all the time:<p><pre><code>  # Lock screen with Ctrl+meta x, have background image\n  bindsym Control+$mod+x exec i3lock -i &lt;path&#x2F;to&#x2F;image&gt;\n  \n  # Show a floating calc terminal with Mod+c\n  for_window [instance=&quot;termite&quot; title=&quot;My Calculator&quot;] floating enable\n  bindsym $mod+c exec termite -t &quot;My Calculator&quot; -e calc\n  \n  # Show a floating units terminal with Mod+u\n  for_window [instance=&quot;termite&quot; title=&quot;My Units&quot;] floating enable\n  bindsym $mod+u exec termite -t &quot;My Units&quot; -e units\n  \n  # Allow quick back and forth (First Meta+Workspace-ID goes there, second goes back)\n  workspace_auto_back_and_forth yes\n  \n  # Use rofi to launch programs and find windows\n  bindsym $mod+d exec --no-startup-id i3-dmenu-desktop --dmenu=&#x27;rofi -i -show run -dmenu&#x27;\n  bindsym $mod+o exec --no-startup-id i3-dmenu-desktop --dmenu=&#x27;rofi -i -show window&#x27;\n  \n  # switch between the current and the previously focused workspace\n  bindsym $mod+b workspace back_and_forth\n  bindsym $mod+Tab workspace back_and_forth\n  \n  # invert the screen with Mod+i\n  bindsym $mod+i exec xrandr-invert-colors\n  \n  # toggle tiling &#x2F; floating for window with Mod + Shift + Space\n  bindsym $mod+Shift+space floating toggle\n  \n  # rename workspaces with Mod+t\n  bindsym $mod+t exec i3-input -F &#x27;rename workspace to %s&#x27; -P &#x27; New name: &#x27; -f &#x27;-*-*-*-*-*-*-28-*-*-*-*-*-*-*&#x27;\n  \n  # Gnome settings daemon helps us with keyrings and GTK themes\n  exec --no-startup-id &#x2F;usr&#x2F;lib&#x2F;gnome-settings-daemon&#x2F;gnome-settings-daemon\n  \n  # calendar with Mod+p\n  bindsym $mod+p workspace calendar; exec termite -e &#x27;ikhal\n  \n  # Make the currently focused window a scratchpad (a hidden floating desktop) with Mod+Shift+Minus\n  bindsym $mod+Shift+minus move scratchpad\n  \n  # Show the first scratchpad window (on any desktop show the first floating hidden window) with Mod+Minus\n  # Normally there is a floating terminal with vimwiki in the scratchpad\n  bindsym $mod+minus scratchpad show</code></pre>')
