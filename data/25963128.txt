Anything.<p>Go into that directory and type:<p><pre><code>  git log --reverse\n</code></pre>\nThen, for the first ten to fifteen commits&#x27; HASH, do:<p><pre><code>  git show HASH\n\n</code></pre>\nDo it for many projects that matter and that are useful and popular. You&#x27;ll find one thing in common: the structures in the &quot;initial commit&quot; are most likely long gone.<p>Obsessing about getting things right in order to get started makes prevents you from getting started and getting things done. This is a malady.<p>None of what you are obsessing about matters or will survive.<p>You want to start? Write a text file where you explain what your code does, then write the code that does it. If you are writing a library, give usage examples of the API. Shop it around if you&#x27;re building it for others [does this make sense to you?]. Then write the backend to make that API real.<p>But, a great way to start is to write code snippets and functions that do what you want, put them in a utils file, add to it, and then refactor it.')
