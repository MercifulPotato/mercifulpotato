Yes, of course they don&#x27;t restore normal colour vision. They can&#x27;t possibly work <i>iff</i> that&#x27;s the goal.<p>Look at the frequency responses of cone cells in a human with normal colour vision: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Color_vision#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:Cone-fundamentals-with-srgb-spectrum.svg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Color_vision#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:Cone-...</a><p>Those already have a very high overlap. A lot of people with red-green colour blindness still have those two types of cones working quite well individually, but the overlap is even more extreme. What these glasses do is filter out photons that fall in these overlapping regions. This amplifies the difference in responses from different cone cells.<p>I don&#x27;t know about what marketing claims were made by that particular company. Maybe some were plain wrong; maybe they were correct but overhyped with a tendency to mislead. Maybe some of those YT videos aren&#x27;t as ‘organic’ as they seem, but dramatic reenactments incentivised by some PR douche handing out free samples. All I know is that it&#x27;s not implausible that someone is happy because they can finally tell grey from purple for the first time. I&#x27;d encourage interested consumers to check out other brands first, but no idea if those even exist in the consumer eyewear market. Maybe Enchroma are sitting on a patent? Anyway, try before you buy.<p>By the way, I would have been surprised if that Wikipedia article actually said ‘they can&#x27;t possibly work‘. That&#x27;s not the case — it contains a quote with that claim. It&#x27;s cool to shorten a quotation to just the relevant parts, but please try to not invent ‘alternative facts‘ in the process.<p>&gt; <i>like a deaf person hearing for the first time</i><p>Yeah, definitely not. Once upon a time, my headphones and earphones failed simultaneously and I spent a couple of weeks listening to podcasts through busted earbuds, in shit quality, mostly one ear at a time. Then I got proper IEMs and finally could hear music again. In stereo. Experience <i>all</i> the instruments. That felt quite good. I guess it&#x27;s more like that. Except it would be for the first time ever. I can see how that would prompt an emotional response.')
