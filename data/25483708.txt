Jetbrains has been on a multiyear journey (documented with fantastic blog posts) to move Resharper out-of-process but there&#x27;s still overhead in maintaining separate systems working on the same project space.<p>Rider bypasses all of the process limitations and syncing overhead by using the Resharper&#x2F;C# logic exclusively, and is much faster and more responsive as a result.<p>Also VS has been slowly copying Resharper features but is still far behind. I mostly use VS today for heavy debugging where it still excels.')
