If a Russian agent with a secret invisibility cloak powered off the freedom of the countries they invade sneaked into Hunter&#x27;s room at night, killed his dog, and stole his laptop, I don&#x27;t care.<p>Maybe the repairman story is parallel construction maybe it&#x27;s not, but I think the emails are real and Biden&#x27;s Campaign response is a pathetic attempt at pointing to a scarecrow. It&#x27;s as bad as Chinavirus in my hierarchy of sins, it&#x27;s fuel for America&#x27;s systemic racism and exceptionalism which are the energy that fuels the reactor that will make this country blow up.')
