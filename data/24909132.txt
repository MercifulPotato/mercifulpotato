Though I am not surprised. The Teams client is pretty bad. It&#x27;s slow and clunky. It tries to do way too much while succeeding at very few things.<p>The desktop client chat _still_ doesn&#x27;t have a &quot;reply to message&quot; feature, while the mobile client has had it for, what, more than a year? This is a feature that _should_ cost a competent engineer no more than what, a week? to implement. The team should take a note out of Discord&#x27;s or Telegram&#x27;s book to improve the chat experience. It&#x27;s really very bad.<p>In the meantime the latest noticeable additions were mostly fluff like extra ways to show webcam stream backgrounds, and a &quot;cinema-like&quot; webcam-view.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that the same company can produce both Teams, being pretty bad, and VS Code, being very good.')
