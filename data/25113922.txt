We&#x27;re damned either way.<p>Any long-term effects from a vaccine seems unlikely to be as bad as the virus itself.<p>But still, is that really the answer? That there&#x27;s no way to know about long-term effects until it&#x27;s been out there for decades? I was kinda hoping there was an answer like &quot;what we know from other vaccines is that any bad effects almost always show up in first few months -- never, or almost never, many years down the line.&quot;')
