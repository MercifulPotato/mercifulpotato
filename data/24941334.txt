It&#x27;s been fantastic. We&#x27;re a similar setup to a lot of the top links on there (actix-web over juniper for graphql resolving with sqlx). While the speed is incredible, the biggest improvement has been the types system. I&#x27;ve never had such an easy experience being able to pick and choose libraries based on shared traits - eg we could authorize on jwt using jsonwebtoken, load fairly complex migrated relational data into our nice models, and even wrote the crate phpass so we could keep some accounts created back when we were a WordPress blog working.<p>The strict typing in graphql has made dataloaders orders of magnitude faster. The same code that makes our business logic clear makes it easy to figure out if graphql needs to resolve all those nodes with individual sql queries, one against the parent node, build some `IN (?,?,?,?)` prepared statement, or resolve from cache. String manipulation is definitely a bit harder, but otherwise the experience as a web app developer has been amazing.')
