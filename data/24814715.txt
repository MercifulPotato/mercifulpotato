It turns out that faculty positions are competitive enough at the elites that few make it in without cheating. There has been a steady decline in research integrity (with a parallel incline in research impact) as competition went up.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what to do about it. I know MIT better than Stanford, and fixing the culture would involve firing a big chunk of the faculty. You can&#x27;t fire tenured faculty, even if you could get people to acknowledge the problem.<p>Integrity at 2nd and 3rd tier schools is still a lot higher, but we do need to fix incentive structures, or the rot will take over academia.<p>Softer disciplines (like social sciences) are way ahead of harder disciplines like CS on the rot curve. In CS, it&#x27;s a lot harder to bake data.')
