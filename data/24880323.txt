People are.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to say that &quot;the EC was about slavery&quot; is a correct narrative or even more valid than &quot;it was about states&quot;. The point I&#x27;m trying to make is unrelated to the specific question about the EC and slavery. The point I&#x27;m trying to make is that there are <i>hundreds</i> of narratives for almost every historical event. Motivations that range from the smallest microhistory to the largest historical narratives. And that &quot;APUS said it was about X&quot; is going to miss a whole lot of interesting scholarship.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not trying to make any statement about the EC. I&#x27;m trying to make a broader suggestion about the limitations of high school history classes.')
