I actually live in a University town. We have tons of students all &quot;working remotely&quot; within a single mile radius of campus, and many of them are connected together by our campus intranet -- the University does wireless point-to-multipoint links to connect all of these random housing options (which include large buildings they simply bought in the community) -- which is something I think we could easily push to include more buildings. I bet we could easily pull off 2ms networking overhead.<p>(And no: you are wrong about round trip. If you care about round trip time then 3ms of round trip by sound is so close that the violin player is going to be elbowing the singer. Sound is fundamentally slow, and you need to just accept that.)')
