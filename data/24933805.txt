The shop&#x27;s surveillance camera footage for the time period in question got wiped clean even though there&#x27;s footage from before and after.<p>And instead of just deleting the data and moving on with life, the owner held on to it for a year (no one does this) and then somehow (we still don&#x27;t know how) it ended up in the hands of Rudi Giuliani. And we can&#x27;t see it except for a couple of screenshots from imessage, but we&#x27;re told it&#x27;s damning. It got mailed to Tucker Carlson but somehow got lost in the mail.<p>Here&#x27;s the interview with the shop owner: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedailybeast.com&#x2F;man-who-reportedly-gave-hunters-laptop-to-rudy-speaks-out-in-bizarre-interview" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedailybeast.com&#x2F;man-who-reportedly-gave-hunter...</a><p>This is classic KGB&#x2F;FSB misinformation. It&#x27;s right out of the playbook.')
