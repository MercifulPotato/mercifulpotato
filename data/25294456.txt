The &quot;human&quot; way of thinking about it is it&#x27;s the last address in the subnet. The IP4 broadcast address for the current network (even if the client doesn&#x27;t known what it is) is 255.255.255.255.<p>Once the packet arrives at the destination subnet (which can be immediately or several routing hops away) it will (in the case of Ethernet) you&#x27;re right that&#x27;s to the FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF destination MAC.<p>In the case of DHCP client &lt;-&gt; server on different subnets there is a special &quot;DHCP relay&quot; role configured in the network and that relay is what handles broadcast to unicast conversions <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol#Relaying" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Pro...</a>')
