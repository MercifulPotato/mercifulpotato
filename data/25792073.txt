I recently got this book to get into ARM assembly language, with the long-term goal of using it on an M1 Mac, I barely could resist on getting a MacBook Air immediately :). Right now, I am setting up a Raspberry Pi 400 for first experiments. Unfortunately, it still ships with a 32 bit install.<p>While the differences between a M1 Mac and Linux-ARM machine are small, it is very nice to have the examples ported and especially tested on the Mac, as especially during learning a small mistake can be difficult to be noticed.')
