That would be a failure to teach them responsibility, and yes, that teaches entitlement.  This is about seeing yourself as a willing helper, the extra support that our children need to practice or to be willing to do it themselves.<p>It&#x27;s not clear to me that just changing the way we see ourselves will actually achieve anything. Even if we see ourselves as &quot;willing helpers&quot;, the child might take that to reinforce their view that everyone should be helping them willingly.<p>I love thoughtful mini-essays, and this is one of those. I just think that in this case the author reaches the wrong conclusions.')
