If the people who are passionate about a language are the ones who pursue its advanced features (and therefore somehow force them on the rest of the world), who then is left to &quot;actually build shit&quot;? Why, if simple functionality is such a strong requirement of productivity, aren&#x27;t those who stick to simple features productive enough to maintain an ecosystem without the Architecture Astronauts building all the infrastructure?<p>It doesn&#x27;t track that it&#x27;s possible to simultaneously ruin a language by sabotaging all of its major libraries with novel features if writing code using novel features is actually incredibly difficult. It certainly doesn&#x27;t track that, once you have somehow sabotaged a language&#x27;s major libraries, that nobody bothers to &quot;fix&quot; them by introducing a new, simpler version.')
