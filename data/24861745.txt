You&#x27;ll need to show your net worth somehow, so that the IRS (or equivalent) knows not to tax you. Otherwise I could assure you that I totally only have $1M in assets, with definitely no Swiss bank account or yachts.<p>I will admit to not knowing much about a wealth tax, so maybe there is an established solution here.
