We believe there are consequences of this action... the end result was the decision that got made by the project »<p>Something doesn&#x27;t seem right, if CentOS is really a project capable of making its own decisions as he&#x27;s trying to make it appear.<p>If that was the case, I wouldn&#x27;t expect that the first thing the public to hear about the change would be the announcement that CentOS-in-its-previous-form was being discontinued.<p>I would expect to hear the board saying « Red Hat say they&#x27;re no longer going to invest in CentOS in its current form. If nobody comes forward to invest with money or staff, we&#x27;ll have to discontinue it. »')
