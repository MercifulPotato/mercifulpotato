If I sold Bob a billion XRP for 1 penny, then I sold Tim 1 XRP for $40, then told Bob not to sell, and Tim can sell his for $40 (because he wants to at least get that much back), then XRP&#x27;s &quot;market cap&quot; is worth $40 Billion, but in reality it&#x27;s probably worth $40.<p>I get that there is a lot more money in it than that, but let&#x27;s be honest about something, if half the people sold Bitcoin tonight - they HAVE to get out today, it&#x27;s &quot;market cap&quot; would likely go from nearly half-trillion to probably $300M overnight. Even though technically it should only cut in half right?')
