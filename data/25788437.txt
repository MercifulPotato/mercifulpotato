Fully understanding the distinction between client and server is one such nuance.<p>When it comes to coding, the bottleneck is essentially never the tool, it&#x27;s almost always the person.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever met anyone who was naturally good at thinking logically. Working close to the hardware and then working your way up the stack is one of the best ways to develop the required level of nuanced logical thinking.<p>The problem with no-code, low-code or tools which try to move away from the underlying reality is that they don&#x27;t train your logical thinking skills.<p>In my view, tools should help people develop into better programmers, not give an illusion of ease and mastery when it is not deserved.')
