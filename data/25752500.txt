Item(by='puzzlingcaptcha', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610481187, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25749367, text='$150 (roughly the cost of APU2+case+power brick+16GB SSD) for a t620 would be daylight robbery. I got the non-plus variant on the secondary market for $30 delivered and it works very well, uses roughly the same CPU as APU2 as well (4-core AMD Jaguar derivative, AES-NI &amp; AVX extensions). Power usage is 6W idle (headless), 12W full-load. UEFI is basic but functional, I can boot Linux straight from the EFI boot entry.<p>t620 Plus has a PCIe riser so would be better suited for a network gateway.<p>The Wyse equivalents from that era would be Zx0Q&#x2F;Dx0Q series although I don&#x27;t think they had a PCIe version.<p>Another interesting option is something like Fujitsu Futro S9010&#x2F;S940 (4-core Goldmont, you get SHA ISA extensions which is nice), has a PCIe riser as well, but there are fewer of these on the secondary market.<p>I recommend this charmingly old-fashioned site for reference on old thin clients <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.parkytowers.me.uk&#x2F;thin&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.parkytowers.me.uk&#x2F;thin&#x2F;</a>')
