We don&#x27;t have world peace yet, and have plenty of countries that if not outright hostile in the rhetoric and stance, have the capacity to elect leaders who could change those stances. All of those countries have complex sets of relationships with one another, and its not a given that if your country is attacked (and is not the US or some other super power), that someone else will come and defend it. The concern over China is, of course, quite a bit more obvious given the _ongoing_ abuse of their own citizens.')
