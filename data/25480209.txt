Item(by='Geminidog', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608405145, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25479714, text='&gt; You spent so many words, yet you still side-step the main argument, and then further ridicule my argument by taking it out of context.<p>Nothing is being ridiculed here nor taken out of context. This is simply a misunderstanding by you.<p>As for the side stepping... It&#x27;s a matter of perspective. From my perspective you are the one side stepping because you didn&#x27;t even bring up the contradiction. So I&#x27;ll regurgitate your words right back you were side stepping the contradiction thank you for finally addressing the issue.<p>&gt;These are different contexts. I do not wish to read a 300 page manual when it can be described in 2 pages, similarly to not wanting to scan 10 pages worth of code that has hundreds of thousands of code I may be expected to have to look at. I require both enough energy and insight to solve the problem after reading.<p>Let&#x27;s frame the context here so that we both agree. The context is to communicate a concept to a reader WITHOUT being verbose. Code and English both live within this context because you use code to communicate to other programmers and you&#x27;re using English to communicate to me Right Now.<p>We can also agree that BOTH code and english can be over verbose.<p>Context Established.<p>&gt;This is a discussion forum. We write differently here. Information sharing is not our prime objective, unlike writing code.<p>Information sharing is the prime objective Of all written and verbal forms of communication. You need to understand this. There is zero point of writing anything if it is not communicating a point. Any form of communication is a form of information sharing, and english being a medium of communication which makes it a medium for information sharing.<p>Have you ever heard of &quot;Documentation&quot;? Documentation communicates the EXACT same information that code does but better because it&#x27;s in English and more verbose. That&#x27;s why Documentation often exists along side code. One can derive code from documentation and documentation from code.<p>&gt;Contradiction solved. Now, will you answer or continue to side-step?<p>Contradiction not solved. You still need to address it. English and programming occupy the same context with English actually being used within programming. Think about it, Programming is basically a shitty version of english that&#x27;s only used because a computer understands it. Nobody would be programming otherwise. If you can program a computer efficiently using English I guarantee you traditional programming languages will be thrown out the door within a day, nobody will use it anymore.<p>So the context that programming occupies is two fold. It occupies the same context as English to communicate with other people, and at the same time it also has to communicate with a computer. That is the prime difference. So why do we have reduce naming to some poetry contest when you can write a fully grammatically correct and clear sentence as function name and call it a day? We don&#x27;t do it in English why can&#x27;t we stop doing it in programming? The contradiction is still there and still invalidates all your points.<p>There is no logical reason why we shouldn&#x27;t bring programming up the same level of clarity and verbosity as English. The only thing stopping us are the technical limitations of the computer, so we should get as close as possible with what we currently have.')
