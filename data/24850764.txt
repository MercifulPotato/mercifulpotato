There are lots of companies that do games that game developers don&#x27;t consider to be game development. There are also a lot of companies that do interactive systems or gaming systems or augmented reality or puzzle systems. Some of this is in research, some of it is practical, some of it is war games, some of it is simulators. There are companies that do gamification of trivial tasks. If you expand your definition of being a game developer there&#x27;s lots of work out there.')
