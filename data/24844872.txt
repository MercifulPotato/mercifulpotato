Years ago Chrome had poor optimization around try-catch and this meant it couldn&#x27;t be used in the application I was working on, as we pretty much targeted only Chrome. I guess by the time async-await got into the engine try-catch was optimized enough and now this doesn&#x27;t seem to be an issue.<p>Hopefully this changes, even slowly, but it&#x27;ll probably take a while since Chrome&#x27;s got so much share.')
