Being a musician can involve an obsession for quality that can&#x27;t be explained in utilitarian terms.<p>One thing is that the audience only has to tolerate your sound for a couple of hours, and can always seek refuge at the bar or just go home. You have to hear it over and over, night after night. You also have to hear it at home. As an amateur, most of my playing time occurs in my own living room.<p>Another thing is that there&#x27;s a layer of the performance above the basic sound of the instruments, that the audience might perceive even if they can&#x27;t quite put their finger on what it is. It&#x27;s what separates a great performance from a dull one. We&#x27;re all trying to find what that thing is, and it involves exploration on many fronts, including how we choose and optimize our instruments.')
