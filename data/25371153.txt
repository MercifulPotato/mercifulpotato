Instead, Republicans are alleging that the way the election itself was conducted in four swing states violated the Constitution.<p>The election changes were made due to the COVID pandemic, and the number of votes affected by the changes were obtained by the certified election results in each state, those vote totals are not in dispute, and those vote totals are large enough to put the results in each state in doubt.<p>So what the Supreme Court is being asked to do is declare those votes invalid. Whether they will take the case or rule in favor of Republicans is extremely unlikely according to virtually all legal and media expertsâ€¦but the same was true for <i>Bush v. Gore</i> and we all know how that turned out.')
