Moving from the Merkle–Damgård construction to Sponge construction for hashes is one way to deliver another unspecified requirement - preventing length extension attacks.<p><i>Way</i> too often in cryptography when somebody is sure that they don&#x27;t need a big complicated system with a bunch of features it turns out actually they just didn&#x27;t understand their full requirements, and as those become clear all the baggage they were pleased to be rid of turns out to have been necessary all along.')
