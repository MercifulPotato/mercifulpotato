Although the article equates fee splitting as the American rule, there&#x27;s technically no such rule for transactions, but it does represent the general American sentiment on the subject, which is that parties should bear their own costs. Requiring the weaker party in a transaction to shoulder the financial load of a dominant party may be a common capitalistic practice, but it&#x27;s not an American ideal.')
