Every country that imposes lockdowns on the premise that they were forced, that they didn&#x27;t have a choice, they just had to stop the disease from spreading. But very few countries have indicated they have a plan for how to permanently stop the disease from spreading - in most countries, experts believe that there <i>is</i> no workable plan and the disease will spread for decades at least. So how can we be confident that lockdowns won&#x27;t continue for a few years until they just become the status quo?')
