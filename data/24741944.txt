I&#x27;ve got a lost mouse (the package was delivered empty), Amazon immediately refunded. I had other packages not delivered at all with other retailers, and they wouldn&#x27;t refund until they enquired with the delivery company, which had to do an internal investigation. And some of them wouldn&#x27;t refund but gave vouchers instead.<p>Also, Amazon returns are refunded as soon as the package is scanned at the post office, not 2 or 3 weeks after.<p>I&#x27;d really like to buy from a French company, but every time I try, they go out of their way to send me back to Amazon.')
