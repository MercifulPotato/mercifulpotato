They are de facto fascists.<p>Jesus that&#x27;s insane. No, no they are not. Do you not see the danger we&#x27;re about to enter into? You&#x27;re saying 70 million people are &quot;de factor fascists&quot; .. what the fuck does that even mean?!<p>Have you been out to a farm in Tennessee? Have you ever walked with a group of friends through the blue watering holes of Georgia? Have you broke bread and had dinner with them? I grew up in Tennessee. I will no condemn the views of 70 million people I do not know because the TV tells me they are &quot;fascists,&quot; which is pretty much Orwellian DoubleSpeak and means absolutely nothing today.<p>You do not know these people. If you did, you would not say such things. You are trapped in a bubble where you are scared out of your mind, and that fear will help this republic fall and strip rights away from every human being in America and maybe even the world over the next four years.')
