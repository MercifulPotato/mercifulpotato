Despite the prosthelytization you&#x27;ll get from many died-in-the-wool users who forgot what it was like in the beginning, in order to use NixOS effectively you either need to learn Nix, or be willing to spend a lot of time on IRC asking questions, which will end up with... you learning Nix. That&#x27;s the reality. I think I spent something like 3 weeks porting my server configuration from Ubuntu to NixOS, by hand, piece by piece, many years ago. Admittedly I think we&#x27;re better off than we were 7 years ago, but it&#x27;s still not a grand slam. Even things like basic GUI installers that can set up your filesystem don&#x27;t exist! Manually screwing with partition layouts to get volume encryption isn&#x27;t easy to use at all, honestly.<p>There are an array of flaws with the tools but, despite that, they are unbelievable powerful and you can do things in NixOS you can&#x27;t dream of doing elsewhere, and it makes things like using OpenZFS or whatever <i>pretty easy and simple</i>. And it makes some thing far more difficult than that, nearly trivial. But only once you know what you&#x27;re doing. But that&#x27;s just the reality: it&#x27;s an extremely powerful tool that has many rough edges. Saying it&#x27;s &quot;the easiest distro to use&quot; is a complete joke, and I wish fellow NixOS users didn&#x27;t have some weird propensity to practically lie about how good it is on that front. I say this as someone who has been a NixOS developer and user for like, ~7 years and who apparently(?!) has over 1,000 commits to the tree now, too. Trying to actually sit down at a terminal and sell unconvinced people on it opened my eyes quite a bit. It&#x27;s good, but lying about what it is and isn&#x27;t is a good way to burn peoples faith.')
