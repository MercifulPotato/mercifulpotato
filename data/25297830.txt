Your user isn&#x27;t privileged enough to disable it which is why you need to boot into recovery mode in order to disable it. This feature isn&#x27;t unique to MacOS, either [1].<p>And of course, if you don&#x27;t like it, you can disable it once and never have to think about it again! At worst you&#x27;re running with true root privileges, which isn&#x27;t different from linux.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, Yabai&#x27;s tiling actually works fine without disabling SIP. Your link enumerates the features that requires disabling SIP.<p>&gt; But, my experience has often been that things I would be willing to invest to customize on macOS are simply not customizeable.<p>A lot of the time it&#x27;s definitely more convoluted to customize MacOS though i am curious what sorts of things you are trying to customize that you couldn&#x27;t.<p>&gt; (as to the &#x27;your time is money!&#x27; counterargument people sometimes make here - it takes me about 2 hours to build a PC and my linux box hasn&#x27;t panicked or booted improperly once).<p>When people say &quot;your time is money&quot; with regards to using Linux, it&#x27;s rarely about building a computer and generally has to do with using the OS itself. \x1f<p>&gt; TLDR; You&#x27;re probably right. Macs aren&#x27;t a great choice if you&#x27;re a power user (read: control freak) with your PC.<p>I think it&#x27;s more that it&#x27;s not a great choice if you don&#x27;t want to invest the same amount of time you&#x27;ve invested in learning how to be a power user in a different operating system.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freebsd.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;en_US.ISO8859-1&#x2F;books&#x2F;faq&#x2F;security.html#idp64321744" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freebsd.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;en_US.ISO8859-1&#x2F;books&#x2F;faq&#x2F;securi...</a>')
