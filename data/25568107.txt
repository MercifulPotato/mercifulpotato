All feedback is really welcome. Firefox is supported.

It&#x27;s on my list...<p>With respect to your highlighting results: I am aware that it can be a hit or miss at this stage. I&#x27;ve had really mixed feedback so far and I do have a theory that the quality of results may depend on the kind of writing (which is odd, bit I digress).
