I think people dismiss it as not being on the same level as chess or go because of the &quot;chance element,&quot; but that element is probably better described as &quot;management of risk&quot; or &quot;the calculation of risk,&quot; and it is remarkably deep.<p>And while it&#x27;s true that a novice can beat a grandmaster in a single game, you can be sure that you would have been destroyed in six games by a player like Natanzon.<p>The other nice thing about it is that while two strong players can break each other&#x27;s brains over it for hours, it&#x27;s also a fantastic casual game that&#x27;s just good fun with coffee and conversation (as it is throughout much of the Middle and Near East).<p>I&#x27;m always hoping it undergoes a resurgence one of these days.  Stranger things have happened!')
