We have a number of big and small features that require planning, intuition, and excellent programming skills to get right. We&#x27;re all experienced in our fields (including a Rails rockstar you&#x27;ll be working with that&#x27;s built much of our current platform) and are looking to bring on someone excited to build&#x2F;augment features that will quickly become customer-facing. A few examples of upcoming backlog items:<p>* data aggregation and display<p>* machine learning<p>* site performance improvements<p>It&#x27;s a really exciting place to work at a very exciting time in the company&#x27;s life! Boston-local preferred (remote during the pandemic either way), but remote could work with the right person.<p>If this sounds interesting, reach out to me (CTO) at andrey@bldup.com! I&#x27;m specifically looking for an engineer, but if you&#x27;re great at sales&#x2F;marketing&#x2F;content creation and our platform sounds interesting to you, reach out and I&#x27;ll be happy to connect you with the appropriate person!')
