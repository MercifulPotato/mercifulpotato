Our main focus right now is making Google’s index of the web available for use by competitors, since no one other than Google is really allowed to crawl the web. If people were allowed to use the index to build what they want, then you or somebody else would be able to build a search engine that avoids the Pinterest cruft and would be more suited to your needs, instead of Google’s one size fits all approach. So, to answer your question directly, yes we do have some ideas about how to do this.')
