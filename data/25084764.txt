If it is advertised as a &quot;tip&quot; box, it should result in exactly that amount of gain to the driver than if $0 were entered in that box. How much you, the corporation, pays, should never depend on what I fill in for the tips.<p>Also, if the company <i>can</i> pay $15, they should pay $15, and recruiting me to pay part of that $15 under the guise of &quot;tips&quot; is unethical IMO. Call it a delivery fee and charge a fixed amount.<p>If you are asking me how much extra I want to pay in tips to a driver (10%, 15%, or 20%), I would be sympathetic to gig workers, because you&#x27;re an asshole for paying them a $1 base wage.<p>If you are asking me how much extra I want pay to your asshole corporation, the answer will always be 0%. I don&#x27;t want to pay any extra to your corporation. Name your lowest price that would keep your company afloat and I&#x27;ll decide if I want the service or not.')
