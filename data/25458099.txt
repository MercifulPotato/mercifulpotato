Period. That would be highly illegal.<p>This is more like you want to buy something at 100. Robinhood then goes to the market and looks at all the vendors. The vendors are selling at various prices. Robinhood has a relationship with one of the vendors so they went there and that vendor was willing to sell at 98. However, a vendor down the street (that Robinhood doesn&#x27;t like) would have been willing to sell at 97.<p>None of that is illegal. What the SEC is arguing here is that Robinhood didn&#x27;t tell the customers this when they advertised &quot;commision-free&quot; trades. In Robinhood&#x27;s eyes, they didn&#x27;t charge a commission, so this was accurate. But in the SEC eyes, the customer was paying a &quot;hidden&quot; commission because they would get a slightly worse price than if they went with a different broker.<p>Imagine you are Fidelity... All of a sudden, you have Robinhood advertising &quot;commission-free&quot; and you just lost a good chunk of business from retail traders. You then complain to the SEC because the advertising here is not entirely accurate - the customers might have even gotten a better price with Fidelity - even if you add in the commission.<p>FTA:\n&gt; The order finds that Robinhood provided inferior trade prices that in aggregate deprived customers of $34.1 million even after taking into account the savings from not paying a commission.')
