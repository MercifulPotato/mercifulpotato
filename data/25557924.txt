Item(by='KMag', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609148315, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25555229, text='What about something like having fixed 64-bit instruction bundles, where the first 4 bits indicate if it contains 4x15-bit, 3x20-bit, or 2x30-bit instructions?  This limits the combinatorial explosion in cases hardware needs to handle for variable-width decoding (effects don&#x27;t cross 64-bit boundaries).  One could reserve some of those 4-bit patterns for indicating instruction dependencies (a la EPIC&#x2F;Itanium) and&#x2F;or indicating extended functional units with completely different opcodes (similar to EPIC&#x2F;Itanium opcodes having completely different meaning if marked as FPU instructions).<p>Presumably some of the 4-bit prefix patterns would indicate that the final instruction in the bundle was an immediate value instead of an instruction.<p>Alternatively, one could take a page form Sun&#x27;s MAJC playbook and shorten the opcode of the first instruction in the 64-bit bundle by 2 bits to indicate 4x16-bit, 2x32-bit, 16+16+32-bit or 32+16+16-bit instructions in the bundle.')
