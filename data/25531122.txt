Employees and customers are who the company should be serving. It isn&#x27;t &quot;employees at the cost of customers&quot;, or vice versa. If your business can&#x27;t do both it shouldn&#x27;t exist. In this case the thought was &quot;It&#x27;s worth making employees upset because this addresses a real customer concern&quot;.<p>2. Phishing tests are silly. You should just assume someone will get phished. If you want to do trainings, do trainings. Or, better yet, make phishing pointless - at my company anything important is gated by a U2F token, among other things. We are simply &#x27;immune&#x27; to most types of phishing - the one major source left being wire transfer fraud, which is fairly easy to avoid.<p>We only do phishing training for compliance purposes.<p>3. This is the wrong kind of security. It&#x27;s &quot;blame the user&quot; security. It&#x27;s a silly, backwards, outdated, ineffective attitude.<p>If the goal is &quot;Make sure people report phishing&quot;, you can do that without trickery. Just send an email and request that users report it to whoever is responsible - you&#x27;ll soon find who does or does not know how to do so.<p>4. (Editing in) Security teams should be aware of how what they&#x27;re going to do is impacting the company. The impact of this phishing test has had <i>public impact</i> on the company - that&#x27;s a disaster. A security team is about managing risk, and here they&#x27;ve instead subjected the company to concrete, public scrutiny. This was simply the wrong call.<p>Having trust in your security team is really important. Security teams need to do outreach, they need to be friendly, and be people who everyone feels good about going to with a problem. Building animosity for the sake of phishing protection is far more dangerous.<p>&gt; If this was a real phish they&#x27;d have leaked real data. Perhaps even your data.<p>That&#x27;s the security team&#x27;s problem, not the victims!')
