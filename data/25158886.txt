They first called getThing(), which might return null, and then passed the result to doSomethingWithThing(), which did not expect a null. That sounds like a &quot;flow&quot; problem to me, and TypeScript literally would&#x27;ve warned them of it.<p>(Since this particular combination of functions is likely to be common, we added a runtime check for people who aren&#x27;t using TypeScript now.)<p>&gt; Most devs using it have never seen vanilla js and are more java minded that prototype minded.<p>I think you might be underestimating the number of people who strongly dislike Java&#x27;s type system but very much appreciate TypeScript. They&#x27;re very different, and hence it&#x27;s very much possible to like the latter for reasons that do not apply to the former, or to dislike the former for reasons that do not apply to the latter.')
