I&#x27;ve showed that the left, which is most of the media and the democrats, encouraged the riots and set the precedent of using violence to achieve political goals.<p>(Local) democrats demonized the police as enemy of the people. Kamala Harris encouraged her millions of Twitter followers to donate to a Minnesota crowd-funding effort that paid bail for accused rioters. Both local and national media rigidly only referred to the far-left rioters as “protesters.” The Associated Press, which sets guidelines for journalists, amended its stylebook to discourage use of the word “riot,” given protesters’ “underlying grievances.” It took months before Biden condemned the riots and he only did it when he started to drop in the polls. In Portland BLM&#x2F;Antifa rioted for months and they even tried to storm into a federal courthouse downtown several nights in a row. The respons of the mayor wasn&#x27;t to condemn the riots but to tell Trump to take his “troops” and leave. \nThose showing righteous indignation now only months or weeks ago argued that the riots were “mostly peaceful” and that vandalism and looting don’t count as violence.<p>And it seems people have forgotten it&#x27;s not the first time government building have been occupied to prevent a vote.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;wokal_distance&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347107498134630400" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;wokal_distance&#x2F;status&#x2F;134710749813463040...</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2011_Wisconsin_protests" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2011_Wisconsin_protests</a><p>My point isn&#x27;t to defend what happened but to point out the hypocrisy and double-speak.')
