Copyright gives the holder the rights over the ability &quot;to perform the copyrighted work publicly&quot; (directly from US law). The wording from the law on public performances: &quot;to perform or display it at a place open to the public or at any place where a substantial number of persons outside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is gathered&quot;. Even in the strictest interpretation of the law, no reasonable judge&#x2F;lawyer would find that singing to a single friend would meet this criteria. So someone can absolutely sing a copyrighted song to a friend without being in violation of copyright law. You can even do so with a group of friends (as long as it is what is deemed a normal circle of family&#x2F;friends).')
