I just mean basic language support is not reasonable to be considered a pro feature. There are many other advanced features to imagine.<p>E.g. I would gladly pay for being able to load a custom auto-completion dictionary file, for an additional programmable row of keys (where I could put anything including whole phrases, selection&#x2F;search&#x2F;replace macroses and system keys like Ctrl and F1-F12), gamepad-like split-overlay for the landscape mode (like in SwiftKey) etc.<p>I also consider requiring a credit card to start a trial so you could auto-charge once the user fails to cancel in time a soft kind of fraud but this practice is so widespread I can&#x27;t blame anyone.<p>Using more than one language&#x2F;script, however, is not a choice nor an attribute of a pro user, it&#x27;s a basic thing every keyboard is meant to allow.')
