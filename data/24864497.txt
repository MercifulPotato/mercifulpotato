In fact, a lot of merchants saw the third-party domain as a status thing.<p>An argument against custom domains being a &quot;premium&quot; feature, then?  If you <i>don&#x27;t</i> have a paid plan, then you <i>have</i> to bring your own domain.  Paying gets you the *.example.com status symbol.  Makes sense — a custom domain usually requires technical expertise and some amount of inconvenience for users (not unlike a services company that publishes their source code to GitHub, which you can always set up and maintain for yourself, but if you want to use the company&#x27;s hosted services, then you have to pay).  Another part of the value proposition would be, &quot;You&#x27;re gonna have to spend money one way or another — either to a registrar or to us — so why not let it be us?&quot;')
