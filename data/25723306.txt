That&#x27;s _exactly_ what they are supposed to be.<p>A place where you can safely get lost in ecstatic bliss, altered states of consciousness and the sometimes-difficult psychological territory of self discovery that typically follows these experiences.<p>The guard rails are put there by people who have travelled the road before and know what the pitfalls are.<p>For anyone curious about that (from a Christian monastery context):<p>*  Cloud of Unknowing (Anonymous)<p>*  The Dark Night of the Soul (St. John of the Cross)<p>*  The Interior Castle (Teresa of √Åvila)<p>Similar material exists for guiding e.g. Buddhist monks through the sort of territory that comes up when people spend a lot of time alone in contemplation (The Visuddhimagga, The Vimuttimagga in the Theravada tradition, The Tibetan Book of the Dead in the Vajrayana tradition).<p>Shamanic traditions likewise have very strict schedules of diet and spiritual preparation before aspirants can consume psychedelics - and ceremonies are (traditionally) performed under exquisitely controlled conditions.<p>Incidentally - westerners who play with meditative technologies or &quot;psychedelic&quot; therapies absent a regular, working relationship with a guide who know the territory do so at their own peril, IMO.<p>Thousands of years of contemplative and meditative practice have yielded independently arising systems in many different cultures which call for a controlled environment where a practitioner is surrounded by peers who know what to do, and more importantly what _not_ to do when things get a bit weird.<p>That&#x27;s JUST for the individual practitioner.<p>Now add another layer for &quot;things that can go wrong when trying to manage &#x2F; lead a large community of people doing these things together&quot;.<p>Many mystical traditions (particularly eastern ones) solve this problem by having rules about how long monks and abbots can stay in one place.<p>Here, we see some western solutions to the common problems of community governance (at least: the sorts of problems one was likely to encounter at the time).<p>I&#x27;ve meandered really widely around the point! :)<p>Really I just wanted to call out that there is a valid (within the context of the goals of spiritual practice) use for a very controlled environment that should be considered separately from the common understanding of &quot;religious control&quot; (i.e. the powerful and political abusing religious devices to exert control over the masses).')
