In this case on memory access. Most (all?) async software assumes the CPU can&#x27;t block. A modern CPU has a pipelining mechanism, where parts can simply block, waiting for e.g. memory to return. If you want to handle this all nicely, you have to respect the api of this process which happens to go through the OS. So for example, while waiting for your memory page to be loaded, the OS can run another thread (which it can&#x27;t in the async case because there isn&#x27;t any other thread).')
