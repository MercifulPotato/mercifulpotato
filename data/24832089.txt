One issue with games for that system is that graphics are in black and white, but then again so were Space Invaders, Pong, and Asteroids! Not to mention the first version of Tetris. Apple&#x27;s original Macintosh still had monochrome (but much more detailed) graphics, and many interesting games were made for it.<p>Most computer game companies were probably tiny in the early 1980s.<p>It is interesting to think about what the computer industry would look like today if Commodore, Radio Shack and other companies&#x2F;platforms had managed to keep up with Apple (and DOS&#x2F;Windows) over the long term.<p>&gt; Tandy otherwise kept all technical information secret, hoping to monopolize third-party development<p>Didn&#x27;t many vintage computers (and other electronics) come with schematics so you could troubleshoot&#x2F;repair the machines and&#x2F;or design your own expansions?')
