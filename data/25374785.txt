T&quot;<p>This is a ridiculously false statement.<p>Everyone wants zoning laws, you can&#x27;t put up a gas station or an industrial facility right in the middle of xyz residential neighbourhood, nobody wants that.<p>&quot;Yes my point is that they didn’t, and now they’re paying the ridiculous cost&quot;<p>So you&#x27;re saying that people are making a choice, but because you&#x27;re not happy with the choice, they should change?<p>Are you arguing for rights or not? Which is it?<p>SF residents wanting to keep zoning laws intact are making their own choices, and that&#x27;s fine.<p>&quot;Calling high density planning short sighted in favour of single family dwellings is absurd.&quot;<p>Just the opposite when in fact the citizens are adamant that their city not turn into Hong Kong.<p>&quot;This mindset is what causes suburbia, which has an absolutely disastrous impact on the environment and local economies&quot;<p>Total rubbish.
