I built an app back in 2012 called iFeelio for emotional micro-journaling and one of the goals I set for it was for me (and then others) to get better at expressing how I felt so I didn&#x27;t have to use the app anymore. As you expressed on Quirk&#x27;s Github readme, that doesn&#x27;t jive with a subscription-based model: if people improve, they stop paying. I also didn&#x27;t want to make the app addictive, another thing that seems to clash with the subscription model.<p>One thing I contemplated but didn&#x27;t have the courage to do was to charge a very high initial price to use the app. It was on Android at the time and I wanted to charge the max price, which I think was like ~$200, to download the app, one time.<p>Did you think about doing something similar? What alternatives did you contemplate to the subscription model? Is there a way to price it with an anticipated 3-month retention or other time-limited retention?<p>Would love to hear any thoughts you have on this!')
