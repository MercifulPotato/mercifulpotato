Jot down everything you eat - it helps motivate you to not eat poorly.<p>Measure everything - well, as much as you can.  I used some Omron body composition scales - probably not hugely accurate in the absolute, but more than sufficiently accurate in the relative.<p>So I have a google spreadsheet that over the space of 18 months has daily weigh-in data, and very detailed descriptions of everything I ate each day.  (It was quite the adventure, though I&#x27;d be unlikely do it again.)<p>I reiterate -- this graph shows changes in my mass during a period where I was never calorie-counting, never felt hungry, wasn&#x27;t in keto, and felt the approach could be sustained long-term without threatening sanity.  My modest amount of exercise - the occasional bicycle ride - did not change during this period.<p>Viz.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jeddi.org&#x2F;c&#x2F;2013-01-01-4hb-mass.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jeddi.org&#x2F;c&#x2F;2013-01-01-4hb-mass.png</a>')
