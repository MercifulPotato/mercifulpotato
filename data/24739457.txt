These stories and their kin across the world comprise humanity&#x27;s first attempts at formalizing ergodic reasoning. They were technically incorrect, but only insomuch that they didn&#x27;t have as much to work with as we do. I also think most miss the important bits about genesis, the part where our consciousness became a binary machine of good-for-me &#x2F; bad-for-me projected over time (whereas before the machine merely had some limited scratch memory), how that relates to scarcity in the story of Cain and Abel, and how that really sort of mucked things up for humans as far as war and horrific things go. Genesis is primarily about the birth of human consciousness. Eve gained knowledge first, not because of some sexist nonsense, but because it&#x27;s a &quot;good&quot; thing for women to project about the well-being of themselves and their offspring. This &quot;good&quot; thing however, was witnessed by men who then killed each other over achieving that &quot;good&quot; status. It&#x27;s a story concerning the origin of all material conflict, the bridge between beast and man, and the evolutionary impetus for the development of all intelligence.')
