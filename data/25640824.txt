We use it at work (also a B2B web app, no affiliation with LogRocket) and it&#x27;s a very useful too.<p>You have plenty of other options - Rollbar and Sentry come to mind, though I&#x27;ve never used either, but have heard good things about both.<p>Lastly, if you have back-end monitoring already then you might want to see if that solution has a front-end integration. Datadog does, for example (also a Datadog customer, but again no affiliation with them). Warning: Datadog is powerful but can be a bit overwhelming with features, I probably wouldn&#x27;t start there if you just want some front-end error tracking.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;logrocket.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;logrocket.com</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rollbar.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rollbar.com&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sentry.io&#x2F;welcome&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sentry.io&#x2F;welcome&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datadog.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datadog.com</a>')
