Still doesn&#x27;t even seem like misinformation to me, the reality was that every driver who did not want to work full-time on the company&#x27;s schedule would lose the ability to work if AB5 stands. (And if the companies shut down operations altogether in CA or demand took a big hit due to higher prices, then some or all of the rest of the drivers would lose their jobs too). I don&#x27;t see how advertising that to drivers is dishonest.')
