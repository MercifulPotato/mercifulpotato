Like when you buy $n of stock, it is impossible to lose more than $n. But with shorting you could lose unpredictable amounts if shit hits the fan. I agree it&#x27;s not a good look for a hedge fund to have put themselves in this position, but I think it was more about believing they couldn&#x27;t lose so extraordinarily badly, not that they couldn&#x27;t lose at all.')
