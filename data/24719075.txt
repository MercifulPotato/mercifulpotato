I was by no means the first to make a spatialized audio chat system. I might have been very close to the first to release something after the start of the pandemic, but it&#x27;s also not even the first time I&#x27;ve built spatialized audio chat into a system.<p>My first experience with spatialized audio in a chat system was AltspaceVR, when I first got into working in the VR space, when they interviewed me for a job (sadly, they didn&#x27;t understand their own product enough and insisted that I&#x27;d have to move coasts to work with them). That was easily 6 years ago.<p>A couple of years later, I built my own VR-based spatialized chat system. It was way too early. WebVR was way too much friction for users[0].<p>Incidentally, Calla has all the necessary parts to be usable in a VR system. And I&#x27;m using it for that in my day job (VR environments for roleplay scenarios in learning foreign languages).<p>I don&#x27;t remember why exactly I open sourced this project. It just seemed like the thing to do. I guess I hoped that other developers would find it useful and contribute bug fixes. That largely hasn&#x27;t happened, so I&#x27;m mostly just focused on building the day job project for now. Once I get the next milestone done, I&#x27;ll consider working on more features for Calla, but for now I need to pay the bills.<p>[0] WebXR today still kind of is, but it&#x27;s a lot better than it used to be and I think some clever design in UX with something akin to 2-factor auth can help get around it.')
