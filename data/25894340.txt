It&#x27;s just my observation, but the issues lefties and righties have with each other spring mainly from which aspects of history they venerate?<p>Do you beleive the most important thing about the Civil War is the Confederacy and their right to self determination even on matters of slavery? Or do you think the most important thing about the Civil War is the <i>defeat</i> of said Confederacy and the abolition of slavery in every land under our dominion, no matter the determination level of its people?<p>&quot;Both may be, but one must be, wrong.&quot;<p>Is the Trail of Tears important? Or is the defeat of the Nazis important? If it&#x27;s the defeat of the Nazis, do we tolerate the people hoisting Nazi flags? Lefties and righties differ on these issues.<p>Believe it or not, we have a mechanism to handle all these contradictions. The US Constitution. Which brings us to the second major issue that lefties and righties make in society.<p>Their selective interpretation of the Constitution. Again, I have to respectfully disagree with your assessment that these people respect the Constitution. Neither lefties, nor righties, really respect the US Constitution. If they did, we wouldn&#x27;t have people frothing at the mouth at the sight of the nazis&#x2F;confederates&#x2F;whatever-they-ares with their flags. Nor would Colin Kaepernick and other black athletes have people frothing at the mouth when they kneel. Nor would &quot;stop and frisk&quot; have ever even been conceived. Nor would privacy violations be done by the state at such scale in the name of security. Nor would minorities be discriminated against. Etc etc etc and on and on and on.<p>The issue with lefties and righties is precisely that they <i>don&#x27;t</i> believe in the Constitutional rights of whatever group it is they don&#x27;t like. That, more than anything, is what has caused all of the problems in our society lately.<p>Politics and political people have simply changed considerably over the years. Very little is what it was like 50 years ago. But again, as long as these people represent the beliefs of their supporters, what can you do? That&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to work.')
