Item(by='manfredo', descendants=None, kids=[25434761], score=None, time=1608063715, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25434624, text='&gt; Police told the crew they were being detained because they were told to move and didn&#x27;t, one member of the CNN crew relayed to the network.<p>Right, they were violating an order to disperse or a curfew. Again, being a journalist doesn&#x27;t bestow some special rights that lets you ignore the police when they issue an order to disperse or set a curfew. When people are looting and burning stuff down, the law has provisions to let the police say &quot;this is out of hand, the only way we have to restore peace is to tell everyone to get out of the area&quot;. And when people ignore those orders they&#x27;re violating the law and subject to arrest. And so are CNN&#x27;s journalists. Being a journalist doesn&#x27;t bestow any special rights.<p>You can disagree with whether it was appropriate to order people disperse in this situation. But what is certain is that your previous comment was spreading falsehood: they weren&#x27;t arrested for filming police, they were arrested for ignoring an order to disperse or a curfew. I&#x27;d come off as a lot less deceptive if you were transparent about the real reason for the arrest in your previous comment. It&#x27;s 40 minutes old at the time of my writing this so you have at least an hour to edit it.')
