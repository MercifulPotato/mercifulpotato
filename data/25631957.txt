Won&#x27;t &#x27;time spent in buses&#x2F;cars&#x2F;planes etc&#x27;, unless driving them, always also be time spent &#x27;idle&#x27;, &#x27;procrastinating&#x27;, &#x27;culture&gt;books&#x27;, or one of the others?<p>This sort of thing is what always stops me or is the problem I hit in categorising anything. Labels&#x2F;tags are the usual solution, but that doesn&#x27;t really work in this case, since you can&#x27;t then say how you spent your time using a 365 days per 360 degree pie chart or whatever.')
