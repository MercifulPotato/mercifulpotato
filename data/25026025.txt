As to racial injustice, no one is arguing it should be swet under the rug, but neither should cherry-picked examples of bad interactions between police and black people be used to build a narrative that justifies looting, murder of police officers and calls to defund the force. The US is a large, violent country, with guns everywhere. You can build a narrative about anything if you simply select, out of the millions of encounters betwen citizens and the police, the ones that go bad and victimize one particular demographic. And that is <i>exactly</i> what the media does. For good measure they also distort the facts to support the narrative. Relentlessly, blatantly, shamelessly. The consequences are dire: a divided country, racial hatred, violence. This isn&#x27;t going to stop just because Trump is out of office. Its too profitable.')
