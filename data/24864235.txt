I wish it wasn&#x27;t, but it is.<p>People bully you all the time because there&#x27;s not much you can do about it and they know it.<p>The &#x27;ol &quot;I&#x27;m gonna get you fired, get me your manager, you&#x27;re worthless, I&#x27;m a lawyer, I make more in a day than you do in a year,&quot; will be very familiar to anyone who&#x27;s worked in retail, medicine, customer support, etc.<p>Just watched a lady pull that at the cable office the other day.<p>The employee just has to deal with it.
