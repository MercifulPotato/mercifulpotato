Item(by='sbergot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607009228, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25289342, text='Ids are rarely used in webapp because most people are using a component based approach. By nature they can be instantiated multiple times so you can only use classes.<p>The basic approach is to only use selectors with a single class name and nothing else. No child selector or anything.<p>Then you use a naming convention for class names. The most popular is called BEM (for Block&#x2F;Element&#x2F;Modifier).<p>Sass can help you write BEM class names: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@andrew_barnes&#x2F;bem-and-sass-a-perfect-match-5e48d9bc3894" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@andrew_barnes&#x2F;bem-and-sass-a-perfect-mat...</a><p>You might use other libraries. Those work by generating class names for you and applying those classes at the right place. There is a whole set of possibilities here: css-modules, styled-component, jss, etc. Some of those libraries use a separate file for writing the css rules (like css modules). Some other libraries ask you to write those rules next to your react&#x2F;angular&#x2F;whatever component (styled-component&#x2F;jss). Those are often called css-in-js.<p>All of this is only useful when you are making a webapp.')
