If so that&#x27;s kind of frowned on here, especially if you were using it to vote.<p>I&#x27;m totally willing to entertain arguments that the Bytecode Alliance are also acting in bad faith. It&#x27;s a harsh world and open source is not all unicorns and rainbows.<p>But you can&#x27;t just brush off the trademark issue by claiming it was unintentional. Especially when what you write here doesn&#x27;t fit well with what you&#x27;ve written elsewhere [3]. I&#x27;ve gotten trademarks through lawyers before and the level of detail was an intense experience.<p>You seem to be claiming your lawyers independently decided to trademark WebAssembly and you signed the pages without reading them? At least that&#x27;s what I can put together from your vague writing about it.<p>If you&#x27;re not willing to give a concrete step by step post mortem of how such a clusterfuck happened, the community should (and I&#x27;m sure does) feel at liberty to not believe you in the slightest. You don&#x27;t owe them an explanation, they don&#x27;t owe you their trust.<p>You&#x27;re clearly good at technology, better than me I&#x27;m sure, and I&#x27;m no slouch. You&#x27;re doing impressive work and I have no wish to downplay that. But you appear to be quite bad at getting along with people. Maybe you can make your business work without developing that skill, and if that&#x27;s your plan then best of luck to you.
