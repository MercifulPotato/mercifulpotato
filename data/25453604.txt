My brother and I had that joke &#x27;Grand Guru Skippy&#x27; for years! We got the grand guru &lt;-&gt; kangaroo part, but never knew there was a show with a Kangaroo named Skippy. That makes it even funnier.\n(The video won&#x27;t make sense if you don&#x27;t speak French, but in case there are others like me here) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=k_3hIoUGbls" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=k_3hIoUGbls</a>')
