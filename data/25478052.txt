Suddenly you could browse the web without following links. This started a trend where you provided lesser and lesser value by stuffing links on your homepages (yes this was a thing) as people didn&#x27;t need the links anymore.<p>Some years later I remember AltaVista suddenly became full of paid links and ads, to the point of unusability. This is when Google came in, with no ads, no paid links, and actual good search results.<p>The irony.. now Google fills at least half the first search page with paid for links and unusable results.<p>Unfortunately, nobody (in the long run) gives away something completely for free. I would pay $1-2&#x2F;month for a search portal without paid links and no sell-off of my private info.')
