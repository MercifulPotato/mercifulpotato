Item(by='koonsolo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602510130, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24750504, text='&gt; Look up statistics on sexual assault and violence against women<p>Why do I need to limit myself to women? You are claiming that men cannot be victims? Here is what I found:<p>As of 1998, 2.78 million men in the U.S. had been victims of attempted or completed rape.\nAbout 3% of American men—or 1 in 33—have experienced an attempted or completed rape in their lifetime.\n1 out of every 10 rape victims are male.<p>So yes, please stop your sexist arguments: both women and men can be victims. Maybe you should be the one who needs to take some time to reflect.<p>I&#x27;m one of those people who really doesn&#x27;t give a shit about gender, race, religion, sexual preferences, etc. But it seems nowadays you have take all of these attributes and divide them into &quot;victims&quot; and &quot;predators&quot;. I&#x27;m really sick of that, and I&#x27;m really sick of media playing out that part.<p>So yeah, there is my reflection on this whole narrative.')
