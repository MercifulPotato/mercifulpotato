Hacking on the internet is pretty much immune to conventional systems that keep people honest, like being able to be caught and prosecuted or social norms. I think it&#x27;s more useful to see hackers as like a force of nature to defend against but which it&#x27;s useless to try to do any moralizing about. The more hacking that happens, the more secure computers will (hopefully) be made in defense, and the less vulnerable to future hacks. Hopefully it&#x27;s not an endless arms race and eventually we figure out standard ways to keep things secure as a result.')
