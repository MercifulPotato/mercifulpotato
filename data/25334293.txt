It does it by reflection (not by analysis), which means that properties that get added by the constructor cannot be mocked. It&#x27;s important to understand though that a fat-arrow assignment in a class in JS is not a class method; it&#x27;s a class property holding a reference to a function.<p>My suggestion to that would be that you change the fat arrow assignments to standard methods and bind them in the constructor. That way they will be Jest aware. Otherwise I&#x27;m afraid there&#x27;s not much we can do here.&quot;<p>See: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;jest&#x2F;issues&#x2F;6065" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;jest&#x2F;issues&#x2F;6065</a>')
