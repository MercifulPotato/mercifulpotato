We&#x27;re Facebook.<p>Consent is important, to not consent, could be considered rape.<p>That&#x27;s why we want to continue data raping our users in the name of small businesses.<p>You see, we don&#x27;t like consent, not when it limits our ability to see what you&#x27;re doing any time, any where, without limits or concern.<p>You&#x27;re taking a poo? We know.<p>You had a secret disloyal fling yesterday? Yeah, we were invited.<p>So please, let us data rape you and lobby for consent to be implied and given, even if you are begging us to remove the dick we&#x27;re enjoyably thrusting inside of you.<p>You&#x27;re wel-cum.<p>FB - where consent is our enemy.&quot;')
