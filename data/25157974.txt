The goal is to take basic measures so that it&#x27;s incidence and transmission rate are kept low.<p>Spain achieved that during the first wave, where in a matter of weeks they managed to get the fatality rate from hundreds per day to the single digits, even achieving days without covid-related deaths.<p>If the disease is contained, we not only avoid the chance of being infected but we also have a shot at normality.<p>If the disease is not contained and allowed to ravage the world then all we get is the despair of having people dying left and right while hospitals are saturated far beyond capacity and unable to respond to any need.')
