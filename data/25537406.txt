There&#x27;s never a &quot;Hi I work at Apple, let me correct that...&quot;, or even a &quot;disclaimer: I work at Apple, but my opinion on this is ...&quot;. This can&#x27;t be because of what you say, that Apple wants to &quot;keep their surprise and delight&quot;.<p>Also your reply seems to be very much in contrast with some other replies here. Which leaves me puzzled.')
