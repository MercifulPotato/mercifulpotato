That&#x27;s it. They&#x27;re letting them TEST it. They&#x27;re not saying that the same software&#x2F;hardware could be used elsewhere. They&#x27;re not saying that they have driverless trucks developed. They&#x27;re not saying anything other then they&#x27;re letting some random company test things out with one of their truck on a short, barely populated road, in perfect conditions.<p>Yet any random member of the population that reads that headline would assume that Walmart would have driverless trucks in 2021. But that&#x27;s not the case whatsoever. 2021 will come and go and nothing will have changed.')
