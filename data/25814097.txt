We just discussed on here about ECC memory where the consensus was ECC RAM even in laptops is good (especially at 32GB+), yet somehow mass storage dealing with orders of magnitude greater volume of data is given a pass on transits. Thanks for sharing your experience, good to know I have to preserve our manifests discipline outside our data lakes&#x27; borders.<p>Also interesting to find out AWS uses their customers&#x27; resources for temporary storage in the transit process, instead of elastically using process-only-bound ephemeral resources outside customer space in a more cloud-native fashion. Temporary consumption in the customers&#x27; resource space in a solution pattern gives me nightmare scenarios of stray code that scribbles the temporary objects into customer-owned data, or accidentally dropped into the wrong location and read by customer processes. Would be curious to hear the trade-offs involved in that decision, they could not have made it lightly, I always try to choose fail-safe design modes and at that level of solutioning I&#x27;m sure their teams are way smarter than I am so I&#x27;d love to learn from this use case.')
