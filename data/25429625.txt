They&#x27;re saying that only Facebook and the like have the resources to catch fraud, and smaller players won&#x27;t. Yes, it&#x27;s harder, but that hardness is almost an irrelevance to Facebook and other FAANG-alikes, whereas it could be much more of a problem for smaller businesses who will struggle to bear the costs both of fraud, and to develop anti-fraud solutions (or pay for anti-fraud services).<p>Maybe that opens up some opportunities as well, but that&#x27;s not necessarily particularly appetising for businesses that aren&#x27;t focussed around those areas of opportunity.')
