GPU &amp; FPGA acceleration do offer tangible performance boost, though each project should be tailored to a domain challenge and current IT infrastructure.<p>To my personal experience, the market for hardware acceleration &#x2F; high-performance computing services is still growing and there are still quite a space for niche solutions. Currently, almost any industry can benefit from boosting computation powers. Think of any business process, where you encounter a performance bottleneck in computation - that&#x27;s where the hardware acceleration with GPU&#x2F;FPGA&#x2F;ASICs can come handy.<p>We also started helping companies with accelerating machine learning processes, image detection and analysis, speeding up them across several industries. You can always see some of the applications of hardware acceleration here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.softserveinc.com&#x2F;Hardware-Acceleration-Services&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.softserveinc.com&#x2F;Hardware-Acceleration-Services...</a>, both for different industry verticals and use cases. Though, it&#x27;s not a startup, but you might find there what you were looking for.')
