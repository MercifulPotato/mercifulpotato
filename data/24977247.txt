A fairly wealthy person could save maybe $50,000 per year with the advice of the smartest tax lawyers and accountants in the world. But it would cost them $500,000 per year to pay for the structure to be created&#x2F;updated.<p>When I worked as a tax lawyer, we created structures and defended cases that saved our clients hundreds of millions of dollars. At this scale, paying for our services was a no-brainer.<p>On top of that, big companies lobby lawmakers to make the tax system favorable to them. This makes sense for the same reason: paying a couple million dollars to create&#x2F;maintain a provision that saves $100M&#x2F;yr is a no-brainer.<p>I&#x27;m not saying any of this is right or good (and I am no longer a tax lawyer; I now build tools that help people with disabilities). I&#x27;m just saying this is why it makes sense that companies can walk a fine line on taxes, save tons of money, and you and I cannot.')
