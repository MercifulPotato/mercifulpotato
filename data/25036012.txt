Don’t invest in an AllWinner-based design expecting to implement key SoC  features later. If it doesn’t work right now, there’s no guarantee it will ever be supported.<p>That said, upstream support for AllWinner parts has come a long way and continues to improve. I wouldn’t mind using them in certain projects.<p>However, anyone who absolutely needs good documentation and SoC support needs to stick with a vendor that emphasizes openness and good documentation. NXP i.MX is the safe choice.')
