But we also see a very wide variance in individual customers&#x27; performance numbers (ie. some instances have consistently faster performance than other instances), and even within individual instances variance amongst users (some users have consistently faster experience than other users on the same instance) -&gt; we&#x27;re trying what we can to narrow down the causes in this variance.<p>Hearing from &quot;users with slow experiences&quot; is simply one of the ways we&#x27;re trying to track this down, but it helps if users are willing to provide more info.<p>--------<p>@ratww - thank you for the suggestion!  We have some amount of data that helps us see what might be different between instances, but haven&#x27;t gone out of our way to &#x27;interview a fast customer&#x27;, I&#x27;ll bring this up with the team to see.<p>The two biggest factors I think we&#x27;ve seen: slow machines can contribute (but not a necessity), and large pages (especially with large tables, or large number of tables) can contribute.')
