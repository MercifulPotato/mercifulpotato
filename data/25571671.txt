But if the goal is predicated on committing violence, and can&#x27;t be achieved without it, then I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s logical to dismiss the violent aspect.<p>To transpose the argument to reality, a serial killer may see the act of killing as a neutral act pursuant to a goal they consider important. There are plenty of serial killers with manifestos.<p>Whatever they are trying to achidve, they aren&#x27;t welcome in society.')
