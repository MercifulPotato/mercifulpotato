Background check companies usually only contact the positions you list to verify your dates of employment and title.  They probably won&#x27;t contact a job you don&#x27;t let them know about.<p>2. If it helps you sleep at night, you can still fill out the background check form accurately, but leave stuff off your resume &#x2F; not talk about it in the interview.  Again, there is no rule that you need to talk about every job you have ever had in chronological order on your resume or in the interviews.  As long as there is nothing untrue, or some sort of strange conflicts of interest, you are totally welcome to omit things that aren&#x27;t relevant.<p>3. In the rare, extremely unlikely chance that you have to explain yourself, it seems perfectly acceptable to say &quot;I&#x27;ve only been at this job for a few weeks.  I am not sure I am going to stay longer, so I didn&#x27;t think it was relevant&quot;.<p>If you are interviewing for the CIA, then definitely list every job.  If it&#x27;s a normal tech job, people simply don&#x27;t care.  Fill your precious chance to impress your interviewer with things that are actually impressive.')
