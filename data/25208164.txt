Cramming vocabulary does help make input more comprehensible, but it should be noted that cramming vocabulary doesn&#x27;t (by itself) cause you to acquire that vocabulary. Graded readers have been shown to also be very effective, despite a lack of vocabulary cramming (meaning that it&#x27;s not necessary -- which is the point I was unsuccessfully trying to make). I do agree that it is a productive use of time (at least in the early stages of learning a language) and in my own language learning, I am cramming vocabulary.<p>However, consciously learning <i>grammar</i> definitely does not have significant enough returns to be worth the effort (it can help somewhat in certain cases, but comprehensible input has a much larger effect).')
