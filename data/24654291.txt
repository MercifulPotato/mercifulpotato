It will be studied as an important part of the history of <i>our</i> time.)<p>The folks running these upscaling operations understand the concerns:<p>&gt; Antic and Kelley aren’t under any illusions that images treated by DeOldify will come out historically accurate, though their reservations are with the practicalities of training a neural network. Making sure colourised films are accurate is “a literally impossible problem,” Antic says. DeOldify uses modern images to train its AI on, he explains, “and we know that&#x27;s a big weakness, because, amongst other things, it biases people to wearing blue jeans.”<p>The challenge is, once they create one of these films and post it for the public, the implications and effects are out of their hands.<p>You might have millions of people watching an AI-changed film and think that what they are seeing is <i>more</i> accurate than the original, since it transmits more information (detail, color, etc). But if that additional information is made up, it&#x27;s actually not more accurate, and maybe actually less accurate (e.g. wrong color instead of no color). That nuance is going to be hard for a lot of people to understand.')
