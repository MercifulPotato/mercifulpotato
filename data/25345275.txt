Item(by='tosh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607436667, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25343274, text='imho the key thing about gaming on the M1 Macs right now is that many games that were unplayable on the previous generation of the same Macs (Air, entry model Pro 13&quot;, Mini) have flipped from unplayable to playable, which is what many people who use these systems (often not primarily for gaming) care about.<p>That said: I do think I need to come up with better wording or at least better definitions of what &quot;playable&quot; means (perhaps even for every game * settings * spec combination). With enough reports per game this might actually work.<p>For a while a long-tail of games will only have 1 report though and I wonder how to deal with those.<p>edit: e.g. in some cases it might sense to provide augmented information like if you are interested in performance on a MacBook Air while there is no report for MacBook Air it might make sense to add the context that there are reports on using a MacBook Pro 13&quot; with the added disclaimer that wile in the same ballpark is not the same system (that could give enough context for the reader to guesstimate an upper&#x2F;lower bound on what to expect)')
