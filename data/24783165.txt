Which is essential, because the OP isn&#x27;t writing historical reference materials, they&#x27;re providing an (apt, IMHO) _analogy_ about trends and popular &#x2F; common experiences.<p>Thus I kinda inferred the OP meant &quot;... which device crossed the threshold into mainstream awareness&quot;. So your &quot;glazed&quot; dismissal seems a little harsh.<p>That said, I think you&#x27;re right to make note of the Hiptop (TIL!), and I agree that it was the touchscreen (albeit also not truly firat of its kind either) that was a transformative experience for the masses. I&#x27;ll never forget the first time I interacted with an iPhone.')
