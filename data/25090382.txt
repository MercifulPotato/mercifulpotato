The Ryzen 5000 chips cannot hit the 5GHz mark that Intel ones can, and yet the Ryzen 5000 chips thrashed the Intel ones in every benchmark done by everyone on youtube.<p>And that&#x27;s when both the chips are on the same x86 platform. Differences in architecture can never be compared or should be compared with GHz as any kind of basis.<p>The only place where the GHz is useful for comparison is with products running the same chip')
