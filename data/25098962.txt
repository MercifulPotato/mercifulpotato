I agree with the top level comment, remote work is not for me. I understand that some people work well with remote work, but for some reason people who like remote work seem to not understand that some people prefer working in the office. I don&#x27;t think that these kind of things replace an in person environment, and I&#x27;m really looking forward to when I can go back into the office.')
