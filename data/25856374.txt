Adrien Zenz publically admitted that the BBC paid him to write a bad report about Uyghurs! Again, watch the video and see the evidence.<p>Why do you glance over the fact that the UN, another well-respected organization, visited and reported favorably?<p>I won&#x27;t let you define who I am. I have a say in that. Seems to me more like you&#x27;re so fanatically anti-China that you can&#x27;t help but label everyone who&#x27;s not as zealous, as &quot;pro-CCP&quot;. This is a false dichotomy.<p>No, I don&#x27;t support literal concentration camps. No I&#x27;m not arguing that actual concentration camps shouldn&#x27;t be called as such because that sounds bad. I&#x27;m arguing that the standard for evidence should be <i>very</i> high because it&#x27;s a <i>very serious</i> accusation, and that this standard hasn&#x27;t been met! Until the evidence is clear, it&#x27;s irresponsible to assume there are concentration camps.<p>You keep trying to link me back to nazis and keep painting me as a concentration camp supporter, but you keep avoiding 60% of the arguments I put forth (where I showed ahain and again how problematic your sources are), focussing instead on a few strawmans.<p>Do you think my concerns are like pro-Nazi Germans worried about their image? Don&#x27;t you remember Iraq and the non-existant WMDs? The result of that is a <i>literal</i> genocide by the hands of the US and its allies! Weapons manufacturers are cooking up consent for a war with China. They&#x27;ve deceived us again and again; see earlier instances: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;02&#x2F;06&#x2F;lie-after-lie-what-colin-powell-knew-about-iraq-fifteen-years-ago-and-what-he-told-the-un&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;02&#x2F;06&#x2F;lie-after-lie-what-colin...</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nayirah_testimony" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nayirah_testimony</a>\nHow long will you let yourself and your zeal to see nazis everywhere, to be used to cause <i>actual</i> atrocities?<p>So I ask you again: do you denounce the US war on terror? Do you denounce the <i>verifiable</i> concentration camps at the US border? Are you really arguing in good faith?')
