I have no idea if that&#x27;s true or not, but if so, it seems like a prudent approach even if we miss out on brownie points of getting to claim &quot;ours is biggest&quot;. As others have pointed out here, the EU is not behind technologically. All we&#x27;re behind on is company size, and I&#x27;m ok with that.')
