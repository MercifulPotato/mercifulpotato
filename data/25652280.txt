I&#x27;m guessing less than 1% of professional human writers or composers create something original. Those people are not in any danger to be replaced by AI, and will probably be earning more money as a result of more value being placed on originality of content. Humans will strive (or be forced) to be more creative, because all non-original content creation will be automated. It&#x27;s a win-win situation.')
