Item(by='ghaff', descendants=None, kids=[24761206], score=None, time=1602523690, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24756597, text='&gt;Buy a vacation home, and you&#x27;re going to have a mental barrier going on vacation somewhere else.<p>I would probably agree with OPs sentiment in the context of vacation homes. They&#x27;re not necessarily a great investment. They sort of lock you into a location. They&#x27;re another thing you have to manage. And so forth. I&#x27;d much rather just get a hotel room, a B&amp;B, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve even thought of buying a small place in the city. First of all, I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t do that in the last year or two. But, really, while I <i>wish</i> I had done it 10 years ago knowing what I know now about property values, I also don&#x27;t miss having another property to manage and I can always get a hotel if I want to spend a weekend in town every now and then.')
