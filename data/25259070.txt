Just for the occasional move. This is a cheating tactic in tennis, too. An unksilled cheater &quot;hooks&quot; constantly when it doesn&#x27;t matter. A skilled cheater does it only on a critical point. You can call out a line judge, but with the advantage secured, the cheater can appear scrupulous for the remainder of the match<p>OT, but as someone who knows basically nothing about tennis, how does cheating work? Are there illegal ways to hit the ball or something?')
