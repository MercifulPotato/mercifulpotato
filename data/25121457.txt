On lock&#x2F;unlock I have a MQTT client called to publish a message to a topic. I think I&#x27;m using HiveMQ&#x27;s mqtt-cli because it was the most immediately obvious option for my OS.<p>Working out from there:<p>* I use Windows as the host OS for my desktop. You can use Task Scheduler to set a task to run on lock&#x2F;unlock. I have jobs set that mute&#x2F;unmute my audio and call a MQTT client to publish the messages to the broker.<p>* Those messages are picked up by Node-RED. It&#x27;s a ladder-logic-ish environment for automation. It has flows that control all the bits of logic based off of all the various data sources including MQTT.<p>* Node-RED calls Home Assistant, which handles providing a UI as well as actual integration with all the various bits of hardware (light bulbs, z-wave controller, etc)<p>I quite enjoy this stuff (which is probably half of how I got here), so feel free to ask if you&#x27;ve got follow-up questions.')
