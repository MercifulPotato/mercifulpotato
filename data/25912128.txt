I tend to prefer solutions like restic + B2 for their price and support, where you at least have a larger company behind the storage backend, you could even directly use it with S3 and it&#x27;d still be cheaper than Tarsnap.<p>Decent write up on the cryptography in restic here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.filippo.io&#x2F;restic-cryptography&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.filippo.io&#x2F;restic-cryptography&#x2F;</a><p>Some tarsnap issues detailed here: \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kalzumeus.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;04&#x2F;03&#x2F;fantasy-tarsnap&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kalzumeus.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;04&#x2F;03&#x2F;fantasy-tarsnap&#x2F;</a>')
