The system starts out at just under $8k, and can upscale the components to over $45k, with a <i>lot</i> of flexibility along the way (especially with storage).<p>There aren&#x27;t any options for a different power supply, so it seems the standard one is intended to be adequate no matter how you configure or upgrade the system, which is reasonable, considering it&#x27;s 1600W (although I have a feeling that running this and turning on the microwave at the same time would pop a circuit-breaker)<p>It looks like the CPU is in the cube shaped housing above the GPUs (that&#x27;s where the big duct leads). Presumably that housing opens as well to give you access to the MB and let you swap out memory.<p>That leaves the flatter box at the bottom to be the power supply, which agrees with the placement of the main power switch. But the PS itself doesn&#x27;t seem to have any provision for airflow, which I find a bit strange. I doubt the intent is for the PS to cook the GPU that&#x27;s sitting right above it, so I must be missing something (perhaps the PS vents out the bottom?), or the renders aren&#x27;t entirely accurate.<p>Anyway, my head scratching aside, a very impressive and sleek design with a seriously ergonomic interior.<p>One thing that I am sure of is that System76 gives very good value for money, and excellent support. The laptops I&#x27;ve bought from them have all held up to many years of constant use, and the support I got from them along the way when there was a problem of any sort was top notch (eg. when I needed a replacement power supply and the laptop was out of warranty, they helped me find a compatible replacement on Amazon rather than insist I get theirs at full price).<p>I really wish I could afford one of these, since even at the basic config they are truly drool-worthy.')
