I really want the low end SBC market to start dabbling in some expandability. This S905X3 chip has one port that multiplexes PCIe OR USB3 on it, &amp; they use it for SATA, &amp; I can&#x27;t wait for these SoC systems to start offering just a little more high speed connectivity, please.<p>Marvell&#x27;s EspressoBin[1] was a great board, because it was small, easy to power, easy to plug a drive into, had space for wifi, had decent ethernet. So much goodness built in, at a great price point. Please all, more ambition on the I&#x2F;O front!<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;espressobin.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;espressobin.net&#x2F;</a>')
