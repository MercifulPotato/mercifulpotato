I think their failing is that at some point in the early 2000s, Jony Ive declared war on whimsy, relentlessly stamping out even the most minor bits of fun in the pursuit of the simplest forms possible.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how this changes now that Ive isn&#x27;t present; while I&#x27;d like to be cautiously optimistic, current design head Alan Dye has been there since 2006 and may have internalized a lot of that anti-whimsy. Based on Big Sur&#x27;s UX, he seems to unfortunately share Ive&#x27;s &quot;form over function&quot; failing.')
