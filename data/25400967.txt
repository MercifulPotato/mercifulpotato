In something concrete like math, I think using hand-waviness is appropriate to describe someone skipping over something they could explain in detail.<p>In other fields, the frameworks present don&#x27;t allow for the same degree of analysis, and that&#x27;s just the way it is. It&#x27;s kind of like comparing logic programming to an ML model. The model can be very accurate, but we likely cannot dissect it and understand what it does in the way that we can with logic programming.<p>To put it another way, a math professor whose blog I followed said something along the lines of math is hard because it&#x27;s easy, and other fields are easy because they&#x27;re hard.')
