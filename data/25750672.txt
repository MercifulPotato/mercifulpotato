You can&#x27;t argue against a feeling because it&#x27;s deeply personal and you can&#x27;t invalidate feelings. The most you can offer is another perspective and hope they&#x27;re willing to consider it. Short of having them convince themselves, you can&#x27;t really change people&#x27;s minds when they feel something is true.')
