Some sources could be permanently rejected, but ‘trustworthy’ sources consistently miss important information that only come in corrections with a significant delay. If we’re not taking the info at face value, the “trust” part is not there anyway.<p>And if we’re talking about well thought and researched pieces, I’d argue we should also take the time to think about them and do our own sanity checks.')
