Especially the way of doing concurreny would be very very different from how it&#x27;s done in both Rust and Elixir. Scala also has actors, but the other way of doing concurrent programming is more interesting. For example, check this here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zio.dev&#x2F;docs&#x2F;datatypes&#x2F;datatypes_stm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zio.dev&#x2F;docs&#x2F;datatypes&#x2F;datatypes_stm</a><p>This is something you don&#x27;t have in Rust or Elixir at all (to my knowledge).<p>But if it&#x27;s really just for the sake of learning, I think choosing Haskell is better - who cares about strings when you learn these things.<p>If you want to specialize, learn Rust in and out. :D')
