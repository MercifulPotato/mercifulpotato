External function calls such as the following:\nmemcpy(foo, bar, n);\nAre roughly equivalent to the following assembly, which leads compilers to assume that most cpu state is clobbered:<p>I think most modern C and C++ compilers know that memcpy is special and optimize accordingly. I believe some C++ compilers recognize when you are using memcpy just to do bit casting to different representations and avoid doing a memory copy at all.')
