The recent election results have been a disappointment to you</i>.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;dSYZypCw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;dSYZypCw</a><p>Props for turns of phrases like &quot;Your opponent is a typical liberal. He hails from the right wing of the Democratic Party, but has been trying to appeal to the left to gain more support.&quot;, but poor marks for apparently not having grasped how elections work. (There&#x27;s a joke in there somewhere)<p>If you don&#x27;t pick a custom world and your own prompt, you get something more like this:<p>&gt; You are Donald Trump, a noble living in the kingdom of Larion. You are awakened by a loud noise outside the gate. You look out the window and see a large number of orcish troops on the road outside the castle.<p>I&#x27;d like &#x27;orcish troops&#x27; better if I thought it was inspired by media reports of Capitol events rather than a corpus of RPGs.')
