George W Bush may have warm feelings about the UK after Blair helped him with the war in Iraq, but would you expect to cash that favour in with Obama, Trump or Biden?<p>Of course not - A new president comes in, they decide to impose new tariffs on imports from the UK, of course something that happened 17 years and two presidents ago doesn&#x27;t give him much pause.<p>Obviously there are longstanding structures of cooperation like NATO and suchlike, which don&#x27;t get reset. But an awful lot does.<p>Besides, Assange is old news now. America&#x27;s message to other would-be whistleblowers has been delivered. If the UK releases him, no American politicians will have to face scrutiny or look weak over the decision. And British politicians won&#x27;t face any domestic blowback, post Harry Dunn.')
