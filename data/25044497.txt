Many of you have been incredibly committed to Overtone and watching it grow. We couldn’t have asked for a better community.<p>As life has it, sometimes one door closes as another opens. From November 30, 2020, we&#x27;re saying goodbye to Overtone. Our Internal Agents and technology have found some exciting new homes within the organization.  We will continue building and innovating, so the work we’ve all been able to do here is not for naught.<p>Where and when will you see more of our creations? All we can say is keep an eye or two on Unity<p>As a final mission, we give you until November 30, 2020, to find a new voice and text chat home for yourself, friends, and communities. At which point, Overtone will cease to operate and all Agent accounts will be deleted shortly thereafter. Change is never easy, but we trust you will be successful.')
