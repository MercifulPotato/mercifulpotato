He fails to answer basic questions about why he chose to also communicate directly with a presidential advisor instead of just talking to the authorities, he changes his story throughout the interview, and he fails to confirm critically important details about the device, who gave it to him, and how it wound up in the hands of the authorities and a presidential campaign advisor.<p>Being nervous in an interview is one thing, trying and failing to wing it through basic questions is entirely different. His comment about the lifeboat particularly stood out to me because he very obviously didn&#x27;t want to explicitly talk about Giuliani, but he was comfortable speaking in hyperbole about it. If you&#x27;re so uncomfortable to answer a question, how would you then be comfortable enough to &quot;say it&quot; without saying it? If I was concerned that a question could threaten my safety or legal standing, I&#x27;d stay as far away from it as possible. This guy clearly wanted the reporters to know that he had been talking to Giuliani, and once that&#x27;s out there, the context of the entire story changes.<p>If it&#x27;s a legit scandal, there&#x27;s no reason that a whistleblower should reach out to a political operative in addition to the authorities. The very fact that he did this says so much about his state of mind, that he was acting in support of a candidate.')
