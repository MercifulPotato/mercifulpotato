These don&#x27;t have any way to interrupt them, so we got a maintenance guy to unplug it - but the door still didn&#x27;t unlock, even after plugging it back in.  The maintenance guy ended up jerking it open hard (might have broken the lock, don&#x27;t remember), so the other resident could get their clothes.<p>I only ever use our top-load washers, which don&#x27;t have any lock on them.')
