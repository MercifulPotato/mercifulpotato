We have switched the nixpkgs version in that version, so a lot of tooling had to be redownloaded. E.g. in our getting started video we install it on a fresh empty macbook: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=PLl9Sjq6Nzc&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=PLl9Sjq6Nzc&amp;feature=youtu.be</a> The full download there takes around 9 minutes on a slow home office internet connection (it&#x27;s speed up in the video, but you can see the real-world time at the top right).<p>We mainly added the warning in that release because usually the update process is very smooth and takes only one minute, e.g. see this tweet: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mittie&#x2F;status&#x2F;1322574176792825861" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mittie&#x2F;status&#x2F;1322574176792825861</a>')
