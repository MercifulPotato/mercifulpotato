The USA in general has the lowest import tariffs on goods of all major countries (even after all the Trump escalations). It also has a large goods import gap (importing much more than it exports). It makes up a lot of that gap in services, so when France passed a tax specifically targeting its most important &quot;service&quot; companies (internet giants), it sees that as a HUGE trade escalation, even though that absolute tax those companies pay in Europe was previously laughably small in absolute terms.<p>One could argue that despite all the headline drama, evening US-EU goods tariffs and making US tech companies pay taxes in Europe lands on a more equitable arrangement, rather than de facto subsidizing EU agriculture and US tech.<p>[0]It&#x27;s hard to find intuitively meaningful numbers for this stuff since it&#x27;s so complicated, but you can see that the EU &quot;general goods&quot; tariff has a mean average of 5.1% vs 3.4% for the USA here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wto.org&#x2F;english&#x2F;res_e&#x2F;booksp_e&#x2F;tariff_profiles20_e.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wto.org&#x2F;english&#x2F;res_e&#x2F;booksp_e&#x2F;tariff_profiles20...</a>')
