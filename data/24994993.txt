I <i>especially</i> had no interest in answering a push poll, from either side.  The result was that I answered <i>none</i> of them.<p>Now, if we had only one outfit doing polls so that I didn&#x27;t get bombarded, and if there was no such thing as push-polling, sure, I might answer their poll questions.  But as it is?  No.  You&#x27;ll find out what I think when I vote; in the meantime; go away and leave me alone.  (It&#x27;s amazing how much quieter my phones are today than on Monday.)')
