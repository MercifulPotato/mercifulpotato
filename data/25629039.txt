Nepotism was rampant in both cases, with most employees being either related or close friends of the CEO and upper management, both coming from old-money families, generating a strong tribal behavior, so anyone who wasn&#x27;t your boss could get you in trouble if they decided they don&#x27;t like you and raises and promotions were allocated based purely on the tribe&#x27;s  perception of you and performance judged on <i>butt time</i> in your chair rather than results. As a foreign tech worker there who&#x27;s not part of the tribe you&#x27;re treated with an air of <i>&quot;you should just be grateful we gave you a job&quot;</i> even though they kept whining about not being able to attract new talent and grow. The lack of transparency was prominent with the CEO always preaching how <i>&quot;times are tight and we&#x27;re all in this together&quot;</i> to justify lack of wage increases while he bought more vacation homes abroad and exotic cars. Information about the company&#x27;s projects, customers, sales, revenue was all kept away from the employees who were not part of the tribal circles as it only circulated via spoken words.<p>Now I only work for big corps and it&#x27;s been a huge improvement, with American corps in Germany treating you the best. They&#x27;re transparent about their projects, customers and earnings in their quarterly town meetings, information is communicated electronically, not by speak, leadership and and workers are (mostly) hired and promoted based on merit and transparent goals and processes vs straight up nepotism and tribalism.')
