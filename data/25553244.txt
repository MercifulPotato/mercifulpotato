A slower vessel of the same size and weight needs dramatically less power.  By comparison the last commercial bulk cargo sailing ship  Palmer which sank in 1957 needed an 85+ man crew, only had an 8-9 knots cruse, and was vastly smaller.  For the titanic to add an extra 200+ crew to possibly save less than 10% on fuel costs was simply not tenable.<p>Where combined steam and sail ships really benefited wasn’t fuel, it was consistent power.  Early steam engines where unreliable as was sail, but they rarely failed at the same time.  However with more reliable steam it was just a question of economics.')
