Item(by='ghaff', descendants=None, kids=[25302531], score=None, time=1607090201, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25298748, text='&gt;until I make it into such an &quot;endgame&quot; company.<p>Unless you&#x27;re close to retirement and don&#x27;t really need the money, it&#x27;s unlikely you&#x27;ll know when you&#x27;re there. Companies change and&#x2F;or get into trouble, managers change, projects get canceled, etc. I&#x27;ve been at companies I spent quite a few years at and I still came close to quitting for various reasons (and eventually did). I&#x27;d submit there is no predictable endgame over more than a 2-3 year time horizon.')
