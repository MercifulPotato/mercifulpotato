I talked to many maintainers in the first few years of it&#x27;s existence who truly benefited from the contributions. Nothing we ever did at DigitalOcean was &quot;just for marketing&quot; - everything we did was because we genuinely cared about developers, that&#x27;s why the company grew.  Certainly it&#x27;s a shame that a few bad actors are ruining the project, but I take real issue with all the vitriol. Maybe it&#x27;s gone off the rails and needs to be revised or reconsidered, but creating &quot;shitoberfest&quot; twitter and putting things in blog posts like &quot;Finally, and most importantly, we can remember that this is how DigitalOcean treats the open source maintainer community, and stay away from their products going forward.&quot; is certainly not constructive.
