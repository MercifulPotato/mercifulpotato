I am not sure that is what I would call easy. Those financial stressors perhaps, in many cases, lead to divorce.<p>What the boomers did luck into was the value of assets being deflated due to those 22% interest rates. As the interest rates came down, allowing people to pay more for those assets, those who were able to service the debt saw their wealth balloon to heights never before seen. That&#x27;s more meaningful today than in the 1980s, though.<p>Until recent events, the younger generations have had a relatively stable job market and low interest rates, reducing financial stress. It will be interesting to see if COVID-19 pushes the divorce rate back up.')
