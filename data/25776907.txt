It seems like the industry is trying fill the gap that was created by a glut of people without math&#x2F;cs backgrounds going into 5-week data science courses who then need hand-holding when they get real jobs.<p>Data science &amp; engineering should be treated as a single collection of skill-sets.  Lacking ETL experience is a major deficit, considering how prevalent that kind of work is.<p>This might just be my personal biases coming through.  I consider myself a &quot;full-stack&quot; data scientist &amp; engineer.  But because data scientists who can work on the backends are rare, I always end up doing the plumbing while other people do the fun analysis work.<p>I think companies that are data &quot;science&quot; heavy are going to be at huge disadvantage soon.  Tools like Rekognition and Google AI APIs are making the model training &amp; deployment aspect almost trivial.   At some point, the only real work involved in this space will be the data &quot;engineering.&quot;')
