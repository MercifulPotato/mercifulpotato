Today we can use deep learning and word embedding to solve&#x2F;improve that problem.<p>A simple spelling corrector that is based on edit distance would always prefer &quot;be&quot; over &quot;buy&quot; because &quot;be&quot; is the more frequent word of both.<p>So the risk of all the easy accessible libraries for a certain task is, that you think the problem is solved, but you overlook many problems because the topic is much more diverse and deep than you would think at the first glance<p>Another point is that while hardware improved, also the expectations have risen. We expect milliseconds latency instead of seconds, we often require the software to work in a multi-tenant architecture with thousands or millions of concurrent users.<p>So even for seemingly simple and straightforward tasks, and despite all the exciting advances in hardware, always new challenges present themselves.')
