It&#x27;s well above the median personal income (around $35K)—the median being usually the useful average for income statistics, but a little bit less than the mean personal income. (The most common “average income” number, though, is neither of those, but the median <i>household</i> income, which is close it $70K, but it doesn&#x27;t really make sense to talk about an individual&#x27;s income being average or not and looking at a <i>household</i>, instead of individual, metric to judge that.)')
