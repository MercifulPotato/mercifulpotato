To request this entitlement, contact your Apple representative.<p>I have not done development in Xcode for some time, but the first thing I wanted to do for an internal project was hamstrung by restricted entitlements. Luckily, it was just an experiment, but it makes it feel like this is coming up a lot. Is there still a way around this (i.e. to run your own code on macOS) ?<p>This isn’t the first time I’ve seen a project based around Virtualization.framework; that’s both exciting and disconcerting. Issues like entitlement deals (that I will never be able to obtain) make the wide open path forward look a lot like a narrow track, the direction of which only Apple controls.')
