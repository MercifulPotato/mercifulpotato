Item(by='klyrs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610386151, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25729524, text='&gt; The idea &quot;I could do some bike work on my own, so bike work can&#x27;t be expensive&quot; has to die, simple as that.<p>If the shop charges more than I value my time, than I won&#x27;t go to the shop except to buy parts and tools to fix my bike with.  Not sure why you think DIY needs to die.  This is a supply&#x2F;demand problem and ease of repair will depress prices.<p>Where the workshop model might work is the fabrication of parts.  The supply chain has tanked; I&#x27;d be willing to pay double on that chainring I busted and nobody can stock.')
