Even in this case the company still loses out from the intern. That money still need to come from somewhere, most likely from profit derived from other employees.<p>The point is “the intern increased the company’s profit by 500k annually but only gets paid 40k” is not the problem it’s made out to be. That 500k wasn’t created out of thin air. There were other employees in supporting functions that made it possible. That extra 460k goes to pay for them too, as well as for the employees that aren’t as productive. Those are the risks the company takes on.')
