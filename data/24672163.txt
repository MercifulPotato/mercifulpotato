It&#x27;s certainly possible, as made in India Samsung M-series phones already has all major Indian apps, they might even provide privilege escalation like Fdroid to make install&#x2F;update seamless. What they are going to replace Google Play Services with would be interesting to see.<p>Of course it&#x27;s not going to happen with Apple unless anti-trust issues in US&#x2F;EU forces Apple to open its platform for 3rd party app stores.<p>Coming back to Huawei, Playstore denial didn&#x27;t have impact on its sales in China as Playstore was never there and China has hundreds of local app stores for android (although silicon denial will have an impact there). Similarly, having local Indian app stores does make strategic sense.<p>But as a consumer I&#x27;m worried about the privacy, security implications of a local app store without common International rules and scrutiny; Especially since I have personally seen what some of these leading apps can do with user privacy and security[1].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abishekmuthian.com&#x2F;paytm-says-to-me-that-its-pos-feature-didn-t-have-a-security-risk-8fd7c3849e54&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abishekmuthian.com&#x2F;paytm-says-to-me-that-its-pos-fea...</a>')
