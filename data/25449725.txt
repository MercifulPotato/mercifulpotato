Does the mail client on your phone go &quot;Hey, I need to re-authenticate to this server?&quot; and meanwhile you don&#x27;t receive any email? That&#x27;s a not-great user experience.<p>For SMTP this is a bit less fraught because at least the user presumably just did something to cause sending, so we can ask them to authenticate at that point. But that still can be a bit trickier than you&#x27;d like.<p>There&#x27;s also a much nastier backward compatibility story for email than for a relatively recent thing like GitHub. There absolutely will be a user with an Amiga 1200 using email on a big email service. Do you cut their service off? Maybe you have to, if that&#x27;s the only way to secure service for other users. But it&#x27;s a real last resort.')
