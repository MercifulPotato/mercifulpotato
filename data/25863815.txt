But if museum sells collection the can&#x27;t &quot;simply come back for more later&quot; cause it will be gone forever into private hands.<p>&gt; More people get to see fine art<p>until it&#x27;s all been sold.<p>&gt; Second- and third-tier museums start to gain access to better art, since they can simply buy it instead of waiting for estate donations (which go to larger museums)<p>There is no way 2nd and 3rd teir museums are going to be able to compete with private buyers on price.  Also where will they get money to buy this if they have to sell art to raise money.<p>This sounds like typical &quot;privatize everything cause free markets!&quot; privileged people spew because they&#x27;ll benefit more than when they have to share public services with the &quot;dirty&quot; masses.')
