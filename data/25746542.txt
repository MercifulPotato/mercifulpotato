Previously these have only been produced by universities and in small numbers. However, researchers at the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, found that they could use CEA-Leti wafers. These industrially produced devices were found to be suitable as a platform for a two-dimensional array of qubits, a significant step for a working quantum computer. The results of this study have now been published in Nature Communications.&quot;')
