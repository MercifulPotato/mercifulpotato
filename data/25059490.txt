You&#x27;ll not find an over-the-top fan here.<p>My point is that x86 can do more with less cache than aarch64. If you&#x27;re interested, RISC-V with compact instructions enabled (100% of production implementations to my knowledge) is around 15% more dense than x86 and around 30-35% more dense than aarch64.<p>This cache usage matters because of all the downsides of needing larger cache and because cache density is scaling at a fraction of normal transistors.<p>Anandtech puts A14 between Intel and AMD for int performance and less than both in float performance. The fact that Intel and AMD fare so well while Apple has over 6x the cache means they&#x27;re doing something very fancy and efficient to make up the difference (though I&#x27;d still hypothesize that if Apple did similar optimizations, it would still wind up being more efficient due to using a better ISA).')
