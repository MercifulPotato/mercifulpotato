If they can lock down the computer, they can drop the price while _increasing_ CLTV.<p>That’s why System76 is more expensive. They’re NOT overpriced. They’re priced as “general purpose computers” must be to be competitive.<p>I agree with this author, but this suggests that the strength of his conviction is maybe $400.')
