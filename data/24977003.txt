The physically active people I know, including myself and my wife, exercised mostly in  gyms before COVID. First, gyms were shut down for months, which pretty much kills the habit of going to the gym (the main reason why people stick with it). Now their policies are so onerous, they&#x27;re borderline psychotic, so we canceled our gym memberships months ago. On a less anecdotal note, two of our three major local gyms are now in bankruptcy. The one that&#x27;s not in bankruptcy is largely funded by Microsoft, their employees used to go there, and now even though they don&#x27;t go, Microsoft still keeps paying.<p>Both my and my wife&#x27;s weight went up. I was able to beat it, she wasn&#x27;t, so she&#x27;s about 8kg heavier now than she was in February. The only exercise I get now is half an hour of stationary bike a day. I used to seriously lift weights 4-5 days a week, in addition to it.<p>It&#x27;s not even a question for anyone not completely brainwashed that lockdowns are very psychologically hard on people.')
