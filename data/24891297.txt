Back home we had restaurants and cuisine and all that. It wasn’t a wasteland.<p>But SF has more high quality restaurants within a 20min <i>walk</i> of my apartment than my hometown had in total. Average restaurant quality is higher too. Just because there’s more competition.<p>Another fun example: in SF we have 5 grocery stores within a 10min walk. Back home the nearest grocery store was a 3min walk away, great. But the next one after that was 10min. To get to a proper supermarket size grocery store ... that’s a car trip. In SF it’s a 15min walk.<p>Density is wonderful. There’s economies of scale that you get at 18,400 people per square mile that you just can’t pull off at 4,500.<p>The ultimate test for a city is this: Do you have 5 “asian restaurants” or do you have 5 south vietnamese, 3 north vietnamese, 10 cantonese, 5 ramen, 6 japanese grill, 3 sushi, 4 dimsum, etc<p>For example back home we had <i>the</i> mexican restaurant, here you have 10 for each type of mexican food.')
