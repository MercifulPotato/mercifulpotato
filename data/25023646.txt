But looks like $260K for someone just a few years in (L4) and $350K for folks senior enough to be real leads (L5). Funded co&#x27;s are the top 1%, so that&#x27;s arguably some $600K folks (L6). Also, I didn&#x27;t adjust for being in a top 1 market (bay area) or 2nd tier (nyc&#x2F;seattle&#x2F;austin&#x2F;...) vs Other. But either way, yeah, you&#x27;re right, &gt; 50% discount for those #&#x27;s ;-)')
