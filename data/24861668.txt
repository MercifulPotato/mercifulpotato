Eventually learners will usually try clicking on a premium episode, which is where the paywall shows up. The reason I do it this way is so that people will know exactly what they&#x27;re getting when they sign up.<p>Also, even getting people learning from the 100+ free screencasts is a plus for me.<p>The other product is in alpha and the pricing is going up as I hit various milestones. It will probably max out around $250.')
