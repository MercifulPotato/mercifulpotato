A framing bit comes first which starts a clock. The signal after that just has to be in the right range for indicating a 0 or 1 at each subsequent clocking. This is probably self-correcting to some extent, if the threshold for a level change is the same as the threshold for starting the clock.<p>The inputs are likely Schmitt-triggered, which essentially recovers the square wave.')
