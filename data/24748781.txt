I’m ready to move on (partly to do with boredom in my current role, but mainly to do with a change in the company culture that is making it hard to work there any more).<p>At work I&#x27;ve been offered a part time contract role that should allow me to spend more time with my son at roughly the same wage I&#x27;m on at the moment. The trouble is that it was a few months ago (when they wanted to cut down on expenses a bit and it suited them) and I&#x27;ve not heard anything since. I&#x27;ve asked my boss a few times and they say that they are working on it, but I&#x27;m not sure I really believe it.<p>I would apply for other jobs (preferably contract) but I have a three month notice period and it seems like it’ll get in the way of a lot of applications.<p>I’m considering waiting for my next pay day then handing in my notice. I figure that I can cut down on expenses a bit and have another month’s cash to live on after my three months are over.<p>That gives me four months to apply and interview. I can also say to my current work that if they want to keep me they can give me the contract role.<p>What do you think? I wouldn’t even have worried about doing this a year ago, but with current economic conditions (especially in the uk with brexit coming up) I’m concerned that it might be a mistake.<p>So HN, should I quit?')
