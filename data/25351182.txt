I&#x27;ve written thousands of pages in LaTeX, and it&#x27;s far more usable than most tools <i>IF</i> you can resist trying to overcomplicate things.  For example, want a diagram?  If you do it in xfig&#x2F;inkscape&#x2F;omnigraffle, you&#x27;ll have little pain.  If you decide to get clever and try to programmatically do it via tikz or some other package, you&#x27;ve opened up a world of pain.<p>The level of pain experienced by LaTeX users in my experience is more often poor choices made by the users who create unnecessary complexity.  Avoid that, and it&#x27;s a pretty reasonable model to work in.')
