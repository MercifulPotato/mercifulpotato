Isn&#x27;t the entire point of a microservices architecture to reduce the cognitive load with understanding how everything in the system works? You simply need to learn endpoints, not inner-workings. Take Uber for example: post API 1 for calling a ride, post API 2 for payment data, post API 3 for reporting a problem.<p>Unless your business requirements change drastically every 2-6 months, then it doesn&#x27;t matter what architecture you use - you&#x27;ll have to redo most of the stack in a monolith or distributed microservice arch.')
