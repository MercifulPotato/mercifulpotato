Russia seems pretty involved in all the hotspots lately including starting a war in Ukraine. Very likely same fate would be for Poland and Baltics if they didn&#x27;t protect themselves with stronger allies.\nAnd even if current Russia is not interested&#x2F;capable to cause trouble to east EU - that doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t change in the future.
