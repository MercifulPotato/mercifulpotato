The repeated quotes *from the insurrectionists themselves* announcing that &quot;this is a revolution&quot; and talking about hanging people, coming for their heads, overturning the election.<p>Quite simply, if you read the definition of insurrection, there&#x27;s no way to NOT apply it to these events, and sedition to apply to the president and Rudy among others.')
