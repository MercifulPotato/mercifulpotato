Large corporations and governments can be considered AI already, with entire humans as the neural nodes, augmented by silicon co-processors.<p>(I like to point out that Turing was observing his own mind when he created computers, so essentially they have always been reified mechanized thought.  Computers are AI already.  Ergo, what we think of as AI is really the attempt to make one kind of human thought imitate all the others.  From that POV it&#x27;s kind of foolish, almost a fetish.)<p>I don&#x27;t have any solutions, I just want to point out that rogue AIs are already a thing from a certain POV.  What are the FAANG but a bunch of complex entities that are too large for anyone to fully control or understand?  The high-frequency trading nexus is another point of dynamics where human motivation and automatic systems form a system of feedback loops beyond understanding or control.  Because humans are part of these machines they cannot be considered inanimate, they are living, breathing systems: cyborgs.')
