Item(by='tsimionescu', descendants=None, kids=[25718319], score=None, time=1610303989, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25717497, text='I would argue that a plan for handing out condoms only with proof of citizenship could be suspect of an attempt at ethnic cleansing. Similarly, if the central government of the Netherlands passed a law to hand out free condoms only in some particular province that may be suspect as well, especially one that has been considered of a different ethnicity.<p>However, if the local authorities in Frisia were to implement such a plan, that would be closer to the first case of universal measures, since the authorities in Frisia shouldn&#x27;t be expected to hand out condoms in other provinces. Of course, if it turned out that the measure was in fact planned by the central government and passed off as a local idea, that would again move the needle towards being suspicious.<p>In general, intent matters - that is why the law can&#x27;t be formalized mathematically. If a country is targeting some group that it has historically considered &quot;different&quot; (regardless of how questionable the difference is) with some kind of measure which may have negative consequences, that measure should receive scrutiny, and the context should be identified. For example, giving poor people condoms may be an attempt at population control in one country, while in another country it may be a democratically enacted benefit.<p>We are far away from providing mathematically clear definitions of legal concepts such as genocide, murder, theft, fraud and anything you like. There are always surprising subtleties, and intent and context are always going to be a part of the definition.')
