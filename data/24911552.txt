Ergonomics and having a correct desk setup up for your needs is incredibly important and something we don&#x27;t value as much as we should.<p>I&#x27;m 50&#x2F;50 on whether I&#x27;d like to go to back to the office in the future (not having to take the tube in London is massive plus) but if I do I&#x27;d want my own desk setup, monitors set up at my required height and a comfortable chair. Hopefully that&#x27;s not much too much to ask?')
