I might say it&#x27;s someone who was a member of the Nazi party in Germany during the early 20th century.<p>You might say it&#x27;s &quot;groups that goals are to harm others&quot;<p>Someone else might say it&#x27;s anyone who doesn&#x27;t support progressive policies because to do otherwise would cause harm to people, many of which are &quot;marginalized&quot; and &quot;under-represented&quot;.<p>Let&#x27;s see if we can agree on what a nazi is before we start figuring out what people are allowed to say and think in private.<p>&gt;Ideally there would be a public organization, not aligned with specific political groups, making the decisions in a transparent way.<p>Good luck with that.')
