There has been no time in the entire history of the \nUS that our &quot;democratic systems were transparent, verifiable and understandable&quot; in the face of a president and an army of his minions spreading lies meant to confuse people and undermine elections. The elections have never been more secure than they are right now.<p>When NO fact finding court will back up any of your claims then how do you know there are &quot;problems&quot; with the ballots in Georgia? Your only source is partisans and the manipulated media they are releasing.<p>Just because trump has been working to blanket the airwaves with lies and half truths to sew doubt doesn&#x27;t mean there is anything there. If there was they would be taking it to court and not losing 50+ cases.<p>There is no way to justify trying to overturn the vote based on technicalities while filling the airwaves with lies about fraud and that the election was stolen. If there is fraud they can prove it. If they can&#x27;t prove it then they don&#x27;t get to find loopholes to steal the election.<p>Can you actually not tell that trump is using marketing and con artist style manipulation to trick you into believing the election was stolen? There is no substance to these accusations.')
