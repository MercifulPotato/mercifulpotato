Not long ago I worked for a company that had a 24 hour live news broadcast. How do you think they handle this?<p>You example does not address my original question in:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24807064" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24807064</a><p>&quot;How would moderation even work for audio&#x2F;video conferences?&quot; &quot;Do you have solutions for issues like that?&quot; In your example there must be a delay in broadcasting, for the realtime captioning to happen in.  That sort of delay precludes a real time back and forth conversation that is expected from audio&#x2F;video conferencing.<p>Secondly I was also asking for a solution that would allow small time actors, like in my example of the conference I attended, to continue to be able to host such conferences with out undue liability or massive investment.<p>&gt; One of the underlying assumptions in all of this Section 230 talk is &quot;it&#x27;s too hard to moderate the deluge of user generated content&quot; .... so why even bother trying I guess?<p>I have not seen that be the main thrust of any argument. To my knowledge Section 230 was in part made to make it easier for more moderation to take place since before some had assumed any level of moderation would induce legal liability, both criminal and finical, for any content that made it past moderation.<p>&gt; Again, that doesn&#x27;t seem like the necessary conclusion. It prevents centralized platforms from publishing massive deluges of unvetted content.<p>As noted above your example above does not apply to my original question an example of a small time actor using audio&#x2F;video conferencing so I remain unconvinced.')
