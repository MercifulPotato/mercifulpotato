I think most of the logistical overhead of a traditional small restaurant will be commoditized and abstracted away by cloud kitchen providers, a marketing&#x2F;rewards layer, and delivery companies.  The barriers to entry will come down, but competition will increase and margins may decrease.  We&#x27;ll be left with fewer &quot;restauranteurs&quot; and more chefs who can sit in the cockpit and simply plan and execute on menus.  Since physical location is no longer a moat and menus are easily replicated, they will have to compete and win on brand.  It will be interesting to see the margins on delivery-only versus indoor dining once the pandemic is behind us.')
