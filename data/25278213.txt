It&#x27;s ok, but I find it a lot less sweet than sugar, so I have to use maybe 2x to 3x as much as I would regular sugar.. add to this that it&#x27;s probably 10x as expensive as sugar and it is just way too expensive for me.<p>Not to mention that at least the brand I tried was a lot finer than ordinary table sugar, and was closer to powdered sugar in consistency.  This is ok for some applications, but not others.<p>I found tagatose to be much, much better, as it&#x27;s virtually indistinguishable from sugar for me.  It&#x27;s also way more expensive than sugar, but at least it&#x27;s comparable to sugar in sweetness, so you only have to use about as much as you&#x27;d use of regular sugar.<p>Tagatose also doesn&#x27;t have any weird aftertaste to it, unlike stevia, for instance.  Overall, it&#x27;s by far the best sugar substitute I&#x27;ve ever tried, and would highly recommend it.')
