I was going to write a message about wishing they would invest more in Thunderbird and fix a particular bug.<p>As I was typing this it made me starting looking a bug I&#x27;ve found  using it. So then I started Googling around to see if someone else found it. Looking at it, it appears it&#x27;s been open for 3 years. But in the bug ticket they had steps to fix it. I now know few more menus in Thunderbird that I never considered clicking on. The bug now seem to be resolved and happier.<p>But then I also wish they would trim it down or at least give me the option to turn stuff off. I don&#x27;t want an events and task organiser and all this stuff. I just want a mail client. I also wish their spam filter would be more consistent and stuff keeps getting through that I&#x27;ve flagged and is clearly spam as it&#x27;s the same message I&#x27;ve been receiving for the last couple of months.')
