I LOVE Dan Carlin and would have liked to see him answer questions about current events and how he sees things playing out.  Instead, the first question was about the &quot;nature of evil&quot;.<p>I have to admit though, Dan Carlin on Joe Rogan isn&#x27;t a good interview either.  His podcasts are incredible, but maybe he just doesn&#x27;t interview well.')
