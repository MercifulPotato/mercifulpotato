Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606109406, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25183837, text='&gt; You are making it intentionally over-complicated. There isn&#x27;t much to unpack at all. A company becomes political by making a political decision, not by consequence of someone else using its products to make political decisions.<p>It&#x27;s not that simple.  If a gun store owner sells guns to people he knows are planning to commit a robbery, isn&#x27;t he also guilty of a crime?  Likewise, if a company sells materials for lethal injections to groups they know conduct executions, aren&#x27;t they tacitly supporting a policy of capital punishment?<p>Also your comment leans very heavily on the definition of &quot;political,&quot; which you leave totally undefined.  Once you try to get consensus definition of that, you&#x27;ll get into the same difficulty of unpacking it&#x27;s meaning that I was referring to.')
