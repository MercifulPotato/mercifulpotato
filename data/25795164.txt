In 2017, I released a CTF reverse-engineering challenge called Scriptabble, in which contestants had to understand a compiled AppleScript file which very slowly computed a flag, then fix or reimplement the algorithm to compute it faster.<p>Teams generally solved it by reverse engineering the AppleScript runtime to understand the VM bytecode; one writeup is here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;_niklasb&#x2F;status&#x2F;856594863294472193" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;_niklasb&#x2F;status&#x2F;856594863294472193</a><p>So, I guess I can&#x27;t be too surprised that run-only AppleScript ended up as a good malware vector - it&#x27;s so poorly documented, and there are so few tools to understand it, that it could easily fly under the radar.')
