Comp in US is insanely high, tons of competition for workers, etc).<p>But I&#x27;d argued that the main reason is: insane growth of US tech sector in past decades as compared to elsewhere in the world. This enables both higher comparative wages and competition for labour.<p>Also consider that almost anyone can start a tech business (workers are the capital resources of a tech outfit - not machinery) leading to more dynamic labour market.<p>But, I&#x27;m not sure this will continue to be true after backlash we are seeing against USA tech sector. Maybe that&#x27;s why the conversation around unions is starting now.')
