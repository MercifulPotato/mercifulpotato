A simple, <i>dedicated</i> interface. Drop in an airline, get a probability estimate you&#x27;ll be flying on a 737 MAX. Or, better, drop an airline, start&#x2F;stop points and time, get an answer whether you&#x27;ll be flying 737 MAX.<p>EDIT: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;airlinelist.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;airlinelist.com&#x2F;</a> has a feature I was thinking about, though not prominently visible. There&#x27;s a button &quot;No 737 MAX in fleet&quot;, which you can use as a filter. So a dedicated website could be just that, with this filter always on.')
