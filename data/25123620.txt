People seriously just got it. Some argued that is was because they had to learn with git, but... since then we&#x27;ve made the switch back to git for other reasons and we&#x27;ve back at wrangling with the tool again. I&#x27;d much much rather use Mercurial with Evolve extension - that is really good.')
