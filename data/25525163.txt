The DOS for Commodore computers instead ran on the floppy drive units themselves which included their own RAM and 6502 family CPUs to do so.<p>The other 8-bit micro I used personally was the TRS-80 Model 1. It would boot directly to BASIC but their was no DOS as part of this basic. To use a floppy drive a DOS boot disk was required. There were a few different DOS&#x27;s available for the machine. The official DOS available from Tandy was TRS-DOS.')
