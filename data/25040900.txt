I&#x27;ve stuck with Google phones for a while, and mostly had good experiences. Nexus 5X, Pixel 2, Pixel 4a lately.<p>The Nexus 5X was great, until it bricked itself. Fortunately, freezing it (literally in a freezer) would get it running long enough to get a few critical bits off.<p>Pixel 2 was a great phone, no complaints. Only replaced it because the battery life was getting painfully low. And the charging connection got really finicky in the last 6 months or so.<p>Pixel 4a is also great. Only issue is that for some reason, like a quarter of my contacts names don&#x27;t show up in the text messenger conversation list. Weird, but I can live with it.')
