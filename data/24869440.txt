Probably true if what you&#x27;re doing is CRUD app stuff that most people on the team have a good idea of how to do, but I&#x27;m skeptical that it works for other types of project&#x2F;product.<p>I work with hardware and being able to have someone physically look at a schematic with me or explain something to me in person greatly shortens the amount of time it takes me to understand them.<p>Edit: I also think we don&#x27;t know the long term effects being remote has on innovation. It seems like people congregate in cities because the rewards to being near people are greater than the costs.
