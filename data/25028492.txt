If added to AltStore, it would make that platform much more well known. In addition, if users install it from the App Store right now, it&#x27;s signed and won&#x27;t disappear or expire after any period of time. AltStore, TestFlight builds, etc., all require routine maintenance to stop from expiring. The iOS App Store release, however, will continue to function indefinitely, even if Apple pulls it from sale.')
