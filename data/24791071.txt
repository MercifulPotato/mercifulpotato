There’s nothing to do in SOMA other than walking to your tech office job and most of the restaurants around there are specifically for business lunch so many of them aren’t open now with the offices are be closed. Given all that, I imagine that area has seen the biggest exodus in the city. Plus the rents were stratospheric to begin with, so even a 30% drop is still ridiculously expensive. In other parts of San Francisco prices have dropped but not nearly as much as in SOMA.<p>This is all from my casual observations on craigslist and Zillow, I would love to see broader data and analysis if anyone has any')
