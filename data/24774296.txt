So she was going from relatively formal Mandarin to more informal Shanghainese, probably because that&#x27;s what she&#x27;s accustomed to speaking.<p>I didn&#x27;t really intend these as a demonstration of how different Shanghainese and Mandarin are even when you translate as literally as possible, but more as a way for people on HN who know Mandarin but haven&#x27;t had much exposure to Shanghainese to try and see how much they understand. I like to think I understood a few words like 自己 and 警察, but maybe that&#x27;s because I looked at the text first.')
