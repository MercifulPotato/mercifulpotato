There are way too many CVEs, and the kernel now has 28 million lines of code. That is a massive surface area for bugs and exploits. Even with LTS kernels, you can still expect to update your kernel a couple times per year with security patches. Each time that happens, you&#x27;re gonna need to reboot.<p>You&#x27;re right that LTS work doesn&#x27;t go away...bugfixes will still need to be backported to old software versions. But that work is actually quite a bit easier when it is not so tightly coupled to kernel versions and repositories that are unique for each distribution and release version and architecture.<p>That complexity is a combinatorial explosion. Instead of having a different codebase for each (PackageVersion,KernelVersion,Distribution,Release,Architecture) combination, you would only need to maintain a codebase for each (PackageVersion, Architecture) combo...and maybe for packages which are trivially cross-compiled, even fewer.')
