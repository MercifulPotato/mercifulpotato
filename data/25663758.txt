Not only do you still suffer (but with timeouts), you also payed more long term.<p>I&#x27;d be especially pissed if he refused to pull my tooth on the grounds that other people would still suffer from toothaches.<p>&gt; If everyone just takes turns pushing a boulder up a mountain eventually you&#x27;ll put in more effort than if everyone pushes at once, and have almost none of the results. Sometimes being even 99% there is not enough.<p>If few people are willing to pay the cost of an incremental solution then how are we proposing to convince them that the much greater cost of a large scale solution is worth it?')
