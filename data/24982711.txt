I do agree that there are words that convey more pomp and that those words tend to be derived from Latin and Greek (typically by way of French), but I don&#x27;t know that the distribution is particularly bimodal. Off the cuff, I would think it&#x27;s more likely that &quot;pomp&quot; of a word is derived from its distance from the core of the lexicon, because these rarer words indicate more education. The core of English is based on Old English and Old Norse, so naturally there are a lot of these words that seem pedestrian, but on the other extreme there are other words very recently borrowed into English (and thus at the periphery of our lexicon) that tend to convey a lot of pomp--typically these are from Latin or French or Greek, but sometimes even from other Germanic languages (e.g., schadenfreude, hygge, etc). To restate my point, the distribution appears gradual rather than bimodal.')
