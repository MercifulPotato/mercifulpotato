In some regard, I agree.  But I tried the initial exercise on my 8 year old and was impressed, so I purchased to have access to the rest.  I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m a sub-par intermediate vim user - knowing enough to know that I don&#x27;t know or use the true power of vim day to day, but have memorized a few &quot;tricks&quot; that seem to impress basic vim users.  Hoping I can leverage this to break a few bad habits I&#x27;ve gotten into.  Nice UI and I think the pricing is fair.  Hopefully the content expands, but even if the service isn&#x27;t around more than a few years I feel like the $15 will have been worth it.  Nice work!<p>Edit: question for Kenneth - do you plan on expanding the content?')
