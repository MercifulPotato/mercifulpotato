Item(by='Reelin', descendants=None, kids=[25396928], score=None, time=1607761000, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25396426, text='&gt; foreign governments and other actors actively seeking to polarize society<p>&gt; What are some better alternatives?<p>I have no idea if it&#x27;s mathematically possible but I&#x27;d be optimistic about the potential of a (hypothetical) privacy preserving web of trust metric. It would be really nice to have at least some limited indication of how the person behind the account fits into the world at large. Right now you can&#x27;t reliably determine (arbitrary examples) country or even continent of residence, paid posts by an organized campaign (PR, propaganda, etc) versus organic occurrences, etc.<p>Of course, Facebook is the ever present counterexample where people proudly attach their full legal name to hate filled streams. But at least I personally know for certain that they&#x27;re local people who actually exist and aren&#x27;t being paid for their posts! Silver linings and all that.')
