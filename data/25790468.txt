This sounds like the fingerprint and DNA data for people arrested and never charged.<p>It sounds like that as that is exactly what is happening - it has been decided in 2009 case (with a riveting name of &quot;Chief Constable of Humberside Police and others v. Information Commisioner and another&quot; [0]) that it is proper for the statutory public purpose of the  Police National Computer - now replaced by Police National Database - to retain nominal records until the person in question turns 100 years of age, as introduced into the new retention policy as of 2006 [1]. Even if you have been unlawfully&#x2F;wrongfully arrested, cautioned etc. your information still goes into the database but you can apply to have it expunged [2], which in practice may require support from your MP - and many simply don&#x27;t know about it.<p>&quot;Nominal records&quot; in this case refer to information linked to specifc named individuals reflecting the fact they have been convicted, cautioned or reprimanded or otherwise dealth with by issue of penalty notice for disorder. It&#x27;s not a &quot;nominal&quot; amount of data - it is quite substantial. DNA and fingerprints are supposed to be expunged from that set after three years due to &quot;Protection of Freedoms Act 2012&quot;, rest stays.<p>Police National Database that replaced Police National Computer retains all data from the PNC and makes it easier to access by multiple agencies.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commonslibrary.parliament.uk&#x2F;research-briefings&#x2F;sn06441&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commonslibrary.parliament.uk&#x2F;research-briefings&#x2F;sn06...</a><p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk&#x2F;+&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.homeoffice.gov.uk&#x2F;documents&#x2F;Bichard_Step_Model_Retention.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk&#x2F;+&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.homeo...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.acro.police.uk&#x2F;Services&#x2F;Record-deletion" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.acro.police.uk&#x2F;Services&#x2F;Record-deletion</a>')
