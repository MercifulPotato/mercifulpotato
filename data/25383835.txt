In 2020, the company generated an average €56k per month at around 11% profit through 8 webshops in niches in the beauty sector.<p>I hired some specialist freelancers to improve SEO and SEA but let them go bcs of COVID. 3 weeks ago hired my first “employee” (freelancer 1hr per day) for customer service as I’m finding answering emails very annoying and time consuming.<p>Hopefully it’ll allow me more time to develop the company further. I have more niches in mind and can always expand into other countries with my current niches (which is not always successful).<p>The work itself is liberating, though and frustrating. I often flow from feeling alone and incapable to victorious and relaxed, and back.<p>I personally know few people who own a company and I know no one who owns an e-commerce. Something which makes asking questions or getting help difficult.<p>Online I often feel overlooked; the startup world focuses a lot on programming and building software. I’m fully aware building your own product ánd a business at the same time is million times harder than what I do. Nevertheless, I’d love to be in contact with people going through similar issues and phases as me.<p>Not sure the ending of this post totally fits the topic intended, so to finish on a positive note:<p>Only a small percentage of companies make it to €1M annual rev, a barrier I expect to pass in 2021. Moreover, growing a company brings hard and interesting challenges; eg being a solo entrepreneur I’ll need to let go of my individualistic nature and improve my social and management skills in order to work well with my current and hopefully future employees.<p>For the curious, one of my shops is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electricnailfiles.co.uk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electricnailfiles.co.uk</a>.')
