For those who are also curious, here&#x27;s what Wikipedia says:<p>&gt;Until the late 4th-generation variants, most Model Ms have a 1.25&quot; slotted, circular speaker grille in their bottom surfaces. Relatively few contain an actual speaker, however, which was useful only for sounding beep codes on older terminal systems. The most common P&#x2F;Ns with speakers are 1394540 and 51G872, made for RS&#x2F;6000 UNIX workstations.')
