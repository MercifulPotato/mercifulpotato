You have to trust someone, but in a better world, that&#x27;s a community of experts reviewing freedom respecting software.<p>Sometimes, the benefits of that centralized control are real, but the concomitant abuse of said centralization appears almost axiomatically inevitable at this point, so you have to ask yourself if the benefits are even worth it. Microsoft&#x27;s OS itself has nearly turned into spyware. It&#x27;ll be signed spyware, assured that it&#x27;s doing what Microsoft wants it to do. If I&#x27;m going to get exploited, I can at least get exploited while remaining free. There&#x27;s a real chance that maybe I&#x27;m not getting exploited if I&#x27;m free, but just about 0% chance if I&#x27;m not even free.<p>I&#x27;m no ideologue, just sayin&#x27;.')
