Item(by='pr0zac', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611863249, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25947096, text='Honest question, why should market making organizations be allowed to take the upsides involved in their position but be able to avoid the downsides by just not doing the job they signed up for when they feel the risk is too high? The argument for why we allow these organizations to siphon money as a middle man is because they provide an important service and are taking on risk. But if they&#x27;re allowed to bail when things actually get risky that&#x27;s a lie and they&#x27;re just leeching money. You made the analogy that their job is like vacuuming nickels in front of bulldozers in another thread, but if they can just leave when the bulldozers show up what they&#x27;re actually doing is just vacuuming free nickels that other people dropped.<p>I know its pretty clear my current personal opinions on this topic lean rather hard in one direction but I am truly open to hearing the counter argument and could be convinced otherwise. Some of your posts here and in other threads have changed my view on other parts of this whole mess already so I&#x27;m asking because it seems like you&#x27;re willing to discuss sanely.')
