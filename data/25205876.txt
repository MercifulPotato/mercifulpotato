The Fourier Transform takes in a function and outputs another function, which you can put meaning on it or you can just &quot;nod and continue&quot; (which is often easier instead of trying to put some words on abstract concepts).<p>Some &quot;ideas&quot; you can use to analyze the situation are concepts learned in things like linear algebra like abstract vector spaces, basis, eigen-whatever... and so on.<p>In the case of the continuous time convolution, it just turns out there is a magical thing associated with something called a Dirac Delta function with certain properties that are important for various things in controls engineering.<p>Kinda feels like a piece of turd that refuses to evacuate but I just stopped caring about &quot;intuitive&quot; explanations.')
