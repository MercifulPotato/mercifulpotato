If you can&#x27;t then I&#x27;m going to side with those to try, even if their technique is less than perfect. Today our scientific experts are some of the very few who even try to follow the scientific method. I acknowledge that there are a small few outside of the profession who also try to apply science, but the number is so small that it&#x27;s almost not worth mentioning.<p>The reality is that few even have the means to actually perform experiments. Certainly outside of computer science, that is true. It&#x27;s unfortunate that the resources we allocate as a society towards scientific pursuit is such a tiny fraction of the resources we spend as a society. But I suppose that is more a reflection on the value of science to the general population than it is to anything else.')
