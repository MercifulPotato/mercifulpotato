I was in a wooden hide overlooking a small lake, and was lucky enough to witness a herd of about 20-30 elephants emerge from the bush on the other side of the lake. For the next hour they did nothing but play in the water under the baking heat (this was one of South Africa’s hottest Decembers on record). One of the baby elephants was particularly mischievous and enjoyed spraying it’s mother with water from behind. When the herd decided to leave, this baby elephant and another insisted on staying for a few more minutes. It was funny to see the mother’s come back and get them.<p>Elephants really are incredible creatures, which I had seen many times but never like this. All the seriousness in their imposing size disappeared quite literally in the water. It was amazing to see a group of animals in the wild do nothing but play. It reminded me that we humans sometimes just need to do the same as well, with no reason or productive purpose.')
