Or 1 hour?<p>The evidence you presented requires a straight connection between the two cities. That&#x27;s not going to happen, for reasons I presented and for which you yourself agreed.<p>If it happens it will be via regional hubs, say via Chicago and Denver. Even non-stop (with no additional acceleration and deceleration) that non-GC route will add more time. Plus there&#x27;s the 10 minutes or so for acceleration&#x2F;deceleration to 600mpn.<p>If you pigeonhole me as a naysayer then may I pigeonhole you as one of those Project Plowshare advocates who wanted to use nukes to make harbors and canals, and fracture the ground for oil production? Or as a modern Lyle Lanley?<p>I&#x27;m asking you to use realistic numbers which make you seem well-informed, not numbers that are easily dismissed as overly optimistic, if not ridiculous.<p>Just like in Marge vs. the Monorail, US infrastructure is horribly under-maintained. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.infrastructurereportcard.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.infrastructurereportcard.org&#x2F;</a> for example. That sort of Federal involvement in local projects is more in line with FDR&#x27;s Great Depression actions than Eisenhower&#x27;s interstate system.')
