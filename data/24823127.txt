You can&#x27;t tell me it&#x27;s not a force. I can&#x27;t resist its pull.)<p>It wouldn&#x27;t be an ellipse even if Earth <i>were</i> a point mass. The gravity of the Moon and Sun, the gravitational lumpiness in the sky, has the same effect as the gravitational lumpiness underground. The combined result may be no closer to an ellipse than it is to a parabola.')
