Item(by='superfrank', descendants=None, kids=[25085871], score=None, time=1605292423, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25083480, text='&gt; AI will achieve human-level intelligence<p>I just have a passing interest in the AI space, but I feel like we&#x27;ve been hearing that this is &quot;10 years away&quot; for the last 20+ years.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m wrong, but with technologies like AI and self driving cars we tend to make a lot of progress and then hit long plateaus of minimal improvement. It feels like someone makes a breakthrough and then everyone rushes to solve all the formerly hard problems that are now easy to solve because of that breakthrough, but once those dry up, we run into a different &quot;unsolvable&quot; problem. The general public keeps assuming we will advance in a linear (or logarithmic) fashion during those times of growth and fails to account for the fact that there are large plateaus of minimal growth in between them.<p>I do think at some point we will achieve this, but 10 years feels like an incredibly optimistic timeline.<p>Also, as a side note, over the years I&#x27;ve found that anyone who describes themselves as a &quot;futurist&quot; tends to have a bit of optimism bias toward how quickly we will reach certain technological milestones, which makes me believe this timeline even less.')
