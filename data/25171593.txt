But cutting 10-20% on your income for a better job in terms of work life balance, interest or whatever else could be worth it for many people. Is there really that much difference between someone making 80K and someone making 100K? In a country like the U.S, where you can potentially lose your health insurance and sending your kids to college is super expensive - then maybe. In Europe the difference is gonna be only what kind of car you drive and how big your house is. In terms of your health, your kids opportunities in life etc, it doesn&#x27;t matter that much.')
