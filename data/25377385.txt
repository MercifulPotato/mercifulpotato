Exactly how dangerous each activity is is difficult to know. We have to apply reasoning to what we know about the transmission mechanisms and people&#x27;s social behaviors. People sit across from one another without masks for long periods of time at restaurants, and they&#x27;re social meeting points. It&#x27;s entirely reasonable to assume they&#x27;re a likely location for transmission.<p>The basic point is that at the moment, most public life has to be shut down, so that R drops below 1 and new cases decrease. Restaurants are very low down on the list of essential services that need to be kept running in order for society to function. We can temporarily shut down restaurants and compensate them for their losses.')
