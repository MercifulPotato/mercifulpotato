The mechanism is consuming less calories than you’re expending. How you do that is up to you. For example, I’ve lost weight on a fast-food only diet, because I like eating burgers and pizza. I just make sure I’m consuming less than 2200 calories, which puts me at approximately 15% caloric deficit.  If you want to eat more, say at 2500 calories, then you’ll have to exercise enough to burn another 300 calories so you’re still in deficit. You can bump up your “maintenance” calories by putting on more lean mass, by weight training for example.')
