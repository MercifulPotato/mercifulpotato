Whether that&#x27;s because they were more prepared in the BLM protests or less professional than in D.C., or whether because they were busy trying to evacuate the inside of the Capitol, or whether the BLM police were responding to the looting, or whether protesters frequently stayed out past curfew, or whether a core tenet of the protest was ACAB and a (justified, imo) loathing of the police, or maybe even because the cops didn&#x27;t have the precedent of the BLM protests that they might not want to repeat is all conjecture.')
