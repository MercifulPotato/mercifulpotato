As a cyclist, I don&#x27;t want people overtaking me 100km&#x2F;h with a 1m gap. As a pedestrian trying to cross a small city or town street without dedicated crossing, I don&#x27;t want drivers to suddenly appear with 100km&#x2F;h from a small curve. I&#x27;d argue that 50km&#x2F;h in a city is still too much. 30km&#x2F;h should be the limit.')
