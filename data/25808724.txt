The general rule that applies here is consistency.<p>So let&#x27;s say in PHP, the preferred convention is snake_cake, then use it for the whole project. Then if you are working on a JS project, which the team demands camelCase, then just follow it.<p>There could be some cases, like in your 3rd example, the team applies camelCase for normal variables, and snake_cake for properties. Again, you still have to follow if it is something the team has agreed.')
