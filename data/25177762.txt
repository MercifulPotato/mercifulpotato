Whenever someone brings up using an SBC as some kind of cheap, low-end computer that will get stuffed behind a screen and keyboard&#x2F;mouse combo and nothing else, I always bring up how even a 10 year old laptop could probably outperform even a rpi4.<p>Always get called a stick in the mud, too. Maybe I am. But seriously, if you just want a cheap linux desktop, grab any laptop from ebay from the past decade. If you want, strip all the casing and peripherals off -- the mainboards are pretty small.<p>Heck, you can repurpose the i2c bus on the video outputs for whatever you want. Could even use a breakout board and drive a microcontroller, get additional GPIO pins[0].<p>Probably other nifty hacks out there. The last gen &quot;ExpressCard&quot; expansion slots are basically external PCIe busses, you can great those out and add PCIe cards to a laptop board.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackaday.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;06&#x2F;18&#x2F;i2c-from-your-vga-port&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackaday.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;06&#x2F;18&#x2F;i2c-from-your-vga-port&#x2F;</a><p>Edit: To be clear, I&#x27;m not pushing back on the idea of the raspberry pi. There are a <i>ton</i> of valid uses for them. I&#x27;m specifically pushing back against the idea that they&#x27;re cheap, power efficient general purpose linux machines.<p>They are definitely <i>low</i> power, but not necessarily power efficient. And I think re-purposing the mountain of e-waste instead of buying a bunch more new SBCs may be better ecologically, but all the power to those who want to have fun with a cool little ARM board. No sarcasm.')
