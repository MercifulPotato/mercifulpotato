The increases to each would be similar; after all, a healthy body won&#x27;t just keel over and die. The post you were responding to specifically mentioned the costs of end of life care. If we can&#x27;t reduce the amount of time between when a body begins to fail and when a person dies, then we&#x27;ve done nothing to address that issue.')
