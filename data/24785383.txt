Giuliani passed the emails via Steve Bannon (Trump’s former campaign manager and “Chief Strategist”, since indicted for mail fraud and money laundering) to a hack “journalist” (former Hannity producer) at the NY Post who did zero fact checking, because no credible journalist or news organization would ever touch such a flimsy story. Someone in the chain made a PDF of these fake emails a year ago but then sat on it, before releasing it in the last 3 weeks before an election, without releasing enough forensic evidence for any third party to do even the most basic check.<p>The computer repair guy’s story is just comically implausible. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedailybeast.com&#x2F;man-who-reportedly-gave-hunters-laptop-to-rudy-speaks-out-in-bizarre-interview" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedailybeast.com&#x2F;man-who-reportedly-gave-hunter...</a><p>You want a real corruption scandal? How about the $10 million bribe paid to the Trump campaign by a state-owned Egyptian bank right before the 2016 election (and immediately after candidate Trump met privately with President Sisi). Which the DOJ never finished investigating because Trump-appointed officials instructed them not to. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;14&#x2F;politics&#x2F;trump-campaign-donation-investigation&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;14&#x2F;politics&#x2F;trump-campaign-donat...</a>')
