In particular for a long time x86 had much cheaper memory barriers than the competition. Not only store release and load acquires were free, but sequentially consistent barriers were also fairly cheap. Intel had to add optimizations to make them fast much earlier, while weaker RISCs could get away with expensive barriers for much longer.<p>Now apparently M1 has very cheap atomics and barriers, to it is doing as much tracking and speculation as an x86 CPU. But probably they can get away with tracking fewer memory operations, which might improve both performance and power usage.')
