Item(by='wolrah', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611760566, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25927380, text='This is one of the reasons I chose a Moonlander over an Ergodox for my first split keyboard, the ability to fold the thumb cluster down to an angled position seemed like it&#x27;d be more natural.  So far in the two months I&#x27;ve been using it I think I was correct about that (that said, when closer to flat the Moonlander&#x27;s cluster is at a much steeper angle off the rest and is less than ideal)<p>Also likewise on thinking about a sculpted build, the rabbit hole is deep with these things.  Redox Manuform is where I&#x27;m currently leaning, I like the extra keys and the thumb cluster looks a bit better.  Unfortunately that means going full custom, since while a few vendors sell prebuild Dactyl Manuforms no one seems to do the Redox version.')
