They&#x27;ve proven to be more than happy to bait the mob when they think they can use it to consolidate their own power.<p>The GOP has been doing a large scale equivalent of swinging nunchucks around in public. The problem isn&#x27;t that sometimes it swings around the wrong way and whacks someone they didn&#x27;t intend to whack. Well, no, it is, of course that&#x27;s a problem. But the more fundamental problem is that they&#x27;re recklessly swinging an unpredictable weapon in public in an effort to be intimidating in the first place. And the problem is that people who didn&#x27;t feel personally threatened by this behavior just sat there and came up with sorry excuses to try and rationalize it. This is deeply antisocial comportment that should have no place in the top echelons of civil society.')
