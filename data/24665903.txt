That&#x27;s what makes it a computational reducibility question and not a measurement information-availability objection.<p>(Also: For a twist, assume you have a quantum computer and they are quantum balls.)<p>&gt; Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle<p>This raises questions, certainly, but the answers aren&#x27;t obvious when talking about repeated interactions with the many particles.  In the box model, the balls are inevitably entangled with each other at the position-momentum level due to their collisions, even if that entanglement is undetectable in an analogous way to how their motions appear &quot;random&quot; classically.<p>Heisenberg does not apply to each ball independently when they are entangled.  In this box model, as your little computer&#x2F;mind&#x2F;demon accumulates information-in-principle from many interactions, in addition to classical information it couples to that entangled state, and the independence of Heisenberg limits dissolves because they aren&#x27;t really independent.<p>(Also: Once you invoke Heisenberg, you&#x27;ve also invoked quantum particles in a box <i>self-interfering</i>.  In a box that <i>reduces</i> the amount of information you need to represent a single particle&#x27;s state to an integer, bounded if the energy is bounded.  I&#x27;m not sure if that also applies to multiple particles interacting chaotically.)<p>&gt; except possibly for a homogenous spherical molecule in a frictionless vacuum.<p>Well, the model actually is about homogeneous spherical molecules, and vacuum at the molecular level is frictionless, so that&#x27;s ok :-)')
