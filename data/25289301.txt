XML is feature packed. Arguably the &quot;better&quot; format but JSON has taken over because it&#x27;s way easier to use.<p>REST beat SOAP and XML-RPC because it was less complex and waaay easier to build.<p>When there is something that is easy and even potentially a little simpler than needed which does the same thing as something complex, the simple thing almost always wins - even if - or especially if - its worse. The whole &quot;Worse is Better&quot; mantra has always proven true.<p>I&#x27;ve said for like 20 years now that they should have just tacked a couple more octets onto IPv4 and rather than trying to reinvent the wheel.<p>Exhaustion was and still is the most important problem to fix. Get that out of the way, and then we could have fixed the other things wrong with IP one at a time.<p>We could have been on like IPv12 by now. Small iterative changes are easier to absorb. Adoption would have happened already. instead we threw the baby out with a bath water, classic second system syndrome.')
