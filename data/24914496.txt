My lovely kitty on the other hand, I wonder sometimes. I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is that domesticated dogs ain&#x27;t the same as feral cats that enjoy a symbiotic relationship.<p>A dog is a great source of oxytocin when it looks at you and wags its tail. A cat decides whether or not they want anything to do with you, and in my case, that desire is to sit on my chest and lick my chin with a tongue that feels like sandpaper. They both love attention and enjoy affection, they just express it in different ways.')
