Item(by='rbanffy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608168205, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25451040, text='An inflatable habitat could hold a small-ish centrifuge enough for some tests and to provide some semblance of gravity for sleep and exercise. If it gets really bad, the centrifuge can be dismantled and its remains used as divisions for what would be a very large empty space.<p>Tethering two Dragons together would be complicated and maybe require an EVA to attach the tether. The trunk remains attached during a launch abort, so it can survive 1g without flying away (the Dragons will need it for deorbit after the experiment). I&#x27;m also guessing they&#x27;d need some redesign, because you don&#x27;t want to mess with the parachute fixation points and, even if you did, the &quot;floor&quot; of the capsule should, for this exercise, be perpendicular to the acceleration.<p>In short, I guess we need sci-fi grade engines that can pull 1g for weeks at a time.')
