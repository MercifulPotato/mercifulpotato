So you have NGINX, Kong, Traefik -- over a half dozen in total.<p>Not all are fully featured in their open source form, so in some cases you need to purchase the tool to do something like url-rewrite. In some cases, the solution exists, but is something contributed via community (better than none, great in theory, but brittle given the pace of platform change.)<p>Further, once you actually try to spend time on it, you find there is little to no documentation on topics such as url-rewrite.<p>It is all interesting, but then you realize you actually have deadlines -- and now you&#x27;ve spent half the day on futzing around with annotation permutations (since there are few&#x2F;no docs) and you have not actually started working on the actual task of tuning a model on PyTorch...that is when you drop down to just &#x27;docker run...&#x27;')
