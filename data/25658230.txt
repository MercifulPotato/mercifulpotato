Except it is quite clear there is no need for that unless you are planning on super soldiers research, or some other way of separating people through genetics (violence like genocide, or a sort of discriminant for creating an elite class).<p>Both of these sound more like Nazi Germany, but we are also coming from a western tradition of democracy and individualism. But again, there really shouldn&#x27;t be a need for DNA collection of EVERYONE, that&#x27;s Orwellian.')
