In the first world of the time, the masses became literate and had more leisure time.   Combined with advances in the technology of printing and paper production, and in distribution of the physical book, it led to an explosion of interest in something called “the novel”.  It was almost a madness at the time, cf. the popularity of Charles Dickens works.<p>But eventually the violent boiling cooled to a simmer.  A continuous simmer, but just a simmer culturally.  I don’t know how or why the dynamic changed, but it did settle down.<p>I’d guess a similar analogy could be made with “the theater”, which is even below a simmer at this point in modern culture.<p>What will change the dynamic?  Your guess is as good as mine...')
