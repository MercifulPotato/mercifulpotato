They use a similar (but more powerful chip) and cost less than cost of shipping: a couple of dollars&#x2F;euros each.<p>They come with a USB boot loader (so you don&#x27;t need a USB to serial cable).  Get 2 and you can also use one as a programmer (probably cheaper than a USB to serial cable).<p>They&#x27;re also compatible with the Arduino IDE if get fed up with the low level stuff')
