A lot of great tech was invented to solve very real problems that groups of people faced. Once it gets hyped though, everyone wants it in their stack because they&#x27;ve read about it in blog posts or want to give a conference talk about or &lt;INANE_REASON_X&gt;.<p>Elasticsearch, postgres, message queues etc. all were invented by people when they faced real problems. As such, I don&#x27;t view them as reinventions, but as simply inventions. Software engineers tackle a problem space thats truly ginormous and diverse. It seems quite natural that this situation would spawn a multitude of tools to manage that complexity, get a competitive edge, or just build a product that just wasn&#x27;t possible before.')
