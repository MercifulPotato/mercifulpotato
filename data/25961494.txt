Appearing at the UBS global media conference in New York, Mr. Buckmaster took questions from the bemused audience, which apparently could not get its collective mind around the notion that Craigslist exists to help Web users find jobs, cars, apartments and dates — and not so much to make money.<p>&gt; Wendy Davis of MediaPost describes the presentation as a “a culture clash of near-epic proportions.” She recounts how UBS analyst Ben Schachter wanted to know how Craigslist plans to maximize revenue. It doesn’t, Mr. Buckmaster replied (perhaps wondering how Mr. Schachter could possibly not already know this). “That definitely is not part of the equation,” he said, according to MediaPost. “It’s not part of the goal.”<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dealbook.nytimes.com&#x2F;2006&#x2F;12&#x2F;08&#x2F;craigslist-meets-the-capitalists&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dealbook.nytimes.com&#x2F;2006&#x2F;12&#x2F;08&#x2F;craigslist-meets-the...</a>')
