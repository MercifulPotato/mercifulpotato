There are corporations that use the GPL&#x27;d version of my software without issue. They use my software internally and also extend it with custom functionality for their own business purposes and have absolutely no issue doing so. There are also corporations that use the commercial license of my software in situations where they wish to release software commercially to other parties.<p>I also do the same myself. Internally within my company I use Linux and MySQL, both of which are GPL&#x27;d software and I am a very happy user of both software products and never felt like I was restricted in how I can use them.<p>If I wish to incorporate MySQL into commercial software, then I&#x27;d need to pay Oracle for a license, but I have no need to do that.<p>In what way is any of this incredibly restrictive?<p>At any rate, I don&#x27;t know that we&#x27;re going to change one another&#x27;s minds on this issue, all I can say is that there seems to be a fairly substantial group of users who do not feel restricted in how they use very popular GPL software such as Ad Block, Wordpress, Git, Linux, MySQL.<p>I use all of those and never once felt like they restricted my usage.')
