Then you see that all the rich people use tax loopholes to pay close to zero while middle class people struggle to get rich because of the extra tax hurdle.<p>I think the situation is slightly better in Switzerland because it&#x27;s a semi-direct democracy and the greater use of referendums gives the population a greater chance to shape their society.')
