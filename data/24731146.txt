Imagination will be curtailed and suffer, and we the readers will suffer as a result.<p>This misguided attempt to &quot;wokify&quot; storytelling is reminiscent of the attempts by INGSOC in 1984 to eliminate the expression of the shades of meaning inherent in ambiguity and nuance from Oldspeak (Standard English). In order to reduce the language&#x27;s function of communication, Newspeak uses concepts of simple construction: pleasure vs. pain, happiness vs. sadness. Goodthink vs. crimethink linguistically reinforces the State&#x27;s totalitarian dominance of the people of Oceania.<p>I hope nobody follows those guidelines. I pitty the fool who does.')
