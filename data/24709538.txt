The only things that should &quot;matter&quot; by definition is the thing you can have influence on and will be important for your life. Why something you can&#x27;t have influence on (space) should matter in how I make decisions ?<p>I agree with the general, bigger line to not get too much stress about random stuff, but in that case I prefer the line of thinking that short term problem are usually meaning less compared to the duration of of your life, than trying to justify it by the fact that &quot;a universe exists&quot;.<p>Sorry for the use of &quot;bullshit&quot; if you&#x27;re the kind to be offended by that')
