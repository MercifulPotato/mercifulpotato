Maybe I&#x27;m just exasperated because of the fact that all my protests and outrage didn&#x27;t make a difference.<p>One of my biggest frustrations these days is actually the CMA tracking cookie notifications that come up on every web site wanting me to agree before continuing. They are more annoying than paywalls and as a general rule I never click I agree so they keep comming.<p>I&#x27;m not negligent with my privacy, but not vigilant to the point of blocking all emails from people with gmail addresses either. I guess I&#x27;m just more complacent and can&#x27;t be bothered to expend the time and effort to protect my privacy to that degree anymore. Maybe once I get burned I&#x27;ll feel differently but at this point in my life I have far more important things to worry about.<p>I sometimes joke that I need to go back to attending church regularly so I can learn how to act properly whilst an omniscient entity like big tech is watching my every action.')
