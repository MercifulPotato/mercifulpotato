Many of these are &quot;you&#x27;ll know it when you see it&quot; kind of features. For example, they will list hardware 2fa as their feature, but they won&#x27;t mention you&#x27;re limited to only one key per account. Some of those are tiny inconveniences, others are deal-breakers. And you keep finding them, but you&#x27;ve already organized your workflow and switching to another vendor might be costly, mostly in time.')
