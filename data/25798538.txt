Your confusion comes from comparing filter media performance to simulated as-worn performance. A good surgical mask media will very much likely provide 17% penetration. Note that this is just the media. When you wear one, there are gaps everywhere. So that&#x27;s why the paper says &quot;penetration goes up to 76% when considering fit&quot;.<p>As for the rest, the paper is saying that with a good tape&#x2F;blocking the exhaust valve, the masks perform as well as ones without the valve. And they speculate that with a better designed exhaust valve, even better source control than as-is valve might be achievable, but there is no standards to measure it.<p>PS: As for your last points, figure 4 answers it.')
