I&#x27;m advocating against claiming there is danger without investigating (&#x27;abundance of caution&#x27; is usually shorthand for &#x27;we could check this, but we&#x27;re not going to bother and just make decisions without information because, hey, no one ever got fired for saying no, right?&#x27;) My point is that even if there is potential issue that is highly unlikely, it will still have to line up with several other highly unlikely things for it to be a problem, which is a fairly good definition of &#x27;safe&#x27; in modern complex systems engineering.<p>As to Kobe Bryant, yes his helicopter flew into terrain (unsurprisingly, &#x27;flew into terrain&#x27; is incredibly common in aircraft accidents.  Sadly, most of them are perfectly serviceable when they do so).  There is no indication that the issue was a radar altimeter (if one was even installed, I don&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re required in that class), much less one that was being interfered with.  I don&#x27;t think the NTSB report is out yet, but I expect the cause will be what it commonly is: a pilot (with a famous and rich client who wanted to get somewhere quickly) taking their vehicle into marginal weather conditions beyond what they and their aircraft are competent to handle.  Working on that problem will save a hell of a lot more lives than investigating &#x27;may be a problem&#x27; that no one can even describe a mechanism for.')
