But it&#x27;s also really, really complex to configure, and it detracts from why I love vim so much - if I wanted an IDE, I&#x27;d be doing my Scala work over in Intellij.<p>I&#x27;m still contemplating whether I can get what I want with a second window a file watcher running build commands.<p>Agreed the treesitter is also really exciting.')
