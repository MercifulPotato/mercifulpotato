I realize this is about protecting privacy, and I fully support that, but putting that aside for a second, I am part owner of a small business and an advertiser - what consequences could this have? I rely on Facebook ads to market to parents in the local area (as well as Google). We use several FB tools to try to make the target audience as specific as possible. This helps, because not everyone is interested in the services our business offers, and saves us ad money. Does this mean that the campaigns I run could become less effective, because FB is less capable of figuring out what the user is like? What will breaks exactly? Is it just retargeting?')
