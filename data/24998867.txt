Is it the overprotective brother or father hoping for a different world? Or are these people having their own internal struggle with lust? Does it matter?<p>I don’t think this movie crosses any community standards, it is just annoying child actors in an annoying plot because its just not that good, like it needs the controversy in order to be viewed')
