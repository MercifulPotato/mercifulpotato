There have been lots of discussions about PouchDB and GunJs but they always seemed limited in the backend story. I&#x27;ve been trying to get Couchdb to work with my own proxies for about a year and it is a big pain point. But, the real time synchronization and offline support is so compelling with those stacks. Thinking in documents and only about your front end code (letting the library do the hard work of synchronization) removes a lot of stress.<p>Using postgresql alone would make this super exciting. Adding graphql takes it to &quot;giddy&quot; level for me.<p>Is there a story for offline support? Is there perhaps a react library that could help here? The tutorial uses subscriptions, wonder what happens when the app goes offline?<p>This is so amazing. I&#x27;m going to play with it and Svelte and see how it goes.<p>Well done!')
