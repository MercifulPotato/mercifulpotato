People have a tendency to relay advice on what has worked best for them; with little regard for whether or not it will work best for others.<p>On one hand the auther uses a lot of &quot;my&quot; language to convey what works best for him. That&#x27;s great and I am happy to read what works best for others, but what makes it a bit short-sighted is the shift in language from:<p>&gt;The more attention I can devote, the more cycles I can complete, and the more productive I am.<p>to:<p>&gt;Make your place of work boring and tidy.<p>&gt;Make your smart phone dumb.<p>&gt;Be an OS minimalist.<p>etc.<p>This shift from &quot;here&#x27;s what works best for me&quot; to &quot;here&#x27;s what will work best for you&quot; is quite imposing and presumptuous.')
