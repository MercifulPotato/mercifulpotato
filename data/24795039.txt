There&#x27;s quite a bit of irony in the author <i>quoting</i> Wikipedia though. On first reading, I thought that was some sort of punch-line.<p>&gt; Having a variety of interests is no more a sign of generalized intelligence than being able to walk and chew gum.<p>This is a reductive oversimplification, and I really wish the author were more fair. There&#x27;s something pretty incredible about someone contributing to multiple fields of study. It&#x27;s rare, but it happens.
