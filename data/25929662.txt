If you need your Wi-Fi to be secure, you need to be doing RADIUS authentication or similar.<p>It&#x27;s just from a UI standpoint that it&#x27;s very seamless. You don&#x27;t have to see the password, you don&#x27;t have to enter it anywhere, one device just shares the Wi-Fi password with another device nearby.')
