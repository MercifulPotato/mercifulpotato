Yes natural disasters happen and we can&#x27;t prevent all of them. Yes we will have &quot;nuclear disasters&quot;. The world is under constant threat of semiglobal nuclear war.<p>But Chernobyl and Fukushima (and others, let&#x27;s not kid ourselves) are disasters with minuscule cost in lives and environment harm. Every year 60 million people die and out of that 12 million die due to unhealthy environment. Risks of (non-weapon) nuclear energy to life, while they exist, are a complete non-issue. Apart from political changes, we need cheap reliable energy to fix the atmosphere and to fix that unhealthy environment.')
