The downside is usually that once you have working code, it&#x27;s just too tempting to launch it as-is. Why wouldn&#x27;t you if it&#x27;s working or even close to working and you can launch it and start making money off of it?\nThe best part of a Figma prototype is that you can&#x27;t launch it and nothing about it is permanent. Really you don&#x27;t even need Figma, you could use MS Paint or Whimsical or Miro or whatever. \nThe point is that it helps to remove the temptation and incentive to &quot;validate&quot; and ship asap.')
