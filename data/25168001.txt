You&#x27;re only taking what you can carry, so you leave a whole lot behind. If you&#x27;re still in California, you have a lot of options within striking distance.<p>There isn&#x27;t really a pinnacle with the backcountry or walking on the ground - there&#x27;s always a longer trail or more distant target.')
