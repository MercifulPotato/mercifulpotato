You get a full computer with much more I&#x2F;O.<p>However, there are a lot of other factors to consider:<p>- Initial cost of the hardware<p>- Time and energy spent maintaining&#x2F;configuring the device<p>- Physical maintenance of the device - power&#x2F;network&#x2F;physical management&#x2F;etc<p>- Lack of immediate access to I&#x2F;O ramp-up and global replication<p>- Lack of direct integration into other AWS services&#x2F;etc<p>AWS Lambda isn&#x27;t a magic bullet, but it offers a lot of convenience to offset time and money spent on a DIY approach. I run a small static site&#x2F;service that never breaks Lambda&#x27;s free tier, but most of the cost goes to hosting a NAT gateway for it to have access to the internet. The benefit of hassle free, global access to the service I built <i>and</i> the underling services it runs on (Lambda&#x2F;AWS in general) makes it worth the cost. I could setup the same service at home on a Raspi for pennies by comparison, but if my home internet goes down while I&#x27;m away, or a dog chews on an ethernet cable, it&#x27;s a headache that I have to deal with personally - or I have to do remote tech-support to whoever is home: &quot;Okay, you should see a Raspbery Pi. No...it&#x27;s not a food. It&#x27;s a computer. Whatever... I know it&#x27;s a strange name. Anyway, is the cable plugged in? Do you see a blinking light?&quot;<p>I find it similar to being able to use a rental car while visiting a foreign city vs just driving yours across the country to save some money. You might save some money, but it comes with extra time, maintenance, potential roadblocks (literally and figuratively), breakdowns that you will have to deal with personally, etc. It&#x27;s really up to personal preference.')
