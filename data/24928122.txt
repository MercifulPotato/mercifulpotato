At some point there&#x27;s clearly a threshold of unacceptable behavior right?<p>The trick is to have that threshold be at a &quot;reasonable&quot; level. That&#x27;s tricky and has room for error, but it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not worth doing.<p>Note that my original response was to this statement: &quot;As I see it, a CoC is a tool for those in power to better exert their influence and control.&quot;<p>We need guidelines for group activities, and they need to evolve as we learn more about the world, and framing this as a tool for power tripping is &quot;the elites&quot;.<p>From the article, it appears that the &quot;rules&quot; were not well communicated and&#x2F;or were poorly enforced. Blaming it on having a CoC vs. a person making poor choices is what I&#x27;m pushing back against.')
