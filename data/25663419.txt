This is why the declaration of independence does not say &quot;life, liberty, and happiness&quot;, it says &quot;life, liberty, and _the_ _pursuit_ _of_ happiness&quot;. There&#x27;s an implied statement there that not everyone, or even most will be happy, but we should be free to be able to seek what makes us happy. You don&#x27;t have a right to happiness, but you have a right to be able to try to make yourself happy.')
