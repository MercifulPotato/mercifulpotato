Perhaps somewhere in amongst this James is actually an expert on something who has useful knowledge to impart to Harvard&#x27;s students, but perhaps not? Maybe you really can go to a &quot;lecture&quot; in which a tenured Harvard professor expects you to laugh at jokes which even by the already woeful standards of Computer Science jokes, are not funny. Ouch.<p>One of these articles proposes that the problem with smartphones is that they aren&#x27;t very good phones. In this &quot;satirical&quot; form it proposes a pyramid shaped &quot;hierarchy of needs&quot; for phones with &quot;Make phone calls&quot; as the most important element at the bottom.<p>Perhaps in 2014 that felt like an insight, to James Mickens or to his readers. I don&#x27;t think so, but maybe 2014 is longer ago than I think it is, and maybe nobody had noticed back then that (and I apologise if this is an amazing insight to you now):<p><i>Calling them phones was an excuse</i>. People aren&#x27;t very good at figuring out what they actually want, so telling people we&#x27;re going to offer them Network capable handheld computers wouldn&#x27;t work, they don&#x27;t realise they want those. So you say these are &quot;phones&quot; and then let them gradually figure out that actually they have never wanted to make a telephone call in their life but they did want a handheld computer to access the Network.<p>The form factor makes no sense for a <i>phone</i>. Clearly a rectangular sheet of glass isn&#x27;t the right shape for a phone. But it <i>is</i> a good shape for a handheld computer. Which, again, is what you actually wanted anyway.')
