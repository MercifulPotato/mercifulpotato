Item(by='wtallis', descendants=None, kids=[25280388], score=None, time=1606935688, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25279696, text='The transistors are 3D only in the sense that FinFETs aren&#x27;t just wires on top of a flat surface of doped silicon. There&#x27;s still no 3D stacking of one transistor on top of another, and transistor density is still best measured by how much 2D wafer area is occupied by a transistor.<p>This is very different from the situation for NAND flash memory, where the memory cell array is genuinely 3D and pushing toward hundreds of layers of memory cells, so volumetric measurements are starting to become useful. (However, the horizontal dimensions of various 3D NAND designs are roughly similar, so comparing simply in terms of layer count is a good first approximation of bit density.)')
