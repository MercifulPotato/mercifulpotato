So I am skeptical about your claim regarding the causal arrow: I only know of this phenomenon because I’m in tech, and other tech people pointed me to it.<p>To me, this feels a little like saying “lots of tech people I know with high salaries were early contributors to Wikipedia, therefore being an early contributor to Wikipedia probably made them successful.”')
