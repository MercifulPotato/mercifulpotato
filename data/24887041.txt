And with success.<p>I&#x27;ve repeatedly heard exposure therapy described as the single most effective treatment in psychology. If true, our approach to microaggressions may be backwards. Protecting people from them may be exactly the wrong treatment for people that are stressed by such behavior.

It might be both politically incorrect and the most effective treatment available.<p>In the same way an unmoderated internet forum may be healthier than a moderated one.')
