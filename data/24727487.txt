I have no problem owning and using a Facebook account, but that&#x27;s my choice and I choose what to share. I don&#x27;t know about you but when I first heard that Facebook had acquired Oculus my first thought was something along the lines of &quot;Oh FFS&quot;.<p>In my opinion, if I pay money for a product I don&#x27;t expect to have my privacy violated so I can be further monetised. The point of a Facebook account is I have made a deal that I will allow information about my use of the product to be used as payment for the product. That is not the case for something I have already paid for.')
