LOL.<p>Even with a $80,000 salary, in the US a medical or other emergency (e.g. getting fired in a bad economy), can leave you unemployed, homeless, or living with a big debt. Even worse so for your retirement prospects (or lack thereof).<p>With a few cool million in the bank you don&#x27;t need to worry about any of those things.<p>&gt;<i>And the link you shared couldn&#x27;t get the analysis more wrong just to come up with clickbaity title. They are taking average happiness of state and average wage, and even then the data doesn&#x27;t look like it is plateauing.</i><p>Missed this part, linked to from the article?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;107&#x2F;38&#x2F;16489.abstract" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;107&#x2F;38&#x2F;16489.abstract</a><p>Or the fact that &quot;non plateuing&quot; still shows clear diminishing returns...<p>Why exactly do you think e.g. 10 million will make you any happier than e.g. 5 million (never mind anywhere close to double as happy)?')
