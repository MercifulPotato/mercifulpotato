Why make noon at one hour past the sun at its highest point? So annoying.<p>I have a friend that is also annoyed by this prospect, but I never could understand why. I mean I can see why people have opinions based on morning&#x2F;evening light, but is &quot;high noon should be noon&quot; really that big a deal? I mean even if the center of every timezone had high noon set at noon, you&#x27;d still end up having the edges of the same timezone having their high noon closer to 11:30 and 12:30. The fact is that local times have had their high noon disassociated from 12:00 for quite a while. Other than the principle of the thing, I just don&#x27;t see why having around 1:00 really is such a bother.<p>edit: I really can&#x27;t understand why you&#x27;re being downvoted. Your frustration shouldn&#x27;t be ignored.')
