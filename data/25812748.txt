Item(by='icedistilled', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610904886, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25808469, text='It&#x27;s not the LD50 for Cobalt Blue, but the LD50 for soluble Cobalt salts is between 150 and 500 mg&#x2F;kg and Cobalt toxicity seems to be a thing. But the LD50(rat) for cobalt blue is &gt; 10000 mg&#x2F;kg according to the MSDS I&#x27;m looking at. That doesn&#x27;t sound toxic.<p>Wiki says this about cobalt: &quot;it causes respiratory problems when inhaled. It also causes skin problems when touched; after nickel and chromium, cobalt is a major cause of contact dermatitis&quot;<p>So for people looking for an example of something that&#x27;s somewhat toxic, but much less toxic as a paint. Here you go, Cobalt Blue. The color this new can be substituted for. yeah the toxicities are different, but it&#x27;s the same idea.')
