You can make games with a different focus though.<p>SC2 is a short (~10-20 minutes) 1 on 1 APMs contest. (APM=actions per minutes). APMs are more than fast clicking. No pro player managed to do everything they know they should do. It is about prioritization. Even I, a modest gold-league player can watch pro replays and go &quot;oh, they should have moved the drones there, they could have saved these 3 marines&quot;. Knowing your skills there, execute well, recover from errors, exploit your enemies&#x27; mistakes, cause them.<p>This is the kind of game SC2 is, and it is perfect in that regard. It fits a niche perfectly, has the good amount of complexity.<p>RTS can be about other things than APMs, but also, I believe they can be about something else than being an eSport. It is not necessary to be an eSport to be a good game.')
