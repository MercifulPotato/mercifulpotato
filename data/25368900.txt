Basically if your in sell-side trading, corporate flows are your bread and butter. The way it works is some corporate customer has some hedging need and the sales desk slaps on a big fat margin that contributes to the majority of money being made. The trader sees this and he&#x27;s a greedy sob too so what he does is he quotes the sales desk an internal price that is further away from the true market bid-ask. This usually involves some degree of bickering depending on how well the two desks get along, and whatever the trader is able to get away with contributes to his &quot;trading&quot; pnl. And yes it is as pathetic as it sounds and involves a fair bit of weaseling around. Less the case if your client is a financial institution though, in which case it more depends on how many flows and trades you get and hope it matches off')
