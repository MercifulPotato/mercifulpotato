The bigger issue is that social cooling is not limited to social media. The larger issue, for me, appears to be that it affects person to person interactions and makes it harder and harder to have an &#x27;adult&#x27; conversation with people without adding niceties ( would you kindly consider the possibility of helping me if you are not too busy vs get over here ) or current set of society mandates ( for example, finding &#x27;preferred&#x27; pronouns ).<p>“you feel you are being watched, you change your behavior.”<p>Social cooling is bad. It makes things hidden, where they simmer and build up. It is not good for the individual and it tends to not to be good for society in general, because it is channeled and not always in healthy ways.<p>In a sense, I agree with you. It is an adaptation, but I am not convinced it is a good one.')
