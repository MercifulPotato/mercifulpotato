I actually spend little time working on the stack. Last time I touched the infrastructure components was probably a few weeks ago.<p>Panelbear was originally built and launched in a weekend ($5&#x2F;mo DO instance with SQLite), and I&#x27;ve been working on it for the past 3 months. I have been releasing a new feature every week. That is, in addition to my full-time job, so most of the time we&#x27;re talking about 2 hours per day tops.<p>I&#x27;d also like to clarify that I am not suggesting this stack should be used by other solo founder SaaS. I actually advice against it in my post :)<p>I just wanted to share my stack, as it has worked really well in my case, and I thought it&#x27;d be interesting material for discussion.')
