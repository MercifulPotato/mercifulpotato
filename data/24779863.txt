Zoom reencodes the video on the fly in different formats and forward to the 10 participants separately.<p>Participants have different devices and network connectivity, that&#x27;s how the dirty real world is, so zoom has to do that. It&#x27;s development work and it&#x27;s compute intensive but it&#x27;s a hard requirement to have &quot;good&quot; videoconferencing.<p>Imagine the same thing with E2E. Client sends a video steam to zoom. Zoom can&#x27;t do shit with it because it&#x27;s encrypted, it can&#x27;t be decoded it can&#x27;t be reencoded.')
