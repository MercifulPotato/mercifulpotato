You have no idea what state they are in because they aren’t. You send me one. You cannot influence if I’ll get it in the 1 or the 0 state. All you can do is later measure your photon and see what state it’s in and that will tell you what state my photon is in. It won’t let you transmit information IIUC and it won’t let you travel faster than light. It might help with time sync (when I measure my photon yours collapses instantly so we can synchronize an event), or synchronize some arbitrary key material: you send me a bunch of photons and then measure yours. I now know exactly what bits you have because they are the opposite of mine and we can use that for cryptography. I know that nobody snooped on this because any measurement would have collapsed the photons.')
