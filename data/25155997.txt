Item(by='gruez', descendants=None, kids=[25156199], score=None, time=1605831284, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25155631, text='&gt;It&#x27;s much, much safer, because the app can&#x27;t see or hijack the login process - it doesn&#x27;t get access to the login form and can&#x27;t phish you with it.<p>Not really. On non-sandboxed platforms (eg. windows or mac) it does nothing because the program already has full access to the operating system. It could very keylog the password as it&#x27;s being entered into the &quot;real&quot; browser. Regardless of whether it&#x27;s sandboxed, it could also launch a phoney &quot;real&quot; browser (ie. custom build of firefox&#x2F;chrome that has keylogging logic built into the browser itself), and keylog using that. I&#x27;m not sure how that can be detected.')
