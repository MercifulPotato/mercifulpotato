In June of that year, the publishers went on a suing spree and not only went after book sellers selling used books online, but Amazon, and school book stores on campus.<p>Amazon now has locked categories for specific books.  To sell them at all, you need to have proof of purchase, directly from the publisher.  Nobody will have this, so they are effectively banned, unless you are the publisher.  Its also a way for the publishers to profit from the second-hand market (aside from requiring access codes that cost more than the book itself).<p>The same thing happened with DVD&#x2F;movies.  You now can&#x27;t sell them at all on Amazon without proof of purchase from a licensed distributor.')
