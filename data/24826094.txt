It was strange and unnatural to me.<p>For me a team is a group of about 5 people working together to achieve a clear goal, going to lunch together almost every day, having coffee together, while talking about solving deep technical issues. It doesn&#x27;t scale to more than  8 people, because I&#x27;m just not able to understand deeply what more than 8 people are doing, and follow their code base.<p>It was the same time when all hands meetings got political and uninteresting, skipping all the technical details on announcements that made them interesting (and that made cross-team collaboration possible), and I just stopped going to these meetings, because they started to be just a waste of my time.')
