In the previous system, if you wanted to fly halfway around the world to visit family or what-have-you, you might use half of those vacation days in one go.  Now, if you&#x27;re only expected to be in the office 1 day per week (&quot;Meeting Monday&quot;), you could take that same trip and use just 2 days of vacation, assuming you&#x27;re working, or at least a making a passable semblance of working during the rest of that trip.  Heck, you could take almost half of the Meeting Mondays for a year if you work the rest of the time.<p>In some sense, that&#x27;s no problem.  One of the big points of remote work is that it doesn&#x27;t matter where you are, as long as you get your work done.  But the reality is, those occasional in-person days seem to be very important for really connecting with teammates.  If Nomad Ned seems to always be missing Meeting Monday but I can rely on Local Larry to be there, I may be much happier and feel more connected with Larry, even if they both take the same number of vacation days per year.<p>Between geopay, tax rules, wanting employees to be close enough to an office for in-person meetings or emergencies, etc, I think employers are going to become much more invasive in terms of tracking the locations of their employees going forward.')
