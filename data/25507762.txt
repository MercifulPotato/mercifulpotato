All of the quality manufacturers were driven out the market ages ago and all that&#x27;s left now is the absolute cheapest garbage sold to people who just need to check a box.<p>You would think there would be a secondary market for all of the fancy phone cameras now being made, but sticking one in a box with a USB connector hanging out the bottom (or Bluetooth) seems like too much of an ask when you can just put an absolute garbage 720p sensor in the same box and save a few bucks.')
