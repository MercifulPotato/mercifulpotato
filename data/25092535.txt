Dynamic typing is basically always the wrong decision in my experience. You give up a huge amount of basic error checking (e.g. 15% of JavaScript bugs are prevented by Typescript) just to avoid a little bit of typing. And it&#x27;s not even like it saves you any time since with dynamic typing you spend so long trying to figure out what types functions expect and looking up APIs in documentation since code completion doesn&#x27;t work.')
