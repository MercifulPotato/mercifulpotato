It ends up being an entire career that is only concerned with how to compose management policies, working within environmental policies and employment policies to create environments that thrive, are sustainable as well as include self-governing mechanisms.<p>I suggest you locate someone with this type of graduate education and ask them where to start if one is serious about the issues raised by this article. I can guarantee you, unless the people behind this are pure stupid manipulators, they have governance specialists already working on their behalf, and they are using $400 words to describe what they are doing.<p>Pretty much every corporation over 10,000 people have someone either on their staff or on the corporate board whose sole role is governance. This important area is already populated with high level experts with their own Scientology-technical-speak one must know to be taken seriously.<p>We&#x27;re so smart, we kill ourselves.')
