You can own something but if someone else possesses it for a long enough time, it is theirs.<p>They also talked about &quot;De Jure&quot;(In theory) and  &quot;De facto&quot;(in practice). You could subvert the law if you do not apply it or apply it selectively.<p>Communist are experts on that. For example, Lenin called elections. When he lost them, he just made a coup d&#x27;etat and took power(De facto), then he will name everything as &quot;democratic&quot;(De jure), the government of the people and so on. A similar strategy as Napoleon, that declared himself against monarchy and declared himself Emperor (De facto) later(while being republican in theory).<p>Another example is Venezuela. It is a democracy &quot;De jure&quot;, but a dictatorship &quot;de facto&quot;.<p>The entities that occupy Mars (or Venus) and take possession of it will own it de facto. Who cares about what lawyers say in another planet?')
