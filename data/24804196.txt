Sometimes when he meets another Indian at his company, they ask him questions that seem innocent enough on the surface, like, &quot;Where is your family from?&quot; Or, &quot;Are you vegetarian?&quot; Sometimes they might even suggest going for a swim. But, Sam says, these questions can feel like a dangerous trap. Coming from a fellow Indian, they&#x27;re often clever attempts to find out something very specific: his caste.')
