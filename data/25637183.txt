They&#x27;re decrepit, corrupt dinosaurs, just like the Right says. But they got that way by losing the fight in the 20th century. Now they&#x27;re kind of useless vestiges just waiting around to slough off eventually.<p>So the old unions are no model to emulate here. But just noting that and giving up of course leaves the problem of my lack of power in the workplace completely unsolved.<p>&gt; One thing that wont happen: better working conditions.<p>I still want better working conditions though, for me and for everybody. What do you suggest?')
