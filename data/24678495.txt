Further, even in the United States, the country with the fewest restrictions of free speech, there are still several kinds of speech prohibited by law. I&#x27;m not aware of any theory, liberal or not, which argues for purely unrestricted speech. There are always caveats in every theory proposed, whether it relates to incitement of violence, child pornography, threatening letters, hate speech, or pornography.')
