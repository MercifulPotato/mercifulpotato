I can&#x27;t speak for an industrial use case, but for a hobbyist writing open source software and personal projects, programming in Haskell has been an absolute joy and has reinvigorated my love for programming.<p>Tools like IHP (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ihp.digitallyinduced.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ihp.digitallyinduced.com&#x2F;</a>) are a great example of not only the beauty of the language, but when combined with Nix and the IHP IDE, a better development experience than I ever had with Rails or any other language.<p>If you are pragmatically minded, you can get stuff done in Haskell. In my experience there&#x27;s a lack of online resources for this kind of work in Haskell, but that&#x27;s what I and others especially in the IHP world are working on. If you just want to experiment, Haskell is great for that too.')
