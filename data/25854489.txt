Many corporates load Chrome as the default browser as part of their setup process for new machines. For many naive people Chrome is the default browser. It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve seen a a windows machine provisioned by a corporate with Edge as the default browser. Many corporates also warn people away from Edge, Safari, Firefox and other &quot;undesirable&quot; browsers.
