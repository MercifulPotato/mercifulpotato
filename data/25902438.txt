It&#x27;s not that Blazor is bad or that I have something against, but you don&#x27;t want to limit yourself when it comes to finding a Blazor developer.  You will hardly find a frontend developer who is focusing on Blazor. \nToday are React, Angular, Vue or similar frameworks the best way to go, especially for a startup where you need flexibility. Keep using .NET for a backend, provide a nice API and implement frontend using already mentioned frameworks.')
