It&#x27;s maybe a little inconvenient to have to scan it with a phone at visible range, but you don&#x27;t have to remember a bunch of funny codes, and if you get one wrong, it breaks entirely with no indication of where the mistake is.<p>Meanwhile, nobody knows that if they see 0xABCDEF, that means they should go to the URL <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;0x.co&#x2F;ABCDEF" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;0x.co&#x2F;ABCDEF</a> with the closest web browser.<p>It might be handier if it could generate a printable webpage or PDF or something that had the QR code for the URL and also the full URL with the short code. Now you have a solution for easily putting messages in QR codes that also has a fallback for users who don&#x27;t have a phone, don&#x27;t have a phone app, don&#x27;t want to mess with their phone that minute, etc.')
