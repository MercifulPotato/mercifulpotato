The support crew is in a pair of prototype Rivian pickup trucks.<p>The Rivians have a &quot;tow to recharge&quot; mode that they&#x27;ve used several times already in the first half dozen episodes.<p>The show is great and I&#x27;m as fascinated by their dedication to do the trip on electric bikes (the first parts of the trip were in freezing and sub-freezing temps in areas with long distances between grid electricity availability) as I am by the scenery and their narration.<p>Anyway, sorry for the tangent, but the title reminded me of the series. I hope it escapes AppleTV+ so that non-Apple folks can watch it at some point.')
