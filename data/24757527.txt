You&#x27;d probably have to start with declaring martial law then plan to operate that way for the next 5-10 years as law enforcement is reshaped from the ground up.<p>The likelihood that anyone in our current administration or on deck would attempt that is vanishingly small, and the likelihood that they would actually pull it off even less so.  It&#x27;s likely going to take decades to fully repair this, and I think we need to consider incremental improvements vs some kind of big bang change.<p>&gt; &quot;Lack of training&quot; is, frankly, a really piss-poor excuse when you&#x27;re seeing videos like George Floyd.  How much training do you need to know not to kneel on someone&#x27;s neck for almost 9 minutes?<p>It&#x27;s not piss-poor, it&#x27;s just not a complete explanation.  There isn&#x27;t one.  More training isn&#x27;t going to help if you don&#x27;t have sound policies at their foundation.  Policies need to be adjusted for sure, practices need to be expanded to build a relationship with the community, and then training needs to be increased to navigate the broad set of circumstances that police officers may counter.  All of this might not have prevented Chauvin from doing what he did, but it seems likely that if the other officers at the scene were better equipped across those dimensions we wouldn&#x27;t have had the same result.')
