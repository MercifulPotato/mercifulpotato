Is it because you&#x27;re actively looking to capture people who are forgetful, or some other reason.<p>Having been in sales and marketing, I can tell you that the first reason is usually why companies want the credit card information for.  If the product was so fantastic that the trial will sell it, there&#x27;s no reason to capture payment information during a free trial.  For people who forget to sign up, when it gets automatically cancelled at the end of the trial, they&#x27;ll beg to give you money.  Requiring it up front is about producing a false conversion rate.<p>I refuse to sign up for free things that require a payment method registered.  It&#x27;s not free if you say, let me hold your wallet while you try it out.')
