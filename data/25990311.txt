I ended up admitting that the thing I was looking for didn&#x27;t exist, so I made it (website in this case so very small risk&#x2F;outlay).  It made a boat load of income from ad revenue back when CPMs were better (still exists these days but revenue is way way down on what it was - perhaps less than &lt;5% - and my regular work salary these days  totally eclipses even what it was at its peak anyway).<p>There must be so many of these sorts of stories on HN - someone scratching their own itch, only to find out that others have the same.')
