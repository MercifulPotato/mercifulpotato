Humanity should always seek to fulfill its needs from terrestrial sources. We shouldn&#x27;t mistake space exploration for infrastructure building.<p>At the same time - this doesn&#x27;t mean we shouldn&#x27;t explore space! Just that we should understand that exploration as low-to-no-return investigations, not investments in the foreseeable future. I also don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve reached the limit for that kind of research. Our society could safely tolerate much higher levels of investment in space exploration (as long as it remains a very small proportion of all investments). We have many other &quot;pure research&quot; fields which are key to long-term health, but do not meaningfully contribute to our current survival.<p>Like Roko&#x27;s Basilisk, this is a good reminder of the dangers of using resources that we have today to try to reach a future we may never see. The human ability to plan for an imagined future is key to our humanity, but so is our ability to deceive ourselves.')
