I&#x27;ve never been more terrified of a communications gadget. I shudder thinking of how many unaware users are actively giving Facebook their bio data, exact location &amp; whatever info they give to them when they invite FB into their lives like this. Whew!<p>On policy agreements vis-a-vis user privacy, it is a bit of a conundrum that I don&#x27;t see the normal consumer winning. WhatsApp&#x2F;Facebook are doing nothing illegal by giving users these new terms. The major problem with such T&amp;C is that the normal user cannot fully understand the contents of them. I will confess to being one of them. Most of them are written effectively to be nothing but legalese scapegoats. With jargons the average Joe cannot comprehend. This I see is the biggest obstacle to every day privacy &amp; user data protection.<p>Bonus fact: it&#x27;s not just Facebook knowingly doing this for profit. Many everyday services which we click &amp; agree yes to are doing so. Someone above just pointed out that sometimes they click yes because they know big tech already have their data or will at some point obtain it, why delay the obvious outcome?<p>Though this shouldn&#x27;t mean you cannot feed them fake data at any given point&#x2F;excuse. Privacy battle is not for those who give up easy.')
