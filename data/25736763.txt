But those bikes won&#x27;t be served by the bike shop that runs the workshop at a loss for his loyal bike buyers either.<p>That part of the market is usually served, quite well actually for both sides, by a shop that is one third preowned bikes, one third budget parts and one third highschool job repairs (sometimes they also rent out the preowned). Lifesavers for my theft-immune three speed (they&#x27;ll happily take on daring salvage operations nobidy else would even attempt), but I surely no place were I&#x27;d leave one of my Campag steeds even for just a tire inflation.')
