But for queries which had big result sets, this order wasn&#x27;t very useful and so search engines began letting users enter more &quot;natural language&quot; queries (duck pond) and sorting documents based on the number of terms that overlap with the query. They came up with a bunch of relevance formulas - tfidf, BM25 - that tried to model the query overlap. But it turns out this is tricky because user intent is a really tricky problem and so modern day search engines just declare that relevance is whatever users click on. Specifically they just model the probability that you&#x27;re going to click on a link (or something) using a DNN that uses things like the individual term overlap, the number of users that have clicked on this link, the probability it&#x27;s spam, the PageRank etc. Some search engines like Google also include personalized features like the number of times <i>you</i> have clicked on this particular domain - because for instance as a programmer your query of (Java) might have different intent than your grandmother&#x27;s. This score then gets used to sort the results into a ranked list. This is why search engines (DDG included) collect all this data - because it makes the relevance problem tractable at web scale.<p>Maybe just my perspective but I just really don&#x27;t understand why OP would want to build an index - it&#x27;s hard boring expensive and doesn&#x27;t violate data privacy - and I don&#x27;t think people grasp that - at least to some extent - data privacy and relevance are in direct conflict?')
