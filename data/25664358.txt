Here&#x27;s what Twitter <i>actually</i> said:<p>&quot;...the account of @realDonaldTrump will be locked for 12 hours following the removal of these Tweets. If the Tweets are not removed, the account will remain locked.&quot;<p>Which means Trump deleted them, as I had described.<p>Either way, I deleted my longer explanation of why the messages appeared they way they did under his Twitter account because it&#x27;s not worth venturing into negative karma over this. I explained why the deletions looked like they did, and Twitter&#x27;s explanation suggests that was correct.')
