Watching them hunt is fascinating, they&#x27;ll crawl all over anything you put in the terrarium, and they can go without food for weeks at a time.  Very low maintenance.  And they&#x27;re usually comfortable with climbing into your palm.  I don&#x27;t do it, because I worry about injuring or stressing them, but my wife loves it.  We&#x27;ve never been bitten by a jumping spider.<p>If you don&#x27;t like the idea of catching and caging spiders, keep one by a window.  The small amount of webbing they leave isn&#x27;t prominent, unless they have trouble climbing (like in glass terrariums).')
