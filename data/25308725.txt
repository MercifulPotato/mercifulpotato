The ONLY reason I can think of why you would not recognize &quot;-flag&quot; as equal to &quot;--flag&quot; is because you want to recognize it as &quot;-f -l -a -g&quot;, which makes sense for programs like ls, but for 99% of newer programs, donâ€™t do it. Just make &quot;-flag&quot; and &quot;--flag&quot; equivalent.')
