You need dedicated backers [cause oriented willing to sacrifice] high up in the armed forces as well as the intelligentsia.<p>Rag tag groups do not execute coups.  That’s a willful exaggeration and further evidence of how narratives tilt people’s thinking.<p>This is the media and social media calling it that -they cannot help it.  Are the armed forces classifying as a coup?  It’s a ridiculous accusation.  More of a coup attempt is the call for impeachment with two weeks left after the previous impeachment failed.  It’s honestly sad.')
