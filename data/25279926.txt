And this results in creating more sweatshops.<p>BUT, as is documented in Pinker&#x27;s _Enlightenment Now_ and elsewhere, this is officially a Good Thing.<p>The reason why people are willing to work in those sweatshops is that it beats spending your day bent over in a rice paddy and praying that you&#x27;ll grow enough not to starve.  And once there is a sufficient supply of people with the skills to work in a factory, a better class of sweatshops move in, and pay higher wages.  This eventually forces the bad sweatshops to find a new place where people are still desperate to move in to.<p>The result is that the Industrial Revolution is not done.  Its leading edge is textile sweatshops.  They move in, and improve life.  And when they do, it is a signal that life is about to get better for everyone.  And when it gets good enough, they move out.<p>To give a sense of scale, in recent decades, we&#x27;ve averaged that 250,000 people PER DAY come out of extreme poverty.  Historically extreme poverty was the norm for over 90% of the human race.  And today we are looking at ending it entirely within our lives.  Then we&#x27;ll have to face a change in dynamic.  Once there is no place where a sweatshop is an improvement over existing life, the textile industry will have to reform.  But for now, they are the first rung on the ladder to prosperity.  And a system that makes it more efficient to offer that rung to those who are still desperate is helping create a future with prosperity for all.')
