Fuck yea it is, but what are you going to do? Stay there and complain? Or are you gonna get busy running.<p>Keep in mind this study was talking about mental disorders.  Many of those mental disorders will interfere will inhibit a person&#x27;s ability to &quot;get busy running.&quot;<p>It is also worth considering that this paper is not about a race with a meaningful measure of success, regardless of how you define success.  There are measured outcomes, whether a person ends up with a mental disorder or not, based upon preconditions.  It is not even clear whether training more and running faster will even help a person reach the finish line (which is presumably good mental health throughout life).')
