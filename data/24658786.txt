I got relatively lucky that the inflammation didn&#x27;t seem to cause any muscle damage. My heart looked perfect on an MRI, despite only beating at 21 BPM at the time. Apparently inflammation doesn&#x27;t really show up on an MRI unless it&#x27;s horrendously bad or it&#x27;s caused fibrous scarring. The scan that really shows inflammation well is PET, and you don&#x27;t really want to do a PET scan without good reason since it requires getting injected with a radioactive substance.<p>I&#x27;ve likely had inflammation in my lungs for years based on a previously unexplained chronic cough, and since getting treated for the inflammatory condition, within weeks my cough was gone and my pulmonary function is quantifiably normal.<p>So, it seems to me like systemic organ inflammation isn&#x27;t too big a deal unless it happens to cause nerve damage, or gets bad enough to cause fibrous scarring. Unfortunately, if you can see it on an MRI, then you&#x27;re probably already screwed. You can get a good view of any inflammation via PET, but you&#x27;re going to glow for a while after.<p>Perhaps viral inflammation is a lot more destructive than autoimmune inflammation alone? It sounds like contemporary COVID treatment has become more effective with the addition of anti-inflammatory medications, though, which is great news.')
