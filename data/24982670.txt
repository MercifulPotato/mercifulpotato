It looks like you have to watch some videos that explain what it is and what it&#x27;s for and I don&#x27;t have time. If they can&#x27;t describe it in a concise paragraph then I&#x27;m not sure why I would care. Why is this ending up on the front page of HN 2 days in a row - apparently it&#x27;s only because they&#x27;re dropping OCaml. Ok, fine you&#x27;re dropping OCaml and moving to F# for your... whatever it is.')
