It&#x27;s based on a pattern of the current administration and the media that supports it propping up nonsense and blowing stories that are critical of their opposition out of proportion specifically in order to rile people up and influence elections. Pizzagate, Hillary&#x27;s emails, Q-Anon, these things all take a toll on people who actually care about what is true and real.<p>Is it really surprising that after all the overblown conspiracy nonsense we&#x27;ve been battered with from the White House and Trump that people have grown suspicious and weary of new stories that smell even remotely similar? It&#x27;s gotten to the point where if Trump supports a story I assume it&#x27;s probably untrue by default just because of the sheer volume of lies and nonsense he retweets on a daily basis. I don&#x27;t know anything about the Hunter Biden story. Maybe it&#x27;s loaded with true, damning information against Biden. If so, it&#x27;s too bad, because we are neck deep in a boy-who-cried-wolf situation here and I&#x27;m not going to learn about it until it&#x27;s been verified and reported by media outlets that I can actually trust.')
