Item(by='jmfldn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607282775, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25323043, text='&gt; LinkedIn is the only social network where it&#x27;s not acceptable to question these weird posts. Only politically correct, somewhat career-related content is allowed, and only positive responses are appropriate. Everyone is inspired and blessed and productive. It&#x27;s a big circlejerk.<p>This! You&#x27;ve articulated perfectly my feelings. It&#x27;s useful for jobs but my god is it a TERRIBLE social network in terms of any kind of real engagement.  I never ever post, or engage with posts, as there are so many layers of fakery, agendas, motivational bs etc buried in everything I see. I find the self-improvement, positive psychology, self-marketing thing you see all over it just so cringe-worthy. I can&#x27;t bear it<p>I find the overall experience of LinkedIn terrible too. So over complicated as a site, such a deluge of information and noise . I feel like you could delete 90% of it and have a better product.<p>Linked in a useful dumpster fire of a website. Its kind of an odd case in that way.')
