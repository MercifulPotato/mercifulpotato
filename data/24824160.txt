Item(by='cyberdrunk', descendants=None, kids=[24824517], score=None, time=1603094161, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24775979, text='Deresiewicz&#x27;s story is inconsistent.<p>First, he writes that early artists (Da Vinci, Bach etc.) basically saw themselves as artisans who worked jobs for their patrons, who essentially sheltered them from the cold realities of the market.<p>Later, he laments that now artists are crushed by the market and can&#x27;t have any stability that Bach et. al. enjoyed. He&#x27;s missing a ton of contemporary working artists, who still have their patrons - visual artists working in game dev, musicians composing music for movies, commercials, video games etc. These people have steady income, just like Bach did. Of course, they&#x27;re not really working on what they&#x27;d like to be working on, but neither really did Da Vinci (he was known to procrastinate a ton when asked to produce another boring portrait of somebody&#x27;s daugther - a portrait which comically now could fetch tens of millions of dollars).')
