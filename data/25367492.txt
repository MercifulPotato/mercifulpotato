Government pressured censorship at least.<p>One can make a reasonable argument that YouTube is making the decision voluntarily.  And the letter is just giving them some cover for what they wanted to do, based on their own biases, anyway.<p>But private censorship is still censorship.  And when a platform is so large that it has effectively become &quot;the public square&quot;, well I do not go so far as to say that they cannot legally engage in censorship, but I do believe they are morally obliged not to, and should be publically called out when they do.<p>I hope people will begin moving to other platforms in droves so that some real competition emerges.')
