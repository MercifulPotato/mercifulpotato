Securing digital things is really hard. For something as important as elections we absolutely need a paper trail.  Physical things that both parties can verify exist and are simple to understand.<p>In an ideal world, we’d have a hybrid system. Everyone gets a paper with an ID cryptographically hashed with their voter id. They vote electronically and mail&#x2F;in person hand their paper with a cast ID that’s also cryptographically signed with their voter id and vote cast. Like how two factor TOTP works, the verification of cast ID can be done totally offline.<p>That way you have a two factor audit system. A fast digital tally backed with a verifiable paper trail for every vote.<p>If paper tally is not within 1% of digital tally, then you have a discrepancy and people ought to vote again.<p>Sure it would take a while to verify paper trail but a couple of days of two factor counting is totally worth it for an important thing as election that decides the fate of a country.')
