I&#x27;ve completely stopped using it for private projects after receiving a $100 bill for something I accidentally provisioned through the command line.<p>Not only is it very easy to spend real money by accident, the web interface makes it incredibly hard to work out what you&#x27;re spending money on (it took me a long time to even understand what I was paying for, and then longer still to turn it all off).<p>Even if you know what you&#x27;re getting in to, the pricing is very misleading. A few cents an hour adds up if its running 24&#x2F;7, and its never obvious whether you&#x27;re in the free tier or not.<p>If you don&#x27;t have deep pockets, be <i>very careful</i> with AWS.')
