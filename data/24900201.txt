I thought the claim of the hack comes from the NY Post article itself where they said the shop owner made a copy of the hard drive.<p>The NY Post article claims the laptop was abandoned at the repair shop (never picked up) and that according to the law in that state became the legal property of the shop owner.<p>&gt;all of the information The Times obtained was provided by sources with legal access to it<p>Notice that The Times does not say the source was legally authorized to release it.  I didn&#x27;t say it was criminally accessed, but that it was criminally released.  For example, if an IRS employee or an employee at Trump&#x27;s accountant released it without permission, those would be crimes.<p>&gt;So at least from the perspective of being a small time employee of Twitter that has to work on moderation<p>I can accept that for the low level employee at the time of moderation.  But once it got so high up that @Jack commented on it, and now over a week later the NY Post&#x27;s account is still banned, it doesn&#x27;t float.')
