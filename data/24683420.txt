Because Pluto doesn&#x27;t meet the definition of &#x27;Planet&#x27;, it is now called a &quot;Dwarf Planet&quot;.<p>Ultimately, it comes down to the scientific issue of Pluto, Charon, and Eris. Its hard to make Pluto a planet without calling Eris a planet. Pluto also interacts with Neptune and Charon in unfortunate ways unlike other &quot;proper planets&quot;, like Earth, Mars, or Mercury.')
