While we do get snow every winter, it tends to be mixed with icy rain, not the powdery stuff you get in more northern climates.  What tends to happen is a bit of snow will fall overnight, then go into a melt&#x2F;flash-freeze cycle as the temperature hovers around freezing.<p>2. Because it only snow (with any major accumulation) once or twice a season, there isn&#x27;t a huge incentive to invest in more snow removal equipment.  The state DOT handles major roads, but neighborhoods are largely left to clear their own snow.  My last neighborhood had a contract with a construction company from out of the region for major snow - they&#x27;d drive up their trucks (with plows attached) and set up camp at the edge of the area for a few days, then go home.<p>3. DC is highly transient.  Lots of drivers who simply don&#x27;t have much experience driving in snow.<p>4. Public transit is terrible.  So, everybody tries to go to work, and if their only car is a Corvette, so be it.  And of course, they spin it into a ditch as soon as they try to get on the highway.')
