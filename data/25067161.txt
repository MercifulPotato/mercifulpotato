It&#x27;s a complicated low level feature. To make it work, you&#x27;d need to figure out what to push, and the ideal way to prioritise and multiplex those streams to optimise for first render. CDNs are in the business of knowing this stuff better than anyone else, yet they still couldn&#x27;t make it work.<p>Remember, most sites using CDNs still go to the root server for HTML and other no-cache content. It&#x27;s only the more optimised sites that figure out how to deliver those resources straight from the CDN without consulting the end server.')
