You define different geometry solids by specifying function which returns for any point in space how far that point is from the surface of the solid. [1]<p>If they are defined this way, it is easy to smoothly interpolate between two or more solids. When rendering to screen, similar techniques have to be used to convert to screen geometry in realtime.<p>The latest technical marvel that uses this tech is Media Molecules Dreams. With SDFs they made rich modelling tools (constructive solid geometry) that produce geometry for physics and painting-style renderer, all running on PS4. The Learning From Failure talk [2] was quite inspiring on lengths they went to achieve their artistic goals.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iquilezles.org&#x2F;www&#x2F;articles&#x2F;distfunctions&#x2F;distfunctions.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iquilezles.org&#x2F;www&#x2F;articles&#x2F;distfunctions&#x2F;distfu...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=u9KNtnCZDMI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=u9KNtnCZDMI</a>')
