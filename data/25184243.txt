Item(by='mulmen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606115189, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25183676, text='2.1 children isn&#x27;t a thing, so your definition of &quot;large family&quot; is just &quot;enough to maintain the current population&quot;.  I interpreted &quot;large family&quot; as four or more children.<p>Further, I&#x27;m not sure why replacement rate is even desirable.  I can see some benefits but there&#x27;s also downsides.  The ideal tax policy with regard to family size is not obvious to me.')
