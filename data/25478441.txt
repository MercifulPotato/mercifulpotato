It&#x27;s important to remember that Facebook can precisely measure the impact of news articles like this. And even without messing with the newsfeed algorithms, they have way more influence over consumer perception of Facebook than a few news articles do. For example, they could introduce some new &quot;privacy&quot; feature and talk it up in in-app notifications. Or they have you review your privacy settings, something most people will glance at and move on, thinking they are in control. And they can do things like this whenever consumer confidence flags.<p>If Facebook loses a few more users of the sort that are tech-savvy and informed enough that this pushes them over the edge, that&#x27;s fine. In fact, it might be even better, as the remaining population is more easily wrangled.')
