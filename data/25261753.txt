Item(by='tw25261371', descendants=None, kids=[25262033, 25262263], score=None, time=1606791226, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25261371, text='Reddit, along with Wikipedia, seems to have already slowly been claimed by groups pushing you to buy, only they&#x27;re seeking something besides (direct) transfer of stuff for cash: buy-in and validation of which political positions are even valid to consider holding, let alone actually adopting.  I&#x27;m on the left myself (although I think in terms of being liberal first over being &quot;a part of the left&quot;), and as Jon Stewart said during simpler times, &quot;<i>Reality</i> has a liberal bias!&quot;, so I don&#x27;t see it as much a direct threat to my existence as say a center-right conservative would, but oh geez.  It&#x27;s been getting really intense over the last year or two.  Over the summer I was listening to a podcast where someone was discussing the remarks of a non-partisan entity (can&#x27;t remember who, but the podcast itself was The Fifth Column), and the hosts referred to the undertones of those remarks as having an &quot;implied &#x27;we&#x27;&quot;.<p>Because the fervor doesn&#x27;t match what I see in real life, I really do wonder how much of what&#x27;s happening reflects actual public sentiment, and how much of it is the result of more subtle, nefarious things at play.<p>I recently found a Wikipedia article where some media organization had published an interview with a public entertainer, only rather than linking to this interview, the Wikipedia article in an attempt to cite a reference for the entertainer&#x27;s quote linked instead to a Vox article that was, in consideration of prosaic matters alone, much worse than the original source.  Of course it was <i>really</i> heavy-handed, too, and overstuffed with &quot;implied &#x27;we&#x27;&quot;.  How did that happen, that piece getting linked in place of the original?  Was it the result of laziness, ignorance, or something more intentional?  I didn&#x27;t dive into it (too much of a quagmire to try to wade in and correct it, either), but I wouldn&#x27;t doubt if there was some monetary cause related to the big business of politics.  It&#x27;s certainly happening in other places.')
