(which is that 4 or 5 of them actually require them, and the rest give religious and&#x2F;or philosophical exemptions)<p>But for the vast majority of workplaces, there&#x27;s not much of an existing precedent to do this, and I suspect the vast majority of employers will not want to rock the boat too much.  I suspect it&#x27;ll be something that will be &quot;required&quot; by policies but not enforced in practice.  The people who want to get vaccines will get them, and those who do not will ignore the policy without repercussions.')
