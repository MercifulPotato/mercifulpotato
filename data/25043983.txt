Surprisingly the reviews are quite ok and you can find a lot of products with 2-3 stars on average and anywhere from 10 to 500 reviews. The problem is they also started offering products through resellers (mostly the actual brands that make the products, but I&#x27;m afraid they will also turn into a marketplace soon enough).')
