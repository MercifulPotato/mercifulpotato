It does so by leveraging the same technology which is used for VR games. Also, you&#x27;ll never hear the same combination of audio twice, as everything is generated randomly.<p>How it works<p>- Choose from a selection of handcrafted audio environments which range from a rainy Jazz bar to a quiet forest lake.\n- Create your very own audio environments by mixing and matching different sounds.\n- Listen to the soundscape and get in the zone\n- Samples will randomly change position in 3D space and play at random time intervals.<p>Soundescape can also be very useful while trying to relax or sleep, I use it myself all the time.<p>Looking forward to your feedback.')
