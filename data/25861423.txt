A thermocouple <i>is</i> a temperature sensor, in that it transforms a temperature <i>difference</i> into a potential difference (voltage).  You might be able to use the built-in ADC to digitize that voltage, but you likely need a sensitive low-noise, low-offset amplifier.  For high temperatures (high temperature differences) and low accuracy requirements, you might use the built-in semiconductor temperature sensor as (not quite so) cold-junction reference.  Does that answer your question?')
