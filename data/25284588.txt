The virus is a separate agent from humans carrying it, like a background weather condition. It isn’t the person unknowingly carrying it who is causing harm. It also seems arbitrary to assign liability to such an intermediary. If anyone is liable it might be the CCP, for initially suppressing reports of the coronavirus when that information could’ve prevented international spread. Would you support everyone with COVID taking China’s government to international court?<p>Also where would your proposed approach to managing externalities end? If you want to start tracing the cost of externalities across the board then you have to also do things like start taxing people below certain IQ levels for the externality of being a burden (net loss of utility) on society.')
