Let&#x27;s create a public lottery for art, education, or lets say business funding. Since it&#x27;s public funded of course it&#x27;s worth more than the nominal fee (just there so proles don&#x27;t fight over it) and we can hand out what... $100M (only 20x the fireworks) for a 100,000 people. That&#x27;s $1000&#x2F;person and only the scaled cost is only $200!  If that&#x27;s good, why not go bigger like $100B since it costs $10M to start a real business and hey, if you can&#x27;t raise $2M for the ticket, what kind of entrepreneur are you?<p>So now we&#x27;re distributing tickets from public funds worth 5x their purchase price only to the wealthy that can afford them? That sounds... fair? I mean proles get to work in the companies that are started so they benefit too (like watching the fireworks from behind the stands). Heck, even the &quot;failed&quot; entrepreneurs who just throw lavish parties and buy expensive cars support the economy! Life is good when you&#x27;re born with privilege.')
