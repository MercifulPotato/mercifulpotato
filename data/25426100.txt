Maybe the ideal pairs are 800km rather than 1000km, but there&#x27;s quite a few of them - I&#x27;ve done London-Glasgow, Paris-Munich, Munich-Budapest, Paris-Rome, Turin-Salerno. Even if it does end up being 10 or 12 hours, it can still be more convenient than a night flight in terms of &quot;can I finish work here at 18:00, have a decent dinner and a good night&#x27;s sleep, and be ready to start work here at 09:00&quot; - that&#x27;s the question that actually matters.<p>&gt; got from one house to my other house in 2 hours with a 1h flight<p>That sounds pretty exceptional. 45 minutes is usually given as the minimum time to go through airport security, since you have to allow enough time to not miss your flight if you do get pulled out for some reason (or be prepared to sometimes miss your flight, I guess). Airports are usually about an hour away from anywhere in the city you&#x27;re going to. So I&#x27;d say 3 hours&#x27; overhead is the norm, and it gets worse if you&#x27;re trying to fly after a day&#x27;s work because the transport system of the place you&#x27;re going to is usually shutting down by the time you arrive.')
