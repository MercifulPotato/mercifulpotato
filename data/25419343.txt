When I&#x27;m cold I just add an extra layer of cloth or do a few squats or push&#x2F;pull ups, heating XXX cubic meters of air is a pure waste of energy if you&#x27;re healthy<p>That being said your flat&#x2F;home insulation plays a huge role. I&#x27;m living in Germany for a few years now, when it&#x27;s 0c outside it&#x27;s still 18c+ indoor even without any heating in my flat. When I was in California if it was 13 outside it would be 14 indoor, you could feel the air going through the doors&#x27;&#x2F;windows&#x27; joints.<p>edit: to all the people saying I can thanks my neighbours, I pay my share of the heating since it&#x27;s averaged. I only have one shared wall so I doubt it changes much')
