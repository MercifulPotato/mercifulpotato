It isn&#x27;t nearly as robust as QtWidgets and doesn&#x27;t scale to large apps like this very well (I&#x27;m not actually aware of any large apps that use QML).<p>If it were me I would wait until Qt 6 is released. The Qt developers are making some changes to QML that sound like they have learned at least some lessons (e.g. adding strong typing, not relying on Javascript).')
