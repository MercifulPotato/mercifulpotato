This allows you to learn to cook without just following a recipe and knowing that if you apply those principles correctly to whatever food you have in your kitchen, you can make something reasonably tasty.<p>Of course, learning to cook also involves many other techniques and combining flavors in more complex ways, but if you&#x27;re starting out and can&#x27;t boil an egg, it&#x27;s a great introduction to the basics of what makes food taste good.')
