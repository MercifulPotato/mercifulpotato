It specifically states 92% were insured for at least part of 2019. It also ignores the quality and effectiveness of the insurance.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.commonwealthfund.org&#x2F;publications&#x2F;issue-briefs&#x2F;2020&#x2F;aug&#x2F;looming-crisis-health-coverage-2020-biennial" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.commonwealthfund.org&#x2F;publications&#x2F;issue-briefs&#x2F;2...</a><p>&gt; In the first half of 2020, 43.4 percent of U.S. adults ages 19 to 64 were inadequately insured.<p>&gt; The adult uninsured rate was 12.5 percent. In addition, 9.5 percent of adults were insured but had a gap in coverage in the past year and 21.3 percent were underinsured.<p>&gt; A quarter of those who were continuously insured and did not meet the threshold for underinsurance also reported problems paying bills.<p>&gt; People who reported problems paying medical bills experienced lingering financial problems including damage to their credit ratings and depleted savings.')
