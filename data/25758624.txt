Item(by='exmadscientist', descendants=None, kids=[25761378], score=None, time=1610516344, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25746957, text='It&#x27;s not clear what&#x27;s going on with the LED in the article&#x27;s schematic, because only one side of it is connected. Depending on how the other side is tied off -- you can tie it to VDD or to ground -- you can get &quot;lit high&quot; or &quot;lit low&quot; behavior out of it. (And, of course, the polarity might be reversed. LEDs are <i>notorious</i> industry-wide for having confusing polarity markings. So never, ever assume a LED is the right way around....) That&#x27;s because this NAND gate is quite good at either sinking or sourcing current: 24 mA either way (at 3.3V). Older designs are not so balanced, or capable of so much current. (The LVC family is often chosen for exactly this reason.)')
