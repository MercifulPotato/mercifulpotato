The only time USB-C has bitten me is when trying to charge a device using a charger meant for a lower tier of hardware. I&#x27;ve never had any issues with USB-PD chargers. For example my MBP charger works on everything. My phone chargers don&#x27;t work at all on my cheap Chinese laptop, but they&#x27;ll trickle charge my MBP (which has honestly been a lifesaver). Even my $20 battery pack will get me a few hours of laptop life')
