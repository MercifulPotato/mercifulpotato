I get the &quot;ad-free public internet&quot; nostalgia, but ads is an inevitable component of our economy. The good old internet was good only because it was something new and unknown. The very first newspapers did not have ads. 100 years after, Benjamin Franklin pulled the trigger and started a column for advertisers to promote their products and services. Ads are valuable. They can make a huge difference for your business. Ads are not going anywhere in the near future.<p>Working for AdTech doesn&#x27;t mean undoing the good. Given that the internet is pretty young, there is nothing to undo. Working for AdTech means improving what&#x27;s already out there.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I hate ads. Who doesn&#x27;t? Everyone in AdTech uses ad blocker, such is life ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯ But, every time I launch a new project, I need some form of advertisement. It can be be Show HN, Product Hunt or Google PPC. But I need ads. You need ads. And if you don&#x27;t need them now, you most likely will in the future.<p>I obviously don&#x27;t know everything about AdTech and I&#x27;m sure there are a ton of shady players, exploiting your software&#x2F;hardware to sneak some ads in (reputable firms do not appreciate such behavior). But from what I do know, the kind of data being shared by apps is so boring that it&#x27;s actually in a user&#x27;s best interest to allow the data to be shared. Otherwise doctors will see ads about vaping and fishers will see ads about the latest JavaScript IDEs. Which is why I asked, what exactly is being shared by WhatsApp? I honestly don&#x27;t give a shit about Facebook knowing my gender, age, the city I&#x27;m from, etc. I&#x27;m 34, male, living in New York. Now what? In contrast, if WhatsApp shares your messages and files with third-party companies, then that&#x27;s for sure a shady shit that affect your security. A whole separate conversation.')
