Item(by='zrm', descendants=None, kids=[25716643], score=None, time=1610297098, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25716302, text='&gt; Somehow people started associating UFOs with flying saucers and aliens.<p>I saw a video (that I can&#x27;t currently find) of Feynman explaining this once.<p>The US government had a classified program that suspended 1940s saucer microphones from a balloon at a height in the atmosphere that would allow them to listen for Soviet atomic tests.<p>The balloon crashes and some reporters are out sniffing around. Someone with loose lips lets slip that it was a <i>flying saucer</i>. You can imagine what the artist&#x27;s rendition based on that description looked like.<p>Then, since the program was classified, the official explanation becomes that it was a weather balloon or something, and a conspiracy theory is born.')
