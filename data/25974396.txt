Wayland compositor sends the key events to the application and its the applications responsibility from there on to do whatever it pleases; in this case it printing them to stderr but that is incidental. Wayland can&#x27;t just magically protect you from having malicious code running within your application.<p>edit: a strained analogy, but this thing is akin to saying that &quot;you can eavesdrop https&quot; and then show ld_preload hooks for intercepting openssl calls.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=article&amp;item=xorg_wayland&amp;num=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=article&amp;item=xorg_way...</a>')
