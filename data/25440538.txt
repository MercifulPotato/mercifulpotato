Some workarounds stay workarounds and never get standardized. Some become so well-accepted and adopted that people then put them into standards. It&#x27;s great to put things into standards, so by all means, do try to improve standards. But that shouldn&#x27;t <i>block</i> you from <i>everything</i>.
