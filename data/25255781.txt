Item(by='pc86', descendants=None, kids=[25256084], score=None, time=1606754907, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25255605, text='I hesitate to use this phrase but isn&#x27;t it important to look at the &quot;ROI&quot; on those audits to determine if it&#x27;s a good thing or not? Whether you&#x27;re poor or not, you shouldn&#x27;t be getting the EITC if you don&#x27;t qualify for it. What does this subset of audits cost the IRS, and how much money is recovered from it? How does that compare to auditing someone who is high income but with a fairly straightforward W2, compared to someone with a lot of Schedule C and 1099 income?<p>To be clear I don&#x27;t think the only component of the &quot;should we audit&quot; formula should be expected ROI; there is also a (positive) chilling effect in general where the chance of a random audit should be just high enough to dissuade folks from fraud in the first place, but the penalties not so severe that someone is bankrupted from an honest mistake.')
