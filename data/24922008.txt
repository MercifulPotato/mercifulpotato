The Wayland ecosystem simply isn&#x27;t there yet though; they&#x27;re hawking a broken solution.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly fine for a FOSS developer to walk away from any given project. When third parties come along and frame things as though the only option is to switch to a broken &quot;solution&quot; it derails the discussion. We (ie the community at large) should be having much broader discussions about both how to keep maintenance going as well as what&#x27;s needed to actually make the replacement viable (so we can maybe switch to it later).')
