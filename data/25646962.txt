As soon as next week, I can join your team as your independent technical co-founder, taking over your design &amp; development processes and freeing you up to focus on the only thing that matters to an early stage startup:<p>Growth.<p>Don&#x27;t just take my word for it. Listen to my clients:<p>“James understands what it means to work with a startup where every dollar counts. Thanks to him, we were able to bring our products to market much faster than we could have ourselves.”<p>- Matt Ivester (CEO, A Rad Corporation)<p>“After three years of other agencies promising a lot but delivering little, getting to test a prototype after just a few weeks was very cool. From the first time we sat down, I really felt James got what I was trying to do.”<p>- Andy Lin (Founder, Self Portrait Project)<p>“After an entire year of working with another firm, our app just did not work—the core feature was broken and the app drained the battery. James was able to research the problem and find a workable solution in a matter of weeks.”<p>- Lachie Given (Founder, Knowhere)<p>Contact me at: james@sane.digital<p>Or schedule a 15-minute chat with me here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;calendly.com&#x2F;sanedigital&#x2F;exploratory-call" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;calendly.com&#x2F;sanedigital&#x2F;exploratory-call</a>')
