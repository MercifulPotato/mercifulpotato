If anything this has shown me just how robust the voting system is currently. Many of the counting locations live streamed the process, there are watchers from all interested parties, and the various people in charge&#x2F;control seem to be from a mix of both sides. Small errors can still occur, but like we saw from 2016, a recount changed the final tally by a couple hundred votes in close states.<p>The real effective fraud, is voter suppression. Shutting down polling places where one side doesn&#x27;t want people to vote, and making absentee voting seem like something that isn&#x27;t done every single election for example.<p>Then there is after election fraud where one side attempts to delegitimize and throw out legally cast votes.')
