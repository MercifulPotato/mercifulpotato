I&#x27;ve noticed this with novice web developers, where they just want to get something working up as fast as possible. This practice of linking to a CDN or external URL for a js library used to be heavily discouraged, called &quot;hotlinking&quot;, but it seems like many javascript libraries now are fine with it (even encouraging it).<p>I see a similar problem with Google Analytics or Google Fonts, where you&#x27;re sacrificing user privacy and agency in exchange for developer convenience. In a slightly more privacy-centric era (perhaps in a few years), I think people will consider this practice unethical, as the web developer is sending their visitors off to fetch and run javascript code from a third party&#x27;s computer. The security, usability, and privacy problems noted by the article are not worth the few minutes saved by the developer.')
