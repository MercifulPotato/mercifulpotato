Item(by='vharuck', descendants=None, kids=[25049110], score=None, time=1605026520, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25046586, text='In a back-of-the-napkin, spherical-cow, way, it&#x27;s not too hard.<p>20% chance it happens in a year means an 80% chance it doesn&#x27;t.  Let&#x27;s assume (this is the spherical cow) each day has the same chance.  We can find it by looking at the chance an adult <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> get a mental illness in a year.  Then, because that&#x27;s the chance they won&#x27;t get it every day, it&#x27;s easier to figure out the daily chance of not getting one.<p><pre><code>    0.8 = x^365\n    x = 0.8^(1&#x2F;365)\n    x = 0.9993888346422956\n    1 - x = 0.0006111653577044462\n</code></pre>\nSo, overall, adults have roughly a 0.061% chance each day of getting a mental illness.<p>Compared to the daily risk for this 90-day period<p><pre><code>    0.8 = x^90\n    x = 0.8^(1&#x2F;90)\n    x = 0.9993888346422956\n    1 - x = 0.0024763016863216247 \n</code></pre>\nSo about 0.248% each day for the COVID patients.  That&#x27;s more than four times as high as for all adults.<p>Remember, this is spherical cow stuff.  Numbers to use in other calculations need a more experienced statistical approach, I&#x27;m sure.  But this at least tells us something&#x27;s different.')
