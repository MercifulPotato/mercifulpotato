I live and work in Silicon Valley. I have Russian heritage of which I am proud, and the ongoing smear campaign is disheartening, even if not entirely unsubstantiated. I am not on payroll of any secret service.<p>And yet you repeat official russian propaganda word for word, including not directly naming Navalny and using the Putin&#x27;s favorite &quot;blogger&#x2F;YouTuber&quot;, &quot;The blogger in question&quot;.<p>Only forgot to call him &quot;that berlin&#x27;s patient&quot; and you are ready to work on russian state television.<p>Also that &quot;smear campaign&quot; was watched over 10 million times in 10 hours in russia, because actual russians that live in russia care when the government tries to murder it&#x27;s critics.')
