For those who&#x27;ve never been, the show is basically filmed in real-time, and the first thing they do during the commercial breaks is Alex re-records any cards that he might have flubbed so they can punch it in later during editing.<p>They film 5 episodes in a day, and maybe he had to re-record 1 or 2 per episode? I remember thinking that was incredible, and I still do. Even some of the things they re-recorded I wasn&#x27;t sure why (possibly he mis-pronounced a foreign word I wasn&#x27;t familiar with).<p>I guess taking 2 of my favorite musicians wasn&#x27;t enough, 2020 had to come for the host of my favorite game show.')
