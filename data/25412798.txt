Even four days is a long time considering how infectious the virus is. That&#x27;s a work week being unknowingly infectious.<p>Considering we&#x27;re in the middle of a huge spike in cases that started two weeks after Thanksgiving, suggesting superspreader events are the primary source of infections is ludicrous. Canada had the same problem after their Thanksgiving holiday.<p>You&#x27;re also seeming to dismiss asymptomatic carriers because individually they are less infectious than symptomatic carriers. This completely ignores the behavioral component of infection. An asymptomatic carrier will have no reason to seek out testing or participate in contact tracing programs. Someone that becomes symptomatic will know to at least inform recent contacts so they can get tested and attempt to isolate themselves to limit the spread.<p>Not all vaccines are going to be compatible with one another. If millions of people take your early-release vaccine and it&#x27;s ineffective they may not be able to get a second one or not get it for a while. This apparently is an issue with the Russian vaccine because of the way it&#x27;s introduced to the immune system.<p>This is why vaccines are tested in multiple phases. It&#x27;s not just to make sure people don&#x27;t have immediate adverse reactions but to find the edge cases and boundary conditions.')
