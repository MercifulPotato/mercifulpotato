Although I was referring to something a bit different â€” the state limiting the rights of people to grow and sell their own food, except for certain limited varieties.<p>You may be &quot;selling ornamental plants&quot; today, but surely, only as long as the government looks the other way. You could be &quot;criminals&quot; tomorrow if the authorities changed their minds.<p>I can think of few more fundamental rights than the ability to grow food to feed yourself and your community.<p>Other governments round the world, and through history, have taken this to logical extremes. I&#x27;m don&#x27;t want to turn this into a slippery-slope argument, but there are some slopes you just shouldn&#x27;t step on.')
