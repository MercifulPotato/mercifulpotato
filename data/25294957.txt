On my team the code writer “arbitrarily” assigns the code review to anyone else on the team with the intent of assigning to someone with domain experience related to the topic or who wants to get more familiar with it. Though one person may write the code, it’s rare that any code was developed solo in a vacuum. So that other person (or people) are obvious candidates to be selected. Most of us lurk on all PRs so anyone can also chime in if something jumps out at them. Obviously most won’t lurk on code details but will lurk&#x2F;chime in on strategy discussion or assumptions. This works best when there is a well written PR description.')
