It&#x27;s a very common problem for people to procrastinate or drag their feet on the parts of their job that they don&#x27;t particularly like. (Just like most students drag their feet doing homework they don&#x27;t like.) But no job (or school program) is ever 100% fun stuff, and being able to delay gratification and get the unpleasant parts done is a super important life skill that not everyone has. For a lot of people, maybe most HN readers, this is basic stuff that they nailed in high school and never had a problem with after that. But I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s the majority experience.')
