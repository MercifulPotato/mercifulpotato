Nobody needs the entire tutorial, but everyone needs parts of it, and it&#x27;s impossible to know what parts in advance. It&#x27;s a fairly fun and easy way to get an exhaustive tour of the framework, and afterwards people are pretty much fully productive.<p>I wish there was an equally good Ruby language tutorial, as my experience is that it&#x27;s a bit harder to master Ruby than it is to master Rails, but mastering the language is far more valuable.')
