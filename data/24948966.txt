Keep in mind that there is very little reason you would actually want to do it that way when either way you&#x27;re dealing with the same impedance mismatch. In other words, you will have to solve the same issues in the display server you&#x27;re running into now with screen recordings and strange window manager behavior. It&#x27;s not something that you&#x27;ll just get for free. If it was, the other Wayland implementations would have it fixed by now. There&#x27;s no magic solutions to this without any brokenness or workaroundsâ€”the crux of the problem is that you have two protocols you&#x27;re trying to match up that are compatible in some ways and incompatible in others.<p>Also I think it&#x27;s a stretch to say the push behind Wayland is  coming from Red Hat. Maybe within GNOME, but there are other implementations with no connection to Red Hat.')
