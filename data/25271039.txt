Particularly the following<p><i>&gt; I don&#x27;t really have a good handle on what changed, or how to get back into my old sleep cycle. I just know it&#x27;s annoying as hell.</i><p>In my mind, the only point in saying that is for others to empathize and share their best ideas so that OP can have &quot;a better handle&quot; on things. I think it&#x27;s only human to respond as I did.<p>I do think we live in an age where people are sensitive over their interpersonal boundaries to a fault. No man is an island, and people will always give unsolicited adviceâ€”the listener can simply just choose to ignore it in which case nobody is really worse off.<p>Advice is almost invariably provided &quot;as is&quot; and with a suggested grain of salt. I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s offensive, almost by definition, as there&#x27;s a distinction between being judgmental of someone and genuinely trying to help.<p>And for what it&#x27;s worth, I don&#x27;t even get offended if people judge me and don&#x27;t think others should either. It&#x27;s part of what defines life in a society and judging &#x2F; peer pressure has a net positive effect lest we remain barbarians.')
