That meant buying a PCB, case, parts kit, Arduinos etc from them, and key switches and cheap keycaps from China.<p>You can further reduce the cost by ordering the PCB yourself from China, and some components from electronics suppliers, or laser cutting a case yourself at a maker space (or doing without).<p>It&#x27;s also possible to do without a PCB, and handwire the whole thing.  This is common where there&#x27;s little alternative, like on the Dactyl or Dactyl Manuform 3D keyboards.')
