There are high-end products out there with redundant backplanes (dual or triple) and redundant PSUs (2 or more).  To match that level of redundancy it seems you would need 4x Turing Pi, to be able to survive a simultaneous failure of 1x arbitrary PSU and failure of 1x arbitrary backplane (ie. the integrated RTL8370 GigE switch).<p>The 2x external GigE ports on the Turing Pi helps a lot, in that each cluster can connect simultaneously to 2 external GigE switches, in case one of those things fails.<p>Could be an interesting exercise to set up and get it all working, in particular K3s + dynamic routing might be a fun challenge.')
