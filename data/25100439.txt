Item(by='zone411', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605440908, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25097145, text='When Twitter blocked the NY Post story about Hunter Biden&#x27;s laptop for &quot;hacked content&quot; (and it wasn&#x27;t factually disproven) and then was very petty and wouldn&#x27;t unblock their account unless they deleted it, they lost whatever remaining trust they had left among right-wingers. Twitter has been slowly becoming more and more restrictive with many users cheering every ban of voices they disagreed with based on their ideology. Trump will probably be banned soon after he becomes a former president due to pressure from these same users and that could give Parler another influx of people.<p>I don&#x27;t buy the argument that Parler needs celebrities and mainstream journalists to survive. Do Discord or Reddit have any? Yet they are doing fine. It will probably stay an echo-chamber and with fewer right-wingers, Twitter will become more of an echo-chamber. 8 days on the top of both app stores is a real momentum for Parler, let&#x27;s see what they do with it.<p>When I saw Twitter&#x27;s head of site integrity post this:\n&quot;a phenomenally documented (and illustrated) study from \n@3r1nG about the ways that inauthentic social media accounts can be deployed to attempt to discredit an activist movement&quot; and actually followed the link and saw that it was just a blog post about very obvious Antifa parody accounts and journalists falling for 4chan-like trolling, it became clear how bad is Twitter&#x27;s company culture. They&#x27;ve been drifting around, not innovating, and their underperforming stock price reflects it well.')
