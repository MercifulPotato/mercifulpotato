I&#x27;ve paid full price for what I thought were legit items on Amazon and received fakes.<p>That&#x27;s the whole point, the whole &quot;free market&quot; thing only works if the consumer has access to all the relevant info about the product they&#x27;re buying. On Amazon more and more there&#x27;s a distortion between what the consumer thinks they&#x27;re buying and when they actually receive.<p>&gt;What Amazon shouldn&#x27;t do is have it both ways, either they&#x27;re an Ebay-esque digital flea market where everything is buyer-beware, or they&#x27;re a retailer who is responsible for the garbage on their shelves.<p>I completely agree with you here and I hope that it&#x27;ll bite them in the ass in the long run. I&#x27;m definitely a lot more cautious of the stuff I buy on Amazon now that I was 10 years ago.')
