Meaning that, even post-expungement or post-sealing (and associated time + legal fees) there&#x27;s still a non-insignificant chance that a potential employer might learn of your charge(s), even after taking legal action to clean up your record.<p>Incidentally, I&#x27;ve also once been told by a Hiring Manager family member of mine that for minor charges it might be best *not* to seal them, since that would leave a potential employer guessing and likely assuming that it was something serious as opposed to something small or common, e.g. a marijuana-related misdemeanor.<p>IANAL, obviously.')
