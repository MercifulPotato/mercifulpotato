I&#x27;ve been on the X, and it is too big. I use my phone far less than I did when they were smaller. It is just awkward and annoying.<p>I&#x27;ll have to hold the Mini to see if it is small enough to actually make a difference, I might actually buy a new phone before the old one croaks.<p>The 4 was the best them, in my opinion.')
