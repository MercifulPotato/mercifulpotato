The level of complexity increase is not just in size, but it&#x27;s a fundamental different <i>thing</i> altogether.<p>The amount of information (via DNA) needed to create a useful protein from the 20 amino acids is absolutely incredible.<p>Soâ€¦finding more <i>potential</i> (note: not demonstrated) pathways to create amino acids <i>ex nihilo</i> does literally nothing for producing viable DNA strands and proteins. DNA and proteins are a totally different problem, and we&#x27;ve made basically no progress at all, and the more we look at it, the less likely it seems.<p>And then people (not you <i>per se</i>) hand wave about the size of the Universe to explain the problem away. I think we should instead accept the problem exists and work to solve it.<p>----<p>Separately, we have no known examples of any natural process producing what we, as humans, would call &quot;information.&quot; DNA is much closer to information than any other concept, to the point where if we were sent something similar to DNA from space in, say, a radio transmission, we would <i>absolutely assume</i> intelligent life had made that transmission.<p>That is, with our current knowledge, it takes something vaguely &quot;intelligent&quot; to product the kind of information we have in DNA. Maybe such processes exist, but this is an absolute <i>far cry</i> from producing amino acids from chemical precursors, which are not information-like at all (and thus, it is unsurprising that we can do it).')
