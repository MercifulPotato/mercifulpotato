I drink its cabernet sauvignon and honestly can&#x27;t taste the difference from ordinary bottled red, although I&#x27;ve never trained my palate in any serious way.<p>Because of the plastic bladder and preservation from oxidization, the BotaBox wine tastes the same from the first glass until the box is drained, normally a week, at room temperature. I imagine though that one would get that same benefit from boxes of swill like Franzia.')
