So why wouldn’t you go to one when your mind is broken? Makes sense to me.<p>Therapy was the best $20 co-pay I paid every week for quite a while. I only stopped because I moved to a state where mental health wasn’t covered well by insurance and couldn’t justify the hourly rate in cash. But it really helped me find perspective in the minutia that is my life.<p>I’d highly recommend it to anyone that can access it. Find a good therapist and give it a go.<p>Also, I second your call for blackmailers to rot. :)')
