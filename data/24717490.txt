Trained logicians should know that semantic meaning is arbitrary (unless the actual argument is about language). The worst thing you can do is to have an argument in which you talk past each other because you each have a different idea about what the words mean.&quot;<p>It doesn&#x27;t make sense to dismiss an argument as merely semantic if you are talking about something more than just arbitrary definitions. In many cases, pro- and anti-abortion people have a genuine disagreement about the point at which life begins. This isn&#x27;t merely a disagreement about how to define a particular word. You can, if you want to, characterize it as a dispute about what it &#x27;means&#x27; for something to be alive, but that&#x27;s a much deeper issue than a mere semantic quibble. (The debate can&#x27;t, for example, be resolved by introducing two new terms alive* and alive†, with both sides of the debate agreeing that a foetus is alive* but not alive†.)')
