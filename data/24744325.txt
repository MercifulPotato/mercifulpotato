There is no way to find out all the regulations that apply to your specific business unless you 1) consult a very expensive lawyer or 2) read an authoritative, current reference specific to your field of endeavor. 2) is usually not an option if you&#x27;re doing something uncommon or brand new.<p>In the end one&#x27;s best bet as a business owner is consulting an experienced lawyer for <i>everything</i> that you do. They&#x27;re usually pricy and charge down to the minute. Everything you don&#x27;t check, is a potential compliance risk. Today some classes of severe violations, for example improperly withholding employee taxes, can even result in the corporate veil being pierced where you as the business owner now become personally liable for your business. And I&#x27;m not even getting into things like tech that have no legal certainty whatsoever.<p>All these legal and compliance costs are deadweight on the economy, they could have been used to invest in better equipment or to pay employees more, instead they are spent on lawyers. Some laws &amp; regs are no doubt necessary, but anything beyond that is a net loss for everyone. The balance always seems to only land one way these days.')
