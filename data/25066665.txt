It would follow that all design decisions stem from that requirement. Yes it is a full-featured DAW like Logic or Pro Tools, but Ableton differentiate themselves by supporting that paradigm and that leads them to configurations that are unconventional for non-performance-oriented DAWs:<p>1. Having all instruments and plugins in a horizontally-oriented trough allows quick drag-and-drop rearrangement. So if you want to rearrange their order very quickly you can do it. In Pro Tools it would be a two click operation at best and depending on how your plugins are arranged it could be significantly more than that.<p>2. It allows you to reach the knobs on their native instruments and plugins without the need to open&#x2F;close plugin windows first.<p>3. MIDI mapping becomes much quicker and intuitive when you can simply toggle the MIDI&#x2F;Keyboard mapping overlay for a given plugin.<p>4. Their Instrument Rack&#x2F;Drum Rack&#x2F;Midi Rack devices are very flexible in their capabilites. Being able to nest plugins within them like macros and then quickly hide or reveal a dozen plugins within a single rack is great for declutterring an otherwise busy interface.<p>As someone who mixes most of their projects in Ableton, their Rack paradigm allows me to condense a lot of parallel processing into a single instrument&#x2F;audio channel. This makes for a very clean representation of very complex processing. To do a similar task such as having three channels of parallel processing on a single channel in Pro Tools involves either sending them to as many return channels, or creating duplicates of that channel which all have their own parallel processing chains. This creates way more clutter on the screen.<p>That said, you CAN still have Ableton&#x27;s plugins displayed in the manner you prefer. It&#x27;s a hidden feature that&#x27;s not documented. Pretty easy to setup, but not discoverable. It&#x27;s an option that they developed but decided not to include in the final version.
