What happened?<p>I have no knowledge of the specific, but I think most people have experienced a freeze up in an interview - I certainly have.  (I tried to reimplement basic math functions on a coding test - I still have no idea what happened)<p>That&#x27;s why there is no silver bullet - fizzbuzz is an indicator.
