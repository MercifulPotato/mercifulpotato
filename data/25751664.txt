If one were looking for evidence to demonstrate that these tech behemoths are, in fact, monopolies that engage in anti-competitive behavior in violation of antitrust laws, and will obliterate any attempt to compete with them in the marketplace, it would be difficult to imagine anything more compelling than how they just used their unconstrained power to utterly destroy a rising competitor.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not buying the premise of this argument. If anything, Parler, a social network, was a (diminutive) competitor to Facebook and Twitter. Amazon, Google and Apple do not come to mind as companies standing to gain by destroying it.<p>The author seems to have an axe to grind against companies he perceives as monopolies and is stretching the facts to support his world view.')
