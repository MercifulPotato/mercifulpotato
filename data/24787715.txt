This is the amplifying effect that makes things hot.<p>2) the immediacy - a message can be spread insanely rapidly, faster than any individual humans can understand or respond to it.  This is the fuel.<p>It&#x27;s the fact that it happens at an inhuman scale that I think is the biggest part.  Email at a human-to-human level is like letter writing.  Information can travel through it, but it can&#x27;t amplify by bypassing the human connections in the way that Twitter trending topics can.  Likewise 1:1 or limited-sized groups on Whatsapp.<p>I&#x27;d even put Facebook groups into that bucket, so long as they&#x27;re full of humans who know each other.  It&#x27;s once you get to groups with millions of people who don&#x27;t know each other directly that things get out of hand.')
