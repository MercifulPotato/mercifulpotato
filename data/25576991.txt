A lot of overseas releases of anime&#x2F;games are censored for mild nudity that passed Japan&#x27;s rating association. And some popular districts advertise erotic games on massive billboards under large crowds of pedestrians. On the other hand, a mission in a Call of Duty title was changed in the Japanese release so that it immediately ends with an admonishment if you try to shoot civilians.')
