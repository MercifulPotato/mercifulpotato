The premise presented is simple. The past is fixed, the universe is consistent, if you travel back in time that always happened.<p>You&#x27;re saying there&#x27;s a puzzle about something that the premise at hand simply says is impossible. You might as well imagine being able to create energy out of nothing and then say that&#x27;s a puzzle in a universe in which we have conservation of energy. Just because you can imagine something impossible doesn&#x27;t make it a paradox.<p><i>And Iâ€™ll reiterate: I accept all of these premises</i><p>No you don&#x27;t. You keep saying &quot;but what if you go back and change the past?&quot;')
