Dam methane production is based on the amount of organic matter being added by the river which is effectively a constant over time.  It’s effectively the same process as cow’s methane where decaying plants release methane in a low oxygen environment.<p>The issue is <i>you don’t get an accurate number for the amount of methane in the atmosphere from a dam by multiplying average annual methane release by the number of years it’s in operation.</i> Thus the the rate of doesn’t correlate to future global warming making such statements absolutely meaningless.<p>PS: Also, all of this is assuming the study adjusted for what happens when the dam is not there and nearly the same process occurs when the river dumps into an ocean somewhere.')
