It also remains to be seen whether the &quot;common folks&quot; that piled on this week are going make a profit or are just going to be bagholders</i><p>My comment above makes no statement about who is going to eventually profit from this.<p>My comment is about how as soon as the &quot;common folk&quot; start to take their destiny into their own hands, the &quot;rich folk&quot; cry foul, to the point where Congressmen are issuing press releases, and there is talk of completely re-designing the entire system.<p>There is an <i>awful</i> lot of whining coming from one end of the wealth spectrum right now.')
