Surprise to see they talk openly.<p>Both Backblaze and CloudFlare are very open about this.  It is called the &quot;Bandwidth Alliance&quot;, you can read about it at these two links:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.backblaze.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;backblaze-and-cloudflare-partner-to-provide-free-data-transfer&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.backblaze.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;backblaze-and-cloudflare-part...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cloudflare.com&#x2F;bandwidth-alliance&#x2F;backblaze&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cloudflare.com&#x2F;bandwidth-alliance&#x2F;backblaze&#x2F;</a><p>For Backblaze, it&#x27;s part of our business strategy to be open and honest with customers.  That feels funny to type, but it&#x27;s true.  We have historically disclosed things that other companies have traditionally kept secret, like our internal drive failure rates.  I don&#x27;t know if this is surprising or not, but it has worked well financially for us.  Meaning we explain what is going on, more potential customers hear about us, more customers trust us, our sales increase.<p>I&#x27;m actually curious why other businesses keep their operations so secret?')
