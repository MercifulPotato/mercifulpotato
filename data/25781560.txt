Alabama (I&#x27;m not a lawyer though, and Ken is probably smarter than me anyhow).<p>But that is that Marsh v. Alabama had the company wanting to use a state law to kick people out (and this was repeated with the California case Pruneyard). &quot;The state doesn&#x27;t need to actively help you kick people exercising their 1A rights in a place you don&#x27;t want them to&quot; is very, very different from &quot;The state can prevent you from exercising your own autonomy to prevent someone from re-accessing your property&quot;.<p>If the company town put up a fence and a gate, they wouldn&#x27;t be forced to let anyone in.')
