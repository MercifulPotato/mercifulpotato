They built it themselves.<p>The theory that the US &quot;does not allow&quot; the establishment of academic institutions in Islamic countries is equally wrong.<p>edit - There is a common attitude among Arabs (evident in this poster&#x27;s comments in this thread) that everything bad in Arab countries is due to some combination of the US and Israel.  One of my teachers, a Jordanian, told me how his father would poke fun at this attitude: when something in the house would break, his father would ironically blame Israel for it.<p>American foreign policy in the Arab world is complicated.  It seems to me that many Arab countries oscillate between Islamist democracies and secular dictatorships.  The US prefers the latter to the former.  I think it&#x27;s fair to criticize this stance but my sense is that the US would support a secular democracy, were it possible.  The Obama administration supported the secular opposition to Assad...but it has turned out that the biggest faction of the Syrian opposition are Sunnis motivated by Islamism, hence America backing away from Syria.')
