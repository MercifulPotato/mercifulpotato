And that&#x27;s what makes it frightening. Especially when everybody nowadays has his own brand of reality.<p>Note: Despite the fact that I think Brexit is a devastatingly bad idea I don&#x27;t mean to imply that leave voters are bigots or racists. Brexit is just a great example about undue influence on a referendum.<p>E: Removed redundancy')
