As a CS guy and software engineer, I&#x27;ve always wanted to combine that knowledge with actual physical engineering (i.e. mechanical and electrical) in order to build cool stuff and complete my knowledge base as an engineer.<p>I&#x27;ve always seen his videos and wanted to be able to prototype and engineer actual physical things like him, rather than spending my whole life building software (although software pays the bills - nothing wrong with that). I wonder how far the course would actually be able to take me - it would be interesting to see.<p>The course seems a bit high priced and I don&#x27;t have time at the moment, but I&#x27;ll definitely keep my eye on it and wait to see the reviews.')
