I&#x27;m a big fan of Google Photos, in fact I&#x27;d go so far as to say I&#x27;d take very few pictures if not for it. Not because of the storage, but because of the ease with which it allows me to reminisce and organize my photos. I&#x27;d happily pay the couple bucks a month for it if it&#x27;s what keeps it viable, I&#x27;d much rather that than the kill the service.<p>And they&#x27;re giving 8 months notice and everything up to that point will continue to be supported for free. It&#x27;s kind of crazy to me that people have a problem with it.')
