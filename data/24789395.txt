The only problem Ive encounteres is that the costs for wide format go through the roof.   I need to print 11x17&#x27;s regularly but infrequently.  The solution i figured out was to get a good consumer all-in-one laser for normal size paper, and then a wideformat inkjet.  I hate havung two printers, but the total cost is like $600 instead of $2500+.')
