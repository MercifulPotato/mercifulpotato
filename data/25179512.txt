Item(by='atmosx', descendants=None, kids=[25180258], score=None, time=1606068462, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25177380, text='The economist is okay if you are conservative liberal with strong bias towards the &quot;west&quot;. Russia and China are _wrong_ by default, every _war_ (Syria, Ukraine, Libya, Afghanistan, Iran... all of them failed campaigns by public standards, Afghanistan not failed(?) by US standards - Afghanistan is about global heroin control btw) is justifiable and actively supported, Banks ought to be _protected_ any social-welfare policy (before covid, in the covid era the tune has changed considerably) is brought to us by &quot;populist devilish politicians&quot; while every bank-saving, pro-market scheme which leaves large % of the population jobless is &quot;made-in-heaven&quot;.<p>The economist like reading an old British grandmother supporting financial schemes and policies which failed more time than I can count, again and again.<p>By the way before 2010 the articles were better argued and these differences were not so blatant. I believe the quality has decreased considerably. Then again, these are polarized times...<p>There&#x27;s also the good parts. The obituary, the &quot;Charlemagne&quot; part is often somewhat relevant.<p>Examples of double-standards are Brexit vs France &quot;yello vests&quot; movement. The British should by all means do another referendum or the politicians should mimic the 2015 Greek PM and revert the result the of the referendum because &quot;people don&#x27;t know&quot;. The French voters should stay put and accept &quot;the result of the democratic procedures&quot; which brought Macron to power. So... Which one is it then? Respect democracy or overturn it? ;-)<p>When I was a subscriber I was getting informed for various matters all over the world, so if it&#x27;s the economist vs <i>nothing</i>, I would prefer the economist. If it&#x27;s the economist vs <i>something else</i>, well... I don&#x27;t know.')
