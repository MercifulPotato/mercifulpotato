At first, it freaked me out. But I never heard a peep, and the neighbourhood was surprisingly peaceful given the location. (It was surrounded by fairly rough areas.) I later learned that this was not a coincidence. Their presence kept trouble away from the block, and they never caused trouble themselves. In other words: No one wanted to mess with them, and the Angels weren&#x27;t gonna &quot;sh*t where they eat&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this was a net positive. I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t live there anymore, as there was a persistent anxiety about the potential for that peace to be disrupted. But it was the closest I ever got to experiencing what it&#x27;s like to living in a gang-controlled area, and it was weird.')
