It&#x27;s detailed, but as an occasional editor, I&#x27;m not seeing much wordiness. It also makes good use of headers and bolding so readers can skim and skip if they want.<p>There&#x27;s definitely imagery, history, and definitions that technically could be cut, but the guidelines would be poorer for itâ€”especially for people with less familiarity with the commandline. I do think they should consider releasing a cheat sheet alongside the full document with just the bolded guidelines.')
