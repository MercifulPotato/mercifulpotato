A problem we could solve <i>today</i>. By popping a range extender under the (currently empty!) bonnet of a Tesla. Then everyone could get an EV, figure out how to make it work right now, and be ready for the way forward.<p>Don&#x27;t think about what we could be doing by 2030 - think about what we could achieve right now!<p>And it&#x27;s not just about petrol - don&#x27;t fixate on when petrol is phased out - it&#x27;s about diesel as well.<p>(An unrelated problem is that EVs need more form factors, such as off-road vehicles, which Teslas don&#x27;t currently do.)')
