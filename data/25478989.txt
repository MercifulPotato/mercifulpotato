I&#x27;m confused if that&#x27;s how I should read this. You might be right. I assume you&#x27;re referring to this paragraph?<p>&gt; Evidence suggests that as early as October 2019, these attackers have been testing their ability to insert code by adding empty classes. Therefore, insertion of malicious code into the SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll likely occurred at an early stage, before the final stages of the software build, which would include digitally signing the compiled code.<p>They talk about adding classes at an early stage... I assumed that meant modifying the source code in some fashion. Sounds like you took it to mean they inserted binary (MSIL?) code during the build? Or are you referring to a different paragraph that indicates this wasn&#x27;t part of source control?')
