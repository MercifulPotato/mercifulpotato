The H-1B has always been meant as a path to permanent residence, which is why it has been dual intent since the beginning.<p>The AC21 indefinite extensions were added because the per-country backlogs were not anticipated back when the program was created. But it has <i>always</i>, from the very beginning, built a path to permanent residence in via EB2, EB3 and the dual intent provision.<p>Edit: The person replying to me about the H1B not being dual intent from the beginning is wrong. I have receipts. The H1B was introduced in the Immigration Act of 1990.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.congress.gov&#x2F;bill&#x2F;101st-congress&#x2F;senate-bill&#x2F;358&#x2F;text" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.congress.gov&#x2F;bill&#x2F;101st-congress&#x2F;senate-bill&#x2F;358...</a><p>&gt;  `(h) The fact that an alien is the beneficiary of an application for a\n preference status filed under section 204 or has otherwise sought permanent\n residence in the United States shall not constitute evidence of an intention\n to abandon a foreign residence for purposes of obtaining a visa as a\n nonimmigrant described in subparagraph (H)(i) or (L) of section 101(a)(15)\n or otherwise obtaining or maintaining the status of a nonimmigrant described\n in such subparagraph, if the alien had obtained a change of status under\n section 248 to a classification as such a nonimmigrant before the alien&#x27;s\n most recent departure from the United States.&#x27;.<p>Edit to respond to the second reply: The <i>H-1B</i> is dual intent. I did not make any claims about a visa category that no longer exists. Besides, the argument about whether the H-1B is an update or a new category doesn&#x27;t matter -- it is clear that Congress intended for the H-1B, as created (or updated if you will) in 1990, to be a path to permanent residence. The assertion that it was never intended that way is ahistorical.<p>Further edit: It sounds like rayiner&#x27;s dad came in on an older H-1 which indeed didn&#x27;t have the dual intent provision, not an H-1<i>B</i> which does. The details matter here!<p>Further, further edit:<p>&gt; The only reason you need “dual intent” is because the law still requires H1-B holders to have non-immigrant intent.<p>I literally pointed to the provision of the 1990 Act which does <i>not</i> require non-immigrant intent for people in H and L statuses. This is what Congress intended.<p>Of course the H-1B isn&#x27;t an immigrant visa. It is a <i>dual intent</i> visa, in that it preserves the <i>option value</i> of not having to become a green card holder (and thus pay US taxes worldwide if you decide to leave later, etc.) So someone on an H-1B can choose to become a permanent resident, but doesn&#x27;t have to become one.<p>I&#x27;m sympathetic to the argument that people should have to decide within a few years either to leave or to stay permanently, but for that the green card backlogs need to be eliminated by statute.')
