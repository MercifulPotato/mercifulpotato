Whether it&#x27;s online or a billboard on the town square it&#x27;s still social media in a sense. Personally I agree with your sentiment, but in my mind I equate no social media with &quot;the giants&quot; like Facebook, Instagram, tiktok, Snapchat I guess.<p>I&#x27;m not sure exactly what makes them different from more focused forums, but it&#x27;s something and – in my opinion – I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a net good for society.<p>Personally, I have no account with these services. I used to but I deleted all of them and it&#x27;s made my life richer, not poorer.')
