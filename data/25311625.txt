They explicitly talk about how some activities today are &quot;actively bad for the world&quot; and perceived as such.<p>There is a moral judgment behind the &quot;That&#x27;s cool dude!&quot; you get when you reveal you&#x27;re working to fix the climate crisis and I suspect there is fear of moral judgment behind GP&#x27;s omission of their employer, due to their employer&#x27;s poor record on the moral issues of the day. This goes deeper than shit being less cool as time passes. In short we&#x27;re not talking about dubstep or fidget spinners.<p>Moral judgments like this do not follow a curve that &quot;always happens&quot;. It has always been good to volunteer at soup kitchens on one hand, and on the other hand while it used to be good to not be evil and &quot;to organize the world&#x27;s information and make it universally accessible and useful&quot;, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d agree nowadays Google is not perceived as less cool than it was only because it&#x27;s not the latest shiny new tech success.')
