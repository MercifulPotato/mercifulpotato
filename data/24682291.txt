Your bigger problem is system interrupts which might cause discontinuous capture. The speed is derived from the core clock which can go to well over 100MHz.<p>Control of the bus is probably handled by kernel drivers anyway, so you&#x27;re not doing much overhead with Python.<p>Also make sure you use hardware video encoding. I don&#x27;t know if the picamera library does, but worth checking. I normally use OpenCV with the omxh264 encoder. You could also run a gstreamer pipeline in parallel with your air code.<p>Edit: looking at you pipeline you use the lsm303 which is I2C not SPI? So that&#x27;s 400khz max. And the Bosch BMP something which isn&#x27;t designed for rapid measurements - even if it&#x27;s over SPI they output of the chip will be your limit there.')
