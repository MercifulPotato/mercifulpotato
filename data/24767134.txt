This leads to the requirement that Planck&#x27;s constant h be the same in all frames. If the Stern-Gerlach experiment could give results between +h and -h, then the orientation producing the maximum value would be a preferred frame.<p>OK, I think I understand that.<p>&gt; And because of that, when Alice and Bob measure entangled quantum particles, their combined results must violate Bell&#x27;s inequality.<p>Could you be slightly less ridiculously condensed here?  Give a one-or-two-paragraph, accessible-to-the-semi-layman explanation of <i>why</i> this means the result must violate Bell&#x27;s Inequality?<p>&gt; But to my mind, the biggest take-away is that Einstein&#x27;s Principle of Relativity absolutely requires that conservation can only be on average.<p>And the same request here.  <i>Why</i> does the principle of relativity require that?')
