They are there at your permission, as long as they behave according to your standards.<p>When you rent space to someone, and they start using it in a way you don&#x27;t like, maybe even specificially violating their lease, you can throw them out, but it becomes a legal process called eviction. You can&#x27;t just put their stuff on the sidewalk and change the locks without going through that process. This is how the game is played when you get into that business.<p>Maybe that is the part that&#x27;s missing with the AWS&#x2F;Parler situation. AWS doesn&#x27;t want them, but they leased space and services to them and there is a contract. Breach of contract is not something that either party to the contract can determine, because they both have conflicts of interest. If we had a judge review the contract, and approve the eviction, at least there would be a lot less basis to claim that are acting capriciously or out of bias.')
