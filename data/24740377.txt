That seems to stay reasonably true a week later.<p>What is more interesting is what tradeoffs you make to produce fast code. Chez scheme produces code that is plenty fast compared to most other scheme compilers, and does so at almost 100KLOC&#x2F;s on my computer (on generated code that is relatively simple and already macro-expanded). They have strict limits on the time complexity on optimization passes, and even though some people have whined about it it seems to have served chez scheme well.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24660468" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24660468</a>')
