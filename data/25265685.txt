Item(by='DennisP', descendants=None, kids=[25273899], score=None, time=1606834588, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25265009, text='There are basically two big things in Ethereum&#x27;s scaling roadmap. One is sharding, so each node only has to process a fraction of all transactions. Initially there will be 64 shards, but it&#x27;s designed to allow up to 1024. As individual nodes get more powerful, both the number of shards and the amount processed by each shard increases, for quadratic scaling.<p>The other part, which is on Ethereum mainnet already, is a layer-2 idea called rollups, which store transactions on chain in a very compressed format without losing security guarantees. There are several rollup systems, capable on today&#x27;s Ethereum of doing 1000 to 9000 simple tx&#x2F;sec.<p>Once both systems are live, total capacity will be 20K to 100K tx&#x2F;sec, not counting the quadratic improvements.<p>On the research side, there&#x27;s also work to make data validation more efficient by replacing merkle trees with something more compact, like polynomial commitments. That would add another 10X factor to rollup scaling.<p>Regarding footguns, people are working on more rigorous languages than Solidity that still compile to the EVM. So far their compilers aren&#x27;t as solid so they don&#x27;t get much production use yet.')
