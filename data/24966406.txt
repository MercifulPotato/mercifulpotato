Most of those journalists had no problem suppressing stories which didn&#x27;t directly affect them as long it a) gave them &quot;access&quot; or b) was acceptable in their social circles - which were often composed of socialites, the rich and the descendants of the rich.<p>As bad as social media is(and I think it is bad), at least now people are able to see more clearly how the sausage is made.<p>The glorification of politicians and celebrities will hopefully die.<p>The realisation that celebrities aren&#x27;t intelligent or have a better grasp on a situation will become clear.<p>Fame doesn&#x27;t make you clever.
