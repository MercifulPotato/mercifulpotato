Try G for bottom, gg for top, $ for end of line<p>How is this better than Ctrl+End for bottom, Ctrl+Home for the top, End for end of line? I believe these keys have actually been put on the keyboards right for this and that&#x27;s why their names are self-descriptive.<p>&gt; 5j to jump 5 lines<p>I can&#x27;t imagine a case when this would be of serious value.<p>&gt; w to jump word, b backwards etc.<p>Ctrl+arrows.<p>So, I still don&#x27;t get it although I sincerely want to.')
