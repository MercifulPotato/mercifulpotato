Nowadays, not using any form of control sounds crazy, but there was a time when that wasn&#x27;t the case.  What was standing in the way?  A subset of working developers who just wanted to code without having to think about the task of systematically capturing a record of a codebase&#x27;s history.  But having a reliable, exhaustive record of changes is more useful than not having it, and the default stance today is that you need to use source control.  What did it take to get here?  Programmers getting over themselves and putting in upfront work to attain a level of competence where basic source control operations are natural.<p>The tools that the author has created and the work they&#x27;re doing is in &quot;clearly better than what many people are doing now&quot; territory, but it&#x27;s completely unworkable so long as programmers are unwilling to get over themselves and keep opting instead to just do things the way they&#x27;ve always done them.')
