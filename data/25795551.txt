Large swaths of criteria are specifically geared to uncover both of these (unencrypted credentials and audit trails).<p>SOC-2 audit firms have a strongly vested interest in hiring competent auditors, because if a SOC-2 auditor did not ask questions covering these areas, then failure to complete the audit would be actionable malpractice and the auditor would be liable, unless the company lied (committed demonstrable fraud) in its written responses.')
