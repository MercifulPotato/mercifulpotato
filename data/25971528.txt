In latest versions of Android, you&#x27;ll need to serve the apk through a ContentProvider. I tested this myself, it works, even if the app is updating itself.<p>But I think you can actually still load arbitrary dex files using a ClassLoader? I thought that the update was only affecting JNI libraries. I remember reading how they wanted for any and all executable code to come from a signed package. Even then, if you&#x27;re determined enough, you can load arbitrary native code by allocating some rwx memory pages and copying it in there ;)')
