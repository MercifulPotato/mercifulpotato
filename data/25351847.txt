Hot data should absolutely have a fully-materialized copy at the node where operations are made, and an arbitrary number of readable copies can be materialized for added performance in systems that don&#x27;t rely on strong consistency as much.<p>However for cold-data, there really hasn&#x27;t been (or at least I am unaware of) any system that can achieve the combined durability of 1.5x Reed-Solomon codes + 3x replication, with such a small penalty to storage costs.<p>Like you said though, it&#x27;s definitely not the thing you&#x27;d be doing for things that prioritize performance as aggressively as the use-cases you&#x27;ve suggested.')
