Item(by='GIFtheory', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611461544, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25888473, text='&gt; 1) If you&#x27;re writing anything that&#x27;s not a script with a few lines, and you care about your software not being terrible to maintain and change for other people in real production settings, typed languages wipe the floor with dynamic languages (excluding ecosystem moats, just judging the languages).<p>I really hope the typed-vs-not-typed debate is over... types &gt; no types. However... I used to believe that types were essential. I now believe that they are more like a luxury. Good tools are a luxury, not fundamental—it’s way more important to have good software design, and the core of good software design is really tool-independent. It requires deep understanding of whatever problem you’re trying to solve, not a deep understanding of software tools—-unless you’re unlucky enough to be building some horrible middleware.<p>I also like to dabble in photography, where you see a similar phenomenon. When I take a really great photo, people sometimes remark, “wow, you must have a really great camera!” No, actually, that’s the least important part of the equation. There’s a reason why Canon’s top-of-the line lenses are the “L” series—the L is for luxury. They make the job a little easier, but they’re not really essential.')
