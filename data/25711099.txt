I don&#x27;t think it was originally pejorative, although it has come to be used as an insult, in the same way &quot;Boomer&quot; has. The term &quot;Cultural Marxists&quot; is probably pejorative to those it targets, although I&#x27;ve seen its use as a shorthand for a collection of ideas the right finds disagreeable, rather than a pejorative. It&#x27;s a term that feels self-describing and immediately obvious to those who use it, but it does not have an academic foundation like &quot;neoliberal&quot; does. And its definition has varied over time, which is the cause of the current lack of consensus on what it refers to. As a result, each political side I think uses the definition that most favors their own ideological bias.')
