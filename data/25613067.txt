Young guy, big production and budget - of course he&#x27;ll listen to everyone since, well.. insecurity!<p>Alien 3 was my first thought when I saw David Fincher in this headline. As flawed as that movie was, I still really enjoyed it. I can tell he legitimately tried to make it a legitimate &quot;art&quot; piece in his mind.<p>Your commentary about him being young+big money... is absolutely correct. Alien 3 could have had 3x the box market pop if there was a more collaborative process in my view.<p>Oh well, you live and you learn. Personal bias: I have enjoyed pretty much every one of David Fincher&#x27;s movies.')
