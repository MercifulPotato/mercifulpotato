Leads weren&#x27;t told how to do it, they were just given the accountability of making sure it was done and the autonomy to decide how it happened. If a lead quit, that accountability fell to that lead&#x27;s lead. This led all the way up to the President of the org who would be accountable for everything should everyone quit. It worked fabulously well. We were all volunteers (~250 members). The closest thing I&#x27;ve seen to this in the paid professional world is the holacracy model of business organization. Despite my best efforts, I was unable to convince my current company to grow this way and now we swim through a deep pile of jira tasks, assigning them out to devs one by one with nobody having a clear sense of ownership of anything ever.')
