Understanding data structures doesn’t require math, just logic. Maybe some mathematical operations can be derived from observation but the numbers behind it don’t really need to be known.<p>I’ve never been able to grasp mathematics as numbers. My ability to work with numbers is severely compromised by my disability. This hasn’t hurt my ability to excel as a web developer. In fact, while I can’t visualize individual formulas or algorithms, I can visualize very complicated applications. And I likely know what types of algorithms and data structures would be likely be optimal.<p>Even if I don’t know the “correct” math, I know where to look for it.')
