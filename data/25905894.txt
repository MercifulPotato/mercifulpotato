Ryanair have only flown the 737 Type Rating since their inception, not solely the 737-8200s they have on order.<p>The only non-737 Type Rated aircraft in the corporate fleet are the A320-200s that came with the aquisition of Lauda Air, which are set to be replaced by 737-8200s.<p>The A320neo was never a viable option for Ryanair.')
