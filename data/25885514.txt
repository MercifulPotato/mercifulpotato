And I think in the beginning Tesla&#x27;s FSD Beta was so bad that it was reckless to release to the testers.<p>BUT. Look at the very latest version of the Tesla FSD Beta (&quot;beta 10&quot;) as of now.  It is literally doing the full self-driving task with very few disengagements now.  And the improvements over the course of the last few months have been dramatic.<p>At this point it is not really safe without watching closely and has a fair way to go before it gets to the high 9s, especially in arbitrary situations as they intend.<p>But if you look at the progress they have made and how many fewer disengagements there are now, I do not think it is reasonable to assume that they can&#x27;t get to the finish line.  They look like their trajectory is actually to get there.')
