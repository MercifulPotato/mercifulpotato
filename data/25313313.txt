Heck, there&#x27;s differences when you just use Chrome as a normal browser. For example, the delta value of a mousewheel scroll event when the user is holding down their meta key (ctrl or cmd) can be <i>very</i> different between Windows and OSX depending on the input device. There are differences between Windows Display Scaling for high pixel density screens on Windows and the scaling on OSX for Retina devices. And so on. They&#x27;re problems right on the edge of app development so they&#x27;re hard to find and hard to fix. You should not just write an app using browser tech and assume the browser will make it exactly the same on every OS. Until you&#x27;ve tested and debugged on a platform you shouldn&#x27;t say you support it.')
