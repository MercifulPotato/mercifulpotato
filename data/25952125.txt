Google sees 100K+ negative reviews coming in for one app on one day. What do you think they&#x27;re going to do? Take &#x27;em all down and call it a day. I really doubt that there is some incredibly corrupt culture in Google Play reviews or something like some are suggesting. I really  the product owners just want to go home for the day&#x2F;turn off the computer and eat dinner, just like everybody else that has a job.')
