If personnel go around talking about &#x27;dominating the market&#x27; that could be effectively &#x27;used against them&#x27; irrespective of the material nature of ostensible market domination.<p>A lot of this kind of stuff is vague, political, words have power etc. and things can be taken way out of context.<p>It&#x27;s not wrong for Google to want staff to use the right words to describe market situations correctly.<p>Of course this means something different if in fact, objectively speaking they&#x27;re trying to get people to actually misrepresent reality.')
