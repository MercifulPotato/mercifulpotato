I had some kind of bizarre arthritis in my ankle at the beginning of the year. First they said it was gout. When gout remedies didn&#x27;t help, they took a fluid sample. Not gout, not rheumatoid arthritis, not another kind of arthritis. Basically they were stumped. Luckily it went away after about a month. But it was utterly debilitating while I had it. No good sleep angle, couldn&#x27;t walk, couldn&#x27;t get it off my mind. Changed my life.<p>Sympathies for everyone out there dealing with ongoing pain.')
