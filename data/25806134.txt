Anything with a master, edge, or nightly release. Safari Tech Preview, Chrome Dev Edition, Firefox Developer Edition.  FreeBSD-CURRENT vs FreeBSD-STABLE.  And every network or storage operating system I ever installed on a switch or router or SAN head or other appliance came in a variety of release trains, from Experimental-Will-Crash to GA(T) and every shade in-between.<p>&gt; &quot;another offender&quot;<p>Be careful, it&#x27;s a nasty fall off that high horse.<p>and re. these earlier remarks:<p>&gt; Windows and Mac OS<p>Windows and Mac OS most definitely have experimental&#x2F;preview releases and standard releases. Microsoft offer extended support options, and ultra-marathon ESU contract support for products as far back as Windows Server 2008.<p>Same goes for most commercial RDBMS. Heck, even Oracle has a preview release.<p>&gt; anything outside of Linux or Node<p>Linux stopped using alternating version numbers in 2004, so I&#x27;m afraid your information there has passed even Microsoft&#x27;s extended support period.  For the curious, though, GNOME still uses the even&#x2F;odd versioning as a lifecycle indicator, but has plans to abandon it this year.  I hope Node will do the same, because of all the numbering styles this is certainly the most confusing.<p>As for Java, only a dyed-in-the-wool government bureaucrat could possibly love Java&#x27;s approach to ecosystem engagement. &quot;Let&#x27;s have seven years of committee meetings and experimental feature flags for the new GC&quot;. Ugh.<p>Standing back, this just sounds like a grumble about terminology, because almost _everyone_ has some kind of leading-edge release and some kind of stable release, the only difference is the naming, and that doesn&#x27;t seem to me the basis of a substantial complaint.  If the core issue is inconsistencies about which one is installed by default, then that is a complaint I&#x27;d suggest best leveled at package managers, because there is no universe available in which every software project is going to somehow magically converge on a single lifecycle policy.')
