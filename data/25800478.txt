So Relational DBs weren&#x27;t &quot;fast enough&quot; for these cases... hence &quot;NoSQL&quot;.<p>I joke that the only thing a NoSQL database can do faster than an RDBMS is give you the wrong answer to a query.<p>There are two different features that people typically think of when they think of NoSQL as compared to a traditional RDBMS:<p>1. Document database (i.e. unstructured, or at least weakly structured data)<p>2. Eventual consistency<p>You could have an ACID document database, or an eventually consistent relational database, so the two are actually orthogonal.  It&#x27;s definitely easier to get something up and running quickly if you aren&#x27;t going to implement all of SQL though.<p>If you make money serving up ads on lists of documents, then getting any answer quickly is going to be better than getting the &quot;right&quot; answer slowly, so for google at least, this made sense, as google&#x27;s databases actually were that big.<p>IMO the rest of it was people cargo-culting, not understanding the hard-won knowledge of the 70s, and also not realizing that, if your working set was 100GB, you could just buy a server with 256GB of ram and have zero performance issues.  Prototypes went up fast, benchmarks were great, and then somewhere down the line, someone wanted to run a query on the data, and discovered that fast writes come at a significant cost.')
