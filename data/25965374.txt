No javascript bs, no UI frameworks, no SPA garbage, just good ol folder listing in HTML. Glorious, fast and shall I say, impeccable?<p>In 2021, this would be a &quot;card&quot; based page, about 6 cards visible, rounded corners, and it would have fucking infinite scroll, ofcourse with spinners to let you know its processing. God, help us.<p>Edit: I should clarify, I like JS for form submission and a few things. If you&#x27;re building Google Docs competitor, by all means, go for SPA and big JS frameworks. That&#x27;s what they&#x27;re designed for.')
