Most western societies have made the decision culturally that even though its disproportionately expensive, that the cost is worth spending to (as much as is reasonable) make things accessible. (Legislators are on board in many countries too.)<p>I see your point - this website is really cool and its classic HN to have the top comment complain about a minor point. But also, because accessibility and security are invisible to most of us, vigilance is the only way it’ll happen.')
