The moment one of those accounts posts something related to the outrage du jour, it&#x27;s an almost immediate unfollow. <i>It doesn&#x27;t matter whether I agree with the content of the post or not</i>.<p>I&#x27;m sure I miss a few from time to time, but you get the point.<p>I&#x27;ve unfollowed lots of tech luminaries I admire, lots of musicians whose music I love, lots of brands that make good products. And I still buy some of the books and albums and products they produce. I might even miss the occasional awesome announcement from one of those outlets. But the resulting sanity and focus of my social media feeds is worth it.')
