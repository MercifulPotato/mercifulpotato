I personally started using Busuu about two years ago. I&#x27;m now at 85% level and almost ready to take the B2 exams.<p>In the meantime, I joined a Spanish&#x2F;English exchange Meetup group. We did weekly sessions talking in Spanish.<p>I started listening to Spanish podcasts made for beginners. I like the Hoy Hablamos. Started listening to Spanish music, tried to read the lyrics of my favourite songs.<p>At this point, I&#x27;m watching Spanish films in Netflix with Spanish subtitles. I think I&#x27;m getting 70% of it, quite a lot I need to pause and translate something or rewind a few times.<p>I&#x27;m definitely nowhere close to being fluid but I&#x27;m feeling the progress I made over those two years and I just keep going. I&#x27;m not in rush in any way so I&#x27;m not pushing my self too hard.<p>My ultimate goal is to be able to go to Spain and talk fluid Spanish with locals. :)')
