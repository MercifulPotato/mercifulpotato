Item(by='lucb1e', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605477131, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25104818, text='&gt; I would have lost access to the developed world FOREVER<p>What&#x27;s wrong with being a programmer in a different country? Maybe I don&#x27;t understand but as someone who writes code and doesn&#x27;t have a &quot;green card&quot; (afaict that&#x27;s some USA immigration thing) I really don&#x27;t see the problem there. Not doing anything fun for a year seems like a much bigger sentence than not being allowed to stay in a place that you apparently didn&#x27;t come from to begin with. There are a lot of other rich countries in the world if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for? I heard some of them even score higher on happiness indices.<p>I do agree with you that OP seems to have social anxiety. Reading that they have a lot of trouble posting things online, that&#x27;s not normal and definitely doesn&#x27;t seem like a good recipe for someone who wants to make a living with a developer job in this digital world. But I don&#x27;t agree that because <i>you</i> went through self-proclaimed bigger risks, this person isn&#x27;t rightfully frustrated after not managing to make money from self-employment.')
