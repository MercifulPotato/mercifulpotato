I think the general experiences for many of us here is: you can&#x27;t listen to music that occupied the same cognitive channel of what you&#x27;re doing.<p>If you&#x27;re thinking, writing, or planing(or anything with &#x27;words&#x27; in your head or &#x27;talk&#x27; to yourself), music with lyric is bad \n(though I found the effect more soften a bit if you listen to what you don&#x27;t understand, e.g. foreign language music, still, zero lyric is crucial for thinking)<p>If your activity is not about words, but more &#x27;action&#x27; (e.g painting , making art, gardening) then you can blast your ear with lyrics or the whole audiobooks all you want. It works great.')
