The G stands for Geometric.  It is composed of a family of global predictors that increase in length with a geometric progression.  That&#x27;s somewhat relieving since it means that the storage growth is not unlike that of mipmapping in computer graphics.  A small constant k times maximum history length N.<p>But to a first approximation, if you double the density of conditional branches in the program, then you will need to roughly double the size of the branch prediction tables to get the same performance, even if all of them are correctly predicted 100% of the time.')
