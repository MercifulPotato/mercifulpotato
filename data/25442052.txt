It&#x27;s an absolute love affair.<p>I used Xmonad and awesomewm before. I don&#x27;t understand enough Haskell to configure Xmonad and awesomewm is a giant dependency mess (the irony being that it&#x27;s a fork of dwm , the minimalist suckless wm)<p>Anyways: i3 has struck the perfect balance for me. Written in C, easy to modify, configuration is intuitive and obvious (I have no interest in spending weeks learning how to configure it), and best of all super stable and bug free.<p>Highly recommended!<p>I started using WSL2 on my windows machines just to run i3 on windows. That works too! (Basically you vnc to WSL to get i3)')
