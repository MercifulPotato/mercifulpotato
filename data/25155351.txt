The criteria I outlined above accomplishes that.<p>As far as socioeconomic class, overproduction of elites and critical thinking skills, I think it is plainly obvious that education systems do not help. I did not learn critical thinking in school, I learned it in life. In fact, what I&#x27;m doing right now is critically thinking about the role and effectiveness of rigorous education. They don&#x27;t do that in rigorous education.<p>Overproduction of elites cannot happen through rigorous and standard education, it underproduces capable people. I should note that I do not think you can overproduce elites, I want everyone to be one.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that a person doesn&#x27;t need an education. What I&#x27;m saying is that a child doesn&#x27;t need 13 years of full time schooling and I&#x27;m saying that a classroom is not an effective place to learn most things we need to learn.')
