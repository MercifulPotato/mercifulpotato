Item(by='0x262d', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611639078, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25912655, text='It&#x27;s clear that some people have done some bad things, and they used the internet (mostly facebook but whatever) to communicate.<p>There are 2 approaches to fixing this.<p>1 is to undercut the roots of radicalism and polarization. I would say to do that by radically redistributing wealth and democratizing government. Yes, the capitol stormers mostly weren&#x27;t poor, but Trumpism is in large part a reaction of horror by small business owners at being squeezed by monopolies, and what popular support they have would evaporate if the government fixed things instead of being run as the public relations firm and personal military of all the large companies put together.<p>2 is to instead double down on physical repression (by funding police) and digital repression of dissenting viewpoints by abolishing any right to privacy. This seems to be the direction we&#x27;re heading. It already happened in large part under the last few presidents but Signal is obviously in the crosshairs.<p>I&#x27;m not mad at you. But I am frustrated that this obviously bad approach has support - of not dealing with root causes and material problems, but committing to suppression of beliefs on both the right and left that are obviously a reaction to those root causes.')
