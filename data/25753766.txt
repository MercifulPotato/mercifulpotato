Except what on <i>earth</i> are you doing with a dictionary whose keys are lists of dictionaries? I am quite sure someone has not modelled their domain correctly there. That&#x27;s not something you can blame on the existence of generics - I shudder to imagine how much worse it could have been <i>without</i> generics!')
