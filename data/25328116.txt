The chimaera infected human airway cells â€” proving that the surface protein of SHC014 has the necessary structure to bind to a key receptor on the cells and to infect them. It also caused disease in mice, but did not kill them.<p>Although almost all coronaviruses isolated from bats have not been able to bind to the key human receptor, SHC014 is not the first that can do so.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;engineered-bat-virus-stirs-debate-over-risky-research-%201.18787" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;engineered-bat-virus-stirs-debat...</a><p>Research continued in 2017 after NIH ended the moratorium: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nih.gov&#x2F;about-nih&#x2F;who-we-are&#x2F;nih-director&#x2F;statements&#x2F;nih-lifts-funding-pause-gain-function-research" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nih.gov&#x2F;about-nih&#x2F;who-we-are&#x2F;nih-director&#x2F;statem...</a><p>Interesting though that we don&#x27;t consider this sort of research the same way we look at nuclear proliferation, we sanction countries that develop nuclear programs we we don&#x27;t approve of but arguably pandemics are already much more deadly than nuclear technologies ever have been.')
