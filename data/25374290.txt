The fact that it runs on the JVM, gives it a nice foot in the door.<p>Ideally, it would be great if clojure replaced Python and Scala as the defacto language used to interact with Apache Spark. That&#x27;s probably not likely, though. It&#x27;s hard enough to get a lot of folks past spark&#x27;s weirdness without throwing a lisp into the mix. But it does seem like a functional JVM language that&#x27;s not Scala would be the optimal way to use spark.')
