Item(by='malloryerik', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607670214, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25380459, text='&gt; Food is a global market, water isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s easier to import food than water since it&#x27;s much lighter for the price.<p>Exactly. These futures are a local market much closer to weather futures than fungible markets like crude oil or soybeans or even natural gas to a lesser degree, exactly because it&#x27;s uneconomical to transport regular water over large distances. So these futures markets have little to tell us directly about anything other than local conditions in California. They allow local farmers to pass risk on to speculators who might feel they have a use for such risk.<p>Also, as long as these futures don&#x27;t get added to long-only exchange-traded funds, a futures market like this is likely to calm prices. That said, if commodity ETFs start adding eternally-rolled long positions, it seems reasonable to imagine the possibility of a distorting effect to the upside, especially during a commodity price boom, though if that could last or how it would effect the spot (physical) prices is another question.')
