Turncoats decide the fate of battles for a reason. The government cracks down hard on people like Snowden for a reason. These networks are only as secure as the weakest, and least loyal, link.<p>&gt; my gosh Boeing doesn&#x27;t just &#x27;patent and make public&#x27; their tech, they keep it very secret.<p>How secret can you keep an aircraft once it gets shot down? The Russians reverse engineered the B-29 [1] , the Americans reverse engineered the Hind [2], the Chinese reverse engineered the F-22 [3], in part using wreckage from an F-117:<p>&quot;On 27 March 1999, one of the US Air Forceâ€™s stealth bombers was shot down in the NATO raid of Yugoslavia during Operation Noble Anvil.<p>The wreckage was sent to China to study the stealth phenomenon except for the cockpit, which remains in a Belgrade museum.&quot;<p>&gt; Also - there&#x27;s tremendous &#x27;know how&#x27; in there, all the unspoken stuff, skill, knowledge that isn&#x27;t very well summarized in any kind of document.<p>Of course! It would take time to unravel this &quot;know how&quot; and get it documented. But the clues are there if you can afford to look. Almost every proprietary system can be documented and clean-room-reverse-engineered if you dedicate enough resources to it. Could a people&#x27;s army do this? Maybe not, but it&#x27;s not impossible either.<p>&gt; China in 2020 is still having a hard time making it&#x27;s own 5th gen jet engines, having to buy from Russia, though that may change.<p>I can guarantee you this project would advance much quicker if we were actually at a state of war, rather than peace with heightened tensions. These engines are not the end-all-be-all when compared to all their other priorities, but they could become a priority if war breaks out (obviously I hope it never does). When they do become a priority, history is on their side in terms of insurmountable odds beaten by skilled teams (see Manhattan Project, Have Blue, etc.)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tupolev_Tu-4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tupolev_Tu-4</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wearethemighty.com&#x2F;mighty-trending&#x2F;that-time-army-night-stalkers-stole-an-advanced-russian-helicopter" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wearethemighty.com&#x2F;mighty-trending&#x2F;that-time-arm...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theprint.in&#x2F;defence&#x2F;china-reverse-engineered-copied-technology-latest-j-20-fighter-jet&#x2F;37266&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theprint.in&#x2F;defence&#x2F;china-reverse-engineered-copied-...</a>')
