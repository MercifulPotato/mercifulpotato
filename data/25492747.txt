The laws date from a time when access to media was hard, and just getting your thing published was an impossible amount of work.  Now that we have social media, it&#x27;s not clear that we need the law to &quot;protect&quot; us here.  If someone writes a hit piece about you, can probably get more people to read your defense.  That&#x27;s new, and the laws haven&#x27;t been updated to account for that.<p>(Unlike more pressing issues facing society, this one doesn&#x27;t require spending money, or passing a Constitutional amendment, so it feels within reach!)')
