Now he occasionally complains that the network inside the network inside the network is annoying because it doesn&#x27;t play nicely with the network outside the network on top of the main network. Overall I feel the rate at which he talks about networking issues has increased, but his enthusiasm for talking about them has gone up, so I guess that&#x27;s a win.')
