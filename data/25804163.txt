Why? Who knows. I don&#x27;t really do politics on Twitter and certainly don&#x27;t post borderline content in general. I opened a support ticket and a follow-up one and it got cleared about a week later. Never found out a reason. I could probably have pulled strings if I had to but fortunately didn&#x27;t need to. But, yeah, you can just randomly lose access to things because some algorithm woke up on the wrong side of the bed.')
