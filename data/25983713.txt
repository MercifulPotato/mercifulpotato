Why not have e.g. generic gamepad support in Chrome and let developers write a driver for their devices as an extension ?<p>Now all you get is horrible fragmentation, your device may work on website A but not on website B, and maybe kinda work but very buggy on website C.<p>It’s a recipe for a shitty user experience. In practice you’ll see that only a handful of popular devices will be universally supported.')
