Item(by='segfaultbuserr', descendants=None, kids=[25089720, 25089788, 25089419], score=None, time=1605313700, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25088755, text='&gt; <i>Trying to replace that with a &quot;central brain&quot; inevitably leads to severe misallocation of resources.</i><p>Now the question is: If a conglomerate has a dominate position in a marketplace, doesn&#x27;t its administration face many of the same problems and challenges just like a central planner? In this situation, from a technical perspective, which are the similarities and differences here? Of course, one can answer, &quot;this is why we have anti-trust laws&quot;, or &quot;the free market still largely works, nobody can fully control an economic sector, even a conglomerate is bounded by the market&quot;. But it doesn&#x27;t respond to the real question. For example, if Amazon or Google is trying to use an algorithm to optimize something globally, intuitively, it seems that they are effectively solving the same type of economic calculation problem, albeit at a much smaller scale. I made this comment because I recently saw an essay that also uses the book <i>Red Plenty</i> as an example to argue that many attempts on &quot;AI&quot;, &quot;machine learning&quot; or &quot;big data&quot; by large corporations can potentially fall into the old central planning pitfalls.<p>What is your opinion?')
