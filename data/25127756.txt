Admittedly Android&#x27;s split screen mode is super clunky to use but if you&#x27;re not constantly switching between apps in the reference pane it&#x27;s okay.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Onyx_Boox&#x2F;comments&#x2F;jt41e1&#x2F;my_max_lumi_review_impressive_device_455_stars&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Onyx_Boox&#x2F;comments&#x2F;jt41e1&#x2F;my_max_lu...</a><p>Having a Laptop + ereader setup would probably be a mess to set up with the cut+paste stuff. If e-Ink reference materials is your use case I&#x27;d probably suggest instead that you either get one of the Boox models that has HDMI in (Max Lumi does) or if you have $ to spend, get the Dasung e-Ink monitor instead, and use it as a 2nd monitor for your laptop. That would be much easier to cut and paste between your coding environment and reference materials.<p>(Also, Boox tablets aren&#x27;t easily rootable so auto-inputting stuff into apps isn&#x27;t easy. You could solve that by building a virtual bluetooth or USB keyboard with an Arduino that your laptop controls, though.)')
