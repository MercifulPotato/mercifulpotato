The ability to copy is a feature, not a bug. Laws that limit the copying of data decrease the proliferation of that data in most cases.<p>&gt; A high tech society is imaginable in the absence of private property, but generally the abolition of private property is not considered as a serious option.<p>I see people mentioning it but I agree its considered to be somewhat fringe by most. A society without private property would likely devolve to subsistence level or recreate propertarian norms.')
