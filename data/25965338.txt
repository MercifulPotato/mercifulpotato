This reads as essentially false to my understanding.<p>No, it&#x27;s not false AFAIK :)<p>By &#x27;endpoint&#x27; I mean what an address on those networks actually *addresses*.<p>Both a Tor-address (a .onion hostname, or a regular web address if you use Tor to access one), and an I2P-address, are essentially similar to an IP-address in terms of being the address of a *machine*.<p>They are anonymized, but the data is routed to the very specific machine which the address is of.<p>A Freenet address on the other hand is the address of a *file* - basically a hash.<p>So in Tor and I2P, even though the machine behind the address is anonymous, you can still DoS it because you have the address of the specific machine where the data is at.<p>In Freenet, you cannot DoS the machine because the address does *not* tell the network where the file is stored. It only tells what file you get. Any machine on the network can serve the file to you!<p>And in fact, if you try to DoS a file by requesting it very frequently on Freenet, it will instead be distributed <i>MORE</i> on the network: Machines along the path where the data is routed will cache the file.<p>That&#x27;s what provides the censorship resistance.')
