To me, the interesting question is how the hiring manager got into their position.<p>Referring to the sports analogy of the previous comment: how do you become a sports team owner? Not by being great at sports, but simply by having a ton of spare money. And some pro sports team owners are really bad at running a sports team.<p>Most of us in the system are more or less fighting over table scraps. You can&#x27;t really measure a so-called meritocracy without looking carefully at those in positions of power. We seem to only focus on the lower levels of non-manager worker drone hiring.')
