It very well could be that there was a well-documented flag that you never learned.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re being unreasonable. I&#x27;d be cranky with any DB getting itself in a split-brain scenario, but my conclusion wouldn&#x27;t be a bug in the software but rather it&#x27;s a bug in my understanding. It&#x27;s worth noting that getting in this state should either be impossible, or it should be obvious about how it arrived at such a state with links to relevant documentation.<p>(There&#x27;s also little incentive to make it super easy to run in production on your own. They sell that as a service after all. It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if the product had invariants that assumed production-level configurations and that nobody&#x27;s tested with whatever configs ended up making it go nuts.)')
