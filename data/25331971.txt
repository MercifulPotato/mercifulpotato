Why is it hard to review something that changes both formatting and the code? In the example it is because the tooling is visualizing both kinds of changes in the same way. But there is no fundamental reason for why that needs to be the case.<p>The same applies to refactoring. It seems perfectly doable for a code review tool to detect code motion, and have differet treatment of the code that moved unchanged vs. the parts that were modified.')
