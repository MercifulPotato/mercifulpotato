If one defines top performer as you did, those who are &quot;more focused on big ideas such as the structurally important parts of the architecture&quot;, and you run the numbers, you&#x27;ll find most of these people will also be outliers in commit count.<p>This is true in just about every team I&#x27;ve worked in. And it makes sense too. The person who best understands the design would be the fastest to implement it. They can both do the design and implement 2&#x2F;3 of it in the time it takes the other engineer to grok the design and fumble through the other third.<p>Frankly, I think the role of &quot;design architect&quot; is make-believe. A project only has so much &quot;design work&quot; to be done, so the top dev isn&#x27;t going to be sitting around twiddling their thumbs through the implementation phase. Even people like Jeff Dean still write a ton of code, to my understanding.<p>What you describe in the second paragraph sounds like something that would occur only in a dysfunctional workplace.')
