Item(by='xahrepap', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605423306, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25098788, text='ever since the pandemic started, at work we&#x27;ve had a a chat channel for &quot;socializing&quot; with each other. One day someone posted a topic. Something like, &quot;Tell us about where you grew up&quot;. And the head of security immediately replied and said, &quot;let&#x27;s talk about something that isn&#x27;t a common security question&quot;.<p>I admit that I think that was 100% unnecessary, expecially in this situation, to put the kibosh on the conversation. But it made me realize how insane it is  that something that is a common &quot;get to know you&quot; type question (tell me about where you grew up? (street, school etc) Tell me about your parents? (maiden name)) are also a common &quot;security&quot; questions.<p>Also, side note. I NEVER use real answers to those questions. I treat it as an extra password and store it securely that way. No way I&#x27;m going to turn my mother&#x27;s maiden name (easily searchable if you know my full name) into a password!')
