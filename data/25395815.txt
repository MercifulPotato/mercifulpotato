Item(by='rayiner', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607750542, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25395782, text='&gt; All of this has already happened - keeping Trump and his supporters in &quot;mainstream sites&quot; did nothing to restore trust in elites, or mend the rift in media, so I&#x27;m not sure why it would suddenly work now that he&#x27;s finally being shown the door.<p>The media and elites just spent four years burning their credibility in an incinerator. (Which I think is a tremendously bad thing for America.) Imagine if, instead of spinning out a yarn about Trump being a Russian asset for two years and having to massively walk it back, they had kept their powder dry and responsibly reported on the bad things actually contained in the Mueller report. Do you think that maybe folks would be less willing to believe the outrageous things Trump is saying now?')
