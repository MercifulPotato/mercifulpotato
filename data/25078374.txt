If that were the case, almost all software would cost just pennies a month.<p>I’m not a fan of Stripe’s price increase for recurring plans either, and I think they could’ve communicated it better, but their pricing is far from unreasonable given the amount of research and engineering effort they put into the product that I don’t have to do myself.')
