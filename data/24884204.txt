Despite my original comment, I don&#x27;t think things are entirely pessimistic. There is a push towards open computing. As far as software goes, the open front is doing well. It&#x27;s hardware that worries me. Hardware is hard to do openly at a large scale it seems. Projects like purism and the pinephone stuff are a good start, but this is the direction I hope everything can start moving towards.<p>It does seem like a battle, for every open project you hear about, there&#x27;s 10 more proprietary giants pushing some new all inclusive platform, but I don&#x27;t think the war is lost or even close to being over.')
