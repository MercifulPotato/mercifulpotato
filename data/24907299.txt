The government actually tried to argue that they had to power to censor a book, even if that book had one line that they deemed to be advocating for a candidate [1]. Worse, the FEC standard was arbitrary and capricious. They censored an anti-Hillary documentary put out by a conservative group (Citizens United) but did nothing against Moore&#x27;s Fahrenheit 9&#x2F;11 (which was expressly put out to advocate against Bush).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Citizens_United_v._FEC#Arguments_before_the_Supreme_Court" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Citizens_United_v._FEC#Argumen...</a><p>&quot;During the original oral argument, Deputy Solicitor General Malcolm L.
