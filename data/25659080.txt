This scheme is part of how you convert illegitimate money (usually stolen CCs in the case of eCommerce) into cash.<p>why not just buy it from amazon directly? does ebay&#x2F;paypal have looser anti-fraud systems than amazon?<p>&gt;You set up a bank account and amazon seller account you control in someone else&#x27;s name. Then you use your stolen CCs to buy the &quot;book&quot; from yourself thereby converting credit card details into money in an account you control.<p>That doesn&#x27;t work because if you funnel a bunch of stolen credit card purchases into that account, it will quickly get flagged for an unusually high chargeback rate.')
