To take Taiwan, China needs to annex an entirely separate country. They can do that through soft influence (pretty sure everyone agrees that&#x27;s totally a failure), through economic means (Taiwan has been diversifying it&#x27;s economy so not sure how great that option is anymore), or militarily. Even if other countries were to stay out of it, it would extremely risky for China. They very well could fail. Comparing Taiwan to Hong Kong in this instance really is kind of ludicrous.')
