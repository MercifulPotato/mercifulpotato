If a CDN is critical to your site&#x27;s performance you should put your site on it not internal libraries here and external libraries there. The page mentions this as well:<p>&quot;Speed:<p>You probably shouldn’t be using multi-megabyte libraries. Have some respect for your users’ download limits. But if you are truly worried about speed, surely your whole site should be behind a CDN – not just a few JS libraries?&quot;<p>Also even before QUIC HTTP&#x2F;2 fixed a lot of the problems with distance as you no longer need to wait for separate handshakes for multiple files to be streamed. QUIC will still give a few advantages but again those advantages would be good to have on your whole site not just a few libraries.')
