There are companies that can afford to pay you for each and every extra hour of on-call, but they won&#x27;t necessarily look for you well-being. Having extra time off sounds nice, but on the other hand it will affect the other stuff that you usually have to do at your job.<p>I was hit by on-call duty pretty hard at some point in my career. I was sleep deprived and was not able to execute on my regular tasks. This also lead me depression and increased my anxiety. Even though I&#x27;ve started to work on my issues with therapist, I was not able to recover and was let go.<p>Remember about taking care of yourself.')
