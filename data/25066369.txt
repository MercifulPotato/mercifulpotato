The best resource I found was something provided by my local university called &quot;Mathercize&quot; (may just be something specific to them), which gave you a range of problems you could complete online, with a brief run-down of the theory on how to solve them. It was positioned as a &quot;refresher&quot; on maths for those doing college-level study, and in my case the problem sets were designed for MBA students.<p>Maybe looking around for these kinds of refreshers rather than discrete textbooks in their own right is your best bet? I know that I encountered analysis paralysis when trying to re-learn &quot;everything&quot; from the ground up, and got nowhere as the information wasn&#x27;t curated enough for my needs.<p>Barring this, I found the &quot;MathIsFun&quot; to be the best all-round resource for grokking foreign math concepts.')
