However, I suspect that the reason it uses dissolved dried peppers is because that&#x27;s the easiest way to do it, as the capsaicin would dissolve into solution and be measurable that way.  I&#x27;m not seeing how you could as easily measure the capsaicin content in a fresh chile pepper; you&#x27;re not gonna get the capsaicin to go into concentration so that eliminates most of the typical measuring methods.<p>Separately, I do suspect that a lot of the serious gardeners growing chile peppers are already drying chiles anyway, as you get a lot more in a harvest than you&#x27;d want to eat immediately and the dried form stores and travels better.  You can air dry them, oven dry them, use a dehydrator, etc.  So I think the biggest problem here is the time lag before being able to make the measurement, depending on your drying method.')
