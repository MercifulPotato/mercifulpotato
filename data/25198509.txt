Look at your local antivaxx FB group, they think Wakefield is authoritative.<p>I blame the education system. There&#x27;s way too much specific knowledge that you will be tested on, and barely any theory of knowledge or scientific method fundamentals. And in the end, you will forget the silly quiz questions, leaving you with just the principles, if you were so lucky.<p>It would have been nice to have a general survey as well. &quot;Not gonna quiz you on it, but FYI apart from the classic subjects that you are learning, there are also things like geology, materials science, a huge array of mathematical things, and so on. Just so you don&#x27;t think that we had enough time at school to teach you everything.&quot;')
