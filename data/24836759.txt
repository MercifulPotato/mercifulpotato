I heard living wage in the bay area is &gt; 100K USD.<p>I&#x27;m not advocating for anything and have no stake. But all these statistics are proxies for how citizens are doing. In general, hardships increase as unemployment goes up, whatever way you measure it. It&#x27;s usually better to look at all of them jointly, and focus on differences instead of the absolute rates of a statistic.')
