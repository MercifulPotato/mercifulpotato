The code school route has a pretty hard glass ceiling.<p>I&#x27;m glad I took graduate coursework in advanced algorithms, signal processing, control systems, AI, etc. which followed on a course of differential equations, advanced linear algebra, probability, and so on.<p>There is a difference in computer science curricula, with more than a little bit of correlation with which tier school you go to. Without a solid theoretical background, you can become a decent engineer building a database-backed web application, but there&#x27;s a world of possibilities closed off to you.<p>And those aren&#x27;t skills you&#x27;ll pick up on the job. If you&#x27;re super-self-motivated, MOOCs and similar can do it, but I&#x27;ve found few adults able to invest the time to learn skills which don&#x27;t have a pay-off for years. Differential equations or linear algebra aren&#x27;t very helpful in isolation; it&#x27;s the application which build on top of them which add value. That&#x27;s a few semesters of study.')
