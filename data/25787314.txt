Working title is &quot;Building an OS on an FPGA: First Gate to Self-Hosted Compiler&quot;. I&#x27;m very early in, but realized I had all this knowledge from these different architecture levels and haven&#x27;t tied it altogether to see what I&#x27;m missing... So I started to try and find out by doing it.<p>Been documenting my process and the evolutions of complexity and considerations in a way to put together a book like <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;craftinginterpreters.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;craftinginterpreters.com&#x2F;</a>. Kinda hoping I can it to a point where you could implement the second section byte code machine entirely in a compiler you built... for the OS you built... for the CPU SoC you built... on a FPGA.')
