Game is fine to play, collision bugs &amp; other graphic related bugs are issues that should be resolved. The game is not unplayable, the universe is well designed, story enjoyable BUT bug are common and I cant imagine playing on a base PS4. My experience with the pro is probably my lowest acceptable limit to play a game.')
