And really easy to keep ramping up your dose as your body adjusts.<p>If you just want to _reduce_ your caffeine intake, I found that the easiest way is to pre-mix different ratios of regular and decaf in a container and use that. You can make 50:50 or 25:75 regular:decaf and easily taper off your intake (especially towards the afternoon&#x2F;evening) while still enjoying a nice cup of coffee :)')
