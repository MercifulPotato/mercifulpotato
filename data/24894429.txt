Item(by='bartread', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603706445, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24891125, text='&gt; Amiga is still wrestling with that. There are &quot;classic&quot; fans who thought the 1980s A500 was cool, but unfortunately there are still a loud contingent who are sure that somehow Amiga is the future, and this makes them easy victims for a long parade of hucksters and charlatans.<p>I think there&#x27;s more to it than that. I want to push beyond the base A500 (in fact I don&#x27;t even own one of those at present, even though that was the machine I had back in the day), preferring instead the A1200, but don&#x27;t in any way see Amiga or AmigaOS as &quot;the future&quot;.<p>This manifests as a (very slow) mission to build what would have been my ultimate Amiga circa 1992. So, yes, I&#x27;m adding a 68030 accelerator board with a 68882 FPU, and I&#x27;m taking advantage of modern conveniences like Flash storage, but fundamentally I&#x27;m not departing too much.<p>I may add an FPGA accelerator at some point but, with that, it feels like you can quickly stray into &quot;Is it even an Amiga any more?&quot; territory.')
