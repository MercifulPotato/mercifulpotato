(Price anchoring, premium pricing, skimming pricing, are all just &#x27;high-price rip-offs&#x27; applied practically).<p>Yes, it still <i>occasionally</i> happens, but the days of &quot;a high price probably means better time&#x2F;materials&#x2F;quality&quot; are long gone. 9 times out of 10, the high price product is <i>identical</i> to the cheap price one, and the higher price is explicitly just a ripoff.')
