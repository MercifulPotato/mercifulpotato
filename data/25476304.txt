Their naming scheme seems irrelevant.<p>Almost all modern memory is built in a large matrix where the upper bits select the row into a buffer and the lower bits control a multiplexer that selects a slice of that row. Scanning incrementally through the memory will hit the fast multiplexer path and result in much faster access.<p>Propagating into the whole matrix at each increment is not only a  power draw but a massive slowdown.')
