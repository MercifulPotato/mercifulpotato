Last two years I&#x27;ve been using x1 carbon gen3 released in 2017 so it&#x27;s not so far from current-gen Intel laptops.<p>Yeah Air on M1 cannot beat triple 1440p 164HZ monitor setup with high end desktop hardware, but it&#x27;s still damn impressive. It&#x27;s has slightly better 16:10 screen, more performance than any of current x1 thinkpads and Air that I bought is absolutely silent too.<p>Also might be in the US you have comparable prices on Thinkpad or some Linux-friendly laptops, but where I live I bought Macbook for 2&#x2F;3 of comparable Thinkpad price. I&#x27;ve used to buy used ones, but now they became much more expensive due to high demand and much less of air travel (less smugling I guess).')
