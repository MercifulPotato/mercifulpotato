Item(by='hhw', descendants=None, kids=[24945805], score=None, time=1604080146, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24943695, text='My claim was that the site pushes a blatantly false narrative, not that science is a popularity contest.<p>This paper you&#x27;ve cited supposedly showing positive results is a preprint and has not been published yet, which suggests it hasn&#x27;t satisfied the peer review process in whichever journal it is intended to be published in. The study was also suspended partway through so it&#x27;s unlikely it&#x27;ll ever be completed. I don&#x27;t entirely disagree that science is a pure numbers game (only papers that stand up to peer review, not only from the journal but from the wider scientific community are worth consideration), but you&#x27;re undermining your own argument with this poor selection of a paper. If it does eventually end up published, and doesn&#x27;t have too many glaring issues with its methodology pointed out (some of which are already indicated in the comments on medrxiv), it may be worth mentioning in the future but it certainly isn&#x27;t right now. And the existence of this paper doesn&#x27;t make the site&#x27;s analysis any less dishonest. Suggesting 100% of papers of some particularly category when only one (in actuality none) exist is clearly wrong, and intentionally misleading if not dishonest.<p>I also don&#x27;t entirely agree that numbers don&#x27;t matter. Given a set of papers that are published, properly peer reviewed, and don&#x27;t have any glaring issues with their methodology, it certainly matters if the vast majority demonstrate something while a tiny number suggest something else. This would indicate that tiny number are outliers, and may have had some problems that weren&#x27;t immediately obvious. Otherwise, their results would have been reproducable which is a key indication of the validity of their empirical data.<p>There are also other, better studies that show negative results or no benefit. Why did you pick this particular one?')
