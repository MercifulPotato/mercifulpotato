There are very few places where natural landscape allows it, and making more artificial ones would require flooding <i>vast</i> areas. Considering how difficult it often is to build solar plants on deserts (e.g. consider Ivanpah solar plant, which almost did not get build due to its impact on habitat of desert tortoises, which ended up getting relocated at a cost of $300k each), I don&#x27;t expect the green interest groups to accept such wholesale destruction of environments.')
