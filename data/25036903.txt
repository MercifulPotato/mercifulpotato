My neighbour&#x27;s work permit was stuck in limbo pre-covid. On my advice, she contacted our Liberal party MP, and although the MP signed off on a letter asking for it to be expedited, IRCC basically told her to pound sand. It still took an unreasonably long time to arrive, pretty much what they guaranteed.<p>I still think it would have been worse without the letter, and at least it helped my neighbour&#x27;s spirits. She comes from a part of the world where nothing happens without a bribe, and even then it ain&#x27;t very effective.')
