Now that anybody can reach anyone with any information, bad actors use these techniques to control people to their advantage. Governments&#x27; are now in an awkward position - ramp up education in these areas and forever give up a tool that worked for ages, or censor the information in hope that bad actors will not influence the public. It seems like governments still want to manipulate people, so censorship in their mind is the only way out of this. \nUnfortunately it is like having an aching tooth and taking pain killers hoping it will pass instead of going to dentist.\nMy only hope that in the end this will make politics more honest and people will learn how they are being exploited. \nI don&#x27;t accept that someone should have a power over what I can or cannot read and preventing me from forming my own opinions.')
