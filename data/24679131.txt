If so, how much? I absolutely love gaming, but I can really lose myself in it, and also sometimes think about what I could do if I would spend these hours on for example learning (I&#x27;m a web dev). Sometimes I think about quitting gaming entirely and spending that time on programming projects&#x2F;learning entirely for fun. At the same time I like gaming, but I have a hard time not getting immersed in it.')
