Item(by='dang', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602806771, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24782881, text='I don&#x27;t want to ban you! I&#x27;d rather try to persuade you to make your points without sharp elbows. It may be that others are also doing bad things (for example, I can see how <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24772044" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24772044</a> was a provocation) - but that it doesn&#x27;t make it ok to escalate; we just get a downward spiral that way. Rather, we each need to spend the energy and time needed <i>not</i> to escalate, which brings capacity to respond neutrally with good points. Then you strengthen the commons rather than damaging it—and as a bonus, your comments become more persuasive to others.<p>&quot;Free speech&quot; means different things to different people and depending on what one wants, there are different tradeoffs. On HN, we&#x27;re trying to optimize for <i>interesting</i> speech, i.e. curious conversation: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=curiosity%20optimiz%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=curiosity%20optimiz%20by:dang&amp;...</a>  That means we have to moderate people away from being nasty to each other. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s &quot;intolerance of free speech&quot;, because HN&#x27;s guidelines leave lots of room for arguing most views.<p>pg had a much lower threshold for banning people than we do, btw.<p>If you&#x27;re not persuaded, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24620683" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24620683</a> is an explanation I wrote recently which makes the same points I&#x27;m trying to make here and gives more examples. It also links to other comments on the same. The point is that smart people often come here with a combative model of how to do intellectual discussion that actually works well in smaller, more cohesive communities. The reason we don&#x27;t allow it here is not because we think it&#x27;s bad in itself, but because it doesn&#x27;t translate well into HN&#x27;s context—here it&#x27;s just a recipe for tedious flamewar.')
