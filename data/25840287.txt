Now that it&#x27;s time for the powers that be to punish the red tribe, the blue tribe is all too happy to join in the authoritarianism - eg feigning outrage at the <i>gallows</i> (ignoring the <i>guillotine</i> symbolism of the past year), assertions that speech <i>must</i> be policed, and calls to take right-wing terrorism &quot;seriously&quot; (meaning attack red tribe protests with the same zeal as blue tribe protests).<p>Really, the government is demonstrably out of control from its charter, the economy has been coopted by the bankers, the deep state is a thing (for better and for worse), and the ruling class gives no shits about We The People. When asked in the <i>right way</i>, grassroots of both tribes seem to agree on these things! But rather than having any consensus, the division is stoked by journalist clickbaiters and other political hacks.<p>The tech angle is how such nonsensical propaganda took over the red tribe so strongly - why they went &quot;full retard&quot; with the covid self harm and election theft hoax, well past the expected fomented-division of hating on BLM and &quot;antifa&quot; bogeyman. Some of that is surely due to the charismatic conman figurehead, but not all.')
