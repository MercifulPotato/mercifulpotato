Item(by='dghlsakjg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610386095, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25729810, text='I make a small specialty electronic device that is optimized for size and weight. Its a side hustle, so I do it just to break even.<p>It consists of three parts: a 2-piece plastic case, and a single circuit board with around 25 smt components. The user can replace the battery.<p>I&#x27;m not going to publish my schematic or board design because I already open sourced my code, and the device is designed to be stupidly easy to manufacture for my own sake. Basically I don&#x27;t want people to start making their own. A competent EE could figure it out in a day or two, but a anyone with that ability could design their own in the same amount of time.<p>If something on the board goes bad, I&#x27;m not going to offer guidance to repair it. It isn&#x27;t worth anyone&#x27;s time. That said, I do offer a lifetime warranty&#x2F;buyback option since the unit cost is less than $10.<p>This is a bit of a contrived example since there is literally only one part that can fail, but the point is that there is a very fuzzy line around how far we can go with repairability. Should I be forced to provide a full schematic&#x2F;board design (giving away my IP essentially)? Should I be forced to provide &#x27;parts&#x27; (there is really only one part, and that is the product itself)?<p>I&#x27;m sympathetic to the &#x27;right to repair&#x27; movement, but I&#x27;m curious how it would be implemented across such a broad spectrum of products. Perhaps it could just be a transparency rule: planned obsolescence (unrepairable) items should be marked as such and an e-waste tax added. If you want to avoid that marking you have to offer to trade broken  parts for new for 5 years after first sale at cost.')
