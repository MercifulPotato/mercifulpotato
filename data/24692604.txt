Then you need to add an S3 bucket and dynamo db table.  Most people would just drop a bucket icon outside of the VPC and label it...maybe dynamodb sits inside the region box and s3 kind of straddles it.  Good enough conceptually to talk through the design.<p>Now imagine you want to automate the process of generating that view (or the associated resource graph) automatically.  That&#x27;s where it gets tricky.  Tons of service-specific rules start to come into play.  Kind of a mess.')
