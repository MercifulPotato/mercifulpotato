GFS indeed uses erasure coding with a 1.5x factor, but erasure coding alone does not guarantee durability, and thus needs to be combined with replication to satisfy that requirement, and erasure coding is not the same thing as replication.<p>The innovation here is explicitly the combination of a new erasure coding algorithm (LRC) AND replication, with a <i>combined storage amplification</i> that is much lower than the previous SOTA.<p>The paper explicitly compares the new algorithm (LRC) with GFS and other alternatives, and explains why it&#x27;s better, so this is really not something that is comparable to the 2003 GFS paper in any way (or to any other prior art really), as this is not just a trivial application of erasure coding in a storage system.<p>There&#x27;s also this paper [0] from 2001 which digs a bit deeper into the Erasure Codes vs Replication idea that I can recommend if you&#x27;re interested<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fireless.cs.cornell.edu&#x2F;publications&#x2F;erasure_iptps.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fireless.cs.cornell.edu&#x2F;publications&#x2F;erasure_iptps.pd...</a>')
