Played with my group in the last months: Photosynthesis, Zombicide, Catan, Sheriff, Azul and Splendor.\nThere&#x27;s def a learning curve and some people suffer a bit, but overall now that everybody can use TAB to indicate something on the board, take single card vs all cards on deck, hand mechanics, blindfold, etc, it&#x27;s all very smooth. My brother is not having the best time because he&#x27;s on a mac with a single button mouse (?) but apart from that it&#x27;s alright for everybody.\nWe bought packs of 4 with good prices and everybody is very satisfied.
