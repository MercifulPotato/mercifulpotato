CoCs are designed with the express purpose of letting you know that you will be punished if you do or say anything that the leader&#x27;s deem unacceptable, and to be used as the basis for persecuting and punishing you if you still fail to fall in line and comply with the leadership&#x27;s will.<p>Hell, you don&#x27;t need to communicate to anyone that they can and will be safe. Either that&#x27;s already implied, or means nothing if you don&#x27;t plan to act on it. In fact, it&#x27;s patently wrong that the goal is safety. It is not. The goal is compliance and submissiveness.')
