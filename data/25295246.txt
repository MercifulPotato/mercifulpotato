In fact we&#x27;ve already taken material from asteroids and returned it to Earth. The only question is how long it will take for the technology to advance enough for profitability; there are no fundamental issues preventing it. It really seems inevitable assuming no civilization-ending disasters. And it can increase Earth&#x27;s gold supply arbitrarily up to many times the current supply. And it only takes one company to do it. Anyway, if our only disagreement is on the relative feasibility of changing Bitcoin consensus vs. asteroid mining, I&#x27;m happy to continue to disagree with you on that.')
