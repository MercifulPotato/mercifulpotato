He doesn’t have any proof other than a burner account created today.<p>If it is factual, I agree, have the discussion about addiction. But is it too much to ask to either have the conversation openly (and not in an anonymous comment full of judgment and borderline glee that a person is dead), and not in gossip-laden comments hours after the guy is dead?
