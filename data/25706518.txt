The goal I set myself is <i>consistency</i> of doing <i>any exercise</i>, this builds, eventually, habits and over time you can gradually increase the quality&#x2F;amount&#x2F;whatever.<p>There is a huge variation in people&#x27;s physical capacity as well as &#x27;motivation&#x27; - find out what works for <i>your</i> body by trying different things and finding out what you can do consistently.
