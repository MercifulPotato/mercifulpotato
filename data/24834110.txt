As long as you don&#x27;t pay any attention to the drastically different life between the call center folks, and the engineering department, and can somehow shove the resulting cognitive dissonance out of your head, you should be fine.<p>If you can&#x27;t do any of those things... Just stay away... Which is easier said than done, seeing as every tech business eventually evolves toward fintech at some point.')
