Any ideas? […] The reason is that I use NordVPN to connect to the internet.</i><p>That is weird. Are you confident NordVPN caused the problem?<p>I ask because I also have a NordVPN subscription. I have it for more than a year now. I keep it running 24&#x2F;7 and switch countries every 2-3 days. I visit all the major websites, and I have never had significant problems with my accounts. Google Search is probably the only website (that I remember) that blocks NordVPN IP addresses, but I connect to a different server and reload the page to continue.<p>When I switch between NordVPN servers, I do it across countries. For example, I browse the Internet for a couple of hours from France and then switch to a Japan server. It is impossible to travel between France and Japan in less than 5 minutes, so, Outlook —among other companies— flag these connections as highly suspicious. However, aside from a security alert, I have never had any problems connecting to my online accounts. Even my banks are cool with NordVPN.<p>I am not saying NordVPN was not the cause of your problems. Anything is possible.<p>It would help me, though, to know what server(s) you selected to avoid connecting to them.<p>You can find them in the NordVPN connection history or system logs.<p>I hope you recover access to your account. Thanks in advance.')
