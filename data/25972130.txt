How did they contribute to generating that wealth? From where does the wealth come from that they are profiting from?<p>Now some of that wealth goes to hedge funds and workers see some of it in their 401(K) and what not. But if the alternative is that non of these people that invested in Amazon got extremely wealthy from it... They just got their investment’s worth and a little extra (like a proper loan would). And the wealth generated by Amazon would stay within the company, let’s be a little ideological here and imagine that this wealth would actually be used to pay workers what they deserve. Don’t you think the workers would get more from that deal, perhaps they could use that extra money to open up a saving account, perhaps they could pay it in social security.<p>Anyways I really don’t see in what possible world the existence of the stock market can benefit workers. It just does not seem to work out mathematically.<p>To use the Occam’s razor here... If you have to invent epicycles to explain your case, perhaps the simpler explanation is true. This stock market + 401(K) + hedgefuns + etc. seems to me just to be a bunch of epicycles, and money is actually simply being siphoned away from the value generated by the workers into rich folks that use the stock market for that endeavor.<p>I see two possibilities here:<p>a) The stock market is a predatory lending scheme<p>b) The stock market is a pyramid scheme<p>Either way the stock market should crash and burn')
