Friendly language is becoming common in corporate emails.<p>“Also, why does your employer need you to fill out any forms about your location - they know where you are.”<p>They very often do, because things aren’t wired together within the company - and because many schemes are administered by a third party. Filling out forms with details that ‘the company knows’ is commonplace.<p>Companies even add ‘Warning: External email’ to subject lines of emails from outside the company, but then fail to whitelist trusted third parties, so employees get used to flagged emails actually being legitimate ... and then getting used to ignoring the warnings.')
