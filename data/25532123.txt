I was sick and tired of the same broken mechanics that come with your typical AAA open world game, and thought it would do the Zelda universe a massive disservice.<p>And then I played it and holy hot damn was I wrong, I think it will go down as one of my favorites of all time. So so so well executed, the world never once felt empty and pointless, as was one of my main issue with other attempts at open world. Just an amazing title.')
