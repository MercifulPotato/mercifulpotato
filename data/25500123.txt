Item(by='WorldMaker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608587956, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25487881, text='&gt; Not to mention that main story missions that consist in driving somewhere, going through a badly written dialog tree, just so you can wait to do it all over again is BAD WRITING.<p>That&#x27;s pretty diegetic though: in the real world you wouldn&#x27;t expect everything to be placed right next to each other or that things would happen immediately after without time to research&#x2F;track down leads&#x2F;prepare&#x2F;sleep on it&#x2F;whatever.<p>The game tries to make up for it by offering outs: The skip time button prominently in the menu. The Wait Zones immediately outside most mission start locations which skip immediately forward to start the mission. (It took a bit to get used to finding these, there probably should have been a tutorial for it: they have a clock icon for their interaction and usually are chairs&#x2F;benches to sit on or walls to lean on nearby to where the objective marker is. But they existed for every mission I encountered after learning to look for them.) Even the fast travel is something that is easy to overlook. As much as I enjoyed driving, the game was much better realizing that Fast Travel and walking&#x2F;sprinting everywhere was generally faster and way more convenient than driving anywhere. (Which is an almost an ironic statement of the importance of public transportation in an urban environment.)')
