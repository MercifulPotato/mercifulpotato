It gives customer a clear overview of how many products there are and customer can also navigate faster to get a better understanding of what general prices are. If the table&#x2F;list doesn&#x27;t have good filters, customer can find what they are looking for faster too. Same with highscores, forums threads and other similar things. Say you are browsing highscores and you want to see what scores are around 10000th position etc.<p>As a user I find having only prev&#x2F;next buttons a bit claustrophobic in this case. I think UX should trump whatever performance gains there are from it.')
