Item(by='S_A_P', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604883431, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25029760, text='I think the main intent was to reduce the volume of the cylinder deactivation cycle(it does drone a bit in 4 cyl mode) but it rarely activates that mode unless I put it in &quot;Eco mode&quot;. I would use that if it didnt also remap the throttle response to be so lazy. It adds what feels a few seconds latency to the pedal response.<p>I can say without a doubt that having bypassed it completely has had little to no audible effect. My Jeep came from the factory with a loud exhaust(is a Grand Cherokee SRT- so no off road intent in this vehicle) and I kind of like the way it sounds(though it isnt really <i>that</i> loud tbh)')
