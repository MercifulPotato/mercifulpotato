Check the datasheet:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hoperf.com&#x2F;modules&#x2F;lora&#x2F;RFM95.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hoperf.com&#x2F;modules&#x2F;lora&#x2F;RFM95.html</a><p>They advertise bit rates of up to 300kbps, but that doesn&#x27;t tell the whole story. If you look under the LoRa modem section, you&#x27;ll see that the actual data rate for that kind of modulation tops out at a little less than 10kbps with a high bandwidth and low spreading factor.<p>LoRA is also susceptible to interference. If two packets collide, the CRC will fail and all of the transmitters will need to back off and try again. And usually, higher bandwidth means fewer channels running in parallel.<p>So you might be able to get 1-10kbps between two nearby transceivers, but that probably wouldn&#x27;t scale well to a mesh network and it&#x27;s already very slow.<p>It seems like a good technology for pagers and intermittent text messengers, but a full-fledged network with streaming and file-serving seems like a stretch.')
