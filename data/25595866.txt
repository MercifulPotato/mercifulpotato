But there is potentially a lot we can do (at various levels of cost) to prevent the emission of one ton of CO2 in any future year <i>and the consequences of that additional emission may be disproportionately worse</i>. Your own post acknowledges this, and itâ€™s very much the point of the GP poster.')
