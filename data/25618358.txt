As part of my job I flip between C# and F# often and with each new release of Rider the IDE-support gap between them is closing. Obviously C# has many more years of attention and work on its tooling, but there are very few things I yearn for when editing F# code nowadays. I also find Rider far better to use than VS Code for F#, simply because I’m so comfortable with JetBrains’s IDEs now.<p>2. Any time I have to model anything remotely complex in C# I always wish I was doing it in F# instead. Features like discriminated unions, exhaustive pattern matching and immutability-by-default immediately spring to mind.')
