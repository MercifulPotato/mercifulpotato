That may have been the first year he wasn&#x27;t helping <i>lead</i> part of the workshop, but he was still keeping an eye on things and talking with students. He was -- as the name of the center tells you -- a champion of the idea that science fiction was literature worthy of academic study, which was a pretty controversial take in the humanities for a long time (and still is in some quarters, I suspect). I still refer to some of the material he wrote for that workshop, too.')
