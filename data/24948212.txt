No doctor has been able to help, some doctors want me to do PT, some want me to do chiro, none helped. Some doctors don&#x27;t want me to do X-rays, some are OK with it, after some X-rays some say I have an inverted vertebra, some say that I don&#x27;t. At this point I have learned to understand that no doctors understand back pain, and that unless I&#x27;m willing to pay top money for high-end hospitals, I&#x27;ll probably live all my life in pain until it gets so bad I&#x27;ll end up killing myself or something. Well we&#x27;ll see...<p>What seems to work for me sometimes: jogging and deep breathing.')
