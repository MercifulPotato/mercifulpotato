Just because you set up a false choice of &quot;you&#x27;re with me or against me&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean the rest of us have to play your game. Yes there is such a thing as leaving politics out of the workplace.<p>&gt;Talking about politics provides no liability to Google.<p>I don&#x27;t know about that.
