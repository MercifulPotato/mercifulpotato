The first one explicitly says that antibody-dependent enhancement has not been observed for this virus:<p>&gt; There is no evidence that ADE facilitates the spread of SARS-CoV in infected hosts. In fact, infection of macrophages through ADE does not result in productive viral replication and shedding<p>&quot;suboptimal antibody responses&quot; are indeed...suboptimal...but the paper here is not showing that. As the OP noted, the concerning result is limited to a few examples of monoclonal antibodies. The human immune response is much more complicated.')
