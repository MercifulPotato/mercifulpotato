It&#x27;s &#x27;not illegal&#x27; in the sense that as long as you don&#x27;t admit you did it, there&#x27;s really no way to prove it and there&#x27;s no legal framework for prosecuting you anyway. Lawyers call it &#x27;disclosure timing&#x27; and it&#x27;s one of those often-whispered-about loopholes for the rich.<p>No one admits to disclosure timing, but we all know that it is happening. We know this because on average trades made under 10b5-1 plans get better returns than trades not made under those plans. [1]<p>The law is full of ways for rich people to get richer if they have good lawyers. This is one of them. There&#x27;s not much incentive to change it either - it is hard to prove, it is complex to explain to the public, and the kinds of people that benefit from it are the kinds of people in power.<p>One of the suggested routes to make the market more fair is to require those with 10b5-1 plans to make their scheduled trade dates public. This would at least give the market at way to guess at disclosure timing too. But again, there&#x27;s no real political incentive to do this right now.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu&#x2F;2016&#x2F;03&#x2F;30&#x2F;the-legality-of-opportunistically-timing-public-company-disclosures-in-the-context-of-sec-rule-10b5-1&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu&#x2F;2016&#x2F;03&#x2F;30&#x2F;the-legality-...</a><p>NB: I&#x27;m not a lawyer, so obviously don&#x27;t do anything based on this dumb internet comment.')
