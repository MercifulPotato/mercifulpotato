But people don&#x27;t want to discuss blockers (or don&#x27;t want to discuss at all), or don&#x27;t identify something as a blocker, or would like to solve it themselves, or want to &quot;protect the team&quot; from this information, or think they&#x27;ll get it resolved sooner without extra communication, or expect that they&#x27;ll disagree on the course of action, or feel ashamed of having this blocker, or any other reason out of a hundred.<p>They won&#x27;t rationally formulate it like I did just above, but it&#x27;s just what people do: they get biased and their brain doesn&#x27;t take the most rational course of action. A personal bias: I tend to prefer solving uncertainties by writing more code than talking to people. This is a stupid thing to do and I actively fight against it, but the fact is that I naturally tend to favour the &quot;code&quot; approach to the &quot;communication&quot; approach: standup forces to surface the problem and people can challenge me.')
