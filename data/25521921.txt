Here&#x27;s a useful radio programme that goes through what happened: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;programmes&#x2F;m000jf7j" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;programmes&#x2F;m000jf7j</a><p>Bob works as a postmaster running a small local post office. Bob must use software provided to him by The Post Office. That software is faulty. One of the errors is that it reports more money present in Bob&#x27;s office than there actually is.  Bob contacts his superiors who tell him that no-one else is having a problem (this is a lie, other people are having the same problem and they know this) and that the software is correct. They give Bob a choice: supply the missing funds or deal with the police.  Bob is acting in good faith and he assumes this is a simple mistake that&#x27;ll get sorted out, so he supplies the missing money from his own funds, and keeps telling his superiors to fix it. Eventually, Bob runs out of money (or, maybe, he says &quot;get the police involved&quot;.) So, the police arrest Bob (because we have a low threshold for arrest over here) and interview Bob under caution. Police are told by Post Office that the software is reliable, and that Bob is lying. Police aggressively question Bob. It goes to court. Bob is convicted.<p>Because this is what happened to hundreds of people.<p>What&#x27;s Bob supposed to do? Ask the Post Office to supply the source code so he can have a look for bugs?')
