Linux runs on more architectures than Windows. Linux supports a wider range of machine specs than Windows does. There has never been an operating system in human history having hardware support as vast Linux. The television in your living room might be running Linux. Your refrigerator might be running Linux. Your car might be running Linux. Linux is everywhere.<p>When it comes to hardware support for laptops, the choice of distro is important. Enterprise linux distros ship with ancient kernels and you do not want to install that on a laptop.<p>Most hardware compatibility issues come from WiFi cards, and there are solutions for that other than looking for a driver and installing it manually. You can tether WiFi from your phone, or you can get a USB WiFi adapter for like $5 on Amazon.')
