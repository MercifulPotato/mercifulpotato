If the code couldn&#x27;t be added without paying the owner a sum of money and receiving a licence in return (i.e. something that would have to be archived and looked after), then it all gets more difficult. Budgets have to be allocated, spending authorised, receipts processed, etc. This would require approval from authority, and they would want assurances frrom the supplier that the code is well-maintained, does what it says it does, etc. Someone would have to review the code, and that costs time and more money. They might even have to review multiple alternatives to ensure that the project selected is the right project. At this point commercial suppliers get invited into the room, who send professional salesfolk to a meeting with management, and the whole ball game changes.<p>This isn&#x27;t &quot;management bullshit&quot;. It&#x27;s what <i>should</i> happen in a well-run organisation with a good procurement process.<p>If you want to sell your software, that&#x27;s the game you play, and you better hite professional salesfolk to get your cash. If you don&#x27;t want to play that game, then give it away for free. But don&#x27;t whine later that it created &quot;millions in value&quot; and you didn&#x27;t get any of that.')
