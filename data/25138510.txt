The only audible notifications that I get are phone, text and a couple of other messaging apps that I barely use (I&#x27;m talking one message per month per app). I get visual notifications for my personal email. Contrary to many people apparently, I also view texting as an asynchronous activity; I don&#x27;t fee any urge to view and reply instantly to texts.')
