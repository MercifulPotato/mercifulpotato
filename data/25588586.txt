I&#x27;ve looked up some of the &quot;science&quot; behind these devices [0], even read through a number of the readily available controlled studies that assert a plethora of health benefits from these devices.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m relatively convinced the positive effects I&#x27;m seeing are completely placebo or just because I&#x27;m sitting in front of a warming bright light for ten minutes each morning.<p>What are your thoughts?<p>0 - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;platinumtherapylights.com&#x2F;')
