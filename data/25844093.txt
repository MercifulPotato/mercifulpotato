Item(by='alkonaut', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611132633, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25837579, text='&gt; The idea that a fledgling social media company needs a moderation effort akin to Facebook in order to be allowed to even exist seems very anti-competitive to me<p>Moderation seems to be an activity that can scale linearly with users (content). So if you have 1&#x2F;1000 the user base then you have roughly 1&#x2F;1000 the moderation effort.<p>Of all the barriers to entry in the social \n media market, moderation seems like the smallest one because it doesn&#x27;t scale as well as other activities such as operation costs, development staff , and so on.<p>Of course, if you start a social media company with the intent to be a haven for content that &quot;takes a lot of moderation effort&quot; then obviously you are setting yourself up for a situation where it&#x27;s difficult to compete. If you need 10x the number of moderation actions as facebook or twitter, then you have 10x the cost too.')
