As a foreigner, I&#x27;d mention that he did not start any new wars around the globe, the first U.S. president since... Carter, I guess? I wasn&#x27;t even alive back then. But this is offtopic.<p>Also, fascism is one of those words which lost its meaning. Every person has their own definition of it, the only common denominator (usually) being &quot;something I don&#x27;t like and neither should you&quot;. For constructive conversation it&#x27;s better to avoid this word, I believe.<p>&gt; You&#x27;re scared of the wrong things.<p>Am I? I&#x27;ve seen the rise of (state-backed) censorship and silencing of dissent in Russia, and this is one of the reasons I emigrated. I&#x27;ve seen the rise of (society-backed) censorship and silencing of dissent in Ukraine after 2014, and this is why I did not emigrate there and now have to learn a yet another foreign language. Now I see the rise of censorship and silencing of dissent in the U.S., and I don&#x27;t like what I&#x27;m seeing - unfortunately, what happens in U.S. often has world reach. Meanwhile, I&#x27;m yet to see any hunters for liberals for sports in these places.<p>&gt; As for de-platforming, yes I&#x27;m 100% ok with Alex Jones not making money.<p>I don&#x27;t care about Alex Jones either, that guy sucks. But are you OK with you not making money? Are you OK with subreddits you visit being banned? Are you OK with websites you visit being deplatformed? Are you OK with topics that you are interested in being purged from YouTube?<p>That&#x27;s the thing, people usually want those things for others, never for themselves. Do you think that you should have more rights than those 45% who believe in ghosts, or what?<p>If you don&#x27;t like a website, or a subreddit, or a mailing list - unsubscribe and never visit it again. I had &#x2F;r&#x2F;the_donald removed from my &#x2F;r&#x2F;all for years, and it did not bother me.<p>But if you find yourself wanting to &quot;deplatform&quot; some website or some subreddit - i.e. to disrupt or suppress communications of <i>other people between each other</i> (because you don&#x27;t like them) - are you sure that it is that different from wanting to make your religious beliefs the law of the land?')
