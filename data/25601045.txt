I barely heard anyone talking about it in Western World.<p>(For the unfamiliar: basically, the streamers have to get permissions from Nintendo to stream their games. Some famous streaming groups failed to do so and they had to delete all their VODs involving Nintendo&#x27;s games after Nintendo&#x27;s warning.<p>[I assume other game publishers technically&#x2F;legally can do the same, but I don&#x27;t see them practice this without causing a huge backlash from the community.])')
