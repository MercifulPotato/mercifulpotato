After undergrad, I spent a year back home teaching myself to code then developed and iterated the MVP.\nThe product is a highly customized e-commerce product targeted to industrial customers that is manufactured on demand.<p>Year 1: $500 gross. \nI did some SEO&#x2F;website improvements. \nIt took about 4 months to compound.\nYear 2: $70k gross\nYear 3 (covid): $50k gross<p>I put profits back in the business via buying manufacturing equipment\nThe site is scratch built with a decent amount of tech (AI)<p>-COGS markup is between 300%-600%. Granted this on like a $30 product price.<p>-Spend per customer is $340. But its bimodal. Most spend $30 or $500+<p>-CAC: $0, everything is organic, no advertising or outreach. No time to invest right now.<p>-Customers love the service (Based on unsolicited feedback)<p>-Customers are mostly B2B, many are huge household names.<p>Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s killing me.<p>- I have no employees and I feel like a slave to the machine I built.<p>- I&#x27;m missing some critical features that cause customers to email me with orders.

(6000 units per year)<p>- It&#x27;s a specific niche. I don&#x27;t know how well that scales long term and in volume.<p>- There is still a lot of software dev left to do<p>I want to quit my dayjob to free up time and brain space, to build out critical features. \nI can sustain for 12 months of no sales before bankrupting myself and the company.<p>But if I do go bankrupt, I&#x27;ll be approaching my late 20&#x27;s with nothing to show for myself.<p>Am I insane for thinking about closing this thing? And try to get a well paying job as a programmer for several years, which provides guaranteed money and benefits with much lower stress?')
