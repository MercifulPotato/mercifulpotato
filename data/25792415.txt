So not a replacement. They just also run their own ads.<p>And no, it’s not an ad placeholder. Because they have that too. There is a scene that says “you’re watching YoutubeTV, your show will resume momentarily” while a yellow ad bar progresses.<p>They aren’t also analog ads. You can tell when YTV is playing back an ad recorded within the show, vs when they flip the stream from content to ad content because the UI changes.<p>Nope, from what I can tell, they definitely just show their own ads to their customers.<p>When I had Dish, I saw a lot of DirectTV ads. That makes sense. But I never saw Dish advertising Dish. Maybe I just never paid attention.')
