You&#x27;d have to make sure you have insurance cover, and pay vehicle excise duty (low to non-existent on a Tesla because it&#x27;s an electric vehicle), and that&#x27;s it.<p>All finance has a 14-day cooling off period so no worries there either.<p>Still, it&#x27;s not hassle free: you have to arrange insurance, then cancel it, register the vehicle, unregister it, pay the VED, cancel that.
