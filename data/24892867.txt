It&#x27;s fine to argue that we should be okay with censoring some thing you don&#x27;t like. But at least acknowledge that you&#x27;re not making an appeal to &quot;the principle of freedom of speech&quot; â€” you&#x27;re just arguing for others to adopt your own boundaries of what&#x27;s acceptable.')
