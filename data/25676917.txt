Apple does this for all (major) macOS releases. macOS and iOS are built off of open source components, for which Apple releases the source code now and then. It&#x27;s a courtesy for the most part - most of these are BSD licensed and therefore don&#x27;t strictly <i>require</i> source code to be released.<p>These notably don&#x27;t include much of mac&#x2F;iOS proprietary user interface components, drivers, or system frameworks - basically everything that makes macOS&#x2F;iOS remotely interesting. The source code drops are helpful for the creation of other Unix-like operating systems based on the open source macOS kernel (see also the defunct Open&#x2F;PureDarwin projects), and the released apps are sometimes ported (e.g. the GnuStep project has some older version of Chess.app and others ported over). There&#x27;s some off and on efforts in the FreeBSD community to port Apple&#x27;s open source launchd init system [1]. All in all though, there&#x27;s really not all that much interest in reusing the code from these code drops by the open source community and any efforts seem to lack staying power.<p>The released source most practical value is most likely derived by researchers investigating macOS&#x2F;iOS internals and being able to inspect the source code for some of it. As a curiosity it looks like you&#x27;re able to build and run your own XNU kernel on macOS [2] (what is this, Linux?), but I can&#x27;t personally attest to the process.<p>[1]: e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;freebsd&#x2F;openlaunchd" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;freebsd&#x2F;openlaunchd</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kernelshaman.blogspot.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;12&#x2F;building-xnu-for-macos-mojave-10141.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kernelshaman.blogspot.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;12&#x2F;building-xnu-for-m...</a>')
