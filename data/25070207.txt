R doesn&#x27;t store old versions, which is actually brilliant because your code breaks when your dependencies rot.<p>Python will silently upgrade numpy as a transitive dependency and break everything, which is much worse. MRAN also has daily snapshots which is normally how i handle stuff that will never be updated.<p>I also specified building an R package which does handle dependencies versus the python equivalent which does not.<p>I&#x27;m not saying R is good, I&#x27;m just saying Python is way worse.')
