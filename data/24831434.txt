Browsers make it as easy to clear the storage of a webapp as it is to clear the storage of a native app. If you are talking about PC apps it is even easier to clear webapps&#x27; storage than native apps. If you mean it is bad because the stored data can disappear from the users device, that is what the localstorage API is for. Browsers will only delete that data if the user tells them to. This isn&#x27;t any different from native apps having to deal with users deleting their files.<p>&gt; Performance lower<p>While I have to admit that for raw computation webapps are slower than native, most apps don&#x27;t need that much raw computational power and WASM should bridge the gap to native performance for apps that do need it. If your webapp is slow it is by far more likely you did a poor job programming it, not that you are limited by web performance.<p>&gt; capabilities limited to browser api<p>Browser APIs are expanding all the time (except on iOS Safari but Apple has a vested interest in crippling webapps). And again, most apps don&#x27;t need deep access to a system and the few that do shouldn&#x27;t be webapps anyway.<p>&gt; data consumption unpredictable<p>This has absolutely nothing to do with if an app is a webapp or native. Native apps can suck down data like crazy while webapps can use almost none and vice versa.<p>&gt; identification tied to web technologies<p>Not really? Name one form of widely used identification that webapps don&#x27;t support. You can use emails, usernames, 2FA, security fobs.<p>edit: remove snark at the end, it didn&#x27;t add anything.')
