The others are touchscreen entry devices that print a paper ballot as a hard copy. Hand recounts of the paper ballots have been done -- statewide in Georgia, in one county in Michigan -- and not shown that the machines switched votes as alleged by Giuliani and pals. From here the conversation devolves into conspiracies about how the hand recounts weren&#x27;t <i>real</i> recounts or fake ballots were printed to match the machine totals or something.<p>At which point the voting machine&#x27;s role really doesn&#x27;t matter because the fact is the people making these claims don&#x27;t trust the paper ballot count either.')
