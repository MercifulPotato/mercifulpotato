It looks so different from everything else that you&#x27;re naturally curious to see what it leads to.<p>I will also add that the &quot;professionally designed&quot; ad is kind of busy. It has so many things going on (some text in all caps, different colors, some quoted, illustration doesn&#x27;t add much value, arrows that don&#x27;t mean anything) that it doesn&#x27;t really catch your attention or call you to action. The &quot;ugly&quot; ad, however, gets to the point.')
