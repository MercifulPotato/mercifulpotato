Suppose I say that, for some system, the return to each player is a function of the number of players:  r(n) = 100 &#x2F; (n+1).  One player makes 50, two players make 33 each for a total of 66, three players make 25 each for a total of 75.  Clearly not zero-sum, but I can still move up in the world by killing someone else&#x27;s cows.<p>One might observe that much of the world is like this; not truly zero-sum, but with payoff matrices that incentivize hurting or helping strangers.<p>Note that almost all traditional microeconomics is this kind of curve-following system, one way or another.  I&#x27;m not saying that kind of economics is right or wrong, just that it&#x27;s a very traditional model, worth understanding as a starting point.')
