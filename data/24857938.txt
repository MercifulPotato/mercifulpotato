Last time I checked you had to choose between 3 installation approaches and then choose a 3rd party installer (all of which have bad UX) and set that up.<p>Due to the convention of not relying on fixed-paths in Windows software, as well as Windows providing a stable base platform of common libraries, pretty much anyone can just compile a program and put it and its resources into a zip file. The vast majority of the software I install is distributed this way.<p>&gt; Fragmentation exists on Windows too, it&#x27;s just internal.<p>The fragmentation of Windows is orders of magnitude less than Linux. I can write software today that will work without modification even on versions of windows from 15 years ago without recompilation[0]. Occasionally there are minor incompatibilities between Windows versions and editions, but it isn&#x27;t that way for most software.<p>&gt; You&#x27;re probably taking about Flatpak and Snap. One has great marketing but is not usable for ethical&#x2F;practical concerns while I haven&#x27;t had a very good experience with with Flatpak (its &quot;runtimes&quot; are basically extra Linux distributions).<p>No, I&#x27;m not. In my opinion Flatpak and Snap combine the worst of both worlds in that they still require repos and a special tool to manage them. I meant exactly what I said: AppDirs with default sandboxing.<p>[0] Hell, thanks to WINE it will probably even work on Linux without recompilation.')
