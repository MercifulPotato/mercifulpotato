Kicking a company off of a cloud platform is not putting someone on the street without notice. Companies are not people, clouds are not beds.<p>2. It&#x27;s the company&#x27;s responsibility to manage risk, including the risk of getting kicked off of a platform. Most companies manage this risk by minimizing it - it&#x27;s extremely easy, and well trodden territory. Things most companies will do is moderate content, it&#x27;s pretty much dead simple. If your company won&#x27;t do those things you&#x27;ll have to mitigate risk in some other way.<p>3. You might argue &quot;well companies aren&#x27;t people, clouds aren&#x27;t beds, but workers will lose their jobs&quot;. This is true, if the company has been poorly managed. But we already have nets for those situations. There&#x27;s bankruptcy, unemployment, various tax benefits, notice to apply for a new job, etc.<p>I actually don&#x27;t feel particularly compelled at all by your analogy.')
