If you want to run a complicated bit of SQL past a DB admin first, but your DB admin is 5 hours ahead of you and finished work already, you pay the cost of context switching and picking it up again tomorrow.<p>* Even if everyone speaks English, having a dozen different dialects and accents in one meeting doesn&#x27;t help with comprehension, even moreso on dodgy connections.<p>* Cultural differences can be managed, but if you&#x27;ve got people from half a dozen different cultures on your team, you&#x27;re gonna hit differences, some very difficult to surmount. And this is magnified with the lack of body-language communication you&#x27;d get in person.')
