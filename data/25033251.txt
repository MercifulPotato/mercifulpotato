Item(by='nmfisher', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604917014, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25027687, text='&gt; I&#x27;m confused. Where in this comment chain does what you describe seem to be happening? The closest I can find is the great-great-great-great grandparent, which states “The guy had armies of white supremacist supporters and advisers. He told right-wing extremists to “stand by” on national TV.”<p>There was torrential, indignant outcry on my Twitter feed that Trump was literally sending the message to armed white supremacist militias to standby and that they would be called upon to take arms shortly.<p>But even that GP comment is a good example. &quot;He told right-wing extremists to stand by&quot; - is a partial truth at best. Either way, it&#x27;s misleading. Why did GP choose the words &quot;stand by&quot; and omit the words &quot;stand back&quot;? Because s&#x2F;he wanted to paint Trump as a racist, and the latter didn&#x27;t fit the narrative. It&#x27;s intellectually dishonest.<p>&gt; At this risk of taking a bit of a tangent: it&#x27;s not as if this is the only time his carelessness with his words and stubbornness to correct the way they were interpreted caused problems. In those cases too, we need to acknowledge both the cause and the effect. Accidentally causing damage and intentionally causing damage are distinct problems, but they&#x27;re both problems — especially when you&#x27;re the leader of a country.<p>In this respect, I agree completely. I&#x27;m not saying that puerile stubborness is somehow any <i>better</i> than militant white supremacy. If his speaking carelessly causes issues, it is certainly his responsibility to undeniably, unconditionally refute it.<p>My gripe is with the continual exaggeration, misrepresentation and outright misinformation from the anti-Trump brigade. Any facts which don&#x27;t fit the narrative are conveniently discarded. It&#x27;s not limited to Trump, either. Countless people described the Kenosha shooter as firing indiscriminately and unprovoked into a crowd, which is a patently absurd distortion of reality. Or the complete fiction that Nick Sandmann (the kid in the MAGA hat) approached the Native American guy and start making racist taunts.<p>Many Anti-Trumpers are hypocritically engaging in exactly the same dishonest behaviour as Trump&#x2F;Trumpists. Frankly, I don&#x27;t believe <i>anything</i> I read any more, and that&#x27;s an absolute travesty.')
