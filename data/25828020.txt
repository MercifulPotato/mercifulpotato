My point though is that I think software engineering would benefit from such a regulatory body.  Not for everything mind you, but I would expect some things to require a &quot;software engineer&#x27;s&quot; stamp.  Any system that will be used to handle sensitive or classified data, life and death situations (like automotive or aircraft), etc. ought to require a stamp.  Frankly, it those cases it probably does, but it is the electrical or mechanical engineer that ends up signing off on it.')
