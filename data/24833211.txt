But to at least ask you personally, would you concede that if you were doing well on tests despite the absence of the kind of cramming &#x2F; teaching-to-the-test that the average schooled student receives, you could have done any kind of education, and in many ways, there is nothing special at all about homeschooling? Or that if your structure re-enacts this teaching, but it&#x27;s a lot less time than the average student, you definitely have a natural aptitude for test taking?<p>Are tests the only way we can robustly evaluate a kid&#x27;s education, until they are 18? If so, will sports matter if you&#x27;re getting bad test scores? What does?<p>Here&#x27;s the crazier conclusion. That people finger parental income or cultural values as the biggest factors of education outcomes, and in reality test performance is mostly genetic. It might as well be, from a policy perspective, randomly assigned - God rolls a 100 sided dice when you&#x27;re born, and if it&#x27;s a 1 or a 2 all standardized tests are easy for you. If you roll the other 98 numbers, the best thing is to cram.<p>We don&#x27;t need alternatives to traditional schooling. We need a way of evaluating kids that rewards genuine learning. Kids who are learning should be scoring <i>poorly</i> sometimes, and that&#x27;s the <i>exact opposite</i> of how children are evaluated, and poor scores are the <i>exact opposite</i> of what most parents of high achievers want.<p>Earnest parents are really seeking true learning. On the flip side, parents who send their kids to cram school or kvetch about college admissions not being fair because colleges consider factors other than totally and utterly gameable, zero-learning standardized tests - they are the antagonists. They are ruining our education system, they make school look the way it does, they are seeking a completely worthless advantage for their children (high test scores in the absence of valuable learning via cram school) for some cynically, utterly selfish devotion to values like making money and buying expensive things. Values so primitive and debasing that human cultures around the world have refined, multi-thousand-year-old refutations of materialism - opposition to materialism (asceticism) may be the most mature philosophy of all of history, at least as dominant as family values and theism. And then, to rationalize all of this, they find the least privileged and disadvantaged families and blame them instead! All the while pretending that there&#x27;s some sort of equivalence of shittiness in their situations, because of some fucking number like income, between their families and the Other. It&#x27;s complete and total bullshit.<p>Some changes to the school system can help everyone live happier lives and learn more, like different children spending longer (or shorter) times in class.<p>But really, we have to throw out tests. Or invent a test so sophisticated that it avoids being gamed by cramming.')
