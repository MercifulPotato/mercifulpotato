Unless you need some extreme performance for your final product, a well-optimized Python program will work just fine.<p>But still, there&#x27;s some of that matlab legacy left - instead of one comprehensive application, you have tons of smaller programs floating around, for one-off&#x2F;single-issue uses.')
