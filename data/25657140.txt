But here are two things I do in WhatsApp that I can&#x27;t do in Signal:<p>- Share live location.  If I need to meet up with somebody, or let someone know how far away I am and when I&#x27;m arriving, I use share live location.  &quot;Share for 1 hour.&quot;  In Signal you can share your location at a moment in time but it doesn&#x27;t update.<p>- Broadcast messages (&quot;mass text&quot; basically).  In WhatsApp I can send a message to a list of people without the people on the list seeing each other (to them it looks like I messaged them 1:1).  In Signal I would have to use a group and all the members would see each other.')
