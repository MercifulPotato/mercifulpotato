I only have a spare 2015 MacBook Pro 13&quot; with 16 GB of RAM and 2 TB of SSD. I only need small countries (New Zealand, Taiwan, Switzerland), but I&#x27;m not sure whether this will reduce the system requirements.<p>&quot;A minimum of 2GB of RAM is required or installation will fail. For a full planet import 64GB of RAM or more are strongly recommended. Do not report out of memory problems if you have less than 64GB RAM. For a full planet install you will need at least 800GB of hard disk space (take into account that the OSM database is growing fast). SSD disks will help considerably to speed up import and queries. Even on a well configured machine the import of a full planet takes at least 2 days. Without SSDs 7-8 days are more realistic.&quot; [0]<p>I&#x27;d also like to render tiles in the OSM Bright theme. The default OpenStreetMap just looks kind of unattractive to me.<p>In the end I just use an old version of Galileo Offline Maps (now Guru Maps) with tiles scraped from Google using MOBAC. [1]. I made MOBAC profiles for every country [2] so I can just re-scrape them when I have a fast Internet connection.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nominatim.org&#x2F;release-docs&#x2F;latest&#x2F;admin&#x2F;Installation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nominatim.org&#x2F;release-docs&#x2F;latest&#x2F;admin&#x2F;Installation...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobac.sourceforge.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobac.sourceforge.io&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;peterburk&#x2F;mobacProfiles" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;peterburk&#x2F;mobacProfiles</a>')
