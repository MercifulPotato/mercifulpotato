The world was awed by how awesome their “community spirit” was -  nobody denied they exhibited far more social cohesion, sacrifice and civic responsibility than would ever be on display in the US.<p>That’s a cultural difference on display. Culture is not determined by race, so let’s not conflate the two. Culture is something you are immersed in and it does influence behavior.<p>There are also massive downsides to extreme cultural cohesion, looking at it another way.<p>But let’s not deny that social culture has a bearing on individual and group behavior. It has a massive impact. Conflating that observation with race or _racism_ seems a particularly unhelpful neuroticism of the US.')
