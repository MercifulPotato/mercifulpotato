You think someone is better when in all probability they got luckier. And you think that picking someone you think is better will statistically get you a better person when that&#x27;s not true if credentials are highly luck based. It&#x27;s like buying lotto tickets from a gas station that&#x27;s produced more winners in the past.<p>I&#x27;m saying your measurements aren&#x27;t going to be any better than whatever percent of &quot;skill&quot; is randomness. CEO candidate 2 went to a better school but you don&#x27;t know that it was his grandpa&#x27;s alma matter who pulled some strings. Candidate 3 might be a multimillionaire but it&#x27;s because he got a settlement from a malfunctioning ski lift when he was 10.<p>A lot of the &quot;signals&quot; companies use to determine if somebody would be a good leader or employee are 100% luck based. You could statistically pick a worse candidate every time that looks betters if you&#x27;re looking at the wrong signals.')
