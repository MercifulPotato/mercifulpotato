I really wanted to like it.<p>Sad to say, it&#x27;s terrible. Mostly what it did was remind me how much I appreciate stuff that actually works well (e.g., wrist position sensing, so that it turns on when it&#x27;s supposed to, a reliable touch interface, etc).  I ended up buying a Fitbit Sense when they came out a month or so later.  I don&#x27;t regret it, even at &gt;10x the price.  I have my gripes with the sense but most of the time it is vastly more usable.')
