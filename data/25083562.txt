The people who are most &quot;shut out&quot; by the complexity of the web do not, by definition, speak Javascript. These are the folks who need Anvil most! Most people who speak JS already know web-dev (why else would you learn JS?)<p>2. Python is the most popular language that isn&#x27;t JS. It&#x27;s used for teaching almost everywhere, it&#x27;s used for data science, it&#x27;s used on the back-end, even embedded code...<p>3. We wanted to start with an &quot;island of sanity&quot;. If you google &quot;how to do X in JS&quot;, you&#x27;ll find StackOverflow and end up tweaking a DOM node, or making an HTTP request, or grabbing something else that breaks the abstraction and brings back the traditional Web hairball.<p>We want to make it <i>easy</i> to escape, of course (I wrote an whole essay about that[0]), but not so easy that you wander out of it without realising, and then find that the autocompleter no longer understands all of your project.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anvil.works&#x2F;blog&#x2F;escape-hatches-and-ejector-seats" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anvil.works&#x2F;blog&#x2F;escape-hatches-and-ejector-seats</a><p>4.

We want to win them over in the end, of course, but they would have been a very hard target market for an MVP!')
