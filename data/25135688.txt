That this is a captured system, owned by large corporations.  That education, science, government, media - all of it is captured and bent towards the will of those few who own the large corporations.  If you can&#x27;t see how the world is being co-ordinated now, I don&#x27;t think you ever will.<p>If you are a top elite, and own almost everything, even banks, even the Federal Reserve (and it is privately owned btw), so you can print your own money, you have a totally different set of questions.  You may well find yourself prepared to ditch an entire industry (oil) for the sake of the greater good.  Its really not about the oil industry.<p>We are globally being transitioned away from cars, etc.  We will not own cars in the future.  We will have our freedom of movement severely constrained, on account of our &#x27;citizen score&#x27; (see present day China).  We will not be able to use electricity or water, once our allocated credits are used up.  This sounds dystopian, right?<p>But you will be cheering this on, because you believe what you are told.')
