Interestingly enough, that context tends to get &quot;filled in&quot; with their local vernacular.<p>When done well, it can result in some really interesting fusion cuisine and dining experiences.  That&#x27;s not always the case though, and I&#x27;m reminded of an experience I had in Rome ordering a cheese burger in a quasi-Irish pub, and getting a dry puck of ground beef with a cold thick slice of fresh mozzarella on top.  Not really what I was hoping for.')
