There&#x27;s a spectrum of how readers interpret such things (some would find it snarky, as I did, while others wouldn&#x27;t)â€”but what&#x27;s for certain is that the reader spectrum skews far more in that direction than commenters think it does. Objects in the mirror are closer than they appear. Since you only have to hit a small section of that spectrum to start a flamewar, we need comments to err on the side of not coming across that way [1].<p>There&#x27;s another guideline that helps with this:<p>&quot;<i>When disagreeing, please reply to the argument instead of calling names. &quot;That is idiotic; 1 + 1 is 2, not 3&quot; can be shortened to &quot;1 + 1 is 2, not 3.&quot;</i><p>Although &quot;How fortunate that&quot; isn&#x27;t exactly calling names, your comment could have been shortened in just this way. &quot;This was never claimed&quot; would make the same point without hitting any of the snark spectrum.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=disambiguate%20burden%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=disambiguate%20burden%20by:dan...</a>')
