Most people in the hacker&#x2F;maker community I know are pretty disorganised like myself.. I know for me this kind of thing will never fly, it requires too much dedication. In this sense I&#x27;m not surprised it came from Germany as they love formalising things. It&#x27;s really in their nature and I imagine this is also why they&#x27;re so good at technological things.<p>But for me it&#x27;ll never work, I know I&#x27;ll start on it and then I have a rush project where I don&#x27;t have time to keep the docs up to date and then I&#x27;ll abandon it altogether :) I&#x27;m the kind of guy who fills up their desktop with everything they&#x27;re working on and when it ends up being full just moves it to a folder &quot;Old Desktop&quot; (which is in fact a chain of &quot;Even Older Desktop&quot; folders :) :) :) ). Somehow it seems to work for me though, it really surprises me how I can find stuff back from 10 years ago just by seeing the icons of stuff I worked on around the time. And it&#x27;s really zero effort which I like.<p>And really, I like relying on my memory.. If I don&#x27;t remember something maybe it wasn&#x27;t worth remembering. And discovering it once more may lead to other interesting discoveries.<p>But I&#x27;m glad it helps others forward in their goals! I didn&#x27;t expect it at all though.')
