(Maybe some amount of nonviolent mischief is good for humanity, maybe the impulse for violent retribution is necessary when justice systems are flawed, maybe these kinds of thoughts are generally not acted on and actually make people more self-reflective, etc.) But it&#x27;s at least a bit harder to come up with reasons that speed limits should be exceedable on public roads and a bit easier to think up solutions. Medical emergencies are one possible case, but having an override that records that the override happened and that you&#x27;ll have to give a good reason for doing is a possible solution. Maybe there&#x27;s sudden traffic situations where you have to speed up to avoid a crash, and the system could be made to allow limited bursts of speed.')
