That probably has a good ROI since finding issues with their products is helpful.<p>However, for another company this metric is just a value of how well locked into the M$ stack they are. If it were my company, heavy users would be penalised as there are other, better, less expensive products to use. Sitting in Teams talking to people is not a good score. Firstly you&#x27;re wasting 512MB of that company laptop on a single web page, secondly it is a slow communication tool and thirdly, if you were talking in IRC then the conversation would be logged for others to grep and find answers to similar issues.<p>Scoring high with M$ Word would also be a negative thing in my view, that shows that you&#x27;re using a tool that locks the company into an upgrade cycle for future M$ Word versions. Did you not think to use Libre Office or perhaps MD?<p>Scoring high in Outlook is also negative, that&#x27;s another tool that can&#x27;t store .msg files in open way. Every time a .msg file is attached to something and exchanged, via another tool then the receiver needs something that can disassemble the .msg into a readable form.')
