Item(by='jedberg', descendants=None, kids=[25765610, 25765989], score=None, time=1610557865, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25764797, text='&gt; why do we need it?<p>Because we don&#x27;t have a social safety net in the United States, so getting laid off could make you instantly destitute.<p>&gt; why do employers give it?<p>To maintain their community reputation.  In the future when they hire again, it&#x27;s easier to paper over a layoff if you can show that you tried to take care of the employees.<p>Also because it&#x27;s the ethical thing to do.<p>&gt; should one negotiate it?<p>Usually in a mass layoff like this you can&#x27;t negotiate it, since it&#x27;s a standard package and you don&#x27;t really have any leverage.  But if you&#x27;re a one off &quot;layoff&quot; you can and probably should negotiate it.  Your leverage is &quot;I might sue you for wrongful termination&quot;.  So the company has to make a calculus on what that might cost them.<p>&gt; what is fair&#x2F;unfair?<p>That&#x27;s the 64,000 dollar question, isn&#x27;t it?  It seems like three months is pretty typical.  When someone gets six months most people call them &quot;lucky&quot;.  When someone gets a year people call it &quot;unheard of&quot;.  No whether that&#x27;s fair or not is anyone&#x27;s guess.<p>It would be great to get some data on how long the average laid off tech worker is out of work.  Maybe start a movement to get severance to match that.  But again, the laid off employee has very little leverage.')
