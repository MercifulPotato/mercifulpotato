I can understand all the concepts, but I find formal mathematical notation almost completely incomprehensible. Expressions with all kinds of strange symbols, often variables introduced that are either completely undefined or defined ad hoc locations remote from the usage, integrals and sums with no subscripts &#x2F; unclear scoping, etc etc. Clearly other people just read these and I even know people who will ignore all the text in a paper and just look for the equations. I wish I could master it because in some areas it is a genuine barrier to me achieving my goals.')
