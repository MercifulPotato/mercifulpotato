Clickbait is a title that quickly imposes the feeling of missing and important information. Especially to get people to click through so the link target can serve ads. That&#x27;s clearly not OPs goal as he makes the title a call to action, omitting no critical information.<p>Propaganda has nothing to do with the definition of clickbait, so saying &quot;[propaganda ...] Aka click bait.&quot; Is very misleading. And betrays your argument that everything should be exclusively logic, specifically omitting any appeal to emotion. That&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;re trying to do by portraying op as using propaganda. And rhetorically speaking would be a disservice to both reader and article.')
