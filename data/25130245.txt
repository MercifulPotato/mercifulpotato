I went years thinking I can&#x27;t run Docker because of this fact. Turns out the PC has no such limitation when running Linux.<p>You don&#x27;t have such limitation on Windows Server either. Mac OS has the same limitation. Its strange to think about this the way you do, it was originally linux tech, its like complaining Windows Explorer is not available on linux.<p>&gt; Years ago, tried using Meteor. It was practically unusable as I kept getting error after error. Multiple roundtrips searching and a ton of Windows-specific GitHub issues later, I gave up on the framework.<p>There were always tools that were Windows or Linux specific. You should research your tech more in order not to finish into that trap.<p>&gt; There are plenty of frameworks and dev tools that are an afterthought for Windows. This, of course, is due to Windows requiring often heavy extras to be compatible whereas Unix systems simply just work.<p>Not sure where you got that, that Unix systems simply just work. I had never had a Linux or Unix that just worked in last 20 years of experience with all OSes.<p>Almost everything just works as long as you fit its niche. Once you need specific stuff, every OS needs to be customized and if it works in first iteration, you remember that day like the God looked at you.<p>&gt; Plenty devs just don&#x27;t Care that much whether their software runs on Windows.<p>Its also the opposite.<p>&gt; This, of course, is due to Windows requiring often heavy extras to be compatible<p>Whaaat ? Windows itself is compatible with older self, its not requirement for apps.<p>&gt; MS have released new software or updates to macOS first.<p>Whaat ?')
