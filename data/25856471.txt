These containers are bow missing elsewhere. Lockdowns in Europe and the US and so on didn&#x27;t help neither.<p>And we have to remember that container rates have been quite low for quite a while. So any &quot;excuse&quot; to increase rates is welcome. What I saw since last year is, that carriers and shipping lines are offering much shorter demurrage free periods than, say, two years ago. There was a time two weeks without demurrage fees, now that is a day or so. Containers turned into a rare commodity it seems.')
