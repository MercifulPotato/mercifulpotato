And while N (Nitrogen) and K (Potassium) aren&#x27;t likely to run out any time soon, P (Phosphorus) <i>is</i> in limited supply and finding enough of it for our agricultural needs may become a serious problem later this century.  Not to mention the fact that producing NPK fertilizer takes a lot of energy.<p>Hopefully most of us won&#x27;t have to give up the flush toilet, but we absolutely will have find better ways of dealing with the &quot;downstream&quot; product and start recovering its significant value.  In the not-so-distant future shit <i>will</i> be valuable again.')
