The Venta works _shockingly_ well, and requires basically no maintenance. The problem with most wick humidifiers is that minerals build up on the wick very quickly (even before anything starts to grow), and minerals prevent the wick from absorbing any liquid. Even if you don&#x27;t see or smell anything growing on the wick, the efficiency drops dramatically within a couple weeks, unless you change the wick constantly.<p>In comparison, the Venta requires almost zero maintenance, and the entire machine is basically indestructible. The electronics pop out if you press the two buttons on top, which means you can  hose the entire thing down in a bathtub if you want. You could probably put the whole thing in the dishwasher if you really wanted to, but I haven&#x27;t tried that myself.')
