Unfortunately not that much distributions are still available (most links seem to be dead).<p>If you&#x27;re interested in the OS or the language, here is a platform independent, stand-alone version running on LuaJIT: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rochus-keller&#x2F;OberonSystem" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rochus-keller&#x2F;OberonSystem</a><p>There is also an integrated IDE with syntax coloring, semantic navigation, and a source level debugger.<p>The compiler supports small-case keywords and underscores in identifiers. I&#x27;m currently working on an extended version of the language.')
