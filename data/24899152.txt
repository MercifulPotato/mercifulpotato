I can change a line of code, press cmd+r and I see the change - whereas in Java more often than not I have to wholly restart the application container as hot-reloading is a complicated mess and tough to set up.<p>Also, in Java it is easy to end up with resource leaks whereas PHP always starts from a clean slate for each request.
