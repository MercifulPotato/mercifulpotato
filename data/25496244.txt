The point is you pay for much of Ruby&#x27;s metaprogramming, even if you aren&#x27;t using it. So not using it doesn&#x27;t help you.<p>A concrete example is that you pay for `Kernel#binding` every single time you finish using a local variable but Ruby retains it for the binding, even if you never ever call `Kernel#binding`. Even JITs cannot remove this cost.')
