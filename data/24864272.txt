Item(by='ImprobableTruth', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603407963, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24863614, text='&gt;These are scientifically unsubstantiated claims but to claim that they are impossible is to go beyond the scope of the current science.<p>Proving things impossible is beyond the scope of _any_ science, that&#x27;s just how epistemology works.<p>&gt;How can you know that mind control is impossible?<p>I can&#x27;t. I also can&#x27;t know with absolute certainty that climate change is real, that the earth isn&#x27;t flat, that vaccines work and don&#x27;t cause autism or that bill gates isn&#x27;t a satanist using covid pandemic to implant people with mind control microchips.<p>I have seen absolutely no evidence for any of it and all the believers seem to be absolute lunatics, so the chance of it being true are low enough that I&#x27;m pretty comfortable with acting like I know it for certain.<p>&gt;If you were truly capable of it, would you advertise it?<p>Well, I&#x27;d say writing about your experience with your abilities in a book certainly counts as a form of advertisement! I also don&#x27;t really see what there&#x27;d be to worry about if it&#x27;s true that these powers could simply be learned.<p>&gt;But all that aside, it&#x27;s not really about believing or not believing in whatever the claims are. \n&gt;Whether or not you become a pyromancer is actually not important, most of these disciplines actually discourage these things even though they believe in them.<p>Sure, they might see it like that, but I don&#x27;t think it makes sense for anyone else to view it this way. If someone is either lying or deluding themselves, I think that&#x27;s pretty important information to consider! If someone is, say, an anti-vaxxer that doesn&#x27;t mean everything they&#x27;re saying is false, but it certainly makes it seem pretty reasonable to dismiss what they&#x27;re saying until they&#x27;ve provide some actual evidence.<p>Similarly, why shouldn&#x27;t I be skeptic of people who are claiming supernatural powers while not being able to offer any evidence? Especially because they&#x27;re not making it clear where knowledge ends and religion begins, possibly because they themselves don&#x27;t know.')
