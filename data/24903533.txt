Look at the source for it - it is this spreadsheet. [2][3]<p>The primary source for all of China&#x27;s figures in that spreadsheet is this [3][4] puff piece.<p>Now, the astute reader will notice something strange with this data. Somehow, the primary source [3][4] for the spreadsheet claims that camera&#x2F;capita in China is similar to the rest of the world - yet, for some reason, the spreadsheet - and the subsequent article claims that all the major Chinese cities have an order of magnitude more cameras than the rest of the world.<p>Garbage in, garbage out. The methodology for gathering the per-city statistics was wildly inconsistent (There is incredibly obvious undercounting[3] happening for nearly every datapoint that&#x27;s not in China), and the end product is completely worthless - unless you are, of course, using it to reinforce pre-existing biases.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20737023" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20737023</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;1I-WpH2KOiguKy9JTQ9zC2JxBBhH2scdbSRI8lJVjzdo&#x2F;edit#gid=979494433" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;1I-WpH2KOiguKy9JTQ9zC...</a><p>[3] You can tell this spreadsheet is utter garbage, by looking at the entry for NYC in it. It claims that NYC has 31,490 cameras in it. I&#x27;ve visited NYC twice, and I&#x27;ve probably <i>walked</i> past more cameras than that in the ten days I was there.<p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.360kuai.com&#x2F;pc&#x2F;9d0f97d8eb6ea1d8f?cota=3&amp;kuai_so=1&amp;sign=360_7bc3b157#ch=youlike" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.360kuai.com&#x2F;pc&#x2F;9d0f97d8eb6ea1d8f?cota=3&amp;kuai_so=...</a>')
