There are absolutely a few situations where a mirrorless &#x2F; DSLR camera is going to run circles around a smartphone camera, but fewer than you might think.<p>A mirrorless camera may have a wider dynamic range by default, but modern iPhones have incredible Smart HDR capabilities that <i>actually</i> work really well. With a mirrorless, they can do an auto HDR effect using several photos, but it&#x27;s a much simpler effect, and you can&#x27;t get RAW photos when using that. The new iPhone 12 will capture RAW photos even when applying Deep Fusion and other advanced techniques, from what they mentioned on stage today.<p>I&#x27;m fairly sure no common mirrorless camera is going to be able to do HDR video at the level that the iPhone 12 will do it.<p>If Apple or Google would make a mirrorless camera that combined their intelligent camera software with a larger sensor, that would be epic. Right now, there are always trade-offs, no matter which camera you pick.<p>I&#x27;ve thought about getting a mirrorless camera to have that massive sensor for night photography, and to have the variety of lenses, but it&#x27;s a lot of money for something substantial to have to carry around, and the difference just isn&#x27;t what it used to be.<p><i>Even if</i> you&#x27;re printing these photos, an iPhone 12 is going to be able to take a lot of really crisp, excellent photos. With the help of LiDAR, I think the 12 Pro will be able to create a really compelling portrait mode effect that&#x27;s less glitchy than the current techniques that don&#x27;t have an accurate depth map instantly available.<p>Computational photography is a real thing, and it&#x27;s impressive how much they have made up for the lack of physical space that would be required for a giant sensor.<p>If you scroll back on this twitter feed, you can see some nice examples of pictures shot on iPhone by various people: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;halidecamera" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;halidecamera</a><p>They&#x27;re not &quot;nice for a smartphone&quot; pictures. They&#x27;re just good pictures.')
