New Mexico (46th richest, fifth poorest) is Democratic. But there isn’t another blue or purple state until you get to purple Maine (31st richest, 20th poorest) with its “split” legislature of one party in each chamber. All the states in between (such as Tennessee and Florida) are Republican, both chambers. So is Michigan, where Republicans hold all high state offices (where Donald Trump won in 2016). Above New Mexico, you jump all the way to middle of the pack Vermont (27th richest, 24th poorest) to find a state with both legislative chambers held by Democrats.</i><p>&gt; <i>But all five richest states have both legislative chambers controlled by Democrats – Maryland, New Jersey, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Connecticut. Overall, Democrats dominate the 20 richest states.</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usatoday.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;money&#x2F;columnist&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;21&#x2F;midterms-poorest-states-have-republican-legislatures&#x2F;1694273002&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usatoday.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;money&#x2F;columnist&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;21&#x2F;mi...</a><p>&gt; <i>The people have had the resources they would use to deal with it diverted. Low tax scenarios are much more fault tolerant. High taxes won&#x27;t necessarily promote equality or great outcomes.</i><p>When there are haves and have-nots, often expressed in (e.g.) a high Gini coefficient, things generally do not improve for the have-nots over time. As the 20th century has shown, especially in the post-Gilded Age post-WW2 era, taxing to fund social programs tends to improve a society in many ways.')
