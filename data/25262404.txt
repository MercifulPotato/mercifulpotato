One of its characteristics was that &quot;reasoning by analogy&quot; was rampant; another characteristic was almost total intellectual stagnation, and we now see why the two go together. A reason for mentioning this is to point out that, by developing a keen ear for unwarranted analogies, one can detect a lot of medieval thinking today.</i>&quot;<p>This is essentially the unreflected pop-culture reading of the middle ages as the &#x27;dark ages&#x27; (I also have no idea how Dijkstra determined that reasoning by analogy was particularly a feature of  medieval society), which happens to be wrong, and ironically is in itself a sort of sloppy analogy of the kind he just denounced')
