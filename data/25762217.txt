Until there&#x27;s some kind of common micro-fab standard where every major university can have a legit semiconductor fab for small scale operations, giving people the design doesn&#x27;t really do much.<p>I really wish that someone would work on the problem of making affordable, small-scale semiconductor fabrication possible on a reasonably modern node (&lt;= 32nm). It&#x27;s a hard problem... but everyone in the world being dependent on a few large fabs is also a hard problem.')
