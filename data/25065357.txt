It&#x27;s not extraordinary for something which has consensus to get done really late, even in AUTH48 (a notional &quot;48 hours&quot; for the authors of the document to fix any last little things that often lasts rather longer than two Earth days) if that&#x27;s what people decide is necessary.<p>But &quot;Blink doesn&#x27;t want to do it&quot; isn&#x27;t consensus on its own, this page suggests other clients implement this and offers no opinion about whether they intend to likewise deprecate the feature.')
