And <i>not</i> taking measures to reduce spread probably just means more infections faster, which is more opportunity for reproduction and mutation, which means you probably get higher fitness variations sooner.<p>Also I&#x27;m trying to think of anywhere in US&#x2F;UK society for which &quot;incessant lockdown&quot; could possibly be an accurate description of policy much less behavior.')
