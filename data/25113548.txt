Princedom?).<p>They are also very, very tight knit families - Basques are somehow highly matriarchal - and they take proud in remembering all their &quot;8 last names&quot; (Specially if they all are of basque origin).\nFriend groups are also very tight knit, and a lot of people keep friendships they developed at an early age through their whole life.<p>Basques are also incredible loyal and hardworking people; but they also party like no one.<p>In Amorebieta a the time - ~2005 - I think there were only 4 or 5 bars, and on weekends people would go rotating constantly through them all (This was not particular to the town, but something that was normal for basques).\nOn Sundays and holidays it was normal to find in the afternoon entire families having a drink at the sidewalk in the bars.<p>I know people from the UK had a certain fame about drinking, but let me tell you _nobody_ drinks &amp; party like the Spaniards, and basques are at the top 3 of the Spanish nationalities of the list.<p>There&#x27;s a rather entertaining book called &quot;The Basque History of the World&quot; [0] that claims, among other things, that the basques were also in America before Columbus and that more or less we own them the invention of salted cod that made possible the long journeys around the globe.<p>I left Spain 13 years ago, and to this day one of the things I miss the most is my basque family.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Basque-History-World-Story-Nation&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0140298517&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Basque-History-World-Story-Nation&#x2F;dp&#x2F;...</a>')
