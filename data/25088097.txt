I ask because meatpacking necessarily creates optimal conditions for spread of droplet or airborne viruses. It has to be cold, to prevent spoilage, air circulation must be limited to reduce refrigeration energy consumption, and it has to be a relatively confined space to reduce convection and radiated energy.<p>The meat-packing plants were well-designed given their constraints, but this coronavirus was unanticipated, and creating production facilities with more protections against this will take a lot of time and money. These new facilities would also use much more energy (roughly proportional to the increase in area required), so you have to ask whether those costs would be worth incurring to help with the next (hypothetical) outbreak. It&#x27;s too late to build new facilities for this one.')
