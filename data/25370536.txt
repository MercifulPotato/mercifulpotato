There are a crap ton of laws that protect democracy. They are laws that decide how the votes are reported, where the votes are stored, even how the electoral college electors should vote. When you go into a court and swear an oath to tell the truth about democracy, that is our legal system censoring speech about democracy. Incidentally this is why Rudy Giuliani said in court that there was no fraud in the election. Because we have laws about what you can and can&#x27;t say. Michael Flynn was prosecuted for lying to investigators about his conversations with the Russian ambassador; the heart of that investigation was the election and the Russian threat to the democratic process. No, you cannot legally say whatever you want about the election to whoever you want for self-serving ends. Even if it&#x27;s in limited situations, there is a ton of censorship to protect our democracy.<p>And private entities should go even further, at least to protect their brands. I will always think of Facebook as the place where the Rohingya genocide was organized and carried out, and Facebook is where violent protesters like Kyle Rittenhouse gathered before killing multiple people. I think about the platforms that allowed ISIS to radicalize people. Google doesn&#x27;t want YouTube to be the video hosting site where you can watch the world burn. Reddit removed the sub where you could literally watch people die. You might see these actions as against some dearly held political beliefs but it&#x27;s pretty clear to me that these are just adults trying to act with a modicum of responsibility.')
