The mathematics are quite elegant. Unfortunately, like a lot of beautiful macroeconomics, it isn’t a policy prescription. (Though it provides ivory tower cover for bad policy.)<p>Reserve currency status <i>does</i> afford increased deficit-spending capacity. But it isn’t an immutable, environmental variable.

There is theoretical work for higher FLs. Do you point up the nose of a fully-loaded plane until the wings or engine or fuselage fail?<p>Piloting federal fiscal policy on MMT is akin to steering the plane to FL 100 and keeping an eye out for a stall. You might get lucky. But you should have experimented in smaller and more-controlled settings first.')
