(I think it was Sainsbury&#x27;s.)<p>They wanted to print an appropriate coupon after someone paid for their shopping. &quot;Â£1 off hamburgers next week&quot; or similar, to get the person to return to the shop the following week.<p>They said a very important feature was to avoid giving a discount for a product someone has just bought <i>or a closely related product</i>. This would annoy customers who felt they&#x27;d missed out. Therefore, they were updating Neo4J with the just-made purchases and calculating the recommendation in the time it took to process the payment.<p>Maybe Amazon&#x27;s chaotic mess of similar products makes this much more difficult than for a large supermarket, or maybe Amazon doesn&#x27;t think the annoyance is a big deal.')
