I think the reason is because where I live (London) there has been less people on the street, in shops, bars and so on, so the people who do go out are more likely to chat with others like myself. It’s kind of funny, people who are just out and about and getting in with their normal life have no real fear of the virus or most of them (like myself) already had it and therefore have little reason to follow any guidelines. It’s like a self selection process of all people who have a rather similar view on the pandemic which are mostly economically active and meet nowadays at public places. I kind of enjoy it if there wasn’t the bitter aftertaste of seeing lots of livelihoods being crushed and many shops and restaurants at the brink of collapse.')
