Not for everything I do, but for a large part of my programming. In my eyes, it hits a sweet spot of not having too much complexity, no magic and being an efficient language. It has a fast compiler, a good module system and a strict type checker. Certainly helped by the module system, there is a rich set of libraries in Go. Compiling to a single file executable also solves a lot of deployment problems.<p>In my eyes, Go is also the modern times successor to the Wirth family of programming languages. In Europe, for a long time the Wirth languages were far more popular than C was. Only in this millenium they faded from public perception, but with Go many of their concepts and philosphies come back, even when dressed up like a C language :).')
