I have a general enough notion from digging into Haskell and reading into types (including dependent types). I see the value of uniqueness just from using Typescript and having dumb clashes of type variable names, which may be unrelated.<p>But like a lot of Haskell much of this still goes over my head.<p>I&#x27;m so conflicted and my intuition is to leave this to the CS university types and focus on IRL productivity in my own field. But I want to invest more time into FP in the future.<p>I&#x27;m also technically a &quot;frontend developer&quot; professionally :p')
