The non-majority pool will not change membership to itself. Membership changes require consensus among the original cluster participants, which the non-majority pool cannot achieve. If connection is re-established the protocol gracefully handles bringing the nodes up to speed on any transactions they missed. If the majority pool changes membership to kick out the non-majority pool nodes, when reconnection is established they&#x27;ll just be ignored.')
