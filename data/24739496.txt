Although the animal was tentatively identified as a baiji, the presence of only one or a few animals, particularly of advanced age, is not enough to save a functionally extinct species from true extinction. The last known living baiji was Qiqi (淇淇), which died in 2002.<p>I think the problem is that you can never really know for sure if a species is extinct. But this is pretty sad, and I wouldn&#x27;t know why anyone would want to go in an argument to prove the GP incorrect.')
