First and foremost, it implies the use of much higher weights and workloads than what a typical non-professional stronglifts or starting strength type lifter might be using. This is related to the next two factors: potential use of performance-enhancing drugs, and potential obesity. Without these two factors, you&#x27;d plateau at lower and safer weight, close to your natural limit.<p>2. It implies the potential use of performance-enhancing drugs that push you beyond your limits; the limits of strength, and the limits of what&#x27;s safe and healthy.<p>3. It implies potential obesity: competitive lifting requires massive amounts of food in order to fully recover and continue lifting as much as possible. Teamed with performance enhancers, one might achieve a strength level, body weight, and muscle mass far higher than one&#x27;s bones and ligaments evolved to handle.<p>So if you&#x27;re using good form, not eating inordinate amounts of food, and not using performance-enhancers, you can safely and healthily deadlift. You will move less weight than the professional, but it will be weight that your body is more naturally capable of handling.')
