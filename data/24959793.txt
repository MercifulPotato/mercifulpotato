(My American Aunt has always insisted SMS was obscenely expensive and refused to use it to communicate.)<p>Do you get Data as standard with the plan? (Eg is it that people can&#x27;t easily use WhatsApp because they don&#x27;t have data when out and about or is it that people just won&#x27;t agree which IP product to use in the first place?)<p>Really appreciated; thank you :)')
