They <i>love</i> unions, just not when workers make them. They call them “associations”, “councils”, “chambers of commerce”, etc. They serve on each other’s boards, they form cabals to limit employee pay, and they lobby the government to make it easier to get rid of you whenever they please.<p>Corporations and the rich love socialism. They need it. It’s socialism for them, brutal capitalism and rugged individualism for everyone else. The fools of tech listen to their words and ignore their actions.')
