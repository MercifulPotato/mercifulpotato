Item(by='curryst', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603794799, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24881198, text='A lot of medical software is severely lacking, and general practitioners often operate solo practices where they operate by the doctor&#x27;s preferences (which might make everyone else&#x27;s life very difficult, such as the people who have to handle recurring appointments).  I&#x27;ve been around some doctors that will do things like ban using the recurring appointments because when they double click the appointment it takes them to the &quot;edit recurring appointment&quot; page, not the &quot;take patient notes page&quot;.  So yes, their office may be literally unequipped to handle the passage of time because either their EHR system sucks, or the doctor is making everyone else&#x27;s life hard.<p>Psychiatrists seem to operate out of groups more often (I see far fewer solo psychiatrists).  Groups mean that you have to have EHR software that works well enough to transfer patients between doctors, and you have to have standards set up to where doctors can read patient histories from other doctors.  Basically your EHR system needs to be functional, which has nice side effects like making scheduling and prescription refills work correctly.')
