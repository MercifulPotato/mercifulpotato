Item(by='elyobo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602400958, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24744151, text='I&#x27;m largely uninsured.<p>* I insure my car, because I&#x27;m not a good driver - I don&#x27;t generally drive though, and would prefer to go without, but my wife wants one even though it would be cheaper to Uber everywhere that we actually travel.<p>* I own an apartment, and building corp levies include insurance on the building (but don&#x27;t insure contents). This is an insurance I would keep even if it wasn&#x27;t mandatory; the tail risk is too expensive for me to recover from.<p>* I have health insurance (in Australia, where the public health system is good) only for tax reasons (it would cost me almost as much _not_ to have insurance). Public health system is sufficient that this would not generally be required.<p>I should probably insure more (life, income protection, probably home contents, maybe but probably not actually useful health insurance).')
