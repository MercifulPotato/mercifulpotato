Lower notes tend to have harmonics that are stronger than the base frequency. At least on a piano. Similar issue with mid-range notes that are fading - the fundamental frequency will fade quicker than the harmonics. There&#x27;s also a separate issue with detecting higher-pitch notes, because the spectrum response to these is very weak.<p>That is, spectrum alone is not enough to do any sort of reliable note detection. That&#x27;s where I started too, but none of simple approaches worked well.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Goertzel_algorithm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Goertzel_algorithm</a>')
