Some just run on an internal timer, which is a bit like catching a train by walking of the platform at random points.<p>If you tell the compositor to fuck of by overriding the windows redirect state or have a compositor that at least detects full screen windows you generally get no screen tearing at the cost of everything the compositor normally does.')
