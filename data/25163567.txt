You also should have included something specific about this particular post, instead of tossing off something cheap and generic.<p>This is not a hard call. The comment was obvious flamebait. Every remotely similar thread gets these generic, indignant objections, and they lead to the same flamewar over and over again. That&#x27;s not what HN is for.<p>&gt; I never dismissed it, merely sought to further understand.<p>That does not seem to me a plausible interpretation of your comment. If it really was your intent, you needed to make that much clearer. When it comes to inflammatory topics on the internet, the burden is on the commenter to disambiguate intent: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=disambiguate%20burden%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=disambiguate%20burden%20by:dan...</a>. If a comment looks like a drive-by one-liner and quacks like a drive-by one-liner, then it&#x27;s trolling, whether you meant it to or not. We have to judge these things by their effects: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=troll%20effects%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=troll%20effects%20by:dang&amp;date...</a>.')
