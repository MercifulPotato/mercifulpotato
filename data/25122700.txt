And each of them could in some cases also modify or even delete the data depending on the switches.<p>Imagine there was no division between DML and DDL - you just have to remember which option switches change the schema in addition to doing some other things.<p>And then people would say &quot;SQL is very simple, just learn relational algebra&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s how I feel about git :)<p>With SQL I know for sure I can&#x27;t break the database by doing a select. I know I can&#x27;t change schema by doing a DML.<p>With git I&#x27;m pretty sure I can&#x27;t break anything by doing git status, but other than that all bets are off.')
