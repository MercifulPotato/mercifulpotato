Item(by='jacurtis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607367899, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25331895, text='&gt; &quot;The rest is just him trying to make a long enough article out of one sentence of information&quot;<p>This is how I understand the article too. Bloomberg probably tried to recruit a source within the Apple Silicon team who wouldn&#x27;t provide much information, but did say &quot;well the Mac Pro will have a CPU better than any other high end PC&quot;.<p>Bloomberg wanted to run with that line since they have &quot;unique&quot; information so they could capitalize on it. So the author was told to write an article about it, with really only half a sentence of fuel to run with. So the author states the half-sentence, and then proceeds to use conjecture and speculation to fill out the requisite 500 words needed per the Bloomberg Style Guide that they are forced to file for submitted work.')
