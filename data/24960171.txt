Item(by='taviso', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604245292, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24959267, text='Vi is a text editor, not a word processor.<p>The important difference (for me) is that a word processor understands proportional font geometries and physical page dimensions, so I can layout the page interactively. For example, I have some text that I want to fit on a single page of A4 in Helvetica 12pt, and I&#x27;m willing to edit it until it fits.<p>I think that&#x27;s a really hard problem to solve in a text editor, but it&#x27;s trivial in a word processor.<p>I also use WordPerfect for DOS, because it&#x27;s a full-featured word processor that you can use in a terminal (I think the author of this site uses it in graphical mode, but I prefer to use it in an xterm).<p>Here&#x27;s a screenshot, notice how WordPerfect knows where the text will wrap.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;taviso&#x2F;status&#x2F;1303841149421891584" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;taviso&#x2F;status&#x2F;1303841149421891584</a>')
