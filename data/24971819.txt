Which is that the project page does not attempt to specifically define itself; Rather it assumes the reader understands it&#x27;s purpose.<p>Server side application alone is a useful enough specifier.<p>The only relevant word in it&#x27;s first few paragraphs is &quot;stack&quot; which has been claimed by the Web people (&quot;full stack developer&quot;).<p>This is analogous to American&#x27;s omitting the specifier that \n&quot;America&quot; because they assume all of their readers are also American.<p>I think the basic sin here is trading specificity for elegance. Your readme is very elegant, but it&#x27;s not very informative for people from outside your target domain. This will include students and beginners to your target domain, which will ultimately hurt your adoption.<p>My point can be summed up as this:<p>&quot;go-to template for the perfect stack&quot; is jargon that only has meaning for a narrow subset of your audience.<p>&quot;Perfect&quot; is also overselling this thing. I respect tools that give me a clear idea of when to use it, and when not to.<p>This slogan ultimately says &quot;Stator is a template&quot;<p>What is a template? That term is far too overloaded to be useful.<p>I&#x27;d call this thing &quot;an opinionated starting point for modern web applications&quot;. The most informative section of the document is the &quot;Technical Stack&quot; section.<p>Now what I&#x27;m trying to figure out is what aspect of this thing is not &quot;glue&quot; that holds these pieces together? Is it all glue?<p>Just to be clear, I think this repo has tremendous value. I&#x27;m giving you my stream of consciousness feedback in an effort to help you understand what the average developer&#x27;s immediate response to this page is.<p>I think if you sent this link to any random developer on slack, their first response would be &quot;what is it?&quot;. I think your readme can do a bit better job answering that question.')
