Minimizing the shared cost of throwing the thing away.<p>2. Maximizing durability.<p>3. Maximizing the actual efficacy of the thing.<p>4. Maximizing worker benefit - economical and political.<p>5. Minimizing animal suffering.<p>Not everyone is going to have the same mix of goals or order of goals and many have just one overriding goal: Minimizing up-front consumer cost.<p>So, for example, a &quot;smart-fiber&quot; shirt might be far more durable than a 100% cotton shirt, the throw-away cost is much higher so I&#x27;ll pass. I&#x27;m not saying your site should account for this, but things are complicated, especially among conscious consumers which is an increasingly niche market anyway due to both preference and circumstance.<p>Edit: Oh I should also add somewhere in there<p>#. Maximizing ease of repair&#x2F;cleaning.<p>eg. MacBook vs. Pinebook or Carpet vs. Hardwood etc.')
