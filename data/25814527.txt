Lots and lots of spying.<p>Seriously.<p>Googletagmanager&#x2F;analytics is <i>everywhere</i>, it doesn&#x27;t deserve to be, it doesn&#x27;t need to be. That domain needs to die a painful, horrible death.<p>facebook, twitter, sessioncam, and many others are used to bloat pages, increase my energy usage, decrease my battery quicker and contribute to the wastage of energy on an unprecedented scale.<p>Just ask yourself, how much money, battery life, bandwidth is spent every year on downloading useless scripts that as far as I can see offer no value whatsoever. By selectively deciding what scripts to enable I get the folliowing result:<p>1: pages are lighter, less bloated, and STILL WORK<p>2: I download less scripts, use less battery and save bandwidth and energy for myself and all humanity.<p>3: There is less spying as fetch() requests are blocked and there can be hundreds of them across a single web-page session (you can watch really bloated pages for 10 minutes, there can be 100&#x27;s of requests easily).<p>Test: load the following two pages, study their usage, test each with JS enabled&#x2F;disabled:<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com</a> (with JS:2.69, without: 2.34mb)<p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reddit.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reddit.com</a> (with JS: 8.58mb, without: 8.10kb, but the page is broken...)<p>Baring in mind old.reddit works fine with JS disabled, showing JS is not needed for a site like reddit to work at all.<p>Yet, &quot;web developers&quot; use them as if it&#x27;s nothing. Pages that execute over seconds, possibly MB&#x27;s of data, all the additional requests that are made to enrich the likes of FB&#x2F;Google et al.<p>So no, SPA are a scam and the web is worse today than I remember back in the 2000&#x27;s, at least we didn&#x27;t have cookie pop up boxes because people can&#x27;t help but abuse JS.<p>Most of the GDPR violations I&#x27;ve found thus far are from scripts that have no place or purpose, that slurp up user data without remorse, that, if disabled, doesn&#x27;t impact the functionality of the page, and that enables the great surveillance capitalism and data-raping we are seeing today.')
