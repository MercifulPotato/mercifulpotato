Even alcohol was consider a big deal with my family and many friends (many not all). The closet I&#x27;ve gotten is smoking weed and that too only once and I didn&#x27;t feel anything.<p>Reading articles about common drug use and watching Hollywood movies really makes me feel as if I&#x27;ve missed a big part of living life :( I wish I too had friends like this who would have helped me experiment and live life like this.')
