I suspect that for most types of software work many orders of magnitude more for the former. Software developers can go their whole career without encountering a compiler bug and can basically assume it is flawless even they they read blog posts and change-logs informing them that it is not. But they likely will encounter an issue on every single project they have their framework that irks them. Maybe this is just my niche of software though (web-based, enterprise, saas type software). I could imagine those working on system software in lower-level languages fighting the compiler much more.')
