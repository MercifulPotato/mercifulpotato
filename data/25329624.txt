E.g. you search some data structure for an element. Initially you may do this so that the search returns the element itself or NULL if it&#x27;s not found, but then you realize you&#x27;ll also need to use the same searching logic to insert and delete elements. In this light you rewrite the search to return a pointer to the location instead; this way you can use it as a subroutine for all the operations.')
