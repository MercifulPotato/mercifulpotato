Item(by='vharuck', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602530109, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24757100, text='&gt;The simple expression of an idea w&#x2F;o the intent to cause harm to another party, and the sole intention of discourse should be protected no matter what.<p>The point is Holocaust denial is often used as a foot in the door to spread racial animosity, which has caused harm.  It can be hard to determine what&#x27;s legitimate research and debate versus racist dog whistling.  But people recognize it&#x27;s having a real effect in the world, and the marketplace of ideas hasn&#x27;t quashed it over the past 70 years.<p>I&#x27;m all for Facebook removing anything like Holocaust denial or debate over it&#x27;s existence.  That&#x27;s a good trade-off: prevent a gradual acceptance of racism at the cost of not being a good venue for Holocaust history researchers.<p>But I&#x27;m not for the government taking action.  Just my anti-establishment American streak.')
