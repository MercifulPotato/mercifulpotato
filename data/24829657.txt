Right now, it&#x27;s not meant to be implemented from its spec. The spec documents what the protocol is doing, because you want to know that in order to analyze it. It&#x27;s not meant to facilitate clean-room interop.<p>WireGuard isn&#x27;t an IETF protocol. In fact, it&#x27;s a repudiation of IETF protocol design.<p>Right now, you should use WireGuard implementations Jason endorses, and avoid implements he expresses concerns about.')
