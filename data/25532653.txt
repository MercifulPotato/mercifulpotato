Epistemology convetionally begins with a definition of knowledge as a justified belief in a proposition that is true, and the people who gave the 1-day answer did indeed believe the true proposition that the Earth revolves around the sun (subject to the caveats in the article). Was that belief justified? Well, they they probably received it from a knowledgable source, and if that is not regarded as justification, then by that standard, no-one knows much at all. It is also clear, however, that they do not have much understanding of the situation to which the proposition pertains. Epistemology, IMHO, should spend less time fussing over knowledge being a collection of propositions, and focus more on what it means to understand something.')
