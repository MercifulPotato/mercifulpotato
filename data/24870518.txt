Could we train researchers in another, more efficient way? Maybe, but PhD program are the current means of training specialized researchers.<p>&gt; plus extra student loan debt<p>For researcher jobs, this will almost never be true. The vast majority of STEM PhD students are fully-funded and given a stipend (although usually small). The dynamics of course change if the student has to support other dependents.<p>&gt; Even with a higher salary (and higher tax burden), it&#x27;s not clear that you come out on top during your lifetime<p>For fields like Computer Science, there are many viable and high-salaried career for non-PhDs, so a PhD will likely lose lifetime money. For other fields like biomedical research, then they will probably profit over a full career. But really, people don&#x27;t do PhDs for the money, people like their fields, they like the university environment, they like being around other researchers, or they like the independenceâ€”all of these things can be valuable beyond lifetime salary.')
