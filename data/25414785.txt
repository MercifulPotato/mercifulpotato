I think it&#x27;s really impressive.<p>What&#x27;s even more intriguing is that these days, when we know about climate change and pollution, people still don&#x27;t see cars as tools. When you look at it from the outside, buying 1.5 tons of rusting steel just to transport your ass (that&#x27;s 2 tons in the US, I guess because of heavier asses?) from point A to point B should not be tied to your perception of self-worth and your social status. And yet.<p>A related thought: I think placing the exhaust in the back and down at the bottom was a master stroke. The driver doesn&#x27;t see or smell the pollution. I think a very effective measure to make people realize the pollution issues would be to require that the exhaust be placed in front, pointing upwards, and require adding a non-toxic colorant so that you can see the fumes.')
