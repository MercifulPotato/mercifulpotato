Can you please link me to evidence that Telegram does not have any way to encrypt video or audio calls?<p>You say Telegram is a for-profit company, but I am not sure how Telegram makes money, at all. It was approached by various government agencies looking for backdoors and claims to have rebuffed them all. Unless the whole thing with the founder of vkontakte having to give up his shares to mail.ru and run, was staged, I&#x27;m pretty sure he&#x27;s an anarcho-capitalist who isn&#x27;t very happy with states having data. So if that&#x27;s the case, Telegram (unlike Moxie Marlinspike and Jan Koum) is much less likely to sell out their platform down the line.')
