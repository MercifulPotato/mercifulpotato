It&#x27;s outside of Uber&#x27;s core competence, and it won&#x27;t lead to superprofits&#x2F;a moat for very long, since they&#x27;ll have competitors. Sure, it lowers their costs, but once a second (third, etc) competitor has SDCs, Uber will be able to <i>charge</i> a lot less as well, because <i>competitors</i> will have lower costs too. It&#x27;s not the golden ticket to profitability.<p>I&#x27;ve been long hoping, for their own sake, that they&#x27;d sell off the SDC division, since it was hurting their balance sheet anyway. Glad they&#x27;ve seen the light.')
