This is why you can still legally buy spores of the mushrooms that contain it: the compound does not exist in the spores.  This is almost certainly due to an oversight when the law was written.<p>Legality is weird.  In the Netherlands, over 100 species of psilocybin-containing mushrooms were banned.  But the law there bans only the fruiting bodies, it does not ban other parts of the organism.  A few species form truffles—a sterile mycelia mass for energy storage, kind of like its version of a potato—that still contain psilocybin.  Those can still be legally bought, probably because of a similar oversight in the law.')
