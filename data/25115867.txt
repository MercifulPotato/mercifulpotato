The ability to transfer disease between grocery stores might increase risk in a major way. It&#x27;s also not clear that interacting with one high-risk gig worker is better than interacting with twenty low-risk remote workers.<p>I&#x27;d be wary of coming to strong conclusions here without data; you can easily come up with plausible arguments either way.')
