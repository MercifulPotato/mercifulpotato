Item(by='NE2z2T9qi', descendants=None, kids=[25588526], score=None, time=1609375779, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25585624, text='I&#x27;m as libertarian as they come, but I&#x27;ve also lived in Baltimore and know how incapable the city is of controlling its crime. Baltimore&#x27;s homicide clearance rate in 2019 was 32%. Not only does that leave its residents living in fear, that also represents an outrageous injustice against victims whose deaths are written off as business as usual.<p>Baltimore residents have a right to set their own destiny, but if they reject innovations in crime control that at least have a chance of being effective, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll spend the next 30 years like the last 30: getting absolutely nowhere. I spent decades desperately hoping and expecting Baltimore to turn the corner. It&#x27;s an absolutely beautiful city with a rich history and many world-class cultural and educational institutions. But it hasn&#x27;t changed (except even more murders over the last 50 years) and won&#x27;t ever change if it doesn&#x27;t control its crime.<p>Frankly, the city already has many hundreds of street-level &quot;blue light&quot; cameras all over the place. To me, those are far more problematic and intrusive with respect to privacy than aerial surveillance. I&#x27;d much rather be an anonymous pixel on a giant map than a person whose recognizable features are video recorded and stored on a government street level security camera. To me, blue light cameras are both more problematic and fundamentally less effective. And yet, that&#x27;s what the city has already accepted as a worthwhile privacy trade off.')
