If there&#x27;s one good thing coming out of covid it&#x27;s hopefully long term sustained attention towards disease burden and public health.<p>In this thread there are already people complaining about dystopias. My dystopia is hundreds of thousands of people dying of preventable, mundane diseases every year because we give so little of a crap about public health that we let unvaccinated people into packed stadiums.<p>To me the dystopia isn&#x27;t the future, it&#x27;s the status quo.
