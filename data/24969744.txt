Item(by='codetrotter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604334070, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24969283, text='In my country, with the telecom operators that I have used, in the cases where I was using a phone that could not receive MMS, or I had the MMS profile disabled, the operator would send me an SMS instead with a link to an online customer portal on the web where I could view the contents of the MMS.<p>Curious whether this is something that telecom operators do all around the world or not.<p>Either way, I agree that being unable to receive MMS would be a show stopper for many. The most recent time, a few weeks ago, when I could not receive MMS, my operator would attempt to deliver the MMS first and only after a timeout of exactly 24H would they deliver the SMS with the link instead.<p>The MMS in question in my case was someone that I work with who was requesting that me and another person show up for a meeting the same day. So receiving the MMS 24H later was not much use. Fortunately in this instance the person contacted me through other channels when they hadn&#x27;t heard back on the MMS that they&#x27;d sent and which I had not yet received.<p>The reason that I could not receive the MMS at that time was that I had recently downgraded to a 0MB plan to save money. I have since bumped my plan one step up again, to 500MB included per month for the equivalent of about ~$3 extra per month, so that I am able to receive MMS and to get messages in various IM services, as well as to being able to use Google Maps, bus travel time table apps, and doing web browsing for the most important stuff when I really need it as well.<p>Sadly however, and now I am very much going out on a tangent here but, it&#x27;s actually really difficult to limit data usage to a sensible amount, because even though I have turned off mobile data for most of the apps, sometimes I forget that I am on mobile and I suddenly use a fair chunk more of my data than I meant to. And to make matters worse, sometimes my phone loses the WiFi connection and I don&#x27;t notice and again I use a chunk more than I meant to. With data rollover I have 676 MB available this month, and already I have used 266 MB and there is still 28 days left of the current billing cycle! Looking at the settings, I see now that I&#x27;d forgotten to disable mobile traffic for the Photos app and that it has consumed over 300 MB in total of my mobile data during the last two months. Hopefully having now turned that off I will still be able to manage with the remaining data for this billing cycle.')
