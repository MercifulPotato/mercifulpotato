The snapshots&#x2F;cow&#x2F;data integrity bit is definitely what I&#x27;m interested in as well. It feels to me like as long as I run ZFS under my servers I am much safer than anything else (and it&#x27;s easier&#x2F;possible to go back in time and undo mistakes).<p>Unfortunately, there&#x27;s that whole thing about it being hard to boot to.. Is that still a thing?')
