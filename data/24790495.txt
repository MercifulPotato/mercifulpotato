For most people they could easily use it. However the moment they gotta hop in terminal kills it for them. Linux is great if you know how to fix your problem or look in the right direction.<p>My main beef with it is driver support. It&#x27;s far better than it was 10 years ago but nobody wants to be dealing with that. It&#x27;s annoying. I can deal with program crashes or some minor feature not working right. I can&#x27;t deal with being hindered due to no drivers.<p>Linux will always just be a tool to me and nothing more. It&#x27;s a great fleshed out fully customizable tool. But it is hardly what it needs to be before widespread adoption will occur.')
