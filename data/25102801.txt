It&#x27;s going to be near-valueless (selling for parts) within another 6 years due to battery degradation [and not starting with that much range in the first place]. That&#x27;s after one major battery-out warranty repair by Nissan already.<p>The last two ICE cars I had, I <i>bought them</i> when they were 12 and 9 years old, rather than planning how to get them parted out at that age. I&#x27;ve very much enjoyed having an EV (especially as the guy who turns the wrenches), but they don&#x27;t last anywhere near as long as ICE cars without major infusions of cash for the battery.<p>My next car is very likely to be another 6-10 year-old ICE car where I&#x27;d probably never consider buying a 6-10 year-old pure EV.')
