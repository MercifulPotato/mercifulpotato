However up until recently you could NOT export yt vids from any “sub” yt accounts.  Ie I have one google account but 4x YouTube accounts under that google account.  Google support confirmed that you could only export your YouTube uploads for the primary account.  However as of about 6 months ago this was fixed and you can now takeout yt vids for all “child” accounts as well (and I have confirmed this).\nAltough it is a bit janky (as is all of takeout) as you need to use a separate yt&#x2F;takeout interface to do so.')
