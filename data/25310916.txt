The gist of it is that you help people out by giving them free stuff, but you kill the local food&#x2F;clothing&#x2F;shoe industry and therefore trap the very communities you intend to help into a cycle where they can never start businesses and raise their standard of living because nobody will buy their stuff because they get it for free through aid.<p>Also, the term &quot;third world&quot; is not offensive and most people are tired of playing this game where some group declares some term offensive and we are all expected to stop using it. You don&#x27;t get to dictate the language people use to talk and think about the world around them.')
