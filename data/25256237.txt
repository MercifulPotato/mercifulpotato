There is probably a non-zero error rate associated with that too. It&#x27;s not like the gov&#x27;t is sending checks to random Swedes - they were sent based on available sufficient tax criteria not originally intended to be used for entitlement distribution.<p>I do suspect most countries wouldn&#x27;t have a problem on the scale the US might because a) they have larger, simpler entitlement programs (qualifications tend to be based on a a small number of straightforward residency classes), and b) they do not generally process any tax paperwork from non-residents. It is the US&#x27;s stinginess and paradoxical fear of inefficiency that hurts it here.')
