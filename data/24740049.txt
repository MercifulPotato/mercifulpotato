And the compiler won&#x27;t let you &quot;access&quot; the customer until you&#x27;ve safely checked that the result is, indeed, the customer rather than an error.<p>In this way you end up encoding more intent within your types and behaviours rather than implicitly letting the consumer figure it out themselves.')
