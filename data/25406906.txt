Many parents also had difficulty finding an extra $130 per child to pay for them; the schools wouldn&#x27;t provide returnable ones like they did with textbooks.<p>In contrast, when I went to college (also in the US), we got a simple one-line &quot;+-*&#x2F;^&quot; calculator for the first few years of calculus, engineering maths, etc.<p>Personally, I learned much better with the simple calculator. Complex graphing calculators do seem more suited to professional use than education.')
