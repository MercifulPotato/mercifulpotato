I think the internet may be magnifying the impacts more than we realise and that these political games are trends to be worn one day and taken off the next with not much fundamental change.<p>There certainly seems more polarization on Twitter for example but I wonder whether in reality it&#x27;s like this. Loud people on Twitter make loud noises and newspapers hear loud voices. Most people can avoid joining sides quite happily, that they don&#x27;t need to belong to any political club. I&#x27;m not American so it doesn&#x27;t seem that polarizing where I am.<p>I think that on the Internet, we are not being taught skills for peace and co-existence. Ironically real tolerance and peace is not being promoted by any political group, mainstream or anti-mainstream no matter how much they are against intolerance. Seems like thats what religions used to do?')
