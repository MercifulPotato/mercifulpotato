Item(by='stormbrew', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608332108, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25465852, text='display:table and display:grid are not really the same class of thing? One lets you make things act more like pre-css html, the other is a completely new addition to the box model.<p>&quot;breaks the box model&quot; might be too strong, I&#x27;ll admit. But table-styled elements don&#x27;t act <i>quite</i> like other things in the box model even so. It&#x27;s confusing and messy and anyways you have to contort your document to fit things together in a way that works with it most of the time.<p>On the other hand I&#x27;m saying display:grid is good, but took way too long to get here.')
