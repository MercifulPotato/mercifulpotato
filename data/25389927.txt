I think the first wave in the springtime killed a lot of vulnerable populations in nursing homes and assisted living. I&#x27;m surprised the &quot;third&quot; wave we are currently experiencing hasn&#x27;t led to more excessive mortality, but I think we will be seeing that data spike once this chart gets updated in a few weeks.<p>Suffice to say, if we had been more responsive, more cooperative, and more on top of our response earlier in the year, many thousands of lives could&#x27;ve been saved.')
