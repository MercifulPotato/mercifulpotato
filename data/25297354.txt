This <i>not</i> reducible to a look-up in a hashtable. It requires taking into account some complicated things about the definition of a word and the context in which it is written. \nYou might think that&#x27;s grammar checking but the boundary is not clear and in any case, any language processing application starts with tokenizing and deciding what counts as words and on what basis.<p>What is a word even ? Is &quot;CIA&quot; a word ? What about &quot;C.I.A.&quot; ? What about C (as in the language) ? What about c (as in the speed of light) ? 2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine ? \nHow does the spellchecker handle dashes and apostrophes ? What about proper nouns ?<p>Really, the example is poorly chosen.')
