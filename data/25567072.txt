For example, a positive cue stimulus activates the inhibitory and excitatory subgroups selective for that stimulus and deactivates the negative stimulus subgroups. During the delay period, the inhibition strength between these two inhibitory subgroups dictates the stability of the cue-specific activity patterns generated during the stimulus window. The positive feedback provided by the similarly tuned excitatory neurons sustains the stimulus-specific activity of the inhibitory subgroups.')
