Without active maintenance, odds are neither tower would last a century. Generally the more advanced a technology is, the more fragile it is, and the more reliant on other advanced technology to maintain it. If you want something that lasts a long time, you&#x27;re best bet is to stick to something simple like solid granite, though even if your artifact remains mostly intact, it&#x27;s useless if it gets buried under sediment or weathered to the point that it&#x27;s unrecognizable as an artificial construct.')
