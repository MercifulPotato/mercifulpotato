I understand that NASA <i>thought</i> it needed the vehicle. However I&#x27;m saying it did not in fact need it for any missions. (The idea for docking in earth orbit at the start of a mission is not new.)<p>Very different thing, and you actually demonstrate those points.<p>Everything starts with the misplaced thought that it needs to be so big. Not actually required.<p>Probably correct thought that it needs to be NASA-made since it wouldn&#x27;t make sense commercially, but this is a consequence of misplaced thought 1.<p>Expensive to spend pork. Again, not needed for the mission, if something more sensible was chosen in the first place.<p>There could have been a capsule flying on Atlas V for many years already. The ESAS study just had all kind of really bad assumptions that made Ares happen instead.')
