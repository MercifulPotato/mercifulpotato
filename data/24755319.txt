The same misquoted, manipulated statistics, the same concern trolling, the same dog whistles. There isn&#x27;t any point in listening. Some people hate me for what I am. They want to take my rights away from me, they want to restrict my ability to access medicine, they want to stop me from being in the military (not that I wish to join). Why should I listen to one more person lie and spread hate?')
