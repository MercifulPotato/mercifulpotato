Since I&#x27;m not a Mac user I&#x27;ve definitely yearned for Keynote-like animations etc. so this could be really useful.<p>That said, something here doesn&#x27;t seem to add up to me. Pitch is launching now, two years after being founded by seven founders, raised 50M(!) in funding and has 89 employees?<p>I can&#x27;t figure out why \n1. they didn&#x27;t launch sooner \n2. why they need so many people\n3. why it&#x27;s a freemium model \n4. How they _already_ raised $50M.<p>It looks like a cool product and I might sign up to play around but something doesn&#x27;t add up.')
