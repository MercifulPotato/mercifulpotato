I&#x27;ve worked in code bases and extended internal libraries that forgo the getters&#x2F;setters model, for exposing member variables directly, and it&#x27;s not better.<p>If you ever need to change something about that value, do additional logic before returning (I e.   emit metrics), or model a data class with an interface having getter methods makes these so much easier.')
