Sure it&#x27;s not much work in this instance, but what happens when people move on to being offended by blacklist, or sanity check, or one of the other thousands of terms that can be warped to be offensive. And then if you refuse to change because it makes no sense and is a lot of work, you become some kind of racist&#x2F;sexist because the expectation is that you change your language to accommodate the tiny number of people who are offended for no reason.<p>Language is a tool, and changes over time. If the meaning of a word actually changes to mean something offensive of course we should change it. But that isn&#x27;t what has happened here, instead people are picking out one offensive definition of &quot;master&quot; and trying to apply it to places where it doesn&#x27;t make sense. Are we going to rename &quot;master of ceremonies&quot;, or &quot;master record&quot;? Of course not, because in a language where words have multiple definitions, context matters.')
