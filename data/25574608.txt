Item(by='erikerikson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609274222, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25570376, text='The guidelines, as linked by chlodwig[0] to the report[1], clearly state that if you don&#x27;t drink you should avoid it and that if you do drink that you likely over consume and should limit yourself.  This is right before citing increased risk of death associated with consumption.  The implication that we should avoid alcohol seems rather clear, contrary to the headline.  Even in the article, the subtext undermines the headline.  It is accurate in that it doesn&#x27;t explicitly tell us to stop but fairly meaninglessly so.<p>I wonder if anyone actually thinks everyone would stop if these guidelines told us to, especially given our ongoing lack of compliance.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25572471" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25572471</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dietaryguidelines.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;2020-12&#x2F;Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dietaryguidelines.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;2020-1...</a>')
