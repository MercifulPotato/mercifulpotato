It isn&#x27;t Linus I&#x27;m necessarily mad at, its his legion of fanboys who make crappy arguments based off of Linus&#x27;s words.<p>Its not just the AVX512 example: people copy&#x2F;paste his opinion on C++, Geekbench, and a whole slew of other issues constantly. Linus&#x27;s arguments become memes throughout Reddit and are echo&#x27;d without analysis.<p>--------<p>But that&#x27;s what happens when you put an &quot;Expert&quot; on a pedestal. People take their words, meme them out into new arguments, and then they don&#x27;t necessarily apply anymore in the new situations.<p>That&#x27;s my experience with &quot;experts&quot;. The expert themselves are real, but the words they say can become warped through discussion to the point where they&#x27;re meaningless.')
