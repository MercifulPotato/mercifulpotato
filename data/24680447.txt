I.e., a site like HN knows emails, pseudonyms, and posting history. What if they got a request like this from someone who claimed not to have access to the email they used to sign up? HN couldn&#x27;t possibly comply.<p>Maybe that doesn&#x27;t matter because posting history is public. One could easily envision another site that had some non-public data associated with email address, pseudonym, and no other PII. That site definitely violates the requirements you describe.')
