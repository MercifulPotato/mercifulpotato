Don&#x27;t wait until some specific milestone, show it to people immediately.<p>The biggest mistake that people make is waiting too long before showing people what they are doing, and after they put in months of effort they are disappointed that nobody seems to care about their stuff.<p>If you can&#x27;t find someone who will play your really rough first proof of concept, then you probably won&#x27;t find people who will play the finished game either.<p>(Also, just because someone will try one version of the game, doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;ll be your beta tester for ever. You&#x27;ll need to find new people to try your game all the time. If your game is good it should get easier.)')
