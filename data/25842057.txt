In other words, securely share a complete draft with beta readers and get their feedback nicely organized in an easy to use app.<p>The app works best with markdown, but very early on I had to add &quot;paste from word&quot; and rich text formatting because I discovered that, while _I_ write fiction in markdown, only ~5% of other authors do.<p>Too bad, because it fits really well for the task, and there are so many great long-form markdown writing tools. I personally prefer Ulysses for Mac.')
