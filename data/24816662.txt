In future, people moving to solar will get cheaper and less reliable.<p>That is a very different situation. There is incentive to take the less reliable power now. Uses will be found for it. I&#x27;m happy to make changes to my lifestyle if it saves me a bunch of money, and industrial consumers will start to adapt over a decade if the incentives line up.<p>It won&#x27;t be the end of reliable power generation, but if it is economically sensible then the options will be explored deeply.')
