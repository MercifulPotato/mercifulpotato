In this instance, this is the first trade agreement that has had China, Japan, and South Korea as signatories. Also, despite their posturing China is a HUGE economic power and everyone in the region would prefer to ride that wave instead of be crushed by it.<p>&gt; Do they not fear alienating the US?<p>To a certain extent the US has alienated the rest of the world with it&#x27;s &quot;America first&quot; Trump policy. This is just the logical progression of countries moving on to fill the economic power gap the US has left in the Pacific.<p>&gt;  I suppose once we scuttled the TPP they had no alternatives?<p>Lol. Everyone else went onto sign the CPTTP which went into effect 30 Dec 2018 which was largely identical to the original TTP, excluding the inclusion of the US of course.')
