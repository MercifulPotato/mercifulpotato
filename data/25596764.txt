I haven&#x27;t regularly commuted for a long time and almost certainly never will again. But even when I went into an office regularly, I mostly left at 5-6pm. Never felt it was useful to put in more hours than that. (Travel, well, not these days, but you know what I mean is a different matter.)<p>That said, when I was commuting, I did have a lot of meals I could throw together quickly (or had made ahead)--probably faster than going out for takeout to be honest.')
