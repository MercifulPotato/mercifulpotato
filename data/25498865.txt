But what&#x27;s to stop _anyone_ else from getting into that same business? And doing it better? Maybe you create an initial advantage, but for how long? Game consoles come to mind.<p>You have to keep in mind that the natural outcome of capitalism is to create a forsaken hellscape of competition where individual companies struggle to make margins good enough to survive.<p>In this case, the truism is to commoditize your <i>complement</i>. Companies have an incentive to push as much capitalism as they can into things they don&#x27;t make money on, and keep the capitalism away from their main products as long as they can.<p>So eg Google don&#x27;t want to commoditize maps, because they&#x27;re happy having a monopoly on mapping services. Google&#x27;s <i>competitors</i> want to commoditize maps, because by doing so they undercut Google and make their own cloud service &#x2F; phone OS &#x2F; office suite &#x2F; other all-encompassing orwellian service more competitive.')
