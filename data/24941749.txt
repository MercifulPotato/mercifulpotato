Fascism uses economic and class features that largely do not exist in a far-left society, such as a sizeable middle class and corporate power.<p>From Umberto Eco&#x27;s definition of fascism: &quot;&#x27;Appeal to a Frustrated Middle Class&#x27;, fearing economic pressure from the demands and aspirations of lower social groups.&quot;<p>From Gentile&#x27;s definition: &quot;corporative organization of the economy that suppresses trade union liberty, broadens the sphere of state intervention, and seeks to achieve, by principles of technocracy and solidarity, the collaboration of the &#x27;productive sectors&#x27; under control of the regime, to achieve its goals of power, yet preserving private property and class divisions;&quot;<p>I understand that it is appealing to try to dilute the meaning of &quot;fascism&quot; by applying it overly broadly until it loses its meaing. Whataboutism is also convenient way for the Right to distance themselves from the evils committed by the right-wing Nazis and other far-right fascist groups.<p>The better way for the Right to distance itself is by supporting moderate democratic norms rather than giving in to violent populist impulses.
