In a free nation, it derives that right through various rituals from the consent of the governed, but it remains a fact: if a governmental leader says, for example, &quot;There&#x27;s a curfew, stay home or be arrested&quot;, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going to happen.<p>If I message someone else &quot;leave your house and me and my boys will stomp you&quot;, it&#x27;s different, isn&#x27;t it.<p>So I ask again: <i>why</i> should there be one set of rules for both?')
