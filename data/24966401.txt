Virtual DOM libraries aren&#x27;t necessarily the only&#x2F;best solution.</i><p>That is surely true as well. Even a perfect implementation of a VDOM library is necessarily doing a lot of extra work compared to direct DOM updates if you already know exactly what needs changing. For a “typical” SPA, if there is such a thing, React’s virtual DOM system is fast enough to make its declarative UI strategy viable, which is enough to make it widely useful. However, it can still become a bottleneck given sufficiently demanding conditions. React without a lot of help can still choke quite easily if it’s asked to render something like a table with thousands of cells or an intricate SVG diagram that needs to animate smoothly.<p>Giving React the help it needs typically means bypassing some of the diff logic one way or another, for example by providing sCU in a class-based component or a list of dependencies to hooks. However, these kinds of changes also introduce potential inconsistency between what you’d normally render and what gets rendered with a bypass in place, which creates an opportunity for bugs and seems to be fighting against the whole idea of declaring your UI once and then letting React worry about all the details of maintaining it.')
