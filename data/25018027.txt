We should go back to the old system of a 2&#x2F;3 majority required. No more 50&#x2F;50 simple majority, as the Democrats instituted a while back. I find that a disaster.<p>Senate Republicans were the ones who lowered the requirement for Supreme Court confirmations to a simple majority, not the Democrats[0]. Senate Democrats had reduced the threshold for presidential appointments <i>excluding</i> the Supreme Court as a result of chronic filibustering by the Republican congress during Obama’s term[1].<p>I agree with you that something needs to be done about SCOTUS nominations. It’s clear to me that the stakes are currently <i>way</i> too high. Turning the court into a political football has created an incredibly dangerous situation that risks undermining its authority and the rule of law.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;04&#x2F;06&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;neil-gorsuch-supreme-court-senate.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;04&#x2F;06&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;neil-gorsuch-...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usatoday.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;factcheck&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;01&#x2F;fact-check-gop-ended-senate-filibuster-supreme-court-nominees&#x2F;3573369001&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usatoday.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;factcheck&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;01&#x2F;fac...</a>')
