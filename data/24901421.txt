Item(by='CobrastanJorji', descendants=None, kids=[24901718, 24903671, 24901475], score=None, time=1603746478, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24899863, text='Youtube-dl had some good notes in their README about legitimate uses and an explanation about how they tried to avoid adding sites that specialized in infringing content, but they really did themselves a legal disservice by explicitly using copyrighted music video content as tests. That will not help their argument at all. Youtube-dl absolutely has important and completely legal uses, reporting being among them, but the law doesn&#x27;t care whether it CAN be used for legal purposes. The law only cares if the tool was &quot;primarily designed&quot; or &quot;marketed&quot; or &quot;has only limited non-infringing purpose.&quot;<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;m no lawyer, but I think there&#x27;s a (possibly bad) argument that youtube-dl does not violate 17 USC §§1201(a)(2)(a) because it does not circumvent any technological measures to control access to any content. The video is transferred entirely in the clear to any anonymous users that request it. Youtube-dl makes no false claims or breaks no cryptography or encryption. What measure is in place that is being circumvented?')
