Is it possible you haven&#x27;t tried those other services? Having access to lots of music is certainly better than not but we&#x27;ve had services that do that since the early 2000s.<p>I subscribed to Rhapsody in 2004. It gave me access to &quot;nearly any artist&#x27;s catalogue available for almost free&quot;. As 2 examples of things it did better, instead of using a shitty recommendation system that when I pick some electro swing band it recommends death metal, instead for every artist it showed their lists of who influenced them and who they influenced. I found tons of great bands that way. Way more than i&#x27;ve found on Spotify&#x27;s crappy system<p>And that&#x27;s just one example. The now dead Google Play Music&#x27;s recommendation system actually worked where Spotify&#x27;s does not.')
