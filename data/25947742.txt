But, it isn&#x27;t so simple.<p>Moderation isn&#x27;t something that&#x27;s changed. Forums and modern social media both moderate. They do it to varying degrees.<p>Social media moderation comes in multiple forms. First they will choose which posts people see in their feed. This is a form of moderation. It&#x27;s easy to have topics and even people just not show up. What shows up is based around engagement and money.<p>There is also moderation about content. People can be labeled or removed from visibility.<p>Then there is banning where banning isn&#x27;t on the topic but the whole system. And the systems are tied to other things (e.g., banning on FB impacts your Oculus ownership).<p>Old school forums were based on topics and were different systems. They were moderated, if they were, for that system. The moderation was typically around content you posted. They didn&#x27;t control the flow or order you saw it in. It was the content.<p>When banning came up, it was just for that form. So, if someone is banned from a jeep owners forum they are just fine interacting in a forum on web design.<p>I say this to note that the way the technology is developed has an impact on the way people act.<p>For example, these days there are people who don&#x27;t want to speak out on some topics because they are fearful they will be banned or negatively impacted globally.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting how the technology should be built. I&#x27;m trying to point out how the system design impacts the way people think and behave. Older systems were designed differently and had a different impact. It&#x27;s worth noting these things.')
