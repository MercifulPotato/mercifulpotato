The market for office space is cratering, as is the market for 1BR apts&#x2F;condos in dense urban cores.  But most of the people who would&#x27;ve occupied those buildings are still working, they&#x27;re just working from home.  The market for SFHs (particularly large suburban ones with home offices) is exploding.  I&#x27;m seeing some in Mountain View and the SF peninsula go for ~$350-500K (up to 15-18%) over asking.')
