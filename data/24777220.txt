The client would keep track of which messages were read, and so when new ones were posted you&#x27;d only see new messages by default.<p>Each NNTP server could talk to other NNTP servers. They would exchange a list of forums each had, and then the articles had in each forum. Each article&#x2F;post had a unique ID (basically like the Message-ID in e-mails), and so each could request articles from the other that they did not already have. New messages could be posted to either server and they would &#x27;cross pollinate&#x27; (multi-master basically).<p>Each NNTP server could technically talk to multiple other NNTP servers, so cross-pollination could be very wide, but in the early days with low-kbps modems and expensive long distance, there was a lot of local hierarchical hubs.<p>There were a few key hubs that had fancy long-distance T1 and such that could transfer across continents and oceans as a bit of a service for the community.')
