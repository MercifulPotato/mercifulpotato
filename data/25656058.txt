If they don&#x27;t want to violate privacy, they run a survey. What if the response rate among a historical disenfranchised group (e.g. African Americans) is terrible? The modern &quot;data driven&quot; marketer would see little reason to advertise on Black media properties. This isn&#x27;t a fictious example - it&#x27;s a current problem in the media planning &#x2F; agency industry.<p>* A local government has to decide between investing in more ESL resources in public education vs. other competing budget needs. They look at census &#x2F; community survey data (which some Hispanic and immigrant populations are fearful of responding to d&#x2F;t politicization) and decide to prioritize other asks due to undercounted demand. The data could also be skewed in other ways that warp their decision, like allocating budget to school zones that only represent specific immigrant communities that haven&#x27;t historically been disenfranchised.<p>The big picture issue here is governments&#x2F;businesses making decisions with bias information leading to incorrect conclusions, and the only know recourse currently is to scrap privacy.')
