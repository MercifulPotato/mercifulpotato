Most major cities have at most two primary newspapers. The difference between them and YouTube was geographic reach.<p>... even still, YT&#x27;s size doesn&#x27;t obligate them to provide hosting for high-bandwidth data. It <i>definitely</i> doesn&#x27;t obligate them to put any specific videos in people&#x27;s field-of-view. People with alternative viewpoints can buy cloud storage if they desperately need a place to host videos.<p>The &quot;Is YouTube an editor&quot; question is a good one, but I have a hard time reconciling the notion that they&#x27;re taking on <i>new</i> editorial behavior with the fact that they&#x27;ve always had both community standards and full control of their curation algorithm. Haven&#x27;t they always been an editor in that sense, and the new concern is some people don&#x27;t like how they&#x27;re using that power?')
