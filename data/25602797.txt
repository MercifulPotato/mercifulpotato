Item(by='wcoenen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609504151, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25600344, text='I read the post you linked, and was surprised by the description of money being created when a UK bank buys a government bond from a pension fund. I thought commercial banks were only allowed to create money when creating loan assets. Is creation of money when banks buy assets a unique feature of the UK banking system, or does it also happen elsewhere?<p>If banks would buy financial assets and create money in the process as described in the post, then that would certainly be inflationary. (e.g. I can imagine hypothetical legislation that forces banks to buy government bonds, that would be the time to run for inflation protection.) As far as I understand, this has not happened, or at least not to the degree that it caused inflation. The effect of QE has been to increase bank reserves but not the money supply, which is why we haven&#x27;t seen inflation since the financial crisis.')
