Could you expand a bit on what you&#x27;d like with A&#x2F;B testing?<p>All of the values can be fetched across projects &#x2F; clients, it&#x27;s essentially a simple K:V store with broad libraries. For example, if you have a key &quot;price&quot; whose value is a number &quot;100&quot;, you can call:<p>configly.get(price)<p>from all your clients (provided they are all using the same API KEY).<p>Today, clients download at the granularity of an entire key-value. So if you changed that price to &quot;150&quot;, it&#x27;d fetch the entirety of &quot;150&quot; and not just the digit flip. Were you envisioning a case of storing a lot of data?<p>Today, our free service is capped at 100kb total. Was there a use case you had in mind?')
