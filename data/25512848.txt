This blindness is the same mindset that has caused climate change.<p>Your comment is guilty of the very sin that it&#x27;s pointing at.<p>It may be myopic (or <i>blind</i> as you qualified it) to try to frame success, but unless you have some special kind of sight that allows you to evaluate it yourself across time and space, the alternative you suggest, that hypothetical <i>holistic</i> grand evaluation, is itself a pointless exercise.<p>No one knows the future. No one knows what&#x27;s ultimately &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;. The same people who keep thinking that they do are also the ones who operate under at least one of three illusions: (1) that something is wrong with the world, (2) that it&#x27;s fixable and (3) that they know how to fix it. As Oppenheimer once said, <i>it is perfectly obvious that the whole world is going to hell. The only possible chance that it might not is that we do not attempt to prevent it from doing so.</i>')
