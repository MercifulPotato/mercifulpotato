Think phishing &#x2F; spam &#x2F; fraud detection, anomaly detection, semantic search, image search, keyword labeling, classifying or segmenting customer data. These applications have well-understood business value propositions. Much, much less often the ML application focused on truly large data.<p>I think we might see a winter in super big applications like self-driving cars or voice assistants, but ML in general is just a boring, non-controversial business tool with hundreds of valuable applications.<p>You’ll still need statistical specialists to train and operate models and ensure systems avoid pitfalls like overfitting, poor convergence, multicollinearity, confounders, etc.<p>So I doubt this will have much impact on ML job market. Companies that invest in ML will continue to run circles around companies that don’t. You’ll just see the unjustified over-focus on SOTA neural networks die down and become just another boring tool in the toolbox like everything else in ML.')
