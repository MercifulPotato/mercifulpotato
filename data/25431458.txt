The human mind has a strong tendency to invisibly <i>substitute</i> hard questions for easy ones. When faced with a difficult question like &quot;what are this company&#x27;s future prospects?&quot;, we tend to subconsciously answer an easier question like &quot;do the founders of this company appear competent and confident?&quot;<p>This, not arrogance, is the main reason why so many rate themselves as above average at common tasks. Truly ranking yourself is pretty cognitively difficult. You have to construct a mental model of the full range of driving ability in the population, then place yourself in it. So almost everybody substitutes the much easier question &quot;am I good driver?&quot; instead of &quot;am I an above average driver?&quot;. And the reality is most driver, even those slightly below average are basically good drivers.<p>In other skills though, where most people perceive themselves as not good, the effect is flipped. For example well over 50% of people will rate themselves as <i>below average</i> when you ask them about their ability to strike up a conversation with strangers.')
