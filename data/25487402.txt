We are all better off for it.<p>I suppose the article brought me back to a different time. That original all text green-on-black, terminal-like, view really took me back to the BBS (Bulletin Board System) days. You might not remember but modems were a thing before the internet, I can remember my Dad tying up the house phone for hours while dialed into the mainframe at the office.<p>And the early days of the internet probably looked like a service like Prodigy for a lot of people.  Prodigy was a fancy BBS.  And everything had to work at dial-up speed. Even Berners-Lee&#x27;s original pages would have been data-conserving and fast.<p>Its interesting that the user experience in those times felt, and probably was, faster.  Our fancy modern graphics take a lot of resources in comparison.  While its easy to point to numerous benefits to the modern internet, we&#x27;ve slipped in terms of time to display info on the screen.  Modern web apps treat bandwidth and storage as infinite and free resources, its really the opposite of what we used to do and maybe not for the better.<p>I suppose that the key difference is that Berners-Lee&#x27;s WWW used the benefit of an always-connected network.  Where the BBS days were all about temporary network connections.  While we use WWW and Internet almost interchangeably, its the always-connected network - the concept of packet switching over circuit switching - that brought the benefit of the WWW.  I&#x27;m sure in 30 more years we&#x27;ll have things I can&#x27;t imagine today, its the power of the network.')
