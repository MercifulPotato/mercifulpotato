Bash should be very easy to read for people familiar with the command line.<p>Except for boilerplate (e.g. set switches, documented in &#x27;help set&#x27;, but just ignore them if you&#x27;re just reading) or if switches (documented in &#x27;man test&#x27;, but you really just need to memorize three or so) and a handful of commands that don&#x27;t tend to be used outside of scripts -- all have a help or man page.<p>You could argue that DOS batch files are hard to read too.<p>Of course, bash&#x27;s tacked on features -- regex, array&#x2F;hash syntax, etc. can get a bit hairy, but it&#x27;s all highly documented.<p>To me, bash is more the polar opposite: hard* to write, easy to read.<p>* not that hard')
