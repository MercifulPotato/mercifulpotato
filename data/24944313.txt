Item(by='Sodman', descendants=None, kids=[24944360], score=None, time=1604077314, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24944146, text='Cars already do have to wait a little longer for pedestrians to cross - at traffic lights, stop signs, intersections and crosswalks.<p>Roads are literally built <i>for cars to drive on</i>. Having people on them makes driving far more dangerous, as well as meaning it takes longer to get places, not to mention taking a hit on fuel efficiency.<p>Should I be able to walk in front of a bus load of people and delay their commute? If we&#x27;re allowing pedestrians unlimited full access to roads with full right of way all the time, then roads basically become sidewalks which cars are also allowed to inch along at walking speed. So what happens to busses now? Are we ok saying busloads of people now have to move at 3mph across a few miles? Again, I am for converting some downtown roads into pedestrian-only areas, but until we do that, we should treat these roads as roads.<p>If pedestrians should have right of way everywhere all the time, should a pedestrian be able to walk across a railroad crossing while the barriers are down and a train is approaching? Is the train expected to stop? Of course not, that would be ridiculous, but it&#x27;s the same argument.')
