Intent design: CRM seems designed principally as a sales tool and I don&#x27;t want to sell or be sold to.<p>2. Information retention: I think regular calendar&#x2F;contacts&#x2F;reminders built into your phone balances the &quot;don&#x27;t forget important stuff&quot; with &quot;don&#x27;t make an effort to keep track of things that <i>aren&#x27;t</i> important.&quot;<p>3. Paid service&#x2F;subscription: I&#x27;m OK with contacts apps but I kind of have contacts, notes, and a calendar built into my phone already and have no desire to pay a subscription fee.<p>Elaborating on (1) a bit: I don&#x27;t really set out to &quot;influence&quot; my friends and I&#x27;d be kind of unhappy if they were trying to &quot;influence&quot; me.<p>Influencing family might make more sense though, like influencing kids to study or family members to exercise and eat a healthy diet.<p>The danger in family and friend relationships is turning things into a contract which can be unforgiving and intrusive. &quot;Well, household database shows that you&#x27;ve been late taking the garbage out 52% of the time for the past 3 years!&quot;<p>As a child I dreamed of having a smartwatch that would record everything my family members said so I could play it back to them and prove infallibly that I was right. I was glad they didn&#x27;t have such a thing to apply to me though.<p>I imagine in the future we&#x27;ll be wearing smart glasses or contact lenses that will identify the name of any person within view who we&#x27;ve met before, as well as their relevant statistics and information including data from online services like social media or dating sites (much the way that CRM provide sales clerks with information on every customer who walks into the store.) I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s entirely a good idea.')
