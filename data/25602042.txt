It is not tied to a specific hardware clock rate.<p>So it&#x27;s perfectly possible - in fact dangerously easy - to generate waveforms with components that are &gt;Nyquist.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if the hardware runs at gigahertz frequencies or subsonic frequencies. In fact it doesn&#x27;t matter if there&#x27;s never any hardware at all.<p>Because there is always an implied sample rate of 1 x fs, and any signal which generates components of more than 0.5 x fs will alias.')
