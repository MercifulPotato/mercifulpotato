The website only displays a standard <i>hosts</i> file. Copy and paste it into your local system&#x27;s <i>hosts</i> file. Now browse to the site listed in the <i>hosts</i> file.<p>You can change the domains used in the <i>hosts</i> file at any time, and get real certs for those domains so you can use TLS. If the public browses to the IPs in the hosts file, they&#x27;ll get nothing. But someone with the hosts file can see the actual site&#x27;s content.<p>This avoids domain takedowns, and allows changing IPs and domain names.')
