I actually think it&#x27;s unrealistic and probably not worth it at the time. The forcing function is what&#x27;s useful, not the database portability per se. And whether it&#x27;s actually useful depends on being so successful that you have so much data that your regular RDBMS can&#x27;t cope with some access or update patterns. That&#x27;s a hefty bet early in anything, and probably doesn&#x27;t make business sense, until it does, then you wish you did things differently.<p>(Not coincidentally, it&#x27;s a position we&#x27;re in at my workplace; the database has hit its limits and we&#x27;re needing to use hybrid approaches to hit latency NFRs.)')
