Iran clearly sees the difference between North Korea and Libya, and it clearly does not want to be the latter. The US stupid move was just the last droplet. Hopefully with the new administration the situation can be salvaged.<p>&gt;Note that Qasem Soleimeini was killed in Iraq. The point being the Iran meddles in their neighbors affairs.<p>Oh, wow. According to the Iraqi prime minister he was on a diplomatic mission to ease tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia. He was unlawfully (under both US and international law) assassinated in a clear and blatant violation of the Iraq sovereignty.<p>And compare the Iran &quot;meddling&quot; with the US openly creating military bases in Syria without any authorization from the Syrian government (you think anything you like about it, but it&#x27;s still an internationally recognized government) and open military support of rebel forces, often closely related to jihadists. Also we have the rejection of the Iraqi parliamentâ€²s call to withdraw US troops.')
