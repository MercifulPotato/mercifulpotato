Honestly, the fact we reached ~2 million in a few weeks is insane. I thought vaccines would be delayed, then deployment would lag behind, then HMO systems would absolutely crash for weeks on end, but they didn&#x27;t (except the first 2-3 days) and we indeed started in December.<p>If the current schedule holds, I could be vaccinated in March. Given my friends&#x27; experiences in the US and UK, I consider that <i>very fast</i> and fast enough, at least. Would I be happier if supply sped up and we doubled vaccinations per day? Of course, but given other countries, this is <i>very</i> acceptable.')
