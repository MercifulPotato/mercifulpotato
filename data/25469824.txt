The general idea was that if you&#x27;re on a date with someone, then you should avoid asking or saying things that subtly insist that something is true if you don&#x27;t know it to be true.  An example is that if you don&#x27;t know whether your date was molested by their father as a child, you should tread carefully with any questions or comments that carry the presumption that they weren&#x27;t.<p>Here&#x27;s some more sage wisdom: the average human has approximately one testicle.  Except not, right?  Because that&#x27;s not how numbers work.  So, it doesn&#x27;t matter if, say, only 4% of the people you interact with are unlucky and 96% aren&#x27;t.  This is not an engineering problem.  If you do meet someone who is (or was) unlucky, and you have an interaction with them like this, then even though they&#x27;re in the 4%, their circumstances are still 100% at odds with your assumption.')
