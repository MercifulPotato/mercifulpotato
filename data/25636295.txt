[...]<p>I think there&#x27;s another purpose of the film industry unions that doesn&#x27;t get mentioned much in these (tech industry) discussions.  Specifically, that the film unions raise wages by limiting the number of people who enter the industry.  It&#x27;s simple supply and demand.<p>This works via the following mechanisms:<p>First, the film unions provide useful benefits (like reasonably-priced health insurance), so most professional actors want to be part of the union.<p>Second, union members are prohibited from working on non-union productions.  Additionally, most well-known actors are union members.  This gives a strong incentive for a production to be a union production.<p>Third, union productions are prohibited from hiring more than a token number of non-union actors (unless they pay a fine to the union).  This gives a strong incentive for productions to only use union talent (which also gives actors another reason to want to be a union member).<p>So far so good.  But how does one join the union?  That&#x27;s the catch-22:  You must work for at least <i>n</i> days on a union production (n=1 for speaking roles, n=3 for extra roles) to be eligible to join SAG&#x2F;AFTRA.  But most union productions won&#x27;t hire you unless you&#x27;re a union member (see above).<p>I don&#x27;t know whether something like that would work in the software industry, but it seems at least <i>plausible</i> to me that it could benefit everyone who is currently employed in tech (at the expense of future <i>potential</i> tech employees).')
