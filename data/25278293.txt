One had some neurological side effects, which is rare but happens, that affected his eye movement and made it impossible for him to read or work comfortably.<p>It wasn&#x27;t healing and it turned out he had an undetected issue processing folic acid I believe, which has an effect on how your body heals from neurological damage. He&#x27;s recovering now after 3 months but has to take folic acid and other supplements 5 times a day.<p>Other friends have had persistent diminished lung capacity for months on end; these are folks who had no co-morbidities and in their 20s.')
