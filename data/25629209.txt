It&#x27;s not that the data on those VMs is irreplaceable, any significant work output will be in a VCS outside my laptop anyway. It&#x27;s that rebuilding it from pieces in case of loss requires work that no client will pay for.<p>That being the case, I much prefer being able to re-image my home dir partition into a new laptop&#x2F;ssd and get back to paying work, over to having to fiddle with individual VMs that only exist as partial backups.<p>Edit: I&#x27;ve actually considered the opposite of what you suggest, just doing a raw partition image for backup. SSD is really fast, ethernet is fast, and the runtime would be consistent. Just haven&#x27;t got it out of me to try it in practice.')
