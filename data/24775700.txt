This is basically saying what every other scientific paper has been saying for years. The decrease in the usage of social media led to a decrease in depression in teenagers. It&#x27;s almost like facebook and instagram are inherently toxic by design and should not exist.<p>To further clarify a 15% rate of depression in teens is higher than it was in 2017. The article lists in their survey for families who were well off during the pandemic still 15% which is really high. And 33% for those who were not. The fact the article ignores that fact is concerning to me. And makes this seem like a piece trying to claim social media isn&#x27;t as &quot;bad&quot; as it seems. Claiming that sleep was beneficial for teens. When it in fact is suggestive otherwise that it is negligible.')
