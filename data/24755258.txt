Item(by='helen___keller', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602515877, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24743484, text='To be honest, I think this country could use antitrust breakup for probably every tech giant (in addition to other industries altogether like telecom!)<p>I think both shareholders and the economy would benefit in the end; these breakups would make explicit the implicit relationship between these multibillion dollar business functions and, in the process, incite a profit motive that would invite competition to make the ecosystem healthier.<p>For example:<p>Google could be split roughly into ads, search, browser, youtube, mobile, and nest&#x2F;devices. When the relationship of each of these divisions is made external (ads pay search, search pays browser to be the default, browser pays mobile to be the default, etc) then we we can now have healthy competition, like bing bidding to become chrome&#x27;s default search or facebook ads bidding to serve google search ads.<p>I haven&#x27;t thought it out as much but I&#x27;m certain society could benefit from breaking out a few major business functions of amazon, of apple, of microsoft, of facebook, and so on.<p>In fact, if we were a really forward thinking society we could write a law rather than rely on antitrust action to restrict tech companies operating in the US from combining too many business functions - did it ever make sense to allow content discovery platforms to <i>also</i> be ad distribution platforms? Perhaps we should categorically disallow that.<p>Of course, I&#x27;m sure the free market minded of you will immediately point out - why do we want government dictating what private companies can and can&#x27;t do? I sympathize with this sentiment, but ultimately the point of democracy is that the democratically elected government can make fair rules with the goal of promoting a better society.<p>If we can make a better society by separating content distribution from content monetization, I don&#x27;t see why we shouldn&#x27;t. If we can make a better society by separating marketplaces from their participants (e.g. amazon &amp; AmazonBasics) then I don&#x27;t see why we shouldn&#x27;t.')
