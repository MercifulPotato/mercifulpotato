Item(by='lisper', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604164145, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24953029, text='&gt; You are advocating for cultural genocide<p>I am a descendant of holocaust survivors so please read the following with that in mind:<p>The caste system is part of a culture.  It is also (IMHO) thoroughly odious, and it should be eliminated, along with patriarchy, theocracy, and a whole host of other human cultural norms with long and (some would say) venerable histories.  There is no moral equivalence between a constructive suggestion for how to eliminate the caste system -- notwithstanding that it is in fact an effort to erase part of a culture -- and actual genocide.  So please don&#x27;t bandy that word about lightly.')
