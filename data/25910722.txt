Besides the emotional weirdness of digital only, no eye contact, etc, I can&#x27;t help but feel that my <i>voice</i> is unexpectedly tired after calls as well.<p>I have started to think that I&#x27;m speaking too loudly to compensate for the lack of physical closeness and I&#x27;m &quot;over modulating&quot; my voice to &quot;project&quot; emotion into the call.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m making it up? Anyone having a similar experience?')
