There&#x27;s fewer than 1 million hotel rooms.<p>What happens to school-age children of people who are vulnerable? Do they have to isolate in the hotel rooms too?<p>What happens to the carers of some of these vulnerable people? Do they have to isolate? What about their families?<p>People who are &quot;vulnerable&quot; need by the far the most medical care. How do you do that safely? We can&#x27;t avoid people picking up infections in hospitals at the moment. Surely it would be far worse if we let the virus go wild?<p>Wouldn&#x27;t having lots of vulnerable people who need lots of personal care packed into hotels be at high risk for the virus spreading between them? Isn&#x27;t that the problem we currently have with care homes?<p>As soon as you start looking into this as a solution it looks far easier to try to suppress the virus across the entire population.')
