Item(by='jrochkind1', descendants=None, kids=[25173433, 25172739, 25173053], score=None, time=1605988739, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25172237, text='I did find some instructions just now from NameCheap,where I have some other more recent registrations. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.namecheap.com&#x2F;support&#x2F;knowledgebase&#x2F;article.aspx&#x2F;876&#x2F;83&#x2F;how-to-transfer-a-domain-from-godaddy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.namecheap.com&#x2F;support&#x2F;knowledgebase&#x2F;article.aspx...</a><p>With those instructions, it doesn&#x27;t look too hard. Without godaddy-specific instructions, I would have had a lot of trouble figuring it out. Unlock registration; get authcode; turn off whois privacy protection; accept transfer. Each done in a different screen.<p>I went to do that, to discover... this old domain, the oldest I have registered, has both an email and a phone number that I no longer have access to, and which GoDaddy wants to do 2-factor using one of them even though I do have my password. (The last 4 of the phone number I recognize as a landline I last had around 17 years ago, before I had a cell phone. I&#x27;ve had this domain for a while, from before I knew better than to use godaddy).  They let me pay them renewal every year without me having to log into my account or notice I can&#x27;t anymore, which I guess is better than stealing my domain becuase of it, but is also why I hadn&#x27;t noticed for years I could not log into the account.<p>So I guess first step is figuring out how to get GoDaddy to give me access to the account again... it looks like that may necessarily involve some disruption&#x2F;outage to my DNS which is in the old account I can&#x27;t get access to. We&#x27;ll see.<p><i>edit</i> wait a second, they totally <i>send me a renewal notice to email every year</i>. They know my current email! They are insisting on sending a 2-factor code to a <i>different</i> email I no longer have access to. Wtf is that?')
