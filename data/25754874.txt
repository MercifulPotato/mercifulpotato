I can&#x27;t find the video on YouTube - its probably been lost to time, but there was a video where Michael Crichton was speaking to a crowd about scientific truth. I&#x27;m going to do my best to recall exactly what Dr. Crichton said, but it was something along the lines of, &quot;The story of plate tectonics really is the story of a single person having it right and everyone else having it wrong.&quot; He&#x27;s referring to Alfred Wegener, of course, who theorized continental drift back in 1912 or so. He was widely mocked and his theory totally rejected by - and it really isn&#x27;t hyperbole to say this - every single geologist.<p>Sadly, Wegener died long before he would have his theory confirmed.')
