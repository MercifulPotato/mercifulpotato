Today it can encompass close reading and analysis of literature (since techniques of analyzing one book - the Bible - also work when analyzing other books) or be used in a more general way to talk about a sort of abstracted, looking-at-the-symbols-within approach to analyzing something.<p>&quot;Dialectic&quot; is literally a dialogue between two people, the term originating with Ancient Greece and Socrate&#x27;s approach to philosophy.
