That’s not really UPenn’s fault. No one can know in advance which ideas are promising enough, so it isn’t reasonable to blame them.<p>This isn’t a scandal or an embarrassment. If, after working for decades, no one is willing to fund you, it’s kind of expected that they have to cut their losses at some point. She was apparently working on it for over 20 years! It turned out that all of the grant money and VC money didn’t see the right risk&#x2F;value potential in it, so they declined to provide their money, but BioNTech did and hired her as a VP. I suspect this ended much better for her than staying at Penn would have.')
