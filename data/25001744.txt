Over the time I&#x27;ve lived here, we&#x27;ve had the opposite problem: lots of highly paid tech firms moving into SF. This has changed the nature of San Francisco in a way that many dislike,  including me. I was initially attracted to San Francisco because, it was chill, it was beautiful, and it had a lot of eccentric, really interesting people. Many of our good friends had to leave over the years as SF has becoming more unlivable because rents have gone up so much, and also it&#x27;s just not as fun, it&#x27;s crowded and stressed.<p>I am aware that I am a part of the problem: my wife and I are white, yuppie, dink tech workers. :)<p>These issues are complex.<p>I voted yes on Proposition L: the tax is quite small and I think the tech firms are unlikely to leave, meanwhile SF can get more taxes from them (many of them were historically given tax breaks, like Twitter, to move into the mid-market area). If they do leave, I don&#x27;t see that as a bad thing.<p>Meanwhile socioeconomic disparity is an oozing sore in San Francisco, we have billionaires rubbing elbows with homeless people every day. Nationally, we&#x27;ve had round after round of tax cuts for the wealthiest, if SF wants to tax excessive income disparity, I say, fair enough.')
