Being reserved and self-effaced, she did not seek honors or public attention.</i><p>She was failed and denied a degree in spite of having better grades than Albert, probably solely because she was a woman. Albert was probably blocked from employment positions he wanted by the same professor that failed her, possibly because he was treating a woman like his equal.<p>This reads to me like they coped as best they could with a world that absolutely wouldn&#x27;t accept a woman as a serious scientist and even with trying to be self effacing, etc, they both paid a high price -- such a high price, it likely destroyed their marriage.')
