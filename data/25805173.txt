I do think that most people are not used to how science can change over time and that what most science is is just what the majority of scientists have come to conclude from their independent studies. Most people have not had to deal with greys and prefer things to be black and white.<p>We need a shift towards understanding that the best available information is better than nothing and that the information can change as more better information comes to light.<p>Another thing we need to move away from is crucifying people for getting things wrong - this just doesn&#x27;t help in the long run.
