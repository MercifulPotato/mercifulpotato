My primary language became Go when that came out, and I don&#x27;t foresee myself moving to another language until there&#x27;s a paradigm shift. Meaning, I think the majority of services we need will be written in Go and be exposed as very standard consumable APIs much like unix tools were with text. The shift beyond that, I think is to a language that understands a live environment of these services as opposed to yet another language that looks to replace existing languages.<p>Basically I think Go is the last language needed on the backend for the way we write software today much as C reached its pinnacle 10-15 years ago. C program moved to Java or dynamic scripting languages for different platforms. Go dominates the Cloud and I think the platforms we program for beyond that might be something higher level. Maybe voice. Maybe something visual, who knows.')
