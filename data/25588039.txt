I&#x27;ve got a car from 2017 that has some kind of sensors wrapping all the way around the bumper.  When I&#x27;m parked between two cars, it can detect a car roughly 15-20 feet away as soon as I get an inch or two of my bumper clear of the other cars.<p>It does lack any spatial indicators to the driver, though.  It just plays a beep, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to play the beep from the side of the car the danger is in, nor does it beep louder when they&#x27;re closer.  Still, it works remarkably well.  Reliably detects pedestrians and vehicles (even while I&#x27;m moving, which is impressive, because it doesn&#x27;t go off for parked cars when I start moving).<p>I think it&#x27;s the Dodge ParkSense, but I bought the car used so there&#x27;s a possibility it&#x27;s something aftermarket.<p>It&#x27;s saved my ass a number of times.  I&#x27;m in jacked-up pickup truck country, so it is often impossible for me to see pedestrians about to walk behind me because of the lifted truck, and likewise the pedestrians can&#x27;t see me until they&#x27;re behind me.')
