The ULS database doesn&#x27;t even follow a CSV-like format, because despite all of its variations, one of the two newline forms are ultimately what separates records, and with the ULS, you can&#x27;t make that assumption (unescaped newline characters are valid values). Nothing less than a customized parser will suffice.')
