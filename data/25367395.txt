It was the first time she was doing drugs, and I had had wonderful experiences with friends taking MDMA.<p>She went kind of crazy, yelling and running around in the hotel room we were staying. At some point she went on her knees and asked her to marry her, I said no so she started crying for a few seconds, then went into another thought. Sexually it got pretty wild also, things that she would never accept doing ever since. Unfortunately, I was unable to keep it up.')
