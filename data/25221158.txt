How strict can you get?<p>Lax parsers are the bane of every web browser&#x27;s existence.<p>Ultimately parsing does not get you to correctness, ensuring properties does, and a type system is the lamest way to do it. There are actual logic solvers&#x2F;theorem provers that can handle properties and are as powerful as programming languages while also ensuring correctness and most importantly completeness.<p>Some of them were even available as extensions for Java, though constraint programming is not currently in the mainstream. (Besides a small variant called borrow checking, used in Rust for instance.)')
