We live in a country with bizarre healthcare structures! No one is denying that it&#x27;s bizarre! We&#x27;re just saying it&#x27;s <i>true</i>. You Europeans cannot imagine what it&#x27;s like here thanks to being surrounded by competent social support structurs your whole life, and it&#x27;s beyond frustrating that you think you know better than we do how awful it is in our country and how we could &quot;just&quot; do something to make it better.
