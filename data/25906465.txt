Having recently finished Capital Vol 1, I&#x27;ve started Q by Luther Blissett this week. Q seems to be well regarded, but I&#x27;m going in blind. After Q I&#x27;ll likely go back to Capital Vol 2 which I understand to be on the drier side.<p>During iso I&#x27;ve set aside Wednesday nights as reading nights. The schedule gives me something to look forward too, but it doesn&#x27;t preclude reading during the weekends if I&#x27;m feeling into it.')
