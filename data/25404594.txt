A friend of mine was living across the street from the main building, and I was over one day trying to watch TV in their common room. I donâ€™t recall why I was flipping channels up near 90 but I distinctly heard a crisp clear voice as I was flipping between two channels.<p>The wireless headsets the receptionists had were using the same modulation as TV, and you could hear it by holding the UHF dial on the TV between clicks. And my friend knew about this. Awkward.')
