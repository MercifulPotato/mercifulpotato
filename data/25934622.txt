Not from the company management who did it but from other shareholders, and most of the time &quot;retail&quot; shareholder.<p>They are running to the ground company that may survive with a fresh injection of capital, and destroying company that suddenly cannot raise more capital or have no more collateral for a loan.<p>Moreover they are this hedge fund are manipulating information to the level of a troll farm. I was a shareholder of AMD when they where starting to release the Zen architecture. Every other week, they were sending report of &quot;problems&quot; with the new architecture, or even basic feature behaving normally. Hedging is ok, but betting as they do is not. And when they get burned I celebrate!')
