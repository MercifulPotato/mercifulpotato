I&#x27;ve never really heard it in this sort of fashion and it&#x27;s an interesting approach to teaching types. Language and &#x27;lingo&#x27; really does muddy the waters educationally.<p>I appreciate you writing this out for me. I understand the 3 types you described quite clearly.<p>The compiler stuff I fortunately won&#x27;t have to care as much about (unless I do this fulltime or go even harder core into types) but I appreciate your approach to it.<p>I believe learning Rust has helped me understand Haskell and the utility of even basic things like Maybe&#x2F;Option types. Compared to like Go or whatever I want it plus pattern matching in every language I use now (pattern matching is another thing I gleaned from Erlang&#x2F;Elixir as extremely useful).<p>Anyway, I&#x27;ll find time at some point down the road to understand this better.')
