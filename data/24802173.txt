But the cover story is so flimsy caution is warranted in this case. If it turns out the flimsy cover story was true, and if the NY Post removes PII from their story, then twitter will  lift the ban.  It is not that complicated.<p>RE: Tax, the NY Times, which has a long history of credible investigative journalism, has stated that their source had legal access to the documents.  They were not obtained by their source via a hack. The source most likely did not have permission to share the documents, but the practice of using anonymous, credible sources has a long history in journalism and is widely accepted as ethical.  And the practice of laundering RSU disinformation is generally looked down on.  And the NY Post has failed to prove that they aren&#x27;t laundering RSU disinformation.')
