I try and keep notes in a notepad, but sometimes after I&#x27;m on my 4th or 5th page of notes for the day, I quickly forget to transcribe and organise those notes at the end of the day. And not to mention, that&#x27;s not really that fun. I&#x27;ve tried using Joplin for taking notes on the computer, I&#x27;ve tried markdown files in Vim, but I struggle to make that habitual as it&#x27;s kind of out-of-site-out-of-mind, and I usually end up reverting to reactionary ways of working and prioritising whatever is at the top of my email inbox.<p>Any advice on methodologies, or tools?<p>I&#x27;ve read and followed GTD before, but find it a little too granular and feel like I don&#x27;t really have the right tools to pull it off (restricted internet access at work so many cloud solutions like evernote are off the table for myself). I also struggle with keeping notes during meetings, sometimes my notes are very sparse and not actually capturing the detail and thoughts that need to be captured. Having 4-8 hours of meetings every day also makes it difficult to find time to gather thoughts between those meetings, but I try to flesh out my notes post meeting if I can and that helps a little.')
