First, a &#x27;no&#x27; vote is still taking a position. It requires additional explanation to differentiate &quot;no because I couldn&#x27;t understand it in time&quot; and &quot;no because I think it&#x27;s a bad idea.&quot; That&#x27;s a fair bit of nuance, which these days is... well often difficult to accurately and easily convey to others.<p>The second reason is that it&#x27;s not just a matter of one vote per issue. It&#x27;s not one massively complex issue that requires 5k+ pages to fully flesh out. It&#x27;s a bunch of different stuff all jammed together, and votes can only cover the entire thing. Some of those things are often simple enough, and some are very time critical. Do you want to hold up the time critical bits for the rest of it?<p>If you do, can you get constituents to understand why, and agree with your decision to hold things up? For every voter that you can&#x27;t convince, your political opponents now have an easy in. Can you afford that?')
