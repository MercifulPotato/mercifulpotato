Item(by='klodolph', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605538470, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25112227, text='&gt; I don’t think this works either because you can’t meaningfully agree on when light was emitted from one of the clocks.<p>You can in fact meaningfully agree. You put the clocks in similar reference frames (like “standing on the surface of the Earth”), and accept some small but non-zero margin for error. The fact that a spaceship traveling around the earth does not measure light pulses emitted by these clocks as simultaneous is irrelevant—because we know that the notion of simultaneity relies on reference frame. What we <i>do</i> get is that anyone standing on the Earth’s surface can measure the pulses as simultaneous, within the specified margin of error. This error must necessarily account for the the fact that time progresses differently at different altitudes and latitudes, if your clocks are accurate enough. Because General Relativity is an extremely accurate theory and we have accurate measurements of the relevant physical constants &amp; the mass of the Earth, we can account for the different reference frames and run the clocks at the correct rates so they continue to be synchronized even when they are free running (again, with the appropriate margin of error).<p>If you are using ordinary quartz clocks, then the clocks probably have enough error that you can ignore relativistic effects. I’m assuming we want atomic clocks if we’re series about chronometry, especially considering how cheap they are these days.<p>The idea that synchronizing clocks is somehow impossible stems from an unrealistic idea of how people measure time in the first place.')
