I&#x27;d prefer to see states competing over taxes - it provides a great incentive for efficiency.  And no, a company won&#x27;t always choose the lower tax rate, there are other factors at play like: 1)where are the employees located, 2) will they even go to a state with lower business taxes, 3) what services do I get as a company from the state gov&#x27;t, 4) what&#x27;s the general business climate in the state.<p>I hate the derogatory use of &quot;race to the bottom&quot; since it&#x27;s the reason why we have handheld computers in our pockets and 60 inch flat screen TVs that cost $300.  Every company is &quot;racing to the bottom&quot; to provide as much value for the least cost as possible.')
