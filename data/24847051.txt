There are languages with heavy focus on education (both in the language itself and tooling) like Racket that are still not heavily used compared to python even when they provide a great environment for learning from basic to more complex comp sci.<p>Regarding Julia, yes the focus seems to be more on college, where the matlab-like math support makes it a lot closer to regular math. Though since it&#x27;s not very different from Python someone can still pick it up easily from knowing Python in high school (or Racket).')
