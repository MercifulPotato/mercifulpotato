You should not hate your life that severely, no matter what your line of work is. And it&#x27;s not right to be lied to by people who should be looking for out for you.<p>But to be honest - as someone who was born and raised working class and has a perspective colored by that - I can&#x27;t for the life of me understand why you do this to yourself. Why don&#x27;t you quit and learn a skill that&#x27;s actually in demand? Is it just sunk-cost fallacy? Or do you feel that hard work and some degree of intelligence entitles you to a career that&#x27;s meaningful, respectable, ethical, and well-paid - regardless of it&#x27;s value and demand as determined by the rest of the world?<p>It&#x27;s hard to say, but either your position is more valuable than you&#x27;re getting paid for - which means you all need to unionize, or it&#x27;s not actually that valuable and you need to quit. Or maybe it&#x27;s worth exactly what you&#x27;re getting paid, because so many others will line up right behind you, and take those terrible odds because they like the environment &#x2F; self-pride &#x2F; respectability they get from working in academia.')
