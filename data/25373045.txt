The first they thing teach you in Econ 201 is to ignore everything that happened in Econ 101: it&#x27;s useful to learn to read graphs, but everything is largely useless otherwise.<p>Also, why are you prescribing that we ought to follow Econ 101 then 2 sentences later telling us to instead ignore Econ 101 in favor of this other thing. This is contradictory advice.<p>&gt; A perfect free market might never have existed, but good enough approximations do<p>Good enough is arbitrary. Go check out Anarcho-Capitalists, they want a very different good-enough. Furthermore, we&#x27;re finding another contradiction: your pursuit of a free-market, yet you&#x27;re offering up countries with varying levels of market and capital control. Estonia, for example, has highly market-distorting healthcare&#x2F;insurance industries through a monopsony. This is, again, contradictory, as a monopsony is a market-distorting force--especially when constructed through government mandate. Or is this where that ideology safety-valve kicks in:\n&gt; The latter only by-and-large and with big exceptions obviously, since they are complicated real world places.<p>It&#x27;s full of contradiction and arbitrary distinctions.')
