It seems like the federated model is gaining traction among the decentralized community (Mastadon, peertube..) but I&#x27;d love to get to the point where self-hosting is as accessible to internet users as signing up.<p>My vision for music (and other things) sharing is your personal library is on your personal private server, and you can give access to whoever you want individually.  Now your streaming source is your library and your friends library--and if a friend likes one of your tracks they can &quot;save&quot; it to their library and give access to their friends.<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to build this for status updates (like a Facebook alternative) as a simple private blog+rss[1] that&#x27;s easy to self-host (raspberry PI or AWS) but I can see a world where everyone has their own server enabling an amazing multitude of distributed usage--music sharing, personal restaurant recomendations, the ability to post and share things with only your friends without a mega-corp in between is a future I would get really excited about.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simpleblogs.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simpleblogs.org</a>')
