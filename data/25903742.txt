The worst for me in the past was when I <i>did</i> the behavior but forgot to log it. Then I’d get the depressing “you broke the streak” prompts and give up.<p>Worth noting the first goal is to just do the behavior, the Streaks app prompt is just a safety net. If all goes well, I should only see the prompt if I’m about to miss. My own internal habit development keeps the streak alive.')
