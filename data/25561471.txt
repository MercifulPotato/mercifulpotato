Doesn&#x27;t the victim have to (1) deliberately have a sensitive document open, (2) be somehow framed by an attacker&#x27;s malicious IFrame, and then (3) click the &quot;submit feedback&quot; button to report a problem to Google?<p>All three of those conditions are independently rare. The equivalent conditions are rare in all CJ bugs, which is a reason CJs are sort of a running joke in appsec. This bug isn&#x27;t a joke (look at the target and the impact), but condition (3) is also way more unlikely than the median CJ report somewhere else.<p>If I understand the bug correctly --- maybe I don&#x27;t --- this researcher got what might perhaps be the largest bounty ever paid for a CJ bug.')
