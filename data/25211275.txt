Your reply alludes to this; your definition of an expert involves whether journalists say they&#x27;re experts. How would journalists know?<p>Trusting experts is definitely a good policy from a Bayesian perspective <i>given the dictionary definition of expert</i>, i.e. &quot;a person who is very knowledgeable about or skilful in a particular area&quot; to quote Google&#x27;s top result for the definition.<p>The problem we have with COVID is the people journalists present to us as experts (invariably academics) keep saying incredibly dumb stuff that&#x27;s totally wrong, and by now many of us have concluded these &quot;experts&quot; don&#x27;t actually know any more about disease than the man on the street does.<p>This is an inevitable problem with how academia is structured. Academics aren&#x27;t financially rewarded for being correct, like private sector experts are. They&#x27;re rewarded for writing things their peers find interesting. That&#x27;s a totally different thing. We hope that being interesting and being correct are strongly correlated, but the replication crisis and general low standards observable in research papers are strong evidence they actually aren&#x27;t.<p><i>I am completely unable to independently verify that what they say is valid - without decades of experience in the field, this is simply impossible.</i><p>The people you&#x27;re disagreeing with also disagree about this. I&#x27;ve read a lot of epidemiology papers this year. The field is a joke: epidemiology is a piece of piss. The Gender Studies of medicine. It&#x27;s just stats and some basic programming. I&#x27;ve not once had to look up any biology when reading these papers (microbiology being a genuinely hard field) because none of them use any. It&#x27;s absolutely straightforward to find major, severe defects in these papers without decades of experience in this field. There&#x27;s definitely a huge gulf in how difficult and deep different fields are, certainly, not all scientific endeavours are the same.')
