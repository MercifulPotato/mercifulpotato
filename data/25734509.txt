(I&#x27;m Chinese but mostly Western educated)<p>Having seen my grandparents&#x2F;parents&#x2F;relatives escaping communist China and now my generation escaping HK, it has heavily influenced me on how even people who identified as Chinese and hoping for democracy and freedom for their own cousins in China are being played and lied to for multiple decades.<p>My people in HK are screaming that the West previous engagement policies have proven again and again to be ineffective. It&#x27;s believed that the only way is to &quot;distrust and verify&quot; and not kowtow to their ways like what the West had been doing for the previous decades.<p>I do not claim to know everything about how the Chinese system functions and can only observe how my immediate network is being oppressed but still hope that there&#x27;s a way to engage the CCP if at all possible.')
