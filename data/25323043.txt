The LinkedIn bubble is so <i>weird</i>. It reminds me of those weird bird mating dances you see in nature documentaries.<p>LinkedIn is the only social network where it&#x27;s not acceptable to question these weird posts. Only politically correct, somewhat career-related content is allowed, and only positive responses are appropriate. Everyone is inspired and blessed and productive. It&#x27;s a big circlejerk.<p>That&#x27;s not a surprise though. You&#x27;re here to work on your business-oriented personal brand. If you don&#x27;t need that, you have no reason to be there.')
