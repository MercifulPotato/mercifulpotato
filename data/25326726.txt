I don’t know if I really believe it’s better (actors take flights and likely don’t wear masks for filming, lots of catered food, tests aren’t perfect by any means, etc.), let’s assume that it is.<p>The point still stands that it’s unfair. If the film industry is able to get a pass to operate by meeting some standard then that should be formalized and extended to these small businesses. Let them decide if it’s viable.<p>Back room deals and private special exceptions are no way to operate.')
