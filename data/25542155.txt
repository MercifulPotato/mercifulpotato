The psychiatrist explained to him that he had this trait (felt no pain, felt no anxiety, etc). He explained it&#x27;s common in people with dangerous careers. He explained that people with this trait who grow up in nurturing homes tend to come out ok and usually work dangerous roles. This hitman grew up in an abusive home and that coupled with this trait was what shaped him into what he became.')
