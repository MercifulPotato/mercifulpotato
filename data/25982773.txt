I don&#x27;t find it convincing.  Start with the first screen:  An exponential graph does <i>not</i> have a sharp kink in it just past where you are standing.  The rest of the point is valid (an exponential curve means that the next bit if change will be faster than the last bit, and that&#x27;s going to surprise you), but he&#x27;s cheating to try to make the point more visually dramatic.  It implies &quot;there&#x27;s a discontinuous first derivative coming almost immediately&quot;, when the argument is actually that there&#x27;s a <i>continuous increase</i> in the first derivative.<p>So, yeah.  Overselling the case, in the graph on the first screen.')
