I have addressed a few points here, and just updated the repo, so please keep that in mind while browsing the comments:<p>1. Some people found the README a bit arrogant&#x2F;bratty --- which I agree, sorry! --- so I have edited it.<p>2. Some people found it clickbait-y it says Python whereas there are two C libraries (uvloop, and hiredis) for heavy-lifting the event loop and parsing (respectively.) I have added this fact as a disclaimer in the README, and ultimately it is up to you to decide whether that counts as cheating or not. :)<p>3. I have addressed some major correctness issues too (#12) but it is not 100% correct still.<p>4. This is a proof-of-concept that I wrote in a day (+ spent today fixing some bugs) that you are comparing to an 11 years old industry-grade software. =) Don&#x27;t take the <i>experiment</i> too seriously!<p>Kindly,<p>Bora')
