Item(by='pugio', descendants=None, kids=[25067208], score=None, time=1605160695, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25061438, text='There&#x27;s a lot of negativity in these comments, but I&#x27;m excited because I&#x27;m working on exactly the same thing. I have a raspberry pi 4 hooked up to a PS3 eye camera&#x2F;mic, and have been tweaking it to only forward audio when my child cries.<p>I wasn&#x27;t going to start with ML - just send the audio if it was over a certain threshold for a certain amount of time (say, 5 or 10 seconds of noise that&#x27;s above the normal ambient background for that room).<p>For everyone chiming in about how this is terrible parenting, I know it comes from a place of concern, but I personally am not worried about using this, and I can imagine that the author of the article is probably thinking similarly to me.<p>I would not use this monitor in a situation where the health of my baby was in any way suspect. My baby tends to make lots of noise at night - shifting around, sighing to herself, and occasionally uttering a single piercing wail for absolutely no reason for just one second (sounds like an audio hardware test, just the brain exercising the circuitry during sleep). While none of this bothers the baby, I am a very sensitive sleeper and having her in my room is completely destroying my sleep.<p>I&#x27;m going to use this to be able to move her to another room. It&#x27;s a room adjacent to mine. It&#x27;s close enough that if she works herself up to her full volume I&#x27;m sure I would still wake up and hear her. This is so I can filter out her background noise, but still respond to her night wakeup crying without having her reach her full protesting volume. I think it&#x27;s nicer for her that way. It is not dangerous; just a means for me to get some more sleep while still being able to respond promptly when she wakes up.')
