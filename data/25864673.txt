Item(by='lacker', descendants=None, kids=[25865550, 25866703], score=None, time=1611265241, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25863820, text='<i>You have no realistic opportunity to work some where else - either a restriction in your contract or due to the hours that you work</i><p>I think this part would need to be more specific. A while ago I worked as a low level employee at the Gap in Boston, and the rules were that nobody could work more than 29 hours per week so that nobody was categorized as full time, but you also had to be available whenever you were scheduled. However, many people had two jobs, despite this restriction. They would be asking other employees to swap shifts every week and sometimes failing but usually making it work. Nowadays, with Uber, it&#x27;s a lot easier to fill in an extra 15 hours a week that you&#x27;d like to work. So who could really claim to have &quot;no realistic opportunity to work somewhere else&quot; if any odd hours could be filled as an Uber driver or similar gig worker?<p>It&#x27;s important to recognize that the different ways of scheduling part time work are really different. 20 hours a week that is mandated with three days notice by your employer really sucks. 20 hours a week that you choose with the Uber app is far better.')
