I&#x27;ve been working as an engineer in the Bay Area for 3+ years and found Manara about a year ago. During that time, I&#x27;ve closely mentored 6 engineers and mock interviewed several more. I think nearly every end-of-program mock interview I&#x27;ve given to Manara students are a &quot;Hire&quot; with questions of similar difficulty to those used at the big tech company I work for. Having gotten to know them very well now, it&#x27;s clear to me that these really are a selection of the best engineers in the region (e.g. top performers in competitive programming competitions, hackers with more side projects than university projects, etc).<p>P.S. Also worth mentioning that this is some of the most exciting volunteer work I&#x27;ve done...it&#x27;s a small part of what I do each week but it keeps me disproportionately energized even throughout the rest of my week!')
