Someone would have to figure out which bugs are in 4.9.x, backport the patches (which could be hard if significant changes have occurred).<p>As you say, it could in principle be done, but GCC doesn&#x27;t have a huge amount of funding (most companies support LLVM&#x2F;clang if they support any compiler, which to be honest makes a lot of sense, they are much more business-friendly)')
