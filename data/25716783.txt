Twitter was under the impression nothing Trump could do would get his account banned while president, they even said as much!<p>It took 5 deaths at the Capitol during an attempted attack on Congress as a direct result of his actions for them throw in the towel.<p>I mean the man threatened nuclear war over Twitter and Twitter didn&#x27;t bat an eyelid. Compared to that a poorly worded comment about genocide seems about par?')
