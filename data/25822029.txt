It <i>has</i> a purpose - it&#x27;s a place for me and my friends to socialize, and talk about small things that matter to us.<p>I grew up with the Internet so I can compare it to, say, Livejournal with its much-missed subtle privacy controls, or a local BBS with a Fidonet hookup, or a PHPBB forum, and find it wanting in some ways - but it&#x27;s being run like one of those places.<p>It is not being run for profit. It is not anyone&#x27;s job. It has no VC investment to pay back. It is paid for about 50&#x2F;50 by my money and by user contributions. And maybe a little by the fact that it&#x27;s a nice audience for when I say &quot;hey my commission schedule is open, who wants to trade some money for art?&quot;. I don&#x27;t <i>want</i> it to be any bigger, and actively work to keep its growth slow.<p>Personally I think the fact that the public sphere is a for-profit affair is a lot of why it&#x27;s such a terrible thing, all that matters is keeping users around and feeding them more ads, doesn&#x27;t matter if they&#x27;re happy or angry, doesn&#x27;t matter what they&#x27;re being sold.<p>I think that&#x27;s a perfectly fine thing to make. A place to have a conversation without someone trying to turn it into a source of money.<p>YMMV, if you have more grandiose dreams that you try to build on top of these shared protocols then good luck, and I will probably block whatever you do for breaking the &quot;being or representing a corporation is a bannable offense&quot; rule of my instance.')
