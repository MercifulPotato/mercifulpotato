This is especially true of NextCloud, which almost certainly would have required me to learn how to run nginx on my own, install php or whatever application it uses as the middleware, etc.<p>Instead, I configured my DNS and ran a Docker command and was off to the races.<p>Server-level Open Source Software&#x27;s installation process is often so complicated and has so many dependencies if it&#x27;s not something you can get from your repository&#x27;s package manager, at least in my experience, that docker is almost always the easiest option.<p>What beats a single command and maybe reading a config on what ports to forward or how to set up your config. And then you get a docker-compose if you want to be creative, yourself.<p>Unless you&#x27;re already very skilled at dev-ops, docker is easier.')
