No ads even.  In some cases, it&#x27;s the first two organic results (a main website, and then a direct link to their menu on that same website, which for some reason shows up as two different organic search results - I don&#x27;t even mean sitelinks or the new indented stuff, I mean full on bona fide second organic search result for the same domain).<p>The only one that I usually order from for which this isn&#x27;t the case doesn&#x27;t actually have their own website.<p>So in some cases this is working.<p>What doesn&#x27;t work for me is searching for the type of food - that&#x27;s all aggregator sites.')
