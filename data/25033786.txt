The original comment follows.<p>---<p>This is absolutely bogus. TFA is a description of the math behind Pijul, not a step by step description of the implementation, and certainly not the implementation itself. Have you ever read a math&#x2F;CS paper that attempts to dictate a license on all future work based on the algorithms (or ideas in general) within? I’m honestly shocked that the author, who is apparently an academic, flouts academic norms like this.<p>Disclosure: as someone who was trained as a mathematician, I’m offended by attempts at restricting the free exchange of knowledge.<p>Re sibling that links to author’s tweet: plagiarism is something else entirely, and I fail to see how GPL helps in combating plagiarism.')
