Maybe I’m predisposed, but I watched Boyhood some years ago in the cinema and being able to see life happen is incredible. Apted didn’t start the series, he was a sideman on the first, 7 Up, and possibly 7+7, but it is very much his body of work. I wish he had been able to retain more of the people and also, as he said, had more women, but it stands alone atop the visual and motion picture database in my head.<p>Unassailable.')
