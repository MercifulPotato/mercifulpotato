Provided the dog hadn&#x27;t recently wazzed on the rubber plant that supported the aerial, in which case ITV was optional and then we only had BBC One and Two.<p>However, old school CRT screens could handle pans and zooms that my modern LG thing can only dream of.  Then again the thing I&#x27;m watching now is comparatively huge and &quot;waffer theeeen&quot;.  A ~50&quot; CRT would stick out from the wall about four feet and weigh enough that I&#x27;d be using some of the more robust Civil Engineering things I learned at college to fix it to the wall.<p>When I was a child it took a while to tune a TV by hand, channel by channel.  Remember portables with the little aerials on the end of a wire?

I still have the C-64 and it now has a USB interface.<p>Now I press the home button and pick a service on my TV. OK on my TV that isn&#x27;t one of my RPi driven monsters that uses the MythTV backend.  I have an Octo-LNB on my sat dish ...<p>(Sorry about this (<i>twitch</i>) but it&#x27;s iPlayer and you were a child, not a kid)')
