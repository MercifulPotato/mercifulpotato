It uses hydrogen peroxide as its main power source and also contains a microfluidic logic circuit. Octobot is said to be able to move on its own without any aid by a battery or an electrical power source. The hydrogen peroxide flows around a network of 3D printed hollows (or freckles) within the body of the robot. Hydrogen peroxide moves over platinum pieces, which causes a chemical reaction. This chemical reaction causes a gas to form creating the main power source for the robot. This phenomenon produces a reaction that inflates and moves the arms, to propel the robot through water.&quot;')
