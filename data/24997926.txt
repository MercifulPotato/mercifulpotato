It&#x27;s not actually &#x27;what&#x27; they&#x27;re saying that seems intriguing to people, but more about &#x27;how&#x27; they&#x27;re saying it, typically bordering on arrogance.  To many lower-level employees, perhaps suffering from their own imposter syndrome, generally assume that there must be something to it, even if what they hear is objectively wrong or lacking any material substance.   These people seem to have learned that they can act and speak in a particular way, they can attain positions of authority, without having to actually do anything.  They&#x27;re immediately put into command positions with staff to execute their useless (and usually selfish) agenda. This is usually confirmed by those in positions higher than them, who have attained those positions in largely the same way. Management consulting is probably the most egregious case I&#x27;ve seen first-hand.  You know, where a bunch of 22-year olds from &#x27;good schools&#x27; in nice suits come into your company and dictate &#x27;strategy&#x27; at $3-4K US per day.  Most of these people didn&#x27;t have a clue, and readily admitted it.  Yet there they were..wasting tons of money.  I couldn&#x27;t understand it until I realized that their very presence there was simply a function of the broad confirmation bias that existed at the highest levels of the company.')
