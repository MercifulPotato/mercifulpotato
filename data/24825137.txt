Item(by='nneonneo', descendants=None, kids=[24829970, 24827204, 24825458], score=None, time=1603105301, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24824299, text='The <i>real</i> version of this, which is actually 1021 bytes, is here: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.p01.org&#x2F;MONOSPACE&#x2F;monospace.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.p01.org&#x2F;MONOSPACE&#x2F;monospace.htm</a>. It uses the very clever trick of compressing the JavaScript code as the pixels of a PNG image (which uses Deflate internally), then including the page itself in an &lt;img&gt; tag and decompressing the JS code from the resulting pixels.<p><i>Unfortunately</i>, the developer made a bit of a mistake when uploading this file: it appears to have been uploaded in <i>ASCII</i> mode rather than <i>binary</i> mode, meaning that all the 0x0d (CR) bytes in the file have gone missing (an artifact of the standard &quot;CRLF -&gt; LF&quot; translation performed in text mode uploads). Therefore, it doesn&#x27;t work: all you get to see is a screenful of binary junk. (Author, if you&#x27;re seeing this - it&#x27;s hopefully an easy fix!)<p>I&#x27;ve uploaded the correct version (obtained from <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.p01.org&#x2F;MONOSPACE&#x2F;monospace.zip" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.p01.org&#x2F;MONOSPACE&#x2F;monospace.zip</a>) here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;robertxiao.ca&#x2F;misc&#x2F;monospace.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;robertxiao.ca&#x2F;misc&#x2F;monospace.htm</a>. This works out-of-the-box on Firefox (modulo being really slow, thanks to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.mozilla.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=1190398" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.mozilla.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=1190398</a>), but fails on newer Chrome because of click-to-play audio. You&#x27;ll have to &quot;allow&quot; my site under chrome:&#x2F;&#x2F;settings&#x2F;content&#x2F;sound, then refresh.<p>But! Once you&#x27;ve jumped through those hoops, you can appreciate the real ingenuity that manages to pack this demo into a cool 1021 bytes (the compatible version that most of you would have seen is much larger, at 2338 bytes).')
