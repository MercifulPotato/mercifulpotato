Item(by='Dylan16807', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606979061, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25285833, text='&gt; Not 4% of 1, but 4% of α.<p>I know.  But <i>which direction</i>?  Higher, lower, or both?  If it&#x27;s 4% in both directions that&#x27;s quite a coincidence.<p>And since we&#x27;re talking about percentages of α, I will emphasize that going from .007 to .1 is a change of <i>well over a thousand percent</i>.  That example is the exact opposite of the anthropic principle showing that we &quot;could not exist if its value were much different&quot;!<p>What did I say to deserve the downvotes?')
