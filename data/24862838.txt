Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[24866409], score=None, time=1603397874, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24861852, text='&gt; Nope, you bring your dossiers to a higher court and ask for Justice (EU, ICJ, UN.)<p>The EU isn&#x27;t a court, and European institutions (including European courts like the ECHR) are particularly not &quot;higher courts&quot; over police in the US. The ICJ hears only cases between state parties, not between states and their subjects, and the UN isn&#x27;t a court at all, and, again, is only a forum for state parties, not for disputes between individuals and states, though sometimes you can get a state party to stand up for subjects of another state; but, that&#x27;s not really much of a practical option if the offending state is the US, both because of its Security Council role (which Uniting for Peace, in theory, provides a route around through the General Assembly), and because of its hyperpower status (which means that there is, in practice, no way to enforce a decision against it, even if one was reached through UfP.)')
