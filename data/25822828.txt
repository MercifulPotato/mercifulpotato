The reason is because I like a more natural color spectrum not one with spikes in specific bands. The other reason is because they flicker.<p>Flickering can be addressed by running LEDs in DC mode and CCFLs with electronic ballasts, but both costs a little bit more money and our current society is geared for the cheapest possible product which means you have to skimp on components.<p>Color spectrum can be addressed by adding more phosphors (more expensive) to CCFLs. With LEDs it can be addressed by not using only blue leds with a yellow phosphor and calling it &quot;white&quot;. True RGB LEDs are more expensive.<p>Every time I visit my folks place which doesn&#x27;t use incandescent anymore, I am always struck by how dull and desaturated it looks because of the energy-efficient lighting.<p>There is more to lighting than energy-efficiency, there is also health to consider.<p>Our bodies didn&#x27;t evolve under a flickering light source and they also didn&#x27;t evolve under narrowband color spectrums.')
