The security implications are too high. Let&#x27;s run all of that code remotely, and send only draw commands to the user.<p>Everything old is new again.<p>1984: X Window System. Architecture-independent system for remote graphical user interfaces and input device capabilities. X provides the basic framework, or primitives, for building such GUI environments: drawing and moving windows on the display and interacting with a mouse, keyboard or touchscreen.<p>Unlike most earlier display protocols, X is specifically designed to be used over network connections rather than on an integral or attached display device. X features network transparency, which means an X program running on a computer somewhere on a network (such as the Internet) can display its user interface on an X server running on some other computer on the network. The X server is typically the provider of graphics resources and keyboard&#x2F;mouse events to X clients, meaning that the X server is usually running on the computer in front of a human user, while the X client applications run anywhere on the network and communicate with the user&#x27;s computer to request the rendering of graphics content and receive events from input devices including keyboards and mice.<p>source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;X_Window_System" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;X_Window_System</a>')
