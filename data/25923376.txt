Item(by='MikeTheGreat', descendants=None, kids=[25923581], score=None, time=1611712816, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25923113, text='It takes me about a minute to recalibrate for a different keyboard, although I&#x27;m occasionally making typos for another 30-ish minutes (nothing tragic - most often happens when I reach for a somewhat rare key, like ~, `, =, +, etc).<p>So for me at least it&#x27;s pretty quick.  Having radically different keyboard layouts is actually helpful because it&#x27;s really clear (to your muscle memory) that you&#x27;re doing something very different.<p>I use the ErgoDox that I built from plans I found online, a MS Natural Ergonomic 4000, my laptop keyboard, and rectangular Dell keyboards for random computers at work.<p>If you&#x27;ve got the time&#x2F;money and it looks interesting I&#x27;d encourage you to try it.  If it works out you&#x27;ll be happy, and if doesn&#x27;t you&#x27;ll at least know that it doesn&#x27;t work for you.  But hey, it&#x27;s your choice, for sure :)')
