In Europe, bulk of tax revenues come from high tax rates on middle class, while in the US, most of the tax revenue is paid by the wealthy. In concrete terms, Americans in top 1% of income distribution  pay nearly 40% of all federal income tax, and top 10% pays 70% of all federal income tax. Thatâ€™s significantly more progressive than all large European countries.')
