Not necessarily at all. Say I have a bar that is completely dead on a Wednesday night, due to it being Wednesday night and it being in some off part of town.<p>I could advertise that I have some free jam space for musicians, a drum kit and a PA with a few microphones and maybe some guitar&#x2F;bass amp or speaker cabinet. Maybe people will show up to make some noise. Those same people (and maybe a few of their friends) will buy a few drinks, and that&#x27;s where the &quot;enriching my business&quot; part comes in.<p>Nobody is required to buy a drink, and so this is a better offer than them having to actually <i>rent</i> equipment and room.')
