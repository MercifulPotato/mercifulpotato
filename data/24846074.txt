Onboarding new machines has become a nightmare when people can&#x27;t go to the office.<p>The problem is a catch-22.. We require a &#x27;trusted&#x27; machine to connect to the VPN. Yet the VPN is required to connect to AD and bind it, which is the de-facto way it becomes trusted.<p>Before someone in the office would do this but in many cases this hasn&#x27;t been possible since COVID so it&#x27;s exposed the issues with this approach. But even before that, working from home has been causing a lot of friction.<p>Everyone is moving to EMM models now, like Google Beyondcorp. MS is pushing Intune now as main management, with &#x27;comanagement&#x27; with AD for the time being because it doesn&#x27;t have the same scope of functionality yet.
