Check out the state of Linux support on Intel Macs that were released in and after 2016[1], it&#x27;s abysmal. Once Apple started adding non-standard hardware, Linux support never caught up.<p>It isn&#x27;t like the lack of support is Linux developers&#x27; fault. Apple doesn&#x27;t provide datasheets for their hardware, and they don&#x27;t cooperate with developers writing drivers for their custom hardware.<p>There are hundreds, if not thousands, of ARM SoCs that &quot;run Linux&quot;, but that doesn&#x27;t mean much because they&#x27;re actually running Linux forks, and someone needs to maintain those forks, and build and release custom images for each SoC. I don&#x27;t see M1 Macs diverting from that fate without significant support from Apple themselves.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Dunedan&#x2F;mbp-2016-linux&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Dunedan&#x2F;mbp-2016-linux&#x2F;</a>')
