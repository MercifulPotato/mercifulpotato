My computer has multiple cores running multiple gigabit each. Detecting the connected hardware should be a trivial task.<p>I am fully aware that modern computers are supposed to be easier to use for the average person and they are certainly easier to _start_ to use, but having spent time teaching my grandparents to use their computer I am honestly not sure they wouldn&#x27;t benefit from a simpler text based interface with less bullshit, random confusing crap that appears to change (live tiles in win10 is a specially annoying example) programs that ask&#x2F;demand to be updated) and so on.<p>Of course they would have to learn to use it, and it would somehow have to access their garden websites, but it is not ridiculous. Not if you are a very new computer user and not if you are a very advanced computer user.<p>Anyway my childhood computer was a win98 computer, so I don&#x27;t approach this from a nostalgic perspective but from the point of view that a modern computer should be better in all cases than an old machine.')
