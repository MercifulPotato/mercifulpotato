Can you point me to your source for the excerpts in your sibling comments?<p>Edit: reading your lancet link now (sorry about that).<p>My understanding from reading the description of the Moderna results was “XX &#x2F; YYY people developed covid; but we didn’t test everyone in the YYY set” (so people who definitely got it &#x2F; went to a hospital &#x2F; whatever are in XX, but asymptomatic cases may not be). Agreed?<p>My understanding of the AZ studies (despite all their other mistakes) is that participants were being tested weekly, regardless of symptoms. Is that incorrect, or are you suggesting something else?<p>I definitely don’t want to repeating misinformation.<p>Second Edit: after looking at table 2 in [1] and comparing the results to the common headline “about 60% effective” [2], it seems like media are reporting the “two standard doses” results. That might be what some folks end up doing, and it’s regretful that the study design went all over the place.<p>Either way, thanks for the nuance! I will update my future comments to note that the confidence intervals including the asymptomatic results are wildly large, such that they need serious discounting.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lancet&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS0140-6736(20)32661-1&#x2F;fulltext" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lancet&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS0140-6...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-europe-55862233" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-europe-55862233</a>')
