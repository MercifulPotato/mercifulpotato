(Not being a startup doesn&#x27;t guarantuee better respect for working hours, just increases the probability.)<p>Some other options are to give in to the pressure from management&#x2F;peers and work for free (doesn&#x27;t sound good to me). The other is that your additional time is incredibly well-compensated or that the success of the company has huge upside for you and this makes the extra effort worthwhile (seems unlikely).')
