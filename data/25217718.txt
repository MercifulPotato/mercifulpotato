One radical new chip design could be very micron-sized coolant pipes for wicking away heat. The &quot;coolant&quot; could perhaps be gallium for rapid heat transfer. Micro-valves could open&#x2F;close as parts of the chip draw more power, pumping more fluid through them, and cooling them faster.<p>Every problem has a solution, we must be creative enough to discover &amp; build it.')
