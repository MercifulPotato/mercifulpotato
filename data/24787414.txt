Trump may have done all sorts of things China doesn&#x27;t like, and I&#x27;m not interested in getting into a general political debate about the merits of each of those things, but he hasn&#x27;t done much about the Uyghur situation, aside from when his arm&#x27;s been twisted by Congress. His personal concern in Chinese trade policy seems mainly to be mercantilist (minimizing trade deficits and whatnot).')
