It reads source code and generates bytecode at runtime; this bytecode is cached inside `pyc` files. The bytecode is interpreted.<p>Erlang (pre-JIT) has a compilation step. The compiler reads the source code and generates bytecode files (.beam). The runtime interprets this bytecode; it doesn&#x27;t care about the original source.<p>Erlang (with JIT) has the same compilation process, but at runtime, it also converts the bytecode to machine code in memory. Then it executes that code, which removes the interpretation overhead.')
