But I&#x27;m certainly not going to install Linux for my wife or mother in law - I&#x27;m a proponent and an enthusiast but not a masochist and I do not want to constantly fix and explain the differences.<p>Perhaps less controversially, for my gaming &amp; photo-editing PC, Windows &quot;just works&quot;. I don&#x27;t worry about install, drivers, maintenance, distros, anything. It&#x27;s been rock stable through Win7-Win10 updates from 2013 through now with no reinstalls or hassle.<p>Is that a personal anecdote - of course it is; but if we&#x27;re going to make sweeping &quot;it&#x27;s superior&quot; statements, I feel we <i>must</i> state the scope&#x2F;goal. So very very very few things in life are superior for everything to everybody :-&#x2F;')
