I don&#x27;t want to know just what was decided, but why.  Often I will come back to &quot;should x be updated&quot; again and again. Knowing the factors in the last decision is very important.  More than once I&#x27;ve pushed to update x and had someone say &quot;we can&#x27;t for good reasons that I forget&quot;. Often I&#x27;ve spent weeks redoing the discussion before someone remembers&#x2F;discovers why we can&#x27;t do the update and we all go &quot;whoa, I&#x27;m glad we didn&#x27;t do that&quot;.  Other times we discover&#x2F;remember why we couldn&#x27;t update and they are for reasons that no longer apply and so we do the update.  Still other times we never discover any reason why we shouldn&#x27;t update.  Last sometimes we discover why we shouldn&#x27;t have updated after it is too late and we have a mess to undo while backing out the update.<p>The important part is we know why a decision was made. Chat logs are not a good archive because there is too much to sort thought that isn&#x27;t relevant. Better than nothing, but what is really needed is an effort to document why in a place the right people will find it when they need to know.')
