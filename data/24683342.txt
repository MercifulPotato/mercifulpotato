If you&#x27;re running a server with multiple containers and you&#x27;re concerned about attackers taking over one of those then you can isolate them more from each other and the rest of the system using VMs.<p>(Addendum: I&#x27;m not that experienced when it comes to container tech and I heard you can isolate your containers pretty well these days. Virtualization has also changed over time and isn&#x27;t as &quot;isolated&quot; as it was once; for example virtualized guests are often executed directly on the host&#x27;s CPU. I&#x27;d definitely look into this more before deciding on one approach.)')
