Past weeks, I was working on Hey Gamer. I thought it&#x27;d be good to explain myself and why I started to build such a thing.<p>I am currently working in a gaming-related company. I get a lot of questions about working in such an environment. Most of them are coming from younger people.<p>I have concluded that most people think that you can work in a gaming company only if you are a game developer or designer. So I wanted to show that this is not correct. But this is only one of the many reasons I have.<p>As an employee and a gaming enthusiast, I am aware of &quot;demanding&quot; nature of gaming companies. And I believe that it shouldn&#x27;t be like that. So I am trying to amplify the voice of those companies who care about their work-mates. Soon, I will start to produce content for both employers and employees about building an ethical and respectful working environment.<p>Lastly, I am building Hey Gamer as an Open Startup. So far I have nothing to show, but once I have some stats, everyone on the internet will be able to see what&#x27;s going on inside my product. I also ditched Google Analytics for Simple Analytics, so I am trying to be as ethical as I can towards my future partners and visitors.<p>Please feel free to give me any feedback you can to make my product better. It&#x27;s nowhere near to be a perfect product at the moment, but I dedicate all my evenings into it.')
