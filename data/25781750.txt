In emacs, the portions in C appear to mostly be (no desire to produce an actual breakdown) there for:<p>1. Handling system calls for IO, networking, display<p>2. Implementing the elisp language itself<p>3. Implementing some things so they&#x27;re faster than raw elisp<p>And the preference seems to be to expose, to the greatest extent possible, functionality to the elisp users, even if it&#x27;s actually implemented in C. This is in contrast to the popular JS-based editors which seem to be more interested in a more controlled&#x2F;limited exposure of functionality to users.')
