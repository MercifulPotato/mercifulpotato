Duplicate APIs usually get deprecated, like the old ALAssets photo library API.<p>Try building an app in .NET.  There are dozens of different breadcrumbs you can follow on the MS docs for varying versions of .NET, Windows, and frameworks with radically different feature parity and UI systems.  Virtually everything you google when building a .NET app has to suffixed with a bunch of identifying information for which libraries and versions you are targeting.<p>Open source has a serious advantage in this regard because communities tend to congregate around project and documentation styles that are consistent with similar projects, so you already have an intuition for how to navigate a new repo.  I find React Native documentation especially easy to parse, although sometimes missing features or examples.<p>OSs have it tough because their docs aren&#x27;t tailored specifically to each framework and domain space.  But maybe they should be.  I think if engineers felt more like they owned their product&#x27;s documentation, layout, and structure like at smaller companies, they&#x27;d be more inclined to make it just right.  The SwiftUI specific tutorials are great.')
