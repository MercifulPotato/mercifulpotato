No.<p>- AOC leading a take over of Pelosi&#x27;s office: No, probably the opposite. People were likely laughing about it and mildly annoyed.<p>- Mobs of people ransacking the capitol? Yeah, people felt _terrified_, and multiple people died.<p>See the difference? There&#x27;s non-violent peaceful protest, and there&#x27;s threats of violence, or actual violence, that one can feel in their bones, and which color the situation and subsequent charges should events fall out of line with our tradition of protest. Though events can&#x27;t be known ahead of time, it&#x27;s fairly easy in retrospect to judge intent -- i.e, AOC didn&#x27;t enter Pelosi&#x27;s office dressed in tactical gear and holding zip ties, with a mob of angry &quot;Squad&quot; members calling for the Senate minority leader&#x27;s death.<p>It&#x27;s offensive to common sense and morally dubious to compare these things, or to even bring them up in this context.')
