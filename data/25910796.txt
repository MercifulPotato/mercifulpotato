Item(by='dang', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611620370, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25910071, text='&quot;Unusual opinions&quot; can mean a lot of things. It&#x27;s not hard to express unusual opinions without breaking the site guidelines, but often people can&#x27;t resist ranting, lashing out at the mainstream and so on, at the same time. That approach is guaranteed to get downvoted, and typically the commenter does not think &quot;perhaps I could have expressed myself more thoughtfully&quot;. Instead they think, &quot;I am being downvoted for my unpopular opinions&quot;. It always feels like the fault lies with others. (Edit: of course that applies to what I&#x27;m saying here, too...fair&#x27;s fair.)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>')
