For example, we could reduce the number of product cards shown per page, reduce the number of recommendation widgets per page etc. These could be turned on&#x2F;off instantly by flipping a dynamic config flag (no deployments or restarts necessary).\nOur organic search traffic used to generate huge amount of load on our backend services like pricing&#x2F;promotions and logistics-promise services. We would isolate capacity of these backend services for serving such expensive upstream services and also put rate-limiting circuit breakers to avoid them from killing those critical backend services. Obviously, we had similar feature reduction&#x2F;degradation mechanisms built into our data platforms. Capacity was reallocated for critical data pipelines and all experimental&#x2F;training pipelines were stopped. Drill-downs or adhoc query interfaces were locked down. And, it goes without saying that during these few sale days, the proactive monitoring&#x2F;alerting and oncall rigor was on high-alert to detect and react quickly in case systems didn&#x27;t behave as expected.')
