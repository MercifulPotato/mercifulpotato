If you peruse the comment section of &#x27;How to Radicalise a Normie&#x27; by (I think) Innuendo Studios, you&#x27;ll see a ton of comments talking about how these people used to be radical in the opposite way (e.g. alt-right).<p>But if you look in the comment section of an alt-right analogue of Innuendo Studios&#x27; video (something like &quot;I used to be an SJW&quot;), you&#x27;ll see the exact same type of comment about how people used to be like the people in the Innuendo Studios comment section.<p>I&#x27;ve personally been on both sides at one time or another, and I reckon that the &#x27;radical&#x27; component stays the same or even increases, even as the attribute of &#x27;left-wing&#x27; or &#x27;right-wing&#x27; may fluctuate, like a helix of some kind.')
