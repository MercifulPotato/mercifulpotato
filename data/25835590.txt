Remember that field strength goes as the inverse square of the distance from the transmitter.<p>Suppose you need a certain minimum field strength for the receivers to work, and suppose it turns out that there is also a maximum safe field strength.<p>With a system based on a small number of powerful transmitters to cover an area you can usually place those transmitters in somewhat out of the way places that few people get near. You will have variation in field strength as you move around within the service area, but it won&#x27;t be a lot of variation.<p>If I&#x27;m 1000 m from the transmitter and move 1 m closer, the field gets 0.2% stronger.<p>With a system based on a large number of weaker transmitters those transmitters need to be closer to where the receivers are to get the same minimum field strength throughout the same area. But with people much closer to the transmitters, there will be a lot more variation in field strength as they move around, so it would be harder to make sure that no places where people commonly go stays under your maximum.<p>If I&#x27;m 100 m from the transmitter and move 1 m closer, the field gets 2% stronger.<p>If I&#x27;m 10 m from the transmitter and move 1 m closer, the field gets 23% stronger.')
