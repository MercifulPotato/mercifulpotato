He played Captain Hook. [1]. It was actually a lot of fun. All through the show they teased Ice Ice Baby (&quot;Captain - the pirates are overheating. They need some rice, rice baby&quot; etc etc).<p>He eventually performed his hit at the end. He definitely looked like he was enjoying himself and didn&#x27;t take himself too seriously.<p>He also used to be in a tv show on cable channel called Men and Motors, reviewing the in-car entertainment in young people&#x27;s cars with Jordan (a glamour model&#x2F;reality tv star). It was called Ice with Jordan [2]<p>I really feel I could do a page of footnotes here for non-Brits explaining what a pantomime is in the UK, equivalent US towns to Chatham, who Jordan is etc etc.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kentonline.co.uk&#x2F;medway&#x2F;news&#x2F;rapper-vanilla-ice-in-chatham-ah-a69364&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kentonline.co.uk&#x2F;medway&#x2F;news&#x2F;rapper-vanilla-ice-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;playlist?list=PLJXJH_flgKWg_VhVHpDLuZrOk402gKqdY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;playlist?list=PLJXJH_flgKWg_VhVHpDLu...</a>')
