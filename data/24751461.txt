Perhaps I simply had bad luck with specific nVidia cards, but the AMD driver is <i>stable</i> in a way the nVidia driver simply never was, especially w&#x2F; respect to GPU accelerated desktop environments and screen capture utilities. The only change I made was to switch Arch over to the LTS kernel, as the upstream kernel in Arch isn&#x27;t quite as battle hardened, and did occasionally require a rollback. That&#x27;s not something that&#x27;s likely to affect any other distro though, it&#x27;s a side effect of Arch&#x27;s bleeding edge nature.<p>Anecdotal data and all that. I&#x27;m on a Radeon VII, pretty darn solid, will probably continue to choose AMD cards in the future. Wish the Windows driver were a bit more stable, and it&#x27;s... frankly <i>weird</i> to be saying that in comparison to the Linux driver for the same card.')
