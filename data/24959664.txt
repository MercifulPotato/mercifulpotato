But TLA+ is a tool aimed to help achieve correctness <i>effectively</i>, i.e. get a good cost&#x2F;benefit for it. Between the highly scalable, low-confidence, testing, and the high-confidence, low-scale end-to-end verification, there&#x27;s a huge swath of software correctness techniques, and the flexible TLA+ tries to hit a rather large swathe of that spectrum.<p>In other words, we ask, is this <i>better than what we do now</i> in a sufficiently large portion of cases, rather than is this the silver bullet? The answer to the second question is no. I think the answer to the first one is yes.')
