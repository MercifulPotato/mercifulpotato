If it&#x27;s a more sophisticated harrasment where users change, then reporting one of them won&#x27;t do anything better than blocking.\nIf it&#x27;s someone spamming random numbers, a simple algorithm can raise a flag without any report necessary.<p>The child porn scenario just seems so bizarre, why would someone send you child porn? And I&#x27;m pretty sure the police will get involved in that case.')
