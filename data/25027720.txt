For instance, you could say the same thing about trans people, and that might be true among mainstream straight people, but personally I found dating far easier once I transitioned, and find trans people hotter.<p>Also, disabled people often date each other, which comes with some downsides (like not having an able-bodied partner to be a caretaker), but means you&#x27;re shielded from that icky stigma and you don&#x27;t have a partner who&#x27;s ashamed of you.')
