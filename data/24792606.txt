Things might be different for very large businesses who are spending millions per month, but that&#x27;s hardly relevant to how Google might handle email customers hypothetically paying $9.95 a month for a personal mailbox.<p>Then don’t pay google $10 a month.  I don’t.  I do the work of supporting businesses that I think deserve it.  I know some businesses have monopolies that customers can’t fix by voting with their wallet, but email isn’t one of them.<p>&gt; Collaborating with hostile entities is not a redeeming quality.<p>Using their free services and not voting for the right candidate in the market by paying for the service is collaborating with hostile entities (in the example of email where there is no monopoly and almost zero cost to switching).')
