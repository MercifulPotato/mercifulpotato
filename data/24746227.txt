Item(by='croissants', descendants=None, kids=[24746688], score=None, time=1602428496, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24741985, text='Is &quot;this&quot; my parent comment (&quot;Is the argument you&#x27;re making...&quot;)? I edited that immediately after you added more text to your parent comment (&quot;Are you planning to dox Apple employees?&quot;), but not after your other comment (&quot;I don’t know why you would think it’s my argument.&quot;).<p>Anyway, if I understand correctly your position is that if people here believe that Apple&#x27;s action is wrong, then they must believe that protestors doxxing Belarusian law enforcement is justified. Therefore people here should also believe that doxxing Apple employees is justified.<p>My response is that any question of &quot;relative badness&quot; changes  drastically in the immediate presence of real physical violence. If Belarusian law enforcement is out on the streets cracking demonstrators&#x27; skulls, it&#x27;s more plausible that doxxing is a lesser evil (though of course, I have no idea how credible this doxxing is) -- direct physical violence just makes every response more acceptable.<p>Apple&#x27;s response may have the downstream effect of increasing physical violence, but only through a more diffuse chain of events, so it&#x27;s possible to think that Apple&#x27;s action is bad but, unlike direct physical violence, not bad enough to warrant doxxing its employees (which, anyway, doesn&#x27;t seem anywhere near as effective as doxxing Belarusian law enforcement -- how many Apple employees have the power to affect this policy?).')
