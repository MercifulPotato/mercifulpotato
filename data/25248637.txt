It&#x27;s likely that (again, presuming here) if this is your first time doing this sort of thing, you&#x27;re not able to provide precise (even if non-technical) feedback to your developers and likewise they may not be very good at taking non-technical information and translating that into actionable technical output (i.e., code and bugfixes).<p>Maybe try looking at the curriculum for product management courses first?  I think they might give you quicker, more effective benefit than trying to build up knowledge of computers (especially from such a fundamental level).  You&#x27;ll spend a lot of time learning things that, while beneficial eventually probably, won&#x27;t help you right now.')
