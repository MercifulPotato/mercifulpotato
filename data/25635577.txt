Overly complex, yet always too restricted, unfocused and trying to be everything to everybody (and failing at that), having severe cognitive issues and far-distance effects (tried to grok other people&#x27;s CSS?), making implementing browsers from scratch impossible, carrying loads of extra bytes and CDNs spying on you, inviting people to flaunt their Stockholm&#x27;s as in: managed to grok CSS so now have to educate the world when the question really should be whether we need it at all. Above all: unnecessary proliferation of microsyntax and unintended consequences (&quot;frameworks&quot;) when HTML attributes are or should be sufficient.
