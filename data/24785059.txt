I&#x27;m kind fo sad Google essentially let Dejanews (Google Groups) whither. Yes, you can create groups on it, but it&#x27;s second mission to gather the world&#x27;s information and make it accessible was kind of abandoned, otherwise they would have continued to pursue the old archives.<p>Ditto for old BITNET&#x2F;LISTSERVs needing to be archived. A lot of my childhood is wrapped in up BBSes, BITNET&#x2F;LISTSERVs&#x2F;Majordomo lists, and USENET, and being able to see some of it on textfiles.com and Deja was a nostalgic joy ride down memory lane.')
