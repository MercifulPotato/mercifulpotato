The support for C# works for F# - just like basically any other C# library can be used from F#. I figure the reason they don&#x27;t mention F# is because it is obvious and&#x2F;or implied but perhaps at the same time don&#x27;t want to infer there is some kind of F#&#x2F;FP-style syntax.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t confuse Project Reunion and the arbitrary Windows Store requirement that apps be compiled with .NET Native. A requirement that, frankly, is on borrowed time anyway and I can&#x27;t envisage it surviving much longer. Once .NET 6 delivers Mono-style AOT support - .NET Native&#x27;s sole remaining purpose will cease to exist. Not that modern hardware ever needed it. It was intended for Windows Phones.<p>If the choice facing us was a simple as you describe then, for example, <i>we</i> wouldn&#x27;t have ended up building a UWP app in F# back in 2018, would we? Not everything is black and white nor zero sum.')
