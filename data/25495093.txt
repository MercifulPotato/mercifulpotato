Item(by='hbbio', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608560122, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25494054, text='According to their own description: &quot;Planet Storyline is a website, which provides you information about Technology, DigitalMarketing, Graphicdesign and more about Lifestyle Blogs.&quot; so it&#x27;s more than a random human studies researcher lacking tech skills.<p>As @pepemon points out, the free tier of CloudFlare is probably sufficient and most of the non-tech people running their own variant of WP I know of stopped after being attacked (successfully...) by bots at some point. If you lack tech skills, I think it&#x27;s best to go to wix, squarespace etc. anyway but platforms are definitely not a requirement and you&#x27;d be surprised by the amount of (again non-tech) people who can learn to use a static site generator (with premade theme) and host it using vercel or even S3. At some point, if you want to spread a message, it&#x27;s worth learning how to do it.')
