Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God&quot; but then you also have scholars who claim that the eye of the needle was a gate in Jerusalem, others who claim that &quot;camel&quot; is a Greek misspelling and that kamêlos (camel) was written in place of kamilos, meaning &quot;rope&quot; or &quot;cable&quot;.<p>Then of course you have quotes like  &quot;The LORD makes poor and makes rich; he brings low and he exalts.”...
