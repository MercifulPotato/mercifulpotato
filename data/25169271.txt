I’ve never had a problem with it.<p>There are tradeoffs, but just the fact that nearly every single one of our conversations are documented and searchable is worth it alone.<p>You can’t just walk over to talk to someone anytime the notion strikes you, but you shouldn’t have been doing that anyway. I love to talk, and I love to think out loud. But every time I do that, I’m asking someone else to divert there attention to me.<p>Being remote allows people to turn off the majority of the interruptions and get work done when they need to.<p>And it forces me to spend more time thinking about my communications. Instead of just constantly walking over to people the moment an idea pops into my head.')
