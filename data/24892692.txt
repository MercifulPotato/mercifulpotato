I mean 40 min is crazy long. What builds this long? Chrome, Windows, Linux Kernel on a single core? This should have been raising red flags much earlier. The only explanation I can come up with is that the whole build takes hours anyway, otherwise there is no way you wouldn&#x27;t notice this sooner.')
