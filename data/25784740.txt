A few of my relatives are currently using it and enjoying it.<p>Fun fact, the client is very lightweight and completely written in svelte, except for a tiny rust&#x2F;wasm helper lib. The backend is 100% rust paired with postgres. I wrote my own tiny server framework on top of hyper which is much nicer to use than most of the heavier frameworks I&#x27;ve tried.<p>Anyway, the site is almost complete, just finishing up a few minor details before launching it to the public! It has a free tier as well as a paid tied for users that want more.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in trying it, please do reach out :)<p>After launch, I plan on tweeting about it and about building my first business as a solo dev.')
