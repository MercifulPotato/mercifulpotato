How do you do that if the SSD is permanently soldered in place, and can&#x27;t even be readily attached to another machine for cloning or analysis?<p>I&#x27;d also imagine difficulties with end-of-life disposal; you can&#x27;t just shred the discs and sell the rest for refurbishing or donate them for PR&#x2F;tax write offs anymore.')
