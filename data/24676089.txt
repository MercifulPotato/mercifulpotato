For quite a while, we maintained a Wii homebrew ecosystem that, using our tools, let you run unsigned code on the game CPU, but not the security CPU. By doing this, piracy becomes impractical, because pirated games would need extensive binary patching to work in this environment. All piracy tools for the Wii from this era relied on exploiting the security system, usually with a different exploit from ours, since we were pretty good at hiding them (mostly so Nintendo took longer to fix them, but this was a nice side effect). This had next to no impact  on non piracy related homebrew software. Modding worked fine, because having the disc in the drive let you correctly authenticate as the real game, and then you could patch the executable before launch to add your mods only. Such is how the Wii security architecture works.<p>Eventually we opened up the security CPU for other reasons (mostly a recovery&#x2F;low level bootloader tool we built), but even then, piracy requires <i>specific</i> software, namely hacks that translate game disc access APIs to either DVD-Video access APIs or a USB storage stack. So sure, you have a general purpose computer, but you still need specific software.<p>Xecuter aren&#x27;t just selling hardware and software that turn your Switch into a general purpose computer. They are selling hardware and software that has <i>specific</i> features for pirating games that are not useful in any other context. And therein lies the difference.')
