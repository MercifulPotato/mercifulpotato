The windows theme is a little dated, but Windows users are used to a random mishmash of inconsistent styles, so likely won&#x27;t cause complaints. On Mac, well actually I haven&#x27;t personally tried it on Mac, just Windows&#x2F;Linux, but I hear a lot of vocal complaints about GTK not fitting in from mac users.
