It&#x27;s one thing for the courts to do this, it&#x27;s quite another for infrastructure providers to decide it&#x27;s now their job to police their customers.<p>Infrastructure providers have already decided they get to police their customers, eg. cloudflare dropping stormfront or other white supremacists as customers.<p>EDIT: To be clear I agree it is entirely worrying that infrastructure that takes up a significant amount of the known internet is under the control of a large corporation that can seemingly decide to boot people for violations of terms of service. I just want to disagree that this is new. It&#x27;s not new. It&#x27;s old and well-established by now. If we want to change this, it&#x27;ll have to be through a law.')
