Item(by='pqb', descendants=None, kids=[25445610], score=None, time=1608137546, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25444047, text='&gt; The ability for one window to float over another was a later innovation and is of course more difficult to implement.<p>I find it funny, because I would say I have seen more floating window manager, when I was browsing GitHub, so I assume it is also quite easy to create a new one from scratch. Such floating VMs usually have 200-1000 LOC and die after 1 month after initial commit. Recently, xwm has been on HN [0] and it is small in terms of SLOC. There is smaller one called tinywm[1]. When we would compare them to i3[2] and sway, we can see they have thousand times larger codebase but they also bring a lot more features.<p>I keep my fingers crossed for more sophisticated WMs like PaperWM[3], which is &quot;tiled scrollable window manager&quot; to take off. They might synthesize ideas from floating and tiling managers and provide a better tool to manage windows on a screen.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mcpcpc&#x2F;xwm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mcpcpc&#x2F;xwm</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mackstann&#x2F;tinywm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mackstann&#x2F;tinywm</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;i3&#x2F;i3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;i3&#x2F;i3</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;paperwm&#x2F;PaperWM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;paperwm&#x2F;PaperWM</a>')
