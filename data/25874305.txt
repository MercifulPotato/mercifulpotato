Yep, for now, we focus on file sync and share.<p>Personally, I am looking into kopano or etesync to replace calendar and contacts. We already embed kopano konnectd as the OpenID provider so, there are synergies.<p>We do maintain backwards compatibility for the WebDAV, OCS and OCM apis and the clients are all working. The inner hook system of oc 10 obviously is gone, just as well as the internal PHP APIs. Instead we now rely on the CS3 APIs that describe a set of services in a microservice architecture to extend or customize functionality. Something that has always been fragile, because a bug in an oc&#x2F;nc app could affect all other services.<p>Furthermore, we did not have to start from scratch but contributed to reva, which has been powering CernBox for a few years. It is the reference implementation for the CS3 api.<p>So, we are very much Protocol driven, which makes changing the implementation language possible if needed. And everyone is free to implement his own service replacement if he needs to. The extensive acceptance testsuite will tell you what is not working compared to oc 10 or ocis. For now, we are pretty happy with go and the initial benchmarks.<p>One more thing regarding core developers having moved from oc to nc. The server is just one piece of the puzzle. None, literally, none of the desktop, iOS or Android developers paid by ownCloud moved to the fork. It feels as if they were not even considered important. The sync protocol and the end user experience on his daily driver really is what matters. I am very happy that we as ownCloud finally grabbed the chance to really tackle the file sync and share part with the right tools for the job. Without being pulled in a gazillion of directions. I cannot express my gratitude for the rest of the oc sales and support team that keeps oc 10 well running and bought us the time to actually make this step. Truly exciting times<p>Keep in mind this is still tech preview. There is still a lot of work to do. Helping hands welcome. And yes we need to work on our communication skills...<p>Full disclosure: oc employee no 7 and ocis tech lead here. Originally hired to work on full text search in ownCloud 10. Good old times. Cheers to all the oc and nc devs: it should be possible to implement the internal PHP API of oc&#x2F;nc using roadrunner. That might allow existing PHP apps to be wrapped in a dedicated microservice. But that is not something we are investing time in. Feel free to ping me on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talk.owncloud.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talk.owncloud.com</a>')
