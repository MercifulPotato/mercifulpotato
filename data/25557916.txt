AAA is now a small and ever-shrinking fraction of the overall games market.<p>Will raytracing the best engine that a 30-person team can build in 2 years any simpler? No, because &quot;the best engine that a 30-person team can build in 2 years&quot; is at a particular level of complexity by definition. Will it make the gap between the best engine that a 30-person team can build in 2 years and the best engine that one guy in his bedroom can build much smaller? Yes, yes it will.<p>Custom game engines are already dinosaurs; most of the money in games is elsewhere. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll continue to be produced, just like you can still pay a lot of money for a mainframe today. Mainframes were never defeated, not exactly - they can still do things that commodity hardware can&#x27;t do. But they just became irrelevant.')
