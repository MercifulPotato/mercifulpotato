Item(by='moron4hire', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602615894, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24763495, text='Back when I got my driver&#x27;s license in the late 90s, Pennsylvania couldn&#x27;t handle Scottish surnames, so my last name ended up &quot;MC BETH&quot; after I wrote it on the form as &quot;McBeth&quot; (which is ludicrous, there have been Scots people in Pennsylvania far longer than there have been licenses). When I moved to Virginia 7 years ago, Virginia <i>could</i> handle it, but my PA license showed a &quot;MC BETH&quot;, so my VA license shows &quot;MC BETH&quot;.<p>Before they issue the license, they give you a form to review. They warn you to check the form for errors, because errors are &quot;serious business&quot; with &quot;serious consequences&quot;. So I point out the space on the form, that it is not the correct spelling of my name.<p>The clerk got quite surly with me. It didn&#x27;t matter that all the other documentation I had to submit--including my birth certificate--along with my change of residency showed &quot;McBeth&quot;. Apparently, the PA DMV of 1998 was infallible and I&#x27;m now trying to pull some sort of fraud fastball in VA in getting that space removed.')
