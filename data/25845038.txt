I get the impression that swaylock is a direct port of i3lock, and thus stands a fair chance of being written and architected in an X style, rather than taking advantage of any superior form that Wayland may support but X didn’t.<p>Expressed otherwise: just because someone’s written one piece of bad software for Wayland doesn’t mean Wayland doesn’t allow you to write good software. (Whereas I get the impression from what I’m reading that X makes it impossible to write a good screen locker, if by that you require that it be crash-proof and use the usual platform toolkit for the UI.)<p>(Remember in this that I’m saying <i>I don’t know</i>. I’d like to hear if Wayland <i>does</i> have a good answer to this, or from anyone with definite knowledge that it doesn’t.)')
