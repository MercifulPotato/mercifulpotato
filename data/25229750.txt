A fundamental problem in the research community is that incentives as misaligned to support that initiative, and so there are an endless stream of papers published that are either flawed in themselves or obtained spurious results that wouldn&#x27;t hold up under additional systematic scrutiny.<p>Worse, these flawed pieces of research feed into the sound-byte media cycle and over time have eroded public trust &amp; confidence in the scientific process. To some extent that&#x27;s unavoidable when preliminary research, even well performed, us taken out of context. But every study performed with a handful of subjects that producing a weak result with controversial implications will be shouted from the roof tops nonetheless.<p>So, to PG saying a successful scientist must pursue novel research: stop navel gazing on the superiority of SV values and looking to shove them into every area of human endeavor. You&#x27;re wrong, and sometimes dangerously so.')
