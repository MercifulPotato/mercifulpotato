You don&#x27;t need a reason.<p>For other stuff if you want a second opinion you ask for it.<p>The case being talked about is of a child who had no brain who was being kept breathing by machine. He had no hope of life.<p>In the UK the doctors come up with a care plan and put it to the parents. If the parents disagree the doctors have to go to court to get a ruling. The English courts are there to protect the rights of the child, and the rights of the parents. The child is given their own independent legal representative.')
