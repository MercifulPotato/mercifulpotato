Item(by='owenversteeg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610748648, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25796238, text='No, what I said was entirely correct. I did not say &quot;if everyone did not sell any Bitcoin&quot;, I said &quot;if everyone did not sell or buy any Bitcoin&quot;.<p>I&#x27;d also like to point out that you do not need to own Bitcoin to sell Bitcoin. If you believe the price of Bitcoin will be lower in the future, you can borrow Bitcoin and sell it now, also know as &quot;selling short&quot;, or &quot;shorting&quot;. You can, of course, also borrow Bitcoin and not sell it.<p>I would also like to mention - if you truly believe that you can forecast future prices based on the psychology of recent buyers, you can make lots of money. There are a number of regulated markets where the buyers (or at least a decent portion of them) -are- known, so if you feel that you can do this, be my guest and become the next Warren Buffett.<p>Finally, Bitcoin is entirely unlike Bay Area property. You cannot generate Bay Area property out of thin air using computers, there are no schemes being investigated for printing billions of fake dollars to buy up Bay Area property, and it is far less liquid than Bitcoin. The price of Bay Area property also does not double in a month.')
