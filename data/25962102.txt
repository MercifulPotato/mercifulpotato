Some universities will take pretty big stakes when they can.<p>Calling this a fellowship is a bit confusing, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s anything more nefarious than perhaps simply misleading&#x2F;confusing. At least they&#x27;re up front with the fact that they&#x27;ll take a 10% stake. Many universities that will try to take a pretty similar stake aren&#x27;t so up-front.')
