Rearchitechting an entire CPU seems like it would be a boondoggle. Especially since the well of side channels runs infinity deep unless you&#x27;re back to single core, single thread CPUs. As soon as they &#x27;fix&#x27; this side channel, another will be found. It&#x27;s just an inevitability of multi-tennant processing.<p>I&#x27;d have preferred a hardware flag that says &quot;I accept that if untrusted code runs on this CPU, I&#x27;ve already lost&quot; and keep the performance boosts of speculation, but alas.')
