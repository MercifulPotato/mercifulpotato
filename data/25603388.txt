(I just tried comparing the binaries of my own app updates, where I have the source code and know what changed, but it&#x27;s not pretty, and not &quot;a few bytes&quot;.) Moreover, App Store reviewers are not the least bit qualified to even make this determination with regard to &quot;bytes changed&quot;.<p>Two binaries aren&#x27;t even going to have the same load address for the __TEXT __text segment, and thus a lot of stuff will be different. You think App Store reviewers have any conception of the structure of a Mach-O? Now, one might try to hand-wave and say the &quot;automated tools&quot; will take care of everything, but that&#x27;s extremely unlikely. Diffing binaries is a skill that requires a human with extensive experience in reverse engineering. If it were totally automated, then all of the securities researchers out there would have those tools too, but they don&#x27;t. There are of course tools that help a lot, but the human researcher is still essential to the process.')
