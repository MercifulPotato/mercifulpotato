We wasted a lot of time trying to get everything to properly build and link due to the convoluted way Espressif has set up the CMake dependencies. Lots of hard coded paths and one little thing could cause a lot of issues with compilation.<p>I even submitted a PR to fix one of the areas that caused me a lot of headache (it had to do with an assumption about the Python environment), and it was rejected because the ESP-IDF is meant to be opinionated about its choices.<p>What&#x27;s even worse is Amazon&#x27;s ESP32 FreeRTOS distribution. Stay away from that with a 10ft pole. Sure, it sounds nice to have some integration with AWS (GreenGrass, IoT Core, OTA via MQTT via AWS, etc), but half the ESP32 won&#x27;t work (eg multicore) and modules that you find for ESP-IDF are not inherently cross compatible.')
