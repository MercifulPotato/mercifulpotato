I think you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s largely the same: it&#x27;s about government interference, not the freedom to say whatever you want within any business.<p>&gt; My very first comment was not about Parler but in general. Which you keep misunderstanding.<p>No, your first comment was implicitly comparing the content of the article this thread is based on -- which is about Parler -- with the ACLU defending Nazis marching in the streets.<p>Which is an absurd comparison that ignores the historical definition of free speech.')
