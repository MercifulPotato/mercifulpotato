When buying things, time and money trade-off against each other. If you’re low on money, take more time to find deals. If you’re low on time, stop looking for great deals and just buy things quickly online.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m finding, as I&#x27;ve gotten older, that almost every time I&#x27;ve chosen money over time I&#x27;ve made a bad decision.<p>And I see this among my family and friends, too.  There&#x27;s a mentality that emerges when exchanging time for money that somehow makes it so you waste your time and you end up spending almost or more money than you originally would have.<p>I&#x27;m known for saying, &quot;There is a professional person for that...  Let&#x27;s get one,&quot; instead of trying to fix the water heater ourselves or get transport 2 tons of gravel.  Others in my family would have dragged the old trailer out of the barn.  Oh, it has a flat.  Fix that.  Oh, the trailer hitch doesn&#x27;t fit the new truck, oh, get a new hitch (we&#x27;ll use it someday again, surely).  Or get the old truck working, or the older truck working (cause they keep buying cheap used trucks that break down and sit on the property for eternity).  Then go get whatever, and deal with not knowing what they&#x27;re doing.  Me, just get it delivered.  Maybe more money, waaaay less hassle.  In the saved time I&#x27;ve polished up my CSS skills...<p>Time really is the most precious resource you have.  Think hard before you trade it for anything else.')
