You need a visa and pass a government controlled checkpoint when you enter.<p>Europe (mainland) has no internal borders. There are no checkpoints, customs agents or chokepoints between countries.<p>There&#x27;s thousands of roads leading from every country into others.<p>That, plus the fact that both the government and the population have had no experience with this make it very hard to control the virus.<p>I&#x27;m open to learn, though, so if you have some time to explain what we could learn from Vietnam I&#x27;m all ears.')
