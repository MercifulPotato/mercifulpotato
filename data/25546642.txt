Item(by='zbrozek', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609018745, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25544963, text='&gt; Hydrogen really doesn&#x27;t like to be stored though. It also ruins any storage vessel it is kept in long term.<p>It&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s the smallest atom, but it&#x27;s not the smallest molecule. Helium is more prone to escapement since it&#x27;s not diatomic. Doing a bit of research it looks like aluminum is actually a fine container for pressurized hydrogen (low permeation rates, low embrittlement). You do need to reinforce it (e.g., composite wrapping) if you want to go to high pressures.<p>&gt;and this makes less since.<p>FYI, s&#x2F;since&#x2F;sense<p>I think you&#x27;re over-indexing on efficiency. That&#x27;s not the only metric that influences success. Suppose that we have an overabundance of intermittent sources of electricity (e.g., wind and solar). Right now there&#x27;s not much you can do to store it. Batteries are great for smoothing demand over hours or days, but they&#x27;re quite far from smoothing demand over weeks or months.<p>So if you&#x27;re able to cheaply overproduce electricity, it doesn&#x27;t really matter if your storage process is not particularly efficient. Even at fairly low efficiencies, it&#x27;s more useful than throwing it away so long as the capital cost of the conversion equipment is low enough to tolerate the intermittency.<p>As for the cryogenic storage adding an additional efficiency hit - yes, correct. But there&#x27;s an intercept of marginal cost, storage density, and efficiency where it will be economical to do it. The technology question is if we can deliver that intercept at a lower total cost than other alternatives.<p>One thing that&#x27;s really attractive about hydrogen is that the costs are not the processed media. Batteries are full of expensive to mine and refine materials and their storage capacity is more-or-less directly tied to the quantities of used materials. With hydrogen production the media are water and space, both of which are almost free in many contexts. Vehicles aren&#x27;t really one of them because volume is precious, but for stationary applications it&#x27;s a completely different story.')
