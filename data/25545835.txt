Other &quot;corporate pizza chains&quot; it competed with were fine... Domino&#x27;s pizza wasn&#x27;t. As a college student, I heard--and participated in--people calling for &quot;anything but Domino&#x27;s&quot; many many times. There is 100% a market for &quot;food in the shape of Pizza that is as cheap as possible&quot;, but Domino&#x27;s pushes that boundary really hard and for anyone to have believed that that market was anywhere near the size of the addressable corporate pizza market size ignored both common sense and the reality that their competitors seemed to exist and sell pizza (despite it being slightly more expensive).')
