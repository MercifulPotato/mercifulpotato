Allow anyone to curate the results and define a custom list of allowed URLs. Then, others can use their list.<p>For example, I decide Google is terrible when I&#x27;m searching for product reviews, and all I get are results to Amazon referral websites and spam blogs that never owned the products to begin with. So, I find 200 sites or forums that actually have quality reviews and I create a whitelist of those URLs, and I name it &quot;John Doe&#x27;s product reviews list&quot;.<p>Other people visit the search engine and they can see my list, favorite it, and apply it to their results. I maintain the list, so they continue to get updates as it&#x27;s refined.<p>The idea is you visit the search engine, type your query, then select from a drop down one of your favorite curated lists to apply. Maybe you like to use &quot;Mike&#x27;s favorite free stock photo websites&quot; when searching for free photos for your projects. Maybe you like to apply &quot;Jane&#x27;s vegan friendly results&quot; when searching recipes or face creams. Maybe you want to buy local, so you use the &quot;Handmade in X&quot; list when searching for your next belt. Maybe you use a list that only shows results from forums, or another for tracking&#x2F;ad free websites.<p>Keep track of list changes. So, if someone gets paid off to allow certain sites on their popular list, others can easily fork a past version of the list.')
