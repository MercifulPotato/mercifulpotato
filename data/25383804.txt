Not only in linux but also in macOS and Windows. If not with Docker, is the alternative easier to deploy, use and maintain?<p>Red Hat&#x27;s podman and buildah do pop up in the conversation often but they are not widespread and also only cover a small featureset covered by the Docker ecosystem.<p>And the k8 reference is simply absurd. K8 completely abstract away the container runtime, and you don&#x27;t know or either care if you&#x27;re running Docker or black magic. It simply never registers as a concern or useful info. Thus that sort of info never registers as an argument in favour or against Docker.')
