As Arm improved Intel could bring it&#x27;s celeron lines closer to i3, then manufacturers could switch to i3, i5, etc, for premium. A laptop maker that did an Arm was also doing a unique system as a whole instead of modifying the ROM of a windows laptop and they all know that format with Intel very well. Further, things like performance were even more mysterious to consumers when looking at some manufacturer brand and ghz.<p>Really, Arm was more influential in that a second bid is influential, whatever an Arm could do became the floor. I think most vendors who did an Arm model were doing it for experience in working with Arm in a new format and consider if they want to make Android TV, etc, down the road.')
