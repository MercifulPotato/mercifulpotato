I&#x27;m gonna rant a bit now.<p>I used to make consumer facing software for IKEA 10+ years ago and the dynamic back then was that IKEA Communications (the marketing arm) would always have these pretty cool and interesting projects, but they (and we) were constantly running up against the wall that is IKEA Systems.<p>Basically, whatever Systems says is the law, and they had all kinds of... interesting laws.<p>For example, Systems owned all environments (production or otherwise) and had very draconian rules with regards to deployments. Everything had to be documented and packaged in certain ways, certain formats had to be used etc. This wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if you are given clear instructions, but we never were. So we&#x27;d do our best, throw packages over the wall and then eventually get them back with pretty useless commentare like &quot;This is not up to code&quot; but no indication of what&#x27;s missing or otherwise wrong.<p>Oh and you only had four deployment windows a year, once a quarter. It could take days to get a response, and if you missed the deadline you&#x27;d have to wait three months for the next window. Of course, whenever Communications had a project they wanted done it would be stale and out of date if you missed the deployment deadline, so it truly was a deadline as in your project is dead if you miss it. Needless to say, we had to crunch more than a few times.<p>But it was fun working with Communications – they were a very creative and fun bunch. It&#x27;s also really cool to visit IKEA HQ down in Älmhult, where they have the photo studios, loads of furniture and props from pretty much any decade, a <i>very</i> cool 3D graphics department etc. We had a lot of fun there.<p>Anyway, Systems had a way to always make every project so much crappier than it could&#x27;ve been. They were like the lawyers that would come in and tell us that &quot;you can&#x27;t do this, you can&#x27;t do that.&quot; Systems and Communications didn&#x27;t really talk to one another either. It was a bit like being the kid in a family where the parents are always passive agressive against one another, and the kid is just sitting there in the middle having to deal with all the crap. The people were nice enough, but the whole setup was draining and you end up with a lot of compromises.<p>All that said, I had good fun working for IKEA back in the day, and I don&#x27;t have any regrets. I also obviously have no idea what it&#x27;s like to work for them <i>now</i>, so the above may have absolutely nothing to do with the AR app and current states of play etc. Maybe it&#x27;s better now, but my experience having tried to plan both a kitchen and bathroom in the past few months lead me to believe that maybe not that much has changed in the past decade.')
