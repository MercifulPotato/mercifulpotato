Item(by='ksec', descendants=None, kids=[25719262], score=None, time=1610289781, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25709894, text='&gt; I donâ€™t know if iPhones have a dedicated chipset for H264,<p>Yes it does, both H.264 ( AVC )  and H.265 ( HEVC ).<p>But that doesn&#x27;t really matter because your ( initial ) point still stands, real time H.264 encoding isn&#x27;t taxing on an A14 anymore. Remember H.264&#x27;s work started before 2000 and finalised in 2003. That is like playing Doom 3 on your iPhone. No longer technically taxing by any means even if you are playing it at native resolution.<p>However the industry is well aware of the slow down [1] of Moore&#x27;s law. The cost increase as well as TDP headroom. So thinking we could continue to throw hardware at the problem simply doesn&#x27;t work.<p>[1] Moore&#x27;s Law actually includes a time frame within it, so it would not be wrong to say the law is &quot;dead&quot; considering it has slowed down way beyond its time limit within margin of error. But modern day&#x27;s media and computer PR tends to use Moore&#x27;s law as word for transistor improvement.')
