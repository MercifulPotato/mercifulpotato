Item(by='richev', descendants=None, kids=[24986274, 24986361], score=None, time=1604458869, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24978637, text='Totally agree with this post!<p>I fondly remember a summer job in the IT department of a gas exploration company where we were unboxing and setting up a load of SPARCstation 10 machines, each with three(!) monitors. Monitors so huge and splendid that they came with a credit-card sized remote control (which when not in use was stored in a slot in the monitor casing) and a warning not to damage the screen on your belt buckle when lifting it. So cool.<p>We also did a series of RAM upgrades to some long-forgotten Silicon Graphics machines. Whatever they were, the cases were large and purple, everything inside looked like it was designed to survive a nuclear attack. When powered back on the machine played some wonderful indulgent sound deep from inside. So cool.<p>When all that was done it was time to get back to the PC users to complete their upgrades from 4MB to 8MB of RAM. Less cool, but at least the users were happy at the end of it.')
