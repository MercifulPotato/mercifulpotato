But you can&#x27;t really do that with something psycho active, at least not ethically. I can appreciate wanting high standards, but that doesn&#x27;t mean banning everything that doesn&#x27;t fit the neat mold we use in other cases.<p>Also, suicide is the leading cause of death for multiple age&#x2F;sex demographic groups in most of the western world. Literally number 1 killer. Current anti depressants are about the least effective medicines used in the Western world. So there is a good public health arguement to accept that we&#x27;re in an emergency and try things without necessarily having 10 years of statistically significant results and followup and debate.')
