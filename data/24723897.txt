While I doubt that that is Patrick&#x27;s intent, if I were an antitrust attorney, this would convince me that the notion of payment processors as clearinghouses for price-fixing  merits investigation.<p>This is a great example of how one can do something well-meaning at small scale (Advise tiny, tiny businesses that they would be better served having more confidence in their value) that can turn into something illegal at scale (Advise price leaders that they can safely lead by less and so-on).')
