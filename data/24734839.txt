Zoe Hudson, who is TIP’s director, is also a former top figure at OSF, serving assenior policy analyst and liaison between the foundations and the U.S. government for 11 years.<p>&gt; OSF ties to the TIP are a red flag for a number of reasons, namely due to the fact that OSF and other Soros-funded organizations played a critical role in fomenting so-called “color revolutions” to overthrow non-aligned governments, particularly during the Obama administration. Examples of OSF’s ties to these manufactured “revolutions” include Ukraine in 2014 and the “Arab Spring,” which began in 2011 and saw several governments in the Middle East and North Africa that were troublesome to Western interests conveniently removed from power.<p>The Soros stuff is a bit of a red flag.  Also, Ukraine wasn&#x27;t non-aligned, but aligned towards Russia.  Anecdotally, the Ukrainians I know weren&#x27;t fond of Yanukovych and were happy to see him go, both times.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;_whitneywebb&#x2F;status&#x2F;1312730357175902209" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;_whitneywebb&#x2F;status&#x2F;1312730357175902209</a>:<p>&gt; Good ole sheep herder Bernard!<p>Referring to people as &quot;sheep&quot;?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;_whitneywebb&#x2F;status&#x2F;1312430264870674438" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;_whitneywebb&#x2F;status&#x2F;1312430264870674438</a>:<p>&gt; My opinion:<p>&gt; This is about ramping up fear and distracting everyone from the VERY DISTURBING revelations in just the past few days on something the creepiest part of the military you&#x27;ve never heard of is up to.
