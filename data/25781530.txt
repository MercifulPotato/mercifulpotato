To be fair, it&#x27;s pretty hard to actually do worse than SF, but there are still issues to watch out for. The biggest thing is housing. When tons of people suddenly show up who consider a million dollar house affordable, it can really do a number on people who don&#x27;t earn tech salaries. It looks like Austin is still working on getting away from the exclusionary zoning paradigm, I hope they&#x27;re successful.')
