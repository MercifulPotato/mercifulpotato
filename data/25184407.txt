Remember the Wii ran an Opera derivative.  They decided to roll out a Blink-based version (v12-&gt;15 transition) and that shot them in the foot in every possible way:<p>* They no longer had a product they could commercialize for licensing revenue.  Why buy Blink from them instead of doing your own Chromium fork for free?<p>* The Blink version was so feature-poor for years that the power users that loved Opera 12 eventually moved to products like Vivaldi, which felt like it was trying to capture the same spirit.  I suspect many of them abandoned Opera&#x27;s portal services which could have been a revenue stream.<p>Ironically, I suspect the value of a (maintained) Presto engine would only have risen, especially after Chromium!Edge arrived and furthered the fear of a browser monoculture.')
