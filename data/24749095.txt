The copyright industry invests a lot of money into creating hardware that obeys them instead of their actual users. They aren&#x27;t actually that important in the long run. Governments are a far bigger threat to computing freedom.<p>Governments think computers are too powerful and mere citizens should not be allowed to have free and unrestricted computers. Cryptography used to be a military tool but it has been democratized. Everyone has access to high quality, widely available cryptographic software. This means citizens are able to subvert the government by denying it access to information. Governments think they are always justified in everything they do and it&#x27;s an affront to their power when they experience resistance.<p>In order to safeguard our freedom, we need to be able to manufacture hardware just as easily as we can write software. Currently, computer hardware manufacturing costs billions and there are very few companies doing it. They are natural targets for regulation and legislation.<p>We need to be able to make computer hardware at home.')
