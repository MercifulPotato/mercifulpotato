When I was younger my go-to explanation was that any aggression is because of a certain class I was part of  (read: gender, race, nationality, religion, etc.). It took me a while to realize that while people can always <i>use</i> a reason to act the way they do, they don&#x27;t actually <i>need</i> that reason. The advent of the internet just made it easier to see this and to do it.<p>One of my comments on HN was repeatedly downvoted for saying something like &quot;I don&#x27;t use more than a bit of a particular ingredient in food because it gives me a throat burn&quot;.<p>This makes you realize sometimes a downvote is just &quot;because&quot;. In someone&#x27;s mind anything can trigger a &quot;penalize&quot; response towards the comment or the author. But I&#x27;m fairly certain most times guesses for the reason are very likely to be wrong.')
