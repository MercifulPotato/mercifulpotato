I think we need to go back to the idea that software can be like building a building where there are basic building blocks that can be purchased from many vendors and let each vendor decide how to improve the blocks and let the architects and engineers decide what blocks to use. Creating software from lines of code is too slow and ultimately it leads to lock in and inability to upgrade. People think that it will lead to a slow down in technological advancement but at the moment we aren&#x27;t really advancing. We keep on changing programming languages with out much advancement in the ultimate result. It&#x27;s change for the sake of change leading no where.<p>If you look at advancements in society you will see that once defined standards are put in place then technology moves forward.')
