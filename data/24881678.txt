I&#x27;m glad you enjoyed it.<p>In terms of LATAM, I think the party&#x27;s just getting started. Literally earlier _this month_ we saw the formation of the first ever Mexican unicorn as Kavak was valued at over 1$bn. I feel like the potential for both the market and the startups out of LATAM have not been fully appreciated or priced in, so there are many opportunities there. In particular &quot;Series B&quot; &#x2F; growth financing rounds are unnaturally difficult to raise, so the first Sequoia or the like to double down on the space will likely perform very well over a 10 year fund lifetime.<p>Many US funds have Limited Partner Agreements that put restrictions on the amount of capital that can be invested in non-US entities. Some clever firms and companies have gotten around this by having LATAM startups create a parent company that is a Delaware C corporation in which investors invest. That has some nice auxiliary benefits like falling under QSBS. But it would be good to have large VCs have funds set up such that they could invest directly in promising LATAM startups.')
