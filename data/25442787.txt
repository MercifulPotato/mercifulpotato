I can carry my configurations between machines with almost no setup. Every computer I use is the same.<p>I find Windows and macOS painful to use. Constantly hunting around for applications I have open, that requires me to remove my fingers from my keyboard and play around with my mouse. I barely bother to use tabs for anything (terminal or browser), just switch to another workspace and pop up another instance of FireFox or a terminal.<p>TWM do ruin you though. Once you&#x27;re comfortable in them, you&#x27;ll never want to go back and so using somebody else&#x27;s computer just feels alien.')
