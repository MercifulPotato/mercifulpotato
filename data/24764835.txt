Maybe some of the more egregious footgun stuff and the more petty sanctions and goading that are mainly for show, but the fact is there have been brewing disputes with China for a long time and Trump has brought them to a head.<p>However beating down on China over their behaviour only achieves anything if it changes that behaviour, otherwise what the heck are we doing? I don&#x27;t think Trump has it in him to actually solve those problems. I&#x27;m not entirely sure Biden does either, but even if he doesn&#x27;t at least there&#x27;s a chance he might listen to people who do.')
