I am in a different field (astrophysics) and I have recently moved from the professor job in the US to UK. And one thing I particularly feel is a burn-out. After going through undergrad + PhD + getting tenure which all involved pretty much round-the-clock work, I just can&#x27;t work 60 hours a week anymore. And somehow in academia, it often is required. Basically you have so much stuff that you must do that takes a large fraction of your 40h&#x2F;week (telecons, students, lectures, seminars, refereeing, etc), so anything interesting -- actual science that you do yourself has to be done in the extra-time (i.e. weekends&#x2F;evenings). \nI am currently hoping that in the UK I&#x27;ll be at least a bit better placed than in the US, as the pressure to get grants is lower, and people are more mindful of the working hours, but I am still not 100% sure that I&#x27;ll stay.\n(throwaway account)')
