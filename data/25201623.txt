Article is from 2012, so I&#x27;ll give the benefit of the doubt that this same experiment hadn&#x27;t yet been repeated over and over with slight variations to the same result when it was written. It is at this point common knowledge that online dating as it exists today is horrible. My personal take on that is it is because dating itself is horrible and there are some things you just can&#x27;t fix with a website, but if we&#x27;re going to have a discussion around online dating are there at least any studies out there that <i>might</i> inform a better way to do things?')
