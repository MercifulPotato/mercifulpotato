How would that POSSIBLY work?<p>The novelty of this particular coronavirus is sort of the problem here, since people don&#x27;t already have immunity, so your &quot;millions of years&quot; thing is completely off base.<p>You seem to be arguing against the possibility of a &quot;universal vaccine&quot; for all viruses but that&#x27;s entirely not what this is. It&#x27;s very specifically targeted and the idea that we&#x27;d evolve the ability to target things specifically <i>without actually being exposed to them</i> in the same way is plainly nonsense.')
