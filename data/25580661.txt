Any medicine that is not over the counter needs to be explicitly prescribed before it can be dispensed. (this is what my doctor friends tell me anyway)<p>&gt; Normal vaccinations you just go through some questions on risk factors before the nurse gives you the shot<p>there are nurse prescribers, that have the power to prescribe a limited number of things. That aside, the prescription doesn&#x27;t need to be done with the patient present. it can be pre-filled with the nurse&#x2F;other arranging the dispensing.<p>this doesn&#x27;t mean that the rules can&#x27;t be changed. I suspect that in time there will be special dispensation given to allow non medical staff to prescribe, dispense and administer jabs. However until the first million or so have been done, they&#x27;ll want to keep an eye on things and monitor the number of &quot;yellow card&quot; incidents that occur.')
