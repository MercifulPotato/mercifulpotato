As far as I remember, there is quite a lot of EU laws which did become UK laws. Aparts from the question of the benefits to do so, it would take many many years to disentangle that.<p>So, the UK governments solution is that all these laws will be re-written by the government in one big package and the UK parliament gives more or less an advance approval to that. I am probably not the only one who sees this as a significant weakening of parliamentary democracy in the UK.')
