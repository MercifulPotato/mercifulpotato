Newsflash- they don&#x27;t give a shit.<p>Eng manager turned product manager here.<p>It&#x27;s not that we don&#x27;t give a shit - but paying down the debt isn&#x27;t always worth it. For example in this case, if they always knew they were going to wind down Periscope (or at least that it wasn&#x27;t strategic compared to what they were doing with Twitter) then investing deeply into it would have just been a waste.<p>Here&#x27;s an example.<p>You buy a house in the spring. You know the heating system is very old and will likely fail soon (technical debt.) Should you invest in it?<p>The answer is &quot;it depends.&quot; If you plan to live in this house for a long time, then yes because the last thing you want is for heat to fail in the middle of next winter.<p>However, what if this is just your summer residence? Suddenly fixing the heat is much less urgent (you still have the debt but the risk of it coming due in a very bad way is much less.)<p>Or, you bought the house for the land and plan to tear it down. You would be stupid to fix the heat.<p>I think the Periscope situation is much closer to that last thing. They bought it for something other than the stand-alone Periscope product so throwing a bunch of resources at it didn&#x27;t make sense. Which isn&#x27;t the same as not giving a shit.')
