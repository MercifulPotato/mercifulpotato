There were a few times where my family butted heads with the HOA (replacing fences with a non-standard style, a play swing&#x2F;slide thing being a bit tall) but for the most part the HOA was nice. They managed a park and pool for the neighborhood&#x27;s exclusive use. They decorated the entrance signs to the neighborhood for the holidays. They put on some holiday events like an easter egg hunt&#x2F;picnic, a fourth of july bike parade, Christmas light judging&#x2F;awards. People didn&#x27;t have tons of clutter in their front yards, the streets weren&#x27;t super crowded with cars.')
