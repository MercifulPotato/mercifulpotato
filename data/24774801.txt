And that&#x27;s ignoring Stadia&#x27;s free subscription tier as well as cheaper hardware options.<p>But Stadia&#x27;s game library is small, and needless to say it doesn&#x27;t have Mario Kart, Animal Crossing, or Ring Fit Adventure... ;-)<p>So for the 6-to-106 set, I think the Switch wins, but Stadia is still pretty interesting...')
