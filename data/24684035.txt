It&#x27;s rarely getting an algorithmic speedup. It&#x27;s far more often stepping back and solving a simplified or reformulated problem.<p>It&#x27;s often more complex in practice, but still, it&#x27;s easy to focus too much on solving the given problem efficiently efficiently, rather than finding a simpler solution to the underlying mathematics.')
