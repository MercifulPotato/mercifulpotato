Now of course BRCA mutation testing is much more known and available, but this was 10 years ago.<p>The reason why I&#x27;m more hopeful about liquid biopsies than greatly improved cures at this point is because it depends on an informational technology that is relatively predictable, and has a high chance of success for many types of cancer at the same time. Testing has 0 side effects, and can be done for $2000&#x2F;year in a few years, as the providers are not planning to go through insurance companies first. Also it can be launched globally as long as the blood withdraval can be taken care of.<p>Shasqi&#x27;s goal sounds amazing, but it needs to go through all the clinical trials, it has to be covered by health insurance, which takes much more administration work, it has a 10% chance of success for the first time (as it&#x27;s in stage 1 trial right now), and will take at least about 5-10 years to succeed for just 1 type of cancer, even if it&#x27;s an extremely important type.')
