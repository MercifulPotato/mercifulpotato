I find his transformation from one of the disliked CEOs of most despised companies into some sort of high tech messiah hard to believe. The phrase &quot;Embrace, Extend, Extinguish&quot; was coined in Microsoft when he was the CEO. Google bombing was invented to redirect to Microsoft homepage when searching &quot;more evil than satan himself&quot;. Those are facts that confirm the sentiment I remember.<p>In my opinion, his philanthropy work is just another playground. Power is addictive and now he has way to exercise power over world outside the tech industry. Quick Google search shows he spent 45B$ on his foundation... and another search shows his net worth is still 119B$. This is still more money that I can imagine, even if he spent 99.9% of it he would still be richer than I can ever hope for. And honestly, his personal brand is so strong that even after zeroing on his account balance he could become multimillionaire in no time.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m overly cynical. Maybe my memory fails me and I&#x27;m mistaken about how bad reputation he and his company had back in the day. But it&#x27;s hard for me to buy this 180 degree turn from ruthless CEO into great philanthropist. Now, I&#x27;m not saying his antichrist and he planned the pandemic 20 years ahead; I just would appreciate some healthy skepticism.')
