Item(by='dragontamer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604705429, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25011947, text='&gt; Did Apple actually buy a significant stake in TSMC or are you just referring to the fact that Apple is one of their large customers along with Qualcomm, Nvidia, Huawei (until recently) etc.?<p>I&#x27;m talking more like the later: all of these companies (Apple, Qualcomm, NVidia, etc. etc. and of course, AMD) are effectively pooling their money together to fund TSMC.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to single Apple out as if they&#x27;re the &quot;only&quot; ones funding TSMC&#x27;s research. (And I can see how my wording earlier mistakenly can be interpreted in that manner. I was careless with my wording). Its more of a team effort (although Apple does seem to spend significant amounts of money trying to get first-dibs on the process).')
