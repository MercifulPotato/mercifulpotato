Pretty much any major computing giant you think of gets their stuff made by Foxconn.<p>I&#x27;d argue that a _real_ trade-war didn&#x27;t happen. If it did, color me underwhelmed[1]. We got some tariffs put on Chinese goods, China started buying Brazilian soybean instead of American. To put an end to this, a deal was struck were China buys much more agricultural products, which has been going poorly[2]. Sure, there was some economic damage, but I don&#x27;t think this can be classified as a &#x27;trade war&#x27;. Unfortunately (or fortunately), a proper definition doesn&#x27;t exist in terms of a financial impact threshold.<p>One angle that I don&#x27;t think anyone has discussed. Terry Gou is running for Presidency in Taiwan, and this could be a way to show him rubbing shoulders with international leaders. The US is big ally to Taiwan, and who better to be in the good graces of than the President of the US?<p>Apart from the above discussed angle, I think my comment from Jan 2019 is still relevant[3]<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;China%E2%80%93United_States_trade_war#Overall_effects_on_U.S._economy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;China%E2%80%93United_States_tr...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.piie.com&#x2F;research&#x2F;piie-charts&#x2F;us-china-phase-one-tracker-chinas-purchases-us-goods" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.piie.com&#x2F;research&#x2F;piie-charts&#x2F;us-china-phase-one...</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19018486" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19018486</a>')
