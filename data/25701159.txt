There&#x27;s a huge space of tricks around regularization, randomization, tree structure, etc., that few people are exploring because neural nets are exploding.<p>So far I&#x27;ve roughly caught up in speed and accuracy with a few original tricks (and 1&#x2F;20 of the features), but no real breakthroughs.')
