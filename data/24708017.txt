It&#x27;s not my favorite IDE, it&#x27;s a bit slow too but it&#x27;s the best I could find for what I do. Also I haven&#x27;t found any good native IDE that can handle Python, Django, HTML, CSS and JS as well as VSCode. There are IDEs that can do Python (and Django) and others for HTML, CSS and JS but I don&#x27;t want to be constantly switching between the two. If you know a good IDE that can replace VSCode for my use case please let me know.')
