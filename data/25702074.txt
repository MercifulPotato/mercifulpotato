The idea is to have prebuilt models for tools like GitHub and Jenkins, as well as models for human processes like approvals.  The user can then easily build no-code simulations of end-to-end software release processes, and get quantitative insights from running those simulations.  The app will eventually use discrete event simulation and advanced analysis (graphical), but currently its just some basic placeholder &quot;function modeling&quot;.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;softwaredeliverysimulator.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;softwaredeliverysimulator.com&#x2F;</a>')
