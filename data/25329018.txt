Not one byte.<p>&gt;[...]<p>&gt;But there is no change to the actual end subscriber &quot;leaf&quot; certificate and that&#x27;s a mistake in the linked article.<p>It&#x27;s not really a mistake. You&#x27;re correct in the sense that no change in <i>behavior</i> is required from the ACME protocol client, but the cert PEM it downloads at the end <i>is</i> different. The PEM contains the whole chain, and depending on which link the client downloads (the usual one or the alternate one in the link header) it&#x27;ll get one chain or the other.')
