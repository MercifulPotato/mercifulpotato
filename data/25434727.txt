Small business tends conservative because regulation disproportionately impacts them (eg. regulatory capture).  It would certainly be nicer if more regulation created a level playing field and actually prevented anti-competitive practices.<p>To counter balance the above blatant and unfair stereotyping above, I&#x27;ll add some devil&#x27;s advocate too: &quot;change the world&quot; type leaders might also be more idealistic and would vote progressive anyway, even if it&#x27;s not good business sense.')
