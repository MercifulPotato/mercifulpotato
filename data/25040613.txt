But in the end the result is the same, we&#x27;ll probably need to be re-vaccinated against covid over time.<p>Covid isn&#x27;t going away because it has a non-human animal reservoir, so it&#x27;s all about a strategy to prevent it&#x27;s re-emergence into the sapiens reservoir. It&#x27;s possible that periodic vaccinations of the population as a whole would be overkill and we could reactively immunize smaller populations as re-infection occurs.')
