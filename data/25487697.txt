Hurting someone in retaliation for doing something should never be seen as a viable treatment option; that&#x27;s just punishment for the sake of punishment.<p>I wish that Americans didn&#x27;t enjoy hurting other people so much. It makes it hard and even a little bit traumatizing to live here on a day-to-day and year-to-year basis.')
