Removing practically all barriers, especially to the hardest, most dangerous drugs, is a bad path for Oregon to have opened up.<p>And I fear that it also opens the doors to other countries &#x2F; bad actors seeing that they have a new market to manufacture and sell drugs to (fentanyl, heroin, meth) without penalty.<p>I think there are major unintended consequences here that will materialize in years to come, and it could be possible that this hurts the people it claims to help (and more in fact).  Those who voted for the symbol of decriminalizing the &quot;harmless&quot; drugs may get much more than they expected.')
