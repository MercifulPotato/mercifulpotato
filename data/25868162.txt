Compare the odds of a downed pilot avoiding capture in a WWII bombing mission over Germany with the majority of missions over Afghanistan and it’s clear they where contested territory.  Still high risk, but also a very different situation.<p>Close Air Support is definitely a major role for the F-35, but you have troupes there so it’s contested territory.  Patrolling no fly zones is currently much better suited for drone aircraft, but might become important again.<p>So yes exceptions exist, but you really don’t want to run air to air combat missions out of air force bases anywhere near contested airspace.  The risk vs rewards very much favor longer flights with mid air refueling.')
