Specifically:<p>1. A single consumer has the attention span to follow&#x2F;support only a handful of performers.<p>2. Performers with higher number of followers are more likely to get recommended, hence get new followers.<p>3. Having 100 vs. 100000 followers doesn&#x27;t change the performer&#x27;s costs. Hence, once a few superstars are established in a niche, you have very low chances of outcompeting them.<p>If you want to realistically make a decent amount of money, you need to either look at the markets where your costs scale up with the number of clients (e.g. doctors, lawyers, consultants), or at emerging&#x2F;rapidly moving niches where the dominance has not been established yet.<p>Of course, the human brain is bad at natively feeling linearity at large scales [0], so a tiny chance of a huge payoff will always <i>feel</i> lucrative, even if the actual chances are against you. There are whole industries relying on people <i>NOT</i> calculating the chances [1] and the whole &quot;become a streaming superstar&quot; thing appears to be one of them.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Weber%E2%80%93Fechner_law" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Weber%E2%80%93Fechner_law</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theconversation.com&#x2F;designed-to-deceive-how-gambling-distorts-reality-and-hooks-your-brain-91052" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theconversation.com&#x2F;designed-to-deceive-how-gambling...</a>')
