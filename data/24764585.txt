For example Some researcher would have a grant for developing an optical inspection of a circuit board using a camera moving on the 2d euclidean space efficiently is a TSP. You can develop a Polynomial Time approximation scehne(PTAS) to solve it.<p>At first it&#x27;s novel then st some point it appears in a book specific to polynomial time approximation schems in books dedicated to the cause. Look at the references in wikipedia. They often point to a larger body of work than what the wiki can possibly hope to cover.')
