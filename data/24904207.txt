Then I hit this:<p>&gt; The video memory is SRAM, not RAM.  The SRAM on the MDA card can be used by MIOS as general-purpose memory for creating a Stack Segment (SS) and Extra Segment (ES). Using SRAM avoids the complexity and resource requirements of servicing an interrupt for memory refresh.<p>That&#x27;s not just original its wonderfully nuts.<p>Reminds me of   a trick in use around that time, the CGA (and EGA) adapters and the Mono&#x2F;text adapters used different resource regions and you could have one of each in a system. Then the RAM on one or the other could be used by software, with possibly useful diagnostic display side effects; while the other display was used for the normal display purposes.<p>That was not a <i>common</i> trick, that guy was also soldering together 1MB RAM pack for Commodore 64&#x27;s in that time frame too.')
