She seemed able to avoid the shadier parts and, as a parent, you trust the child-friendly features.<p>However, controls are subverted (for example, by using special characters to get through language filters), and my daughter fell victim to exploitation that moved from Roblox innocence, to instagram, porn, and one-on-one calls. Fortunately we caught it (in time?). Police traced it back to international gangs that prey on the innocent. The trail, at least for us, went cold as there is a request to police in a country (we were not told which) by ours (UK), that is unlikely to be followed up.<p>Roblox was a big thing for her, and the events that started there were traumatic for the whole family.<p>Roblox is extremely popular and a really good platform. I&#x27;m not going to go on a crusade to try and chance peoples&#x27; minds, but Roblox is not as kid-friendly as one would think. It suffers, as all digital social platforms do, with uncontrollable, mis-understood, and untraceable actions by bad actors, that are used for nefarious purposes.')
