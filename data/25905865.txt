The virus doesn&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re bored of the disease and &quot;won&#x27;t tolerate&quot; staying home from more football games. It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s just going to go away because we&#x27;re tired of it! I sincerely hope governments aren&#x27;t going to just open things up because 2021 is a different year and everyone&#x27;s just really bummed of it all. Surely we have better sense than that.')
