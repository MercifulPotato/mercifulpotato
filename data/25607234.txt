But I see your point and your totally right that one sounds less bad to me. I&#x27;m only stating that as a matter of taste I do not like this particular apps name.<p>And since it&#x27;s apple&#x27;s store they have the right to not like it either. I just don&#x27;t think this is a profound &quot;free speech argument&quot; like some do in these comments.<p>Personally I think it&#x27;s really odd that someone would need an app to keep their computer from sleeping. This says far more about macs than the arbitrary naming policy.')
