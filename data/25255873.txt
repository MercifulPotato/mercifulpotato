The technology itself is cheap, fabricating a bunch of de novo mRNA is only a few hundred dollars these days. I’m not sure how much volume is needed for treatment, and there’s obviously much stricter QA&#x2F;QC that must happen for human use, but still the actual manufacturing part is likely no more than single digit thousands per dose. At scale, per your semiconductor analogy, could likely be brought down to single-digit dollars with time.')
