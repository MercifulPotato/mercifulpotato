I am not aware of anyone (okay, maybe outside an insane fringe) who, in any meaningful way, is seeking to &quot;forbid trans people to exist&quot; - how do you not allow someone to exist, except by, you know, stopping them from existing, i.e. killing them? Instead, the fights, and cancellations of those deviating from the approved positions, tend to focus on issues such as whether people should be compelled to refer to trans people by their preferred pronouns, or whether trans people should be allowed access to their preferred gendered facilities (be it bathrooms or battered-women shelters). Do trans people die or pop out of existence when you refer to them by the wrong pronoun? If so, that would be a whole new level of fragility (a word I gather social justice advocates really like to bandy around in situations where it is far less appropriate than here), and it seems like a more appropriate response to someone whose existence is so precarious would be more akin to how we sustain those who are born without an adaptive immune system (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rarediseasereview.org&#x2F;publications&#x2F;2017&#x2F;8&#x2F;7&#x2F;living-without-an-immune-system" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rarediseasereview.org&#x2F;publications&#x2F;2017&#x2F;8&#x2F;7&#x2F;livi...</a>).<p>(Gay marriage, on the other hand, has been (rightly) legalised and enjoys majority support, but even there I think that the problem was that the state presumed to have a say in the definition of marriage to begin with. If any reference to marriage were struck from the books - perhaps by making a neutral construct of civil partnership or something else that can inherit its functions for property-sharing and mutual spokesmanship take it place - then the claim to marriage as a negative right that Scruton would have no cause to interfere with would become apparent.)')
