She got a huge boost in visibility from the Joe Rogan interview which is hosted on YouTube and Spotify, neither of which removed the episode.<p>She may have received a lot of criticism on Twitter and Reddit, but it was far from one-sided. If you read the threads on &#x2F;r&#x2F;joerogan, they&#x27;re mostly positive and I have no doubt a lot of Redditers bought her book after seeing it there. She has 42k followers on twitter, has a pinned Tweet that links to her book, and I don&#x27;t see any evidence that Twitter is stopping her from posting.<p>It actually seems like a great example of tech allowing a creator to reach audience even if they&#x27;re shunned by main stream media and retailers.')
