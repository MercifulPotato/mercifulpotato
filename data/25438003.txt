(Families with a lot of kids need something like a minivan, some people need a truck with huge towing capacity, some people want good gas mileage, etc.)<p>My personal opinions:<p>* Ubuntu - when you want something well-supported and everything usually just works out of the box<p>* Pop!_OS - same as above but gaming is more important to you<p>* Debian - when you want stability rather than the latest features<p>* Arch - when you want control over every aspect of your system<p>* CentOS - when you want a rock-solid server platform (though this has changed very recently)<p>And there are dozens of other flavors of Linux with different strengths and weaknesses and different levels of support.<p>So it depends on your goals!')
