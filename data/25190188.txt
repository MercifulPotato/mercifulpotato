Rather, there&#x27;s a philosophical difference between two parts of the community.  Many people don&#x27;t want to do work for large companies for free, and dislike their work being used without compensation.  So, they license it under copyleft licenses.  Others (like me) don&#x27;t really care and mostly write stuff because it&#x27;s fun and interesting.  We publish things under permissive licenses.  Even were GPL the standard, I&#x27;d probably still use permissive licenses because I don&#x27;t care where the code is used.')
