Namely, hydrogen will be used primarily for non-electrical industrial purposes, and perhaps for seasonal storage of excess electricity that wouldn&#x27;t have been used anyway.<p>I don&#x27;t see much use for shipping hydrogen around, unless it&#x27;s as a minor component of a synthetic mixture that replaces natural gas, but that&#x27;s super speculative.<p>However for ammonia (fertilizer), steel, maybe shipping, there&#x27;s few other options.<p>(And I&#x27;m super hopeful that we figure out how to build more wires in the US, probably by repurposing existing right of way. But I&#x27;m also skeptical that we will be able to fight NIMBYs for that...)')
