It&#x27;s been consistently an afterthought in various releases of VS, initial .NET Core support, etc. As a C#&#x2F;.NET Dev for 20 years, I&#x27;ve tried several a few times to use F# only to find broken tooling, lousy IDE support in VS (compared to C#, etc.)  Jetbrains Rider supposedly has better F# support, but given Microsoft&#x27;s lack of interest and a tiny community, I still can&#x27;t be bothered to pick it up.  I&#x27;m more likely to learn&#x2F;use Elixir than F# at this point.')
