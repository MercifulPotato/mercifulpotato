(If you&#x27;re an application developer, you should audit your code now.)<p>The thing is, you&#x27;ll noisily lose your data, which is far more likely to be caught and corrected. Even the most roughly put together web app is probably going to have some mechanism to alert about server-side production errors.<p>&gt; A well-written application using Postgres would have to truncate the data before insert, achieving the same result as having MySQL auto-truncation, but with more initial and on-going maintenance effort in the case of Postgres.<p>Not necessarily - you could alert the user that they need to provide less data, or mitigate it in some other way (maybe storing a summary and the full version in a blob somewhere).')
