Is &quot;pulse shaping&quot; another way of saying &quot;controlling the wavefront&quot;?  In that case is the maths similar to that used in massive MIMO in communications systems (which in turn is connected to holography)?  If so, controlling an electron cloud is effectively massive MIMO in the optical domain.<p>A further way of looking at it would be as &quot;4 dimensional holography&quot;.  A regular 3D hologram is static in time, but these ones are effectively &quot;holographic movies&quot;, with atomic scale time resolution?')
