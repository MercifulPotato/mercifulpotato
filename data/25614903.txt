It was basically a France-Germany bipartite cooperation, with tiny bits of Spain and Netherlands, and UK being in&#x2F;out. UK didn&#x27;t belong to EEC when they were supposed to take part in the beginning of the project. Spain didn&#x27;t join EEC until 20 years later. Netherlands were in by accident, in a way.')
