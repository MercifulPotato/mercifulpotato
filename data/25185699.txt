In fact it used to be quite the Mom&amp;Pop Shop makin sales in the founder&#x27;s living room that doubled as a show floor.<p>They however were excellent at expanding into online sales (in roughly the same timeline as Amazon) and became Europe&#x27;s largest online retailer. So one could argue that Guitar Center not improving their online offerings and maybe cutting back on physical locations had also something to do with it.')
