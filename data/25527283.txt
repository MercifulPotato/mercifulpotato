If I look at literature of LMS receptor spectra, it makes me wonder why there is so much green in Oklab. When I optimized similar for XYB, the optimization would favor adding slightly more red for the S than green.<p>S component in JPEG XL XYB before non-linearity:<p>0.24 * R + 0.20 * G + 0.56 * B<p>S component in Oklab before non-linearity:<p>0.05 * R + 0.26 * G + 0.63 * B<p>Given the similarity of Oklab and XYB I suspect (but i&#x27;m not completely sure) that JPEG XL&#x27;s format is powerful enough to model Oklab, too. Very very likely it can perfectly model the M1 matrix and the cubic root. I believe for M2 there may be some need for approximations. There JPEG XL can have local variations for M2 from chroma-from-luma fields, but likely luma needs to be slightly different from Oklab.')
