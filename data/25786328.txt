So you get around 10 somewhat related results and then they just instantly stop and you get some &quot;you might like these videos as well&quot; results. Frustrates me to no end and I think there could be a great opportunity in somehow indexing videos properly and creating a search engine around it. Then again you&#x27;d think Google would&#x27;ve done this but maybe they aren&#x27;t able to. But in any case I&#x27;d prefer an endless stream of semi-related videos compared to their 10 results.')
