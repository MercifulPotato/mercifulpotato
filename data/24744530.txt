I tried to look, but a couple cursory searches yielded little in the way of attempts to quantify the amount of “opportunistic crime” versus premeditated. And frankly, going by raw quantity might not be good enough. How much damage are they doing relative to premeditated crime? Shoplifting a candy bar versus a murder, you know.<p>I also wonder if this has much to do with this article. If you are conversing about future criminal activity on Facebook or SMS, can you argue it was not premeditated in some fashion?<p>And even if this makes sense... how much loss of our personal freedoms is it worth to eliminate xx% of crime? (And, is it possible that there are better ways, like perhaps looking at the causes rather than trying to curb the effects...)')
