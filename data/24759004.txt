We had some <i>very</i> nasty snakes, thereabout, half the bugs could give you bites that would take a month to heal, and violent crime was quite prevalent. I learned to be quite careful.<p>I survived. Not sure I&#x27;d want to put my kids through the same risks, but my parents didn&#x27;t seem to have a problem with it (good or bad? I dunno.
