A very long time ago I worked at a high-end men&#x27;s clothing store and I have a sweater that I paid about $75 for. It retailed for $200. An inflation calculator says that $200 is now worth over $400.<p>I wonder what an equivalent sweater would cost today. The brand has since gone mainstream, so I can&#x27;t use them as a point of reference.')
