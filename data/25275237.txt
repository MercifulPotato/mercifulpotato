Already there is talk of compulsory vaccination or &quot;vaccine passports&quot;. Labour (the UK opposition party) were even calling for spreading &quot;misinformation&quot; online to be illegal.<p>I find this ridiculous considering the massive challenge we have ahead of us just to get the vaccine to the millions of people who desperately want it.<p>Sure, if we get to the point where everyone who wants the vaccine has had it, and there are still people dying from COVID, then we can discuss illiberal measures to increase vaccine take-up. (I&#x27;d still be opposed to them).<p>Getting worked up about this stuff when not a single person (outside of the trial groups) has been vaccinated yet just demonstrates our politicians&#x27; (on all sides) tendency towards authoritarianism.')
