Item(by='RandomNick', descendants=None, kids=[25190226], score=None, time=1606148132, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25187948, text='That previous section doesn&#x27;t alter the context and doesn&#x27;t change the fact that nothing I or the author or any other player does in a game like this leads to a single death, let alone millions.<p>If the author is uncomfortable taking on the role of a &quot;German general goose-stepping and kowtowing to his FÃ¼hrer&quot; then he should feel equally uncomfortable acting as a Soviet general goose-stepping for a dictator who imprisoned, tortured and starved millions of his own citizens. Or for that matter the U.S. or Britain. Forget anything based on ancient Greece or Rome as well. Might as well stick to Farmville or Mario Kart if you&#x27;re going to continue down that road.<p>&quot;Further, I think it is unwise to brush aside any argument that the nature of the media we consume does not affect how we interact with the real world without consideration. Just because it turns out that old 90s arguments about DOOM turning us all into violent murderers was wrong doesn&#x27;t mean that there aren&#x27;t effects that might be harmful.&quot;<p>I did not brush it aside, I read the entire rambling article, most of which had very little to do with any potential harmful effects and gave it a lot more consideration than it truly deserved. It was in no way compelling, nor did it contain any real insights. I stand by my earlier statement, he is really overthinking this.')
