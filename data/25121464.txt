Although it takes some effort to find the right difficulty problems (tip: the right difficulty is pretty low) so you don&#x27;t end up wasting time on stuff nobody can solve or stuff everyone easily solves. You can ask people you know to take a stab at a problem to gauge its difficulty. Or you may even be able to eyeball it.')
