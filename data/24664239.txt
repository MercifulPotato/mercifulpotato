The price of the Model T, Ford&#x27;s mainstay product, had been successively cut over the years while the wages of the workers had dramatically, and quite publicly, increased.<p>- The company&#x27;s president and majority stockholder, Henry Ford, sought to end special dividends for shareholders in favor of massive investments in new plants that would enable Ford to dramatically increase production, and the number of people employed at his plants, while continuing to cut the costs and prices of his cars.<p>- The minority shareholders objected to this strategy, demanding that Ford stop reducing his prices when they could barely fill orders for cars and to continue to pay out special dividends from the capital surplus in lieu of his proposed plant investments.<p>- The Court was called upon to decide whether the minority shareholders could prevent Ford from operating the company for the charitable ends that he had declared.<p>The court ruled in favor of the minority share holders.')
