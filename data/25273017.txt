But it takes up a bit more space than I want when trying to build small Debian systems. And it feels like a weird piece of critical infrastructure to have, that prevents Debian from developing new &amp; better selves. One must dabble in antiquity to work with core Debian systems. It seems that may never die. And Perl, with it, may itself never die, never be free to move on, to it&#x27;s next steps.')
