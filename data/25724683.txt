Is this a recent change where development was transitioned from IT to product during a recent transformation?<p>Not directed at you, just some general comments.<p>As someone hinted at in another comment, it seems a better (less dichotomous) framing is:<p>- tech first (developer lead, selling software or hardware),<p>- tech enabled (developers are a key collaborator with the business, e.g., logistics, manufacturing, ecomm, marketing, really every company should be), or<p>- tech as a cost center (the “traditional” company in the article).<p>What about the trifecta of product, engineering, and design advocated for by Marty Cagan?<p>I think the same argument that’s being made for giving developers more weight in the development process could be argued equally as well from the side of design.<p>Edit for formatting.')
