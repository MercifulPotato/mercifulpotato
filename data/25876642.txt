Since they utilize an internal combustion engine, they suffer from the same power band issues that purely ICE cars have. This means that a hybrid does have a normal gearbox.<p>I&#x27;m no expert on Priuses but my quick Google showed that Prius has the electric motors &quot;after&quot; the gearbox. This means that electric motor can assist turning of the wheel and that it can regenerate energy but it is not using the gearbox.<p>One solution to this would be how diesel electric locomotives work. Internal combustion engine generates electricity that is then stored in the batteries and used to power the vehicle. These type of &quot;hybrids&quot; are not popular although I believe there is at least one available where it is used as a range extender.')
