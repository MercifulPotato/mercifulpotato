Since deregulation, much of the new money has gone to buying stocks. Not exactly helping the economy. As long as the stock market appreciates faster than the prime rate, it  makes sense to borrow money from the fed to buy stocks. Especially if the fed is buying stocks too, keeping the market in perpetual inflation driven growth.')
