What they want is to know what you&#x27;re asking for, what you offer in return and then (briefly) how one leads to the other. Thus:<p><i>We make Pypy, which does X and is used by Y people, including projects such as Z, z, and z&#x27;. We&#x27;d love to bring Pypy to Apple&#x27;s exciting new M1 hardware, but that needs resources.<p>We&#x27;re looking for $CASH_MONEY to buy some M1 hardware that we can develop, test against, and eventually run the repository on. With #NUM_MACHINES available, we believe was can have PyPy available to all M1 developers by %CALENDAR_MONTH. We also like eating and drinking and if you send us more money we will spend some of it on !GOOD_TIME(HAVING).</i><p>The whole approach of &#x27;we&#x27;re not asking for much, just x would help&#x27; is how volunteers talk to each other, minimizing their ask so that reorienting effort is not too burdensome for anyone. But how you talk to each other is not a good way to talk to external readers, because it requires effort to parse what you are getting at and then further effort to negotiate and arrange everything which is a distraction from their own concerns. <i>Many people</i> would rather just give you some cash and sign up for a monthly progress update.<p>There&#x27;s a reason services Kickstarter etc. work so well: they save the donors time and entanglement. Just set up : PyPy on Mac M1 for $5000?&#x27; or similar and make it <i>easy</i> for people to throw money at you.')
