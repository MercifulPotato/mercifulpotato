The NWS does not post only global mean average temperatures<p>2. My comment specifically said it would be apolitical for a weather service to report this<p>3. If the New York times were to have an entire issue with just the global mean temperatures over time, that would clearly be both politically motivated and non-neutral.<p>There are 3 things that you seem to be confounding: apolitical, politically neutral, and factual.  One can select which facts to report with the intention of motivating specific policies.  That is neither apolitical nor politically neutral, but is factual.<p>The NWS was commissioned to observe the weather long before climate change was on anybody&#x27;s radar, so it&#x27;s clearly apolitical that it does so.  The fact that some significant fraction of one of the two major political parties in the US wishes it to <i>stop</i> should be clear evidence that it is not politically neutral.  That&#x27;s fine!  There is no demand in TFA, or any of my comments that any or all government agencies need be politically neutral.')
