Item(by='roenxi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602152528, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24715145, text='&gt; So straight up, do you believe that the government is infringing on people&#x27;s rights by banning child porn, yes or no?<p>As I recall it, people can and have been prosecuted for drawing and owning cartoons of child porn. That is a victimless crime - so yes it probably has gotten to the point where the government is infringing rights unreasonably. The government can walk in and created a loser in a situation where nobody was unhappy. It is the production of the porn that worries me rather than the possession. I&#x27;d be ok with the whole situation if everyone was sticking to one cache of obscene material produced 50 years ago and nobody new was being harmed.<p>But more to the topic at hand, CP isn&#x27;t a free speech issue. The crime is, by and large, <i>possession</i> of child porn and so the issue is one of privacy rather than speech. They may as well legalise distribution, if anyone were stupid enough to do it publicly it would make it easy for the police to find everyone involved and prosecute them.')
