Item(by='octoberfranklin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607847704, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25404069, text='&gt; we prove time and again we can&#x27;t fix this &quot;feature&quot;<p>I crave a system where upvotes are stored in a decentralized graph, like the PGP Web of Trust.  No reason to even bother counting upvotes, because Sybil.<p>This is not a website, service, or company; it&#x27;s just a protocol like NNTP was.  My client would crawl the graph, showing me identities with interests similar to mine and the content they like, plus a sprinkling of random stuff.  I would read that random stuff for the same reason we occasionally do janitorial duty in the the &quot;new links&quot; section on HN.  I have ideas on how to tune my own client&#x27;s definition of &quot;random&quot; towards &quot;eclectic&quot;.<p>Nobody knows I upvoted them, or even how many upvotes they got (because Sybil, again).  Nobody cares.  It&#x27;s not about upvote count, it&#x27;s about flow.<p>I&#x27;ve wanted this for a long time, and like most people on HN could easily build it, but fear I&#x27;d wind up alone there.  Also, I loathe promoting things.<p>Surely I can&#x27;t be the first to think of this.')
