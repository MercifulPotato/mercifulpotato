Take it out, and you&#x27;ve lost the primary reason you smoke: the true sweetness of all cigarettes is due to one flavor, just like the true sweetness of all wine is due to one flavor.<p>If you eliminate nicotine from legal cigarettes, the vast majority of smokers will stop smoking. Sure, maybe after a few binge sessions where they desperately and fruitlessly seek that hit.<p>I think the fraction of smokers who will sustain a smoking addiction via black market cigarettes is less than 10%. To maintain a smoking addiction, you need to buy a <i>lot</i> of cigarettes. Few have sufficiently frequent access to black markets to sustain it.<p>And yes, I&#x27;m chewing that damn gum as I write this;)<p>To clarify, I don&#x27;t advocate banning nicotine. I advocate banning nicotine delivered via toxic trash-heap. The same way I&#x27;d advocate banning alcohol mixed with methanol, if that was a super popular drink.')
