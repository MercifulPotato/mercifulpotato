A hidden agenda maybe?<p>It reads like if it is an informercial for whatsapp.<p>It is very strange that it advise everyone to go to whatsapp and not any other solution and does not evocate all the issues with whatsapp.\nFor example the fact that enabling automatic backups is strongly pushed on users but these backup are performed on google drive in clear, not encrypted!<p>And so far, in spite of the telegram issues that are well known, Telegram never betrayed any user to this day as far as I know.<p>Also it is strange that they use nazi arguments and co. It&#x27;s not because you don&#x27;t appreciate some people or ideas that a platform should censor them. Also the goal of the platform is especially to not mess with users data. So I find it very strange to say that it should be uninstalled both because it does not encrypt enough and also because you say that they should look more into their users messages!')
