Item(by='ksec', descendants=None, kids=[24989116], score=None, time=1604490555, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24986313, text='After the reversal, Developers are chanting &quot;Awesome&quot;, &quot;This is great&quot;, &quot;Running to Twitter helped&quot;, etc etc. Not a single developer asked <i>why</i> and <i>how</i> did it happen in the first place.<p>The original purpose of the App Store guidelines were to protect the users &#x2F; customers. And it did!. It worked great. And Apple charge you 30% for Digital Goods. And nothing for physical goods. It was Fair. 30% for the likes of Gaming, Productivity Apps such as Office, Camera, Calendar, Photo Editing etc etc. That was fine. And true to its words, Steve&#x27;s Apple had all the rationale in nearly all rejection cases.<p>These days App Store policy is much more about rent seeking, their sole purpose is no longer serving its users and customer&#x27;s best interest. But used in every opportunity to extract more revenues from these Apps <i>and</i> Services. Not to mention how many of these letters from Apple suggest Developers of Free ( as in beer ) Apps contributed <i>nothing</i> to the App Store and act as a &quot;Free Rider&quot; on Apple&#x27;s platform. Compounded by Tim Cook&#x27;s comment on App Store and being user first.<p>Normally I give some benefits of doubt to CEO as they may not be on top of all the things happening in a company. But judging from the Apple vs IMG and Apple vs Qualcomm cases I think he knows exactly what he is doing.<p>This whole things stinks and reeks of hypocrisy to me.')
