You asked me to be more civil a few months ago and I obliged. I&#x27;ve never started ideological flamewars. Just corrected them.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s obviously against the rules and obviously not ok and you&#x27;ve been flaming up a storm here.<p>So it&#x27;s okay to start a flamebait but not to respond to or correct flamebait?<p>&gt; In case anyone is worried about this, we ban accounts that abuse the site regardless of ideology.<p>What ideology are you speaking of? You think I&#x27;m china bot?<p>&gt; Actually, the irony is how much all these sorts of account have in common with each other on both sides of the ideological divide.<p>What ideological divide? You think I&#x27;m a republican and this guy is a democrat? Or vice versa? You are literally making shit up.')
