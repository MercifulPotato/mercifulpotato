I very strongly disagree with the notion that integration into a locked-in ecosystem is a legitimate reason and not an abuse of power.<p>When you switch from product A to product B only because product B integrates with proprietary protocols or services you rely on and not on the merit or price of the product itself then that&#x27;s bad, and it&#x27;s harming consumer welfare and competition. It also is a positive feedback loop in that those services just keep claiming more and more space and the claim of space alone diminishes the value of everyone else, because you&#x27;re forever locked into a web of, in this case, Microsoft products. Which is of course one of the reasons the company is so powerful.<p>You can ask yourself this, if every software company waas forced to implement transparent protocols and APIs, so that clients can freely choose their end-user software, what would the market share look like?
