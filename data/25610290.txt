Apparently the FDA doesn&#x27;t like studies from other countries, so they&#x27;re waiting on a 3rd trial&#x27;s data to come in, which may not happen for several months. The manufacturing technique and storage requirements for this vaccine mean that supply constraints should be much less significant than the currently approved vaccines. Doing this could easily save thousands, likely tens of thousands of lives by spring.<p>So far the vaccines all ran with trials with the minimum time between doses that was likely to incur maximum immunity. It was absolutely the right call, given that they didn&#x27;t know for sure how wildly effective the two mRNA vaccines would be in practice and wanted to expedite the trial timeline. However, now that we know the both vaccines provide roughly 80% immunity after 12 days, which likely last several months at least it would be smart to delay people second dose another 4-8 weeks to allow the maximum number of people to get some immunity quickly.<p>The UK did both the above this week and I think we&#x27;ll look back and realize it was absolutely the right move.')
