There&#x27;s the ethical aspect, but also removal messes up threaded comment systems. A common workaround seems to be to leave the removed comment in place, but make its contents blank.<p>I think a good solution would be setting aside all owner-removed comments, concealed but available for review if someone clicks on them:<p><pre><code>  + (124 comments removed by the author)\n</code></pre>\nThat the content uploader&#x2F;business owner would be able to hide genuinely disruptive and spammy messages. Abusing the power would be pretty easy to expose. Just expand the list of removed comments and see if they&#x27;re really trash or merely criticizing the author&#x2F;owner&#x2F;uploader.')
