And it&#x27;s produced in the first place in the hope that it will be bought at the price asked?<p>So, I&#x27;m not sure that those who produce (or distribute) it will agree at once &quot;let&#x27;s give right away half of produced for free&quot;. But if you pressure them much, they might &quot;agree&quot; to cut the production in half. But you may imagine where that could lead.<p>Finally, you may expect the government to buy half of it right away to give away for free. Well, good luck with running with that line for president, probably won&#x27;t work even in Sub-Saharan Africa. And likely the food will still be trash when reaching the target audience, due to government efficiency.')
