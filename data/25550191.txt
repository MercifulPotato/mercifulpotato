Wikipedia describes it well:<p>&gt; Under California&#x27;s non-partisan blanket primary law, all candidates appear on the same ballot, regardless of party. In the primary, voters may vote for any candidate, regardless of their party affiliation. In the California system, the top two finishers—regardless of party—advance to the general election in November, even if a candidate receives a majority of the votes cast in the primary election. Washington and Louisiana have similar &quot;jungle primary&quot; style processes for U.S. Senate elections, as does Mississippi for U.S. Senate special elections.<p>source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2018_United_States_Senate_election_in_California#Democratic_Party" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2018_United_States_Senate_elec...</a><p>Every senate election I can recall in California has been Democrat v Democrat by the general election.')
