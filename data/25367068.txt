Item(by='tidepod12', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607556804, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25364593, text='That&#x27;s one situation, but when I said &quot;earned due to work in CA&quot; I meant work that is physically done in CA, not just work for a CA-based company.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say I live in Texas and work for a Texas based company at a salary of $100k&#x2F;yr. I spend most of my time in Texas, but I travel a lot for work and for 12 weeks of the year, I spend Monday through Friday in California.<p>Since I am a resident of Texas, I pay taxes on all of that $100k to Texas (but since TX has no income tax, it&#x27;s moot).<p>However, I spent 12 weeks of that work in California, making me a nonresident worker in California. I owe CA income tax on $100k * (12 weeks spent in CA &#x2F; 52 total weeks in a year) = ~$23k. If I have enough deductions in CA to offset that, I might end up owing nothing and any paid taxes might all get refunded to me. But if I don&#x27;t have enough deductions, I might owe CA some tax money.')
