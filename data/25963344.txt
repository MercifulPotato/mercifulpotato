We scream &quot;obvious market manipulation&quot; and then learn how normative this is.<p>This story has been exceptionally good to follow because the mechanisms, as well as one half of the trades are all relatively simple and public. This isn&#x27;t a scheme with super-complicated instruments and acronyms making their first appearances in the news. It&#x27;s a simple strategy. Simple stocks. Simple shorts. Simple companies.<p>These &#x2F;wsb nutters just found stocks that was aggressively and irresponsibly shorted. I&#x27;ve heard 140% of the total shares in existence. In theory (because who knows how tf it actually works irl), they now need to buy shares in order to sell them at the contracted price. There are only so many shares for sale, and the buyers have no choice. The &#x2F;wsb nutters (and now also everyone who hates hedge funds) are holding to spite them.<p>Meanwhile, brokerage CEOs are hinting (and more) at market integrity-level issues yesterday. Solvency of clearing houses and other infrastructure stuff that we only hear about during a scandal.<p>This kind of makes sense, there are theoretical market conditions where prices go to infinity... which is the ultimate stretch goal for wsb right now.')
