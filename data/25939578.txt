Glad you finally get it. Except of course if you think that someone was being scolded for having mental deficiency or specifically an IQ below 70 or something, which I doubt and which I would agree would be just as uncouth as scolding an immature person (in the sense of not being fully developed or grown) for being immature as they can&#x27;t change that about themselves.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wiktionary.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;immature#Adjective" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wiktionary.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;immature#Adjective</a>')
