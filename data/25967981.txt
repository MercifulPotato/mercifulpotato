The EU negotiations with these Big Pharma corps made it wait for these 3 countries (Israel, UK and USA). Vaccinations started 1 or 2 months later in EU (depending on country).<p>A fair comparison would be the data of today in EU with the data from 1 or 2 months ago in those countries (per capita).<p>But the big questions are:<p>Why did we have to negotiate vaccines for a global pandemic? Why are countries moving up the stack with Big Pharma? Why is the vaccination rate higher in USA than in Mozambique?')
