All you need to do is show the other party acted with malice or through fraud. Punitive damages are designed to be a punishment for the bad actor, you can net some nice coin that way if the judge is particularly unhappy with your opponent. Just get try to get in touch with the ACLU to see if they can give any advice before you file, the case law for this stuff is complicated last time I looked into it.')
