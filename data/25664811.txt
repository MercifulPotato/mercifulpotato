Signal is not only not that, but is in fact a completely open non-profit project, so it&#x27;s basically impossible for it to turn into that.<p>Even moving from Fb to Telegram is an improvement in almost all respects and it&#x27;s sure as hell a lot easier to do than going straight to Matrix&#x2F;Riot&#x2F;whatever it is these days. Don&#x27;t be a purist and let people have their compromises, lest you end up like the &quot;GNU&#x2F;&quot; part in front of &quot;Linux&quot;.')
