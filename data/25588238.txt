I am referring to initial infections, not pretending that tourism has been going full swing since March. You cannot compare New Zealand to New York City. I don&#x27;t even think you can compare Seoul â€” and I accounted for the difference in interventions, regarding Seoul. But you conveniently leave that out.<p>As for your &quot;everyone likes to quote,&quot; I in fact said: &quot;you&#x27;ll note that death estimates in the United States were from 200 thousand (if we followed their recommendations) to 2.2 million (if we did nothing).&quot; Are you pretending now that I am misrepresenting the paper? You are simply repeating what I&#x27;ve written, and pretending to be contributing something new to the conversation.')
