Item(by='burntoutfire', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603106959, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24825294, text='&gt; You&#x27;re either unlucky or exaggerating.<p>I think I was neither, as I repeated it three times and always got the same result (I was moving every couple of years, so I threw out the crooked desk top when moving and bought identical one in a new place). Eventually, I stopped getting those $40 honeycomb desk tops and got a wooden one, from IKEA as well (made not from solid wood, but from sort of glued together mosaic of small wood pieces, don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s called) for around $100, which is still good as new after 8 years of usage.')
