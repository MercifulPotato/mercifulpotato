You can run your own instance, but then you&#x27;re just talking to yourself.<p>~15 years ago, when blogs and forums were where most Internet discussions happened, we had that same scenario, and we now consider that at least a silver age of free speech.<p>(And if you went and made your own blog, it was much harder to connect with other bloggers and commenters, compared to running your own instance and tooting at other like-minded instances).<p>If the Fediverse grows and create something similar to that age, I will be overjoyed. I will certainly prefer it to the giant cloud conglomerates&#x27; &quot;professional community managers&quot;, whose rules may or may not be clear but it doesn&#x27;t matter when they&#x27;re based on the politics and concerns of Silicon Valley instead of those of my country or my community.')
