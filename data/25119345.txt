I think there&#x27;s a good argument to be made that we should consider Airbnb a &quot;hospitality&quot; company, but ultimately the label of &quot;tech&quot; company is shorthand for a set of characteristics of the business that other sibling comments have called out -- large amounts of R&amp;D, low marginal costs, and low CapEx. Their product is hospitality, but the company has operating characteristics that have more in common with Facebook than with Marriott.')
