There&#x27;s a huge difference between wanting to share all your content with a group of people all the time, versus trusting those people to make a collective decision to release your documents, for example when they agree that you have died.  People are seriously examining this sort of mechanism now because it&#x27;s relevant to modern life.  For example releasing your password and accounts store to family or trusted friends upon your death or incapacitation, using some kind of distributed dead man&#x27;s switch that needs human judgement to confirm.)<p>The fact is, mnw21cam&#x27;s statement that there are only two possible branches because of maths, depends on the assumption that keys &quot;will be leaked&quot; being inevitable.<p>A sibling commenter believes it is inevitable they will be leaked no matter how sophisticated an aggregation mechanism is used.  That is a reasonable argument, though one I disagree with.<p>If you have a threat model strong enough to break the distributed consensus mechanism of things like Ethereum, then you have a threat model that invalidates branch 1 in mnw21cam&#x27;s list as well as branch 2, so you cannot win: Under that model, you cannot have &quot;secure legal communication that no-one can break&quot; because your own device is vulnerable to compromise as well.  You should find a way to talk without a recording device.<p>Your #2: What I&#x27;ve said is a real logical possibility, and in fact is what we might actually end up with in a number of areas of life.  It is not as &#x27;clever dick nonsense&#x27; as you think.  It might be an undesirable idea, but it is a technically possible one.<p>Your #3: Yes blockchains store and publicise.  They also implement strong distributed consensus, and on top of those other things are layered, such as Ethereum-style smart contracts, and zero-knowledge calculations.  If you think those cannot be used to control the release of fragmented or encrypted <i>secrets</i> driven by measurements of human decisions, you haven&#x27;t understood them yet.  I really recommend you look at ZKProof.org, and have a think about how privacy-maintaining blockchain coins like Zcash and Monero are able to use a public blockchain to exchange secret transactions.<p>Note: I have no stake in this, I&#x27;m not a cryptocurrency or blockchain fan particularly.  But I do understand how they work, and I&#x27;m not fooled by the buzzwords (at all, I&#x27;m quite skeptical).')
