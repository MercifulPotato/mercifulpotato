I mainly use it through eTools metasearch : eTools let you decide on which search engines you want to perform a search. You can define 15 search engines (including Google) and decide if they are important or not.\nSometimes, less than 10 times _a month_, I need to launch Google to check an address on maps or some images.\nMojeek is very useful for me and cover quite my needs, which is a bit of a surprise considering the variety of subjects I look for.\nI also run a little Yacy node.<p>Everyone wanted to understand how very few search engines are real crawlers, should open  &quot;The Search Engine Map&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.searchenginemap.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.searchenginemap.com</a> created by Mojeek.')
