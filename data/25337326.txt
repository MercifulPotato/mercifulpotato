My work involves low-latency network drivers, not at all the field of AI.<p>Fine, there are AI stars too, but the article could lead about what they have done and why they are important no? A discussion involving Jim Keller would lead to his contributions to x86, Apple A10 series, Tesla chips and Zen.<p>I don&#x27;t want a hand wavy discussion over ethics and AI, I want an explanation as to what they have contributed to the field that justifies why their opinion matters.<p>&gt;Why are you trying to establish some &quot;level&quot; distinction between Damore and Gebru.<p>I am trying to establish that these random individuals don&#x27;t matter to me. They are not known for their tech contributions but for the dirty laundry being exposed to the public.<p>These individuals from an external perspective seem to be known for being employed at Google and for some public controversy that cannot be influenced externally.<p>My point is why are these individuals in the news? Why should I care? They aren&#x27;t industry leaders and from my perspective appear about as important as &#x27;GE fires engine tester&#x27;.')
