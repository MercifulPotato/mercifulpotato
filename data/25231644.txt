And also requires delivery of spare parts to professional repair centers. It seems like it will facilitate monopoly for authorized service centers rather than give a real right to repair.<p>Also since the right to repair is a closed catalog it liberates other manufacturers from providing the right.<p>At the end it may be a law that will do repair not easier but even harder.')
