Whether or not not stories are killed immediately by flagging (and it makes sense to me that they are), would it be reasonable for a moderator to eventually review everything that is flagged, or at least everything flagged by more than one person?  I don&#x27;t have a good sense of what the volume would be, but I think it would lead to better results than allowing a tiny number of of users to suppress stories without administrative review.')
