Really!<p>We settled on Rust back when we were building a JS runtime into our proxy. It&#x27;s a great language for hosting v8. When we realized our customers just wanted to run any ol&#x27; code, and not be stuck in a v8 isolate, we extracted the proxy bits and kept them around.<p>I think you could build our proxy just fine in Go. One really nice thing about Rust, though, is the Hyper HTTP library. It&#x27;s _much_ more flexible than Go&#x27;s built in HTTP package, which turns out to be really useful for our particular product.')
