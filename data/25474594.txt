There are a number of GF beers, but they&#x27;re mostly not that good.<p>I can also recommend Udi&#x27;s GF bread, a bit pricy and you keep it frozen, but it defrosts in the toaster easily and is actually pretty decent.<p>I&#x27;m afraid you&#x27;re out of luck for GF Pizza, of most of the frozen ones the cardboard packaging tastes better.')
