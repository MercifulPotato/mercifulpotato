Item(by='jolmg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610610148, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25771202, text='&gt; I disagree... if that rock were to suddenly vanish from existence, would your life really be any worse for it? Or could you just find another rock?<p>I&#x27;m not sure how your point counts as a disagreement. You&#x27;re telling me about how unessential you are, and I don&#x27;t see how that matters. Nearly everybody is unessential. Heck, being &quot;essential&quot; depends on other people&#x27;s opinion, and I don&#x27;t see how their opinion matters either. There&#x27;s nobody in the world that&#x27;s <i>really</i> essential.<p>Before the needs of the world comes the needs of oneself. Though we can enjoy being important to others, nobody needs that to enjoy life. It&#x27;s just one way to do it.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with a mundane life either. Many people even covet for a simple, ordinary life. I did. I was dealt a bad hand (perhaps avoidable&#x2F;fixable with more effort by me, though that&#x27;s in hindsight), that I thought I was going to have to live with for the rest of my life. I learned to accept it, commit to it, and enjoy what I still had available to enjoy. Things got better to my surprise and dismay (yes, it was very conflicting), but I would have been fine even if it didn&#x27;t.<p>Even members of the lowest social&#x2F;economic classes laugh heartedly at times and have their own ways to enjoy their time.<p>&gt; Imagine you saw someone doing something that you loved... Could you honestly say that seeing that would make you happy?<p>I was trying to write in broad terms. Their wish might not be because the act would make them happy. Rather, one can wish for a task they want done. Even if the person doing it doesn&#x27;t enjoy it, if it gets the task any closer to completion, then that could make them happy.<p>As an example, if someone dying is worrying about the care of a dependent loved one, taking steps to care for that dependent person would make them happy no matter how much you might hate it. There&#x27;s no completion to it either. Any amount of care would be welcomed, I think.<p>&gt; FWIW I did look into being a living organ donor.<p>If your health isn&#x27;t so bad that you&#x27;re close to dying, then that&#x27;s also very wasteful in my opinion. You can achieve more with a healthy body. Leave the donation until after you die. There&#x27;ll always be someone in need of an organ. Even if you provide one now, that&#x27;ll just leave someone in the future without an organ you could have provided then.<p>You seem fixated on the happiness of others. Can&#x27;t you be a little more selfish? You should be able to enjoy life on your own. Actually, you should be able to enjoy it even if you were the only living being on this planet. Even in those circumstances, I think I&#x27;d lack time to fully enjoy life. I&#x27;d probably spend my time either studying something to make sense of the world or developing skills. That&#x27;d be my enjoyment even if there&#x27;s no one to acknowledge me. I hear others enjoy the feeling of aching muscles after a day&#x27;s work. I imagine they&#x27;d enjoy building stuff, maybe a garden. With the abundance of things we have, it&#x27;s a matter of choosing the best way to spend our time rather than having trouble finding anything at all. Can&#x27;t you find a hobby? There&#x27;s an infinitude of things to enjoy.<p>Re: finding another rock. You don&#x27;t need to be irreplaceable to be loved. You can be the support of someone that would appreciate it and find joy that way, too.<p>Though if work works, then I think that&#x27;s good too.
