It&#x27;s better understood as a paid apprenticeship in R&amp;D.<p>It&#x27;s preparation to become either a professor at a university or an independent researcher at an industrial&#x2F;government research lab. It won&#x27;t increase your lifetime earnings or job prospects, but it does open up doors to jobs whose primary allure is intellectual freedom rather than material reward.<p>If you don&#x27;t go one of those two routes after a CS PhD, then a CS PhD has rather high negative expected value except in a few special circumstances (e.g., BS from NoName Branch Cappus to PhD from mit&#x2F;cmu&#x2F;stanford. But that&#x27;s not the typical case for non-immigrants.)')
