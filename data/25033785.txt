What good does it do to include an encoder if it can only do bad quality? (Where does all that subscription money even going, Adobe? Adding more bugs and bad quality code?) We&#x27;ll have to re-encode everything after the Adobe step anyway... (Also Adobe doesn&#x27;t support Linux at all of course, so it&#x27;s hard to compare there already...)')
