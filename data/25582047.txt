If a company swings too far to the sales-oriented mindset, new R&amp;D ventures can look very unappealing under typical models. Sales-minded executives would rather focus on the investments they know, such as hiring more sales people or increasing advertising expenditure.<p>Having a separate division responsible for R&amp;D allows them to play by different rules and take more risky, longer-term bets. However, this is easier said than done. These R&amp;D budgets are usually the first thing on the chopping block when sales are down and executives need to clean up the budget numbers. It&#x27;s also extremely difficult to transition new products out of R&amp;D and into their own, sustainable divisions. Some companies, executives, and engineers get hooked on tinkering with new product R&amp;D and forget that they have to turn things into long-term product offerings. This is how you end up with constant product churn like Google&#x27;s ever-expanding graveyard of abandoned products.')
