Our salaries have already been adjusted for local conditions for years. If you transfer from, say, Google Mountain View out to Pittsburgh or Waterloo your compensation will be adjusted accordingly, including your RSUs. None of this is new or novel so it&#x27;s weird to see people complain.<p>In all likelihood these companies will continue to compensate generously relative to everyone else. It&#x27;s their MO.<p>It&#x27;s pretty hard to complain as I watch working class people around me struggle to get by, or get sick working in &quot;essential&quot; industries. Friend of mine got COVID (likely) from work, carpenter at a petroleum plant. Mid 50s, but very healthy and fit, no health issues. Had to be rushed to hospital to get oxygen, was on his ass for weeks. Luckily a unionized job, but others not nearly as lucky.<p>Personally I can&#x27;t wait to be able to go back into the office, at least a couple days a week. Nice that my chronic back pain has improved a lot since I haven&#x27;t been driving my commute daily though.')
