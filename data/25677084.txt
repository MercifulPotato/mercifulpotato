I mean, .. individual classes? You&#x27;re riding at home. By yourself. What&#x27;s group about it?<p>Yes, pre-pandemic, there were other people <i>in the room</i> where they recorded the classes. And likely there are other people taking the same class as you, right now. You can see where they&#x27;re at on the leaderboard. But they&#x27;re also irrelevant to you. You can just ignore it. You take the class any time you want, and there&#x27;s one instructor, and the fact that someone in south america happens to be watching the same stream as you isn&#x27;t really relevant to your experience.<p>I&#x27;d say in the Zwift world, where you race other people on-screen is more of a &quot;group&quot; experience, but again, both of these workouts are highly individual.')
