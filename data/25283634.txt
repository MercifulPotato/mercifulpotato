It might be in ~5 billion years when the Sun itself dies, but the planet will not last forever. To have any hope of lasting on a cosmic time-scale as a species, you need to spread across the stars.<p>There is a very slim chance that somewhere in that vast time-scale horseshoe crabs might evolve intelligence and the ability to manipulate their environment such that they eventually build some kind of means of interstellar travel, but given we&#x27;re using up resources like coal that will never be replenished, mining all the easy accessible metals, etc. I don&#x27;t believe it will be possible for another civilisation  to rise equivalent to humans in technology, let alone a star faring civilisation.<p>Being smart is what made us the dominant species on this planet, and being smart is the only thing that will get us out of the solar system - really, it&#x27;s all we have going for us. The crabs might have better immune systems and so on, but I believe that eventually (if we don&#x27;t destroy ourselves) we&#x27;ll reach a point where our ability to edit the human body would allow us to patch in a better immune system.')
