So schools worked in two shifts. Half of my school years I started school at 1pm. Wasn’t that bad, I actually preferred it.<p>As for “natural sleep cycle” and “improved quality” I can tell you that this is self-made (or rather parent-made) problem in this case. If I take my children’s devices away at 8pm, then they go to bed by <i>themselves</i> after 9, have a good sleep and ready for school.<p>Ironically, similar thing happens to me, but sadly there is nobody to take away my phone, as time of this comment shows.')
