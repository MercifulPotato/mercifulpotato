Among their current goals is to become the dominant power in East and Southeast Asia, displacing the U.S., and to become the dominant power in the world.<p>Trade treaties have long been used by countries for those ends. China in particular has heavily used economic power and arrangements to expand political influence. For example, loans to many countries are used to create leverage and sometimes seize valuable strategic assets when the debtors, which most observers knew were not creditworthy, cannot pay them back. For example, China has acquired ports that way (IIRC, the one in Sri Lanka?).<p>Also, regardless of the situation, China will have the most leverage in any negotiation of an economic treaty (as does the U.S., despite the disinformation that those treaties are to the U.S.&#x27;s disadvantage).<p>The source of the initiative, if that&#x27;s the case (do you have evidence?) doesn&#x27;t restrain China or protect the other countries.')
