That is what was reported immediately after the shooting. That&#x27;s not a summary execution, that&#x27;s serving a warrant for arrest. That&#x27;s due process of law.<p>You are changing the goal posts substantially. Wikipedia defines a summary execution (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Summary_execution" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Summary_execution</a>) as being accused and then immediately killed without trial. That is not what happened to Reinoehl. He was accused, a judge issued a warrant. He was given the opportunity to come and face justice. He did not. Instead he shot at police. They shot back.<p>In order for it to have been a summary execution, Reinoehl would have to have been captured and well under the Marshal&#x27;s control and then killed. Or he would have had to indicate that he surrendered and been shot anyway. That is not what happened.<p>Ultimately, this situation would have been easily resolvable had Reinoehl turned himself into police, like Kyle Rittenhouse. Sad anyone had to die, most of all Reinoehl&#x27;s victim, Aaron Danielson, who for some reason (that we all know) is completely ignored in all this.')
