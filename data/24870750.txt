To the extent they strongly imply you&#x27;ll be taking home $2 per week or that you&#x27;ll be able to afford Disneyland, well aware neither are true, that is likely also fraud.<p>To the extent that someone is genuinely dumb and naive it seems easier to legally put them into an exploitative situation but I reject the notion that this is an accurate description of most Uber drivers.<p>You have brought up a good point, the system I&#x27;m imagining doesn&#x27;t have a good solution for people who are dumb and naive and who unknowingly put themselves into exploitive situations. Luckily I don&#x27;t think there are many people like this, hopefully they have a network of friends&#x2F;family guiding them, and hopefully the safety net I&#x27;m describing puts some bounds on their downside: by picking a bad job they might not make it to Disneyland but at least they won&#x27;t make it into poverty.')
