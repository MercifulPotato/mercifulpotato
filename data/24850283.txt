I&#x27;ve been trying to get my fork certification since January.  I&#x27;ve had 8 classes in a row cancelled.  They&#x27;re not expensive or time-consuming.  We simply can&#x27;t get training because there&#x27;s none being offered.<p>The unemployment rate in the USA is dropping but still around 8%, the highest it&#x27;s been since 2012.  Many hundreds of my colleagues are out of work right now.<p>You don&#x27;t need technology to solve this problem.  Hire people, and train them.  If only 1&#x2F;2 of 1% of the unemployed people in America are capable and willing to drive a fork, that&#x27;s still 60,000 more potential drivers.<p>As a former software techie myself, I think this company looks suspiciously like the classic &#x27;startup&#x27; which is trying to insert their technology into a situation, rather than trying to meet a market need.  When a company says they can&#x27;t find workers, I don&#x27;t believe them, and I <i>especially</i> don&#x27;t believe them in 2020 for jobs that take literally 1 day of training.  Nobody can be that incompetent at hiring.  Post &quot;free forklift training + a job&quot; on your personal FB page and you&#x27;ll have 5 people show up this afternoon.<p>Which they absolutely should be doing, of course.  If Teleo succeeds, they&#x27;re going to need a lot of skilled drivers.  This is classic &quot;commoditize your complement&quot;.<p>Teleo is YC-backed, and Phantom&#x27;s founder was previously in YC with a different company.  Cute submarine.  They&#x27;re not really lamenting the lack of workers.  This is pure marketing.')
