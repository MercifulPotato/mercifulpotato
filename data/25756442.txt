I knew David Marcus is&#x2F;was a facebook exec, but even he is listed as head of Novi[2]. That right there tells you how damaged that brand(facebook) is when their crytocurrency project doesn&#x27;t list the company or the CEO(zuckerberg). Needless to say I said thanks, no thanks to that recruiter.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.diem.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.diem.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;</a><p>[2] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.diem.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;association&#x2F;#board_of_directors" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.diem.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;association&#x2F;#board_of_directors</a>')
