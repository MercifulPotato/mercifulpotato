Thank you.<p>I have a lot more to comment here but have a quiz (engineering undergrad) to do rn..lol. But I gotta say your description of you experience is the most comprehensive thing I was ever able to relate to. I found a lot of people on r&#x2F;ADHD articulating individual feelings&#x2F;experiences that I felt but was not able to talk about, but yours just covered a lot more base with me personally.<p>&gt; anything from CSS to soldering and unable to sleep for the rush of ideas.<p>That hit hard XD.<p>&gt; would be better titled &quot;Attention Difference Disorder&quot;<p>Yes, a lot of people are don&#x27;t like that it was named mostly based on the symptoms most annoying to the people around the person ADHD with. Many people suggest something along the lines of &quot;Executive Function Dysregulation&quot; to remove the &quot;hyper&quot; part that many people don&#x27;t suffer from and include emotional-dysregulation in the symptoms.<p>Ok enough. time to go.')
