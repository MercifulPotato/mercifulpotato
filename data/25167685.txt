There, it&#x27;s correct to avoid phrases that are harmful to people, once you are aware of the issue they have.  That&#x27;s just part of not being an asshole.<p>But in public forums--and relevant to the article--public software&#x2F;documentation, I believe the number of problematic phrases approaches 100%.  Even referencing &quot;years from now&quot; can bring a Stage-4 cancer patient to tears--100% real pain I have seen with my own eyes--and there are many people in that state.  Yet, obviously we have to accept that we will cause those people pain and go ahead referencing the future that was taken from them.<p>Therefore, to me, the only social contract that &quot;works&quot; in public is that we all try not to offend, and anyone who gets hurt by everyday language realizes their reaction is mostly an internal issue, and no harm was meant or could be reasonably avoided.<p>I&#x27;d expect that latitude of the wheelchair-bound person who winces at references to walking, and from the developer who thinks of slavery at the sight of a &quot;master branch.&quot;  The tinge they felt was real, but in my view it is not our responsibility to avoid it in a public space. As a result, I must disagree with the handful of advocates who want to change every git repository on the planet.  But maybe I am in the wrong. It is just my opinion.<p>Thanks for your reply.  I always worry these topics will get unnecessarily heated.<p>(edit: removed a bunch of text that was just reiterating stuff I already said).')
