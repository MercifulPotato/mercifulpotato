Hard', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Starting my company was the hardest career decision of my life.<p>I left a cushy role running design at one of New York&#x27;s largest venture studios to transition into the grueling world of startups.<p>It&#x27;s been hard.<p>But, it&#x27;s also been one of the most transformative experiences of my career.<p>Here are the 3 most important things I&#x27;ve learnt along the way.<p>Doubt is a normal part of the process. I&#x27;ve talked to founders who have run companies making millions in revenue. They all experienced doubt on their first day. Many still experience it today.<p>Start shipping. The biggest antidote to doubt is action. As you ship, you&#x27;ll build more confidence and see how your behavior informs your thoughts and feelings, as much as your thoughts and feelings inform your behavior.<p>Keep at it for 3 months. Persist. Ride the highs. Ride the lows. At that point, you&#x27;ll either have shipped an idea that excites you (and others), or you&#x27;ll have learned that an idea doesn&#x27;t work. Either way, you&#x27;ll have learned critical founder lessons, and will be one step closer to finding that killer idea.<p>Either way, you win.<p>P.S. If you want to see what it&#x27;s like for founders to go through the doubt, the shipping, and the 3 months of persistence, there&#x27;s tons of online resources to do so: YC runs startup school which is a free online &amp; community for early stage VC-backed founders &amp; Indie hackers is a community for ideation stage bootstrapped entrepreneurs. I&#x27;m also helping to run an event which will showcase what a few founders have worked on after tackling a sprint for 3 months (links here https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hopin.com&#x2F;events&#x2F;day-one-showcase if you&#x27;re curious).<p>Remember to keep going.')
