Not banned, posted 5 hours ago (stop spreading innocuous misinformation): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;fdrlst" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;fdrlst</a><p>Not all bans are permanent (but thanks for the sanctimonious flair).<p>&gt; 2. What misinformation was spread?<p>1) That you can have safe infections (many otherwise healthy people have died from covid, including kids).<p>2) That &quot;voluntary&quot; is even an applicable term in an epidemic. You are not merely risking your life, but that of others, regardless of what you think are safety measures.<p>And speaking of masks as you mentioned, they are generally not for your safety, but for the safety of everyone else, so they work best if a critical amount of people use them.<p>I find it very curious that you dive deep into the (at least) three people opposing the article, and not the MD posting it. An unlicensed MD who&#x27;s been a business man for 25 years and was a skin doctor.<p>&gt; How is it you can claim that “they spread misinformation that would get people killed?” Something controversial, sure. “Would get people killed?” Thats silly.<p>People die from covid, even outside of risk groups. That&#x27;s not silly, that&#x27;s a fact.')
