Let&#x27;s look at the options for forums with protected speech.<p>* If only publicly funded communication channels have protections of freedom of speech. Can you tell me where I can find a public social network with free speech protections?<p>* Private media doesn&#x27;t owe anyone almost anything lately. They publish whatever they want and will not talk about what&#x27;s not convenient for the stories they tell. We&#x27;ve seen too much of it this year.<p>* Even if there was this great publicly-funded unbiased media source. Public funded usually means government. Twitter, Facebook, and others are now explicitly marking all the government-funded media and sources, as a way of implying bias. Essentially, bit by bit discrediting these platforms.<p>* All the private social platform don&#x27;t owe you anything and will kick you out at will without any need for explanation.<p>If we agree that free speech is a critically important value of a civil, prosperous, modern civilization, then we&#x27;re in big trouble. Most if not all the discourse these days is happening online and all the communication channels that people use belong either to:<p>* private corporations that are not bound by free speech laws<p>* non-profits overrun by often biased volunteers<p>* privately owned media companies pushing their agenda without any boundaries or common sense<p>* biased government sources pushing their propaganda<p>So where is the avenue for free speech in the 21st century?
