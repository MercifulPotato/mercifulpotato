You could only measure the time spent in the seat, right?<p>Now you&#x27;re saying people should be judged on their outputs. Interesting change of pace.<p>In reality he&#x27;s unlikely to draw 2x the salary for 2x the output, though, because he&#x27;s operating from a deficit of information and again, the manager&#x2F;hr person&#x27;s main goal isn&#x27;t actually efficiency.<p>If they&#x27;re smart, though, they&#x27;ll give him a performance bonus based on productivity over a minimum marker, maybe staged as productivity goes up without a quality drop to squeeze out as much as possible. At a certain point, though, money becomes less of a driver for most people so that&#x27;s not the only thing they&#x27;ll do. They will also tie his performance to the team as a whole, create opportunities for building &#x27;team unity&#x27; and maybe put together artificial competition so he actually cares about team performance. Then his colleagues will push him to perform better.')
