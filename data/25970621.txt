It just depends on local gas and electricity prices.<p>For example, in CA current regular grade fuel is about $3.40&#x2F;gal.  A Prius gets 60mpg, which works out to 6c&#x2F;mile.<p>For electricity, the average rate in CA is 24c&#x2F;kWh.  A model 3 uses 250 Wh&#x2F;mile which works out to 6c&#x2F;mile.<p>So exactly the same price per mile. A small change in either fuel price could advantage one or the other.<p>Of course you can take advantage of overnight lower EV charging rates, or drive to an area with cheaper gas, but at least with current average energy prices, there isn&#x27;t a huge difference in per mile energy consumption costs.')
