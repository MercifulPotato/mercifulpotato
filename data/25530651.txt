In the short term, people with this mindset can lose a lot.<p>The get-rich-quick cohort is too quick to sell. They sell after 2x or 3x to &quot;lock in gains&quot; and then sit on the sidelines for the 20x. And then they buy at the top when the hype is at max volume. Then sell after a 50% drawdown to protect what remains of their capital.<p>However, those with extraordinary patience can do very well. Buy the leaders that are technically sound, with high decentralization, widely accepted with deep liquidity.<p>Then withdraw it offline, out of exchanges, to a hardware wallet.<p>Stop checking the price every five minutes.<p>Maybe once a quarter check the market, read the news, and ensure you remember your pin or seed and that your tokens are still there.<p>Never trade. When it doubles or triples, don&#x27;t sell. When it drops 30% or 70%, don&#x27;t sell. Just hold 5 or 10 years.<p>I&#x27;ve never been a fan of the centralized Ripple model, but if I was in your place, I&#x27;d examine my motivations. If I need the money now, if I&#x27;m looking for a quick buck, then I&#x27;d sell to stop the stress.<p>But if I can take a very long-term perspective, then I&#x27;d trade what&#x27;s left for BTC or ETH and salt it away offline until 2026+ and see what happens.')
