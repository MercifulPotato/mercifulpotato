And with suggestions like &quot;mandatory firing of over-represented groups,&quot; a ridiculous and awful suggestion that nobody wants and would achieve no good, I&#x27;m guess that you also wish to denigrate those who work to understand racial disparities in the US. But usually such sort of odd sarcasm isn&#x27;t found on HN.')
