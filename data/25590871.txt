If you are writing the game yourself, you can do interpolation to fix things up gradually.<p>You can also delay significant events such as death until the rollback threshold has been passed, so you don&#x27;t run in to knife edge situations where, e.g., it looks like you died and your character starts to ragdoll but then you snap back when it turns out you killed the enemy instead.<p>The key to it not being too disruptive is keeping the maximum rollback threshold fairly low. If you add inputs and your ping is greater than the threshold, they get delayed to a later frame, and your inputs start to feel sluggish (the server would enforce the delay, but you&#x27;d also add it client side).')
