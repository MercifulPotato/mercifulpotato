I recommend finding a private practice psychiatrist first since they can refer you to a specialist for therapy—doing the reverse is much harder. My sister is a clinical psychologist in the Navy who works with many PTSD patients, so finding a therapist with military experience would make sense in your case; she’s a proponent of exposure therapy. What I discovered was that the most helpful doctors are always in the most affluent part of town, so keep that in mind, it’s worth the drive.')
