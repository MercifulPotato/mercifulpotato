This is one example of the fact that the Earth &#x27;laps&#x27; the outer planets because it has a faster orbit. So the outer planets sometimes appear to go backward with respect to a fixed point such as a star as the Earth undertakes them. They also can move up and down with respect to that fixed point because their orbits are tilted somewhat compared with the Earth&#x27;s orbital plane around the sun. The overall effect is that the outer planets sometimes trace out a little spiral, and the further they are from the sun, the more these spirals dominate their overall motion (because we are lapping them more often).<p>Obviously it&#x27;s different for Mercury and Venus, whose orbits are inside ours. They instead switch between being visible in the morning or the evening.<p>All very complicated for those ancient astronomers!')
