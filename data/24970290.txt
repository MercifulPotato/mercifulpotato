The costs to build a rail system where it doesn&#x27;t exist are very high, and until you have most of the system in place it is useless to most people.<p>Of course we built a road system - without paved roads cars are mostly useless.  We have build rail systems in the past as well.  The problem isn&#x27;t unsolvable by the nature of the problem. It is unsolvable because you can&#x27;t get the right people to make long term investments in it (don&#x27;t look to government - anyone who tries will be voted out eventually at best the system changes course from one okay system to a different incompatible system, though more likely they just stop investing).')
