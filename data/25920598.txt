Even then, you only had one path to the telephone CO and only one CO it could go to.  Outages were rare because voice-grade wire is cheap and all the complexity is handled by the CO.<p>Also, while my Internet may have outages from time to time, I can&#x27;t recall the last time I couldn&#x27;t use my cell phone other than being in a bad signal area.  For voice, cellular is definitely the way to go as capacity is easily added by adding new towers; not something easy to do with landlines.')
