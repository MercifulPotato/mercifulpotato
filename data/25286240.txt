Google corporate accounts cannot sign in on other devices.  When a device gets too old and rolls off the supported list, they automatically log it out and wipe any company data on it.  I believe most large companies operate like this.<p>Google is actually more flexible than most companies: Any employee can get a company phone and employees are allowed to use their personal phones if they want (and don&#x27;t mind the rootkit and spying).  Surprisingly, a lot of people opt for the rootkit &amp; spying to avoid carrying two phones.  This saves the company some money on phones &amp; mobile service contracts.  And it makes those employees happy.')
