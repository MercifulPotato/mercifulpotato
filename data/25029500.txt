Google could implement Dart or an evolution of that language (they tried this around 2010, but Blink wasn&#x27;t on 95% of [desktop] computers back then) and kill off JS overnight, since if every browser supports it by default, there&#x27;s no reason not to use it over JS.<p>The massive downside, of course, is that Google also has the ability to design its browser so that extensions that perform adblocking can&#x27;t run, and that&#x27;ll be everywhere too- though I suspect that the number of people who would pay the price of a VPN connection a month for a modern browser with guaranteed ad-blocking support is quite large provided there&#x27;s no other choice.')
