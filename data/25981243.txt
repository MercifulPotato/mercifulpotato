After this fiasco, who in their right mind can trust Robinhood for financial future.<p>The cofounder stated in every interview that it was not a liquidity issue. The actual company stated reasons are still very cagey and ambiguous.<p>There are all these third parties coming out with shill articles, trying to excuse Robinhood. This is classic propaganda PR campaign.<p>Robinhood can’t explicitly state what they did for specific reason, because everyone can analyze whether it’s true or not. What is being attempted is to run third party propaganda PR campaign to excuse Robinhood.<p>Has Robinhood explicitly stated the exact reasons for shutting down buying but allowing selling stocks?
