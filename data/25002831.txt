Someone shares a link with me (on skype, slack, teams... whatever) and I care about the content because the person sharing it with me thinks I could&#x2F;should care about it, or someone shares a link on an aggregator and then I don&#x27;t think it is too much to ask for that someone to write a summary. If the link is worth sharing writing 1 sentence to explain why isn&#x27;t too much to ask.<p>What is the value a link preview adds? And why should I, as a content provider care about the value you add? Cloudflare does something for me, what is your service doing for me and why should I whitelist you (or care about you)?')
