For example Parler has found a new host in Russia, probably with a big helping hand from Russian intelligence.<p>And sure that host could be deplatformed over it too, but if that continues to escalate then the ultimate endpoint is a balkanized internet where we don&#x27;t tolerate traffic from ISPs that provide peer exchange to ISPs that provide data services to datacenters that provide services to hosting services that provide services to Parler.  Effectively if Russia is willing to continue to escalate then the only practical solution to &quot;de-platform&quot; Parler would be to cut off Russia from the rest of the internet entirely.')
