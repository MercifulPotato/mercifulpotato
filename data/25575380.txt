Item(by='rsynnott', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609278017, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25574777, text='&gt; While I do wish there were more healthy options, I can assure you that the mainstream grocery stores (Ralph&#x27;s, Safeway, etc) contain many products with low or no sugar.<p>What struck me as weird was the sugar in products where I&#x27;d never have expected to find it in the first place. In particular bread (most non-absurdly-expensive brands seemed to have added sugar, which would not normally be the case here).<p>In fact, an Irish court recently ruled that Subway &#x27;bread&#x27; wasn&#x27;t actually bread at all (important for VAT purposes here); too much added sugar.<p>I&#x27;m sure it is _possible_ to get food that doesn&#x27;t have added sugar in the US, but it does seem to be the default to add sugar in some quite weird places.<p>Edit: One way to regulate this, less draconian than actually banning added sugar, would be to regulate naming (for instance, banning sale of a bread-like product with added sugar as bread).')
