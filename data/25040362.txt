I wanted to bridge the gap between (this is an electric circuit that lights an LED) and (this is how you can take a simple inverter and a logic gate to build a D flip flop, which can power registers, SRAM, and more) and (this is an 8-bit example of a Von Neumann Architecture computer).<p>His videos are perfect for that. Very well made and I don&#x27;t have to take classes in circuit design or digital logic control &amp; design at a college to learn the high level of how this works.')
