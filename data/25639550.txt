That band is responsible for a lot of groundbreaking and beautiful music, but they&#x27;re are also associated with &quot;heavy metal&quot;, which makes them absurd in most people&#x27;s eyes AFAIK, sadly tainting the perception of Black Sabbath&#x27;s music.<p>On the other hand, can you really blame anyone for making fun of the <i>metal</i> steretypes they let themselves be pigeonholed into? Their reputation isn&#x27;t even an accident, it&#x27;s connected with their target audience, giving them their niche. Arguably their music was even influential in creating the &quot;metal&quot; culture.<p>The takeaway here could be that there are usually different angles from which it is possible to appreciate (pop) culture, and it&#x27;s stupid to let one aspect taint another, but also that there&#x27;s no point in pretending an aspect doesn&#x27;t exist or treating it with excessive respect (i.e., making a fuss about people joking about it).<p>EDIT: another relevant subject here is whether there should be subjects one can&#x27;t joke with. I think I would like it if nothing was off-limits to jokes (even though I&#x27;m not especially funny). E.g., I&#x27;m pretty sure September 11 is sacrosanct in USA in this regard, and there are other subjects joking about which could get many a person quite uncomfortable, like child molestation, rape, murder, suicide, etc.<p>I myself sometimes get quite uncomfortable when I hear jokes about Holocaust and Jews, but the real issue there is not the jokes, the jokes are just a symptom of societal issues which <i>should</i> make one uncomfortable. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s the best way to deal with those issues, but I&#x27;m sure that making those jokes taboo is precisely what gives them a certain attractiveness and power.')
