Each kit contains four letters, which we will mail back in the future (6 months, 1 year, 5 years, 10 years later).<p>Modern Memories is a concept and product that I wanted for my daughter. I want to send letters to my two year daughter, Navia, so she can receive them as she grows older. Even better would be letters from her elderly grandparents so even if they pass, she will one day receive a letter written in their handwriting.<p>Everyone loves the feeling of finding an old letter and reminiscing about forgotten days and departed loved ones. That&#x27;s what we hope to replicate.<p>The kit comes in a beautiful box and contains stationery to write the letters , a pen , instructions, and a return envelope .   The user provides their information and recipient information (along with contact info for other people incase we can&#x27;t reach the recipient in the future). The stationery contain guided and blank pages. Guided templates ask questions such as “Describe something funny involving you and your grandchild”. The sender can also include a few photos with captions and we send them with the four letters.<p>We will routinely reach out to the recipient via email to keep the most up to date address on file. We will send the letters at appropriate times. Soon we will have a dashboard so the writer can change information on their own.<p>We are launching with 3 kits-<p>PARENT KIT - Geared towards parents and grandparents writing letters to their children and grandchildren<p>LOVE KIT - For romantic partners to write letter to each other<p>The above kits have letters delivered in 6 months, 1 year, 5 years and 10 years.<p>RESOLUTION KIT - Letters written to yourself to help keep track of your goals and aspirations .<p>Delivered in 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years.<p>COVID<p>This pandemic has been incredibly isolating for families. As healthcare workers ourselves, we have felt and seen the impact of this isolation. For each purchased Modern Memories Kit, we are donating a kit to patients in the hospital.   In the future, we want to donate to schools so students can write letters to themselves.<p>What if we fail?   We have already collected letters from family and friends and are personally writing letters to our daughter. If we fail, we will still send out everyone’s letters. If for some reason we cannot, we will mail back all letters. We are keeping them safe with forever stamps already placed on them.<p>Price?  We are currently offering each kit for $19.99.
