It would entirely kill performance. You want it to be an integer maybe, or a double, or sometimes something else. It&#x27;s going to be application specific is the point, because another user want some different subset of Number&#x27;s behavior. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a shortcut here besides making a very limited or opinionated FFI system.')
