Taking a mere observation over one week of weather activity cannot be looked at in isolation and simply called &quot;climate change, tada!&quot;<p>FTA:<p>&gt;When scientists talk about climate, they&#x27;re often looking at averages of precipitation, temperature, humidity, sunshine, wind, and other measures of weather that occur over a long period in a particular place. In some instances, they might look at these averages over 30 years. And, we refer to these three-decade averages of weather observations as Climate Normals.')
