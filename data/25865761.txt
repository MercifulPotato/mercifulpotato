Call it something else, and just call it compatible with Elasticsearch v(FORKED_VERSION). Their continued trying to associate it to ES is causing most of the issues, and after this situation I don&#x27;t think the name is a valuable as it used to be. AWS have the resources to do a nice clean re-branding as well.<p>I am actually quite surprised they haven&#x27;t just hired a small team of core devs for it and try and out compete Elastic. The groundwork is laid, I could easily see AWS being able to maintain a &quot;Fast Follower&quot; + AWS Optimisation approach and be able to offer a substantial portion of the value for a fraction of the costs. Try and pick up the open source community now while there is concerns around the license.<p>Additionally at this point the AWS core platform is different enough then GCP &#x2F; Azure &#x2F; other clouds. I imagine they could build optimisations for AWS in and be able to save costs on providing the service. (i.e. it might be worth doing some work in FPGAs &#x2F; ASICs, giving faster performance while only being economical when your the scale of AWS). I kind of am surprised AWS hasn&#x27;t grown to attempt to have a guiding hand over many of the open source projects that are effectively their vendors. Many projects have a handful of core contributors and a hiring a key person will ensure your able to influence development in a way that assists you (assuming it is neutral to beneficial to the project).<p>Edit: I should probably say I don&#x27;t love the idea (morality) of the &quot;Fast Follower&quot; capturing the value of an innovative project and screwing the people involved in making the project successful. However it is how competition works and how many other businesses operate in other industries. Since elastic and AWS can&#x27;t seem to come to a mutually beneficial agreement, then I would prefer them to sort it out in competition.')
