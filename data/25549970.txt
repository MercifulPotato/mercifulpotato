You would want to launch over ocean so any debris&#x2F;stages don&#x27;t crash into populated areas. There&#x27;s not that many places that is suitable.<p>China has due to geo politics and secrecy three space ports deep inland and it&#x27;s not unusual that launch stages crash into populated areas. Probably why they&#x27;ve started to launch from ocean platforms.')
