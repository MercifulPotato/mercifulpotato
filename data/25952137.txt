Item(by='webmobdev', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611882267, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25941392, text='No, I was broadly commenting on why education cannot trump regulation.<p>For the sake of argument, one can say that actions of forums like WSB should also be regulated to protect them, just like laws for compulsory wearing of helmet (while riding two-wheelers) or putting seatbelts (while riding cars) exist, even though one would think that education and common sense would make them do this automatically out of self-preservation instincts.<p>But since I am not an expert in finance or stock markets, I really am not in any sound position to comment on the specifics here.<p>My broader general argument (not at all related to WSB or the financial industry) is just that education alone is insufficient, and regulation is often required too for maximum efficacy.')
