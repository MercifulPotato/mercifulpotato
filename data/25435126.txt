Different pathogens have different characteristics, and thus different responses to protective measures. AFAIK, most influenzas are much more prone to airborne transmission than SARS-COV-2, where the main concern is droplet transmission (though some airborne transmission seems to occur), against which masks that are ineffective against airborne transmission can be quite effective.<p>You wouldn&#x27;t judge the value of condoms in preventing the spread of AIDS by studies of how effective they were in preventing the spread of the flu, either.')
