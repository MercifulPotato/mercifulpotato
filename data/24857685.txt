If you don&#x27;t believe this, add an MITM proxy to verify what&#x27;s happening on the newtab page.<p>Personal note: From google analytics in the about:addons view that can only be deleted with physical deletion of the profile folder, to digicert&#x27;s OCSP service and Google Safebrowsing getting all your cookies, to detectportal.firefox.com tracking all your Geolocation data on every restart... these are all reasons for me to not use Firefox anymore.<p>That is not privacy respecting. It&#x27;s what I expect from Google, not Mozilla.')
