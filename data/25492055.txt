Which, again, doesn&#x27;t seem to be very well supported by data.<p>I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re being fair to what he said.  He said that black communities have higher crime rates, which should rightly deserve more police attention, hence their interaction with police on a per capita basis would increase.<p>You seem to be implying that cops are, subconsciously or not, more interested in using deadly force against black people than white people.  The data you&#x27;re using from statista seems to have many equally plausible explanations, but you&#x27;ve chosen to only accept the racism one.')
