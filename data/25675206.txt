I then usually just fire it up for them for a small conversation right then but then turn it off.  There is nothing wrong with having more than one application.  Hell most of our phones are already running dozens of them.  But at a point you grow weary of them.  I used to use aggregator applications like trillian.  But they always seem to be chasing the breakage or not able to interpolate at all.<p>In a couple of years it will be some other application that will be the top dog.  &quot;Hey what is your ICQ number?&quot;<p>It also depends if you are considered a hub or spoke in your social circles.  If you are a &#x27;spoke&#x27; then getting others to change would be hard.  If you are a &#x27;hub&#x27; you have better success.')
