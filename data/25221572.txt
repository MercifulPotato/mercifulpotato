The point is that engineers who build bridges know that it&#x27;s their responsibility to do everything in their power to make sure it doesn&#x27;t, even if no-one else around them seems to care about that, or specifically asked for it. That they should walk away from a project rather than sign off on one where they will not have the resources or support to do a competent job.<p>The law takes care of that though. The law and inspection. If it was up to the business, any engineers building bridges who would refuse to project it faster because of that would be fired.')
