Fascism was plenty good at deception and bending of truths the first time around, and at this point in the second go around, they&#x27;ve stopped being subtle about it.<p>Remember that a) plenty of people <i>supported</i> the Nazis, and that Hitler&#x27;s party was voted into power, and<p>b) people on the left have been pointing out the proto-fascist rhetoric since Trump&#x27;s first campaign, and moderate liberals are all acting surprised that the neo-fascists are suggesting fascist things (like subverting a democratic election with military force)')
