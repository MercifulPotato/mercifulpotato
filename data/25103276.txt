I loved it.<p>But no, it was stupid. The climate is fucked and I literally had a car where the ECU would inject fuel and cut ignition just to produce the loud BRAP BRAP BRAP noise when changing gears. Literally burning fuel to make a noise and not move the car forward.<p>Like, these two are not mutually exclusive. It was incredibly awesome and incredibly stupid at the same time.<p>For driving experience of course I would pick the AMG over my electric car. But it&#x27;s not a sustainable position to be in.')
