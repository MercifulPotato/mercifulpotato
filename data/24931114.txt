Company had problems with fraudulent stuff and class action suit brought against them.  Outside of whatever their behavior was that triggered the class action, they had poor service to me as an individual, so I&#x27;m not terribly surprised they probably cut many other corners (ethically&#x2F;legally&#x2F;etc).  Anyway... I got my class action settlement checks yesterday.  $71 and $74.  w00t.<p>EDIT: this was more in reaction to &quot;still waiting on those Equifax checks&quot; comment.  Just give it another 10 years...')
