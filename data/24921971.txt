It supports drawing through hardware-backed drivers (e.g., xf86-video-radeon on Xorg), through generic drivers (e.g., xf86-video-modesetting on Xorg) and even through weirder drivers (e.g., xf86-video-nested). It also supports servers other than Xorg (e.g., Xephyr, Xvfb) and many other things.<p>In an ideal world where everything uses KMS or everybody uses something like Xwayland we would be able to kill million of lines of code from the Xserver. While this doesn&#x27;t happen, those millions of lines not exercised by these paths remain unmaintand.<p>Remember, Ajax works for Red Hat, which is trying to push really hard for Wayland on Gnome. They don&#x27;t seem to care about anything graphics-related that&#x27;s not Wayland+Gnome. Red Hat has much more decision power on the Linux community than people imagine it has.<p>A huge problem here is that a lot of efforts that were previously redirected at X11 are now being done on the Gnome compositor, due to Red Hat. We just won&#x27;t get to see a solution to the fragmentation power unless someone with a lot of money decides to play Linux Graphics.')
