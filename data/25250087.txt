Then, having a GitHub username resembling the same pattern jack5588 and also copyright noticing my work by it like so:<p>&quot;Copyright 2020-2021 jack5588&quot;<p>jack2278@something.com (or maybe jack@someremailer.com) will be also my contact email listed on GitHub for the purposes of &quot;proof of ownership&quot;.<p>Will this go down well or is it a stupid idea making a potential employer&#x2F;interviewer raise eyebrows?<p>There&#x27;s another way to pull this off, but I don&#x27;t want to go by a hash:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;7147&#x2F;declaring-copyright-anonymously<p>My intention is having some simple privacy by not being easily searchable&#x2F;identifiable via a search machine. I intend to use my very common real first name though.<p>Note, the [2-9]</i> is because 0 and 1 can be hard to correctly read out.<p>PS: I know Linus Torvalds won&#x27;t let me contribute to his projects at all, if I choose to do that...')
