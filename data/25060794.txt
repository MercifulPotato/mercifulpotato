It basically means if something goes wrong, you loose half your life savings, and potentially half your earning potential forever (until the other partner re-marries).<p>Pre-marital assets are generally not community property, so, no.  You <i>could</i> lose half your during-the-marriage earnings, but you specifically mentioned pre-marital financial assets.')
