Even the &quot;optimized&quot; solution here is so horrible that I almost thought the article was satire when I first read it. Maybe it is.<p>Even if we ignore the fact that it&#x27;s grid to grid conversion, (which should just let you math the answer, without any searching) the fact that all the data is sorted means you can do the equivalent of a merge sort and only have to look at a two point for each step.<p>And how on earth can you take .117 seconds to line up a half a megapixel worth of grid points, even with their &quot;fast&quot; algorithm. They are using the R language which should be fast, right? Are they doing something expensive with it? Or perhaps there is an insane amount of data elsewhere making these lookups super expensive?')
