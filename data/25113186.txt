If you truly understood something, it should be of no problem to explain it to your in-laws. (Ironically, this sentence is condescending..)<p>Overall, I don&#x27;t think I ever thought that someone is condescending when they went to honestly explain something to me.<p>But it depends on the circumstances. Making a mistake and getting someone to explode &quot;why don&#x27;t you understand this simple thing?!&quot; and then having them explain it to you is a miserable experience, for everyone involved.')
