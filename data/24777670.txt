There&#x27;s clearly a problem if people are having to wait <i>that</i> long to vote (to my knowledge it&#x27;s rarely happened here in the UK, and I&#x27;ve never had to queue for more than a handful of minutes when I&#x27;ve voted), but I applaud the fact they&#x27;re willing to wait and how seriously these people are taking their democratic responsibility as citizens. Well done!')
