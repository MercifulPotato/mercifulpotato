That&#x27;s not a vaccine anymore that&#x27;s a strain of SARS-CoV-2 that&#x27;s never produces symptoms, but is still similar enough to the original to prime the immune system. Presumably it would out compete the original in a Darwinian sense, because people who caught it would never get sick and stay home.<p>Risky, though, because if it turns out to be less benign than we thought - or mutates in such a way as to become  lethal - we&#x27;ve just started a second pandemic.')
