A note here is that neither me or my father meet other people. We both use hand sanitizers when we absolutely have to go out and we both live in houses with no other people nearby.<p>Sweden is not like your typical big american city, a lot of swedes live in houses with gardens and of course a lot of us also live in apartments in a city but that is not me and it is not my father.<p>If it were, we would both be wearing masks.')
