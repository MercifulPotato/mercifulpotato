The density of energy production, in watts per cubic meter, is so low that an impractically large volume of confined plasma would be needed, requiring a reactor many times larger than a fission plant for the same power output. But fission-driven power is itself too expensive to produce to justify deploying on its own merits.<p>Furthermore, since the power must be extracted by intercepting high-energy neutrons after they have blasted <i>through</i> the plasma focusing apparatus, such a plant would destroy its most expensive parts in a short time, requiring frequent rebuilding -- by robots, because of induced radioactivity at the work site.<p>There has never been any expectation of practical commercial power resulting from plasma-confinement thermal-neutron fusion projects. Their only plausible budgetary justification is as a jobs program for high-neutron-flux physicists. They are called for by military policy as a population to draw personnel from for weapons work.<p>Coal has always been cheaper than fission. Solar and wind power costs are much less, and continue falling; and numerous viable energy storage methods, all demanding no fundamental research -- gravity (solid and aqueous), underground and underwater compressed air, LH2, ammonia, methane from captured CO2, even powdered iron -- vie only for which will end up cheapest to deploy and operate.<p>If a commercial reactor <i>were</i> ever built and made to work, it would take many decades just to break even on the money already spent to date, before bevinning to pay down its own construction -- even presuming it could find a market for its output. In practice, without continued public subsidy as long as it operated, its debt would continue to grow indefinitely.<p>The only responsible course for the future is to cancel all publicly funded thermal-neutron fusion work, immediately.')
