Just looking at what Biden did as a senator:<p>In 1983 he introduced the Comprehensive Forfeiture Act, which became law in 1984. That&#x27;s the main piece of law that enabled civil asset forfeiture. That&#x27;s how cops take property, alleging it to be drug money without any evidence. It&#x27;s legalized theft, turning cops into gangs that prey on the people. Black neighborhoods are popular targets. Note that &quot;defund the cops&quot; will make them rely more on this source of revenue!<p>In 1994 he introduced the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. This is the infamous law that put many black people in prison for decades, particularly for crack cocaine. (meanwhile his own son smokes crack with impunity, aside from being tossed out of the Navy) Kamala Harris used the law very often as prosecutor. She warned against leniency, saying that she needed the prisoners to fight California wildfires. In other words, she wanted black slaves. It took Donald Trump to fix this problem, with him signing the First Step Act in 2018.<p>It really does seem that the facts are the other way around.')
