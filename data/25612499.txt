Welcome outside of the EU. That&#x27;s been standard since forever over here although it&#x27;s usually the buyer that has to pay for processing.<p>A particularly extreme example was an old camera I bought on Ebay from Germany for like 25€. That was well under the 350 kroner limit for imports so I thought i didn&#x27;t have to pay anything extra other than the relatively high 20€ shipping. \nTurns out the 350 kroner limit also includes the shipping cost so not only did I have to pay ~6€ VAT but also 200kr(~20€) VAT processing fees taking my 25€ camera to 71€.<p>Norway has now completely done away with the 350kr limit so you always have to pay import tax (mainly to stop the flood of cheap 1€ packages from China). I haven&#x27;t done many international orders since then but I believe at least Ebay now collects taxes as an intermediary.')
