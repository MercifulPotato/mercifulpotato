What is &quot;worst case input&quot; when speaking of &quot;expected&quot;.<p>Mathematically, worst case doesn&#x27;t mean a <i>known</i> worst case that works every time. As long as I have an input that the random algorithm has a chance of generating the worst case, it will be O(n^2).<p>From an adversarial standpoint: If I have information about the random algorithm and the seed, I can make exploit it.<p>So yes, even the randomized Quick Sort has worst case of O(n^2)')
