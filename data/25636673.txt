Item(by='mawhidby', descendants=0, kids=None, score=2, time=1609788789, title='Ask HN: Have you tried Shape Up / Six-week Cycles?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='In 2019, Ryan Singer published &quot;Shape Up: Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters&quot;, which details how Basecamp approaches their work. Among some of the topics are six week development cycles, shaping work before it&#x27;s given to a development team to work on, and a betting table where projects for the next cycle are decided upon. This all sounds very compelling, and I&#x27;ve seen some of the same issues they detail as common struggles throughout my career: feeling like projects go on and on, with no end in sight; product managers can&#x27;t find time to thing strategically about the product; leadership asking why features are getting out like they used to in the early days.\nThere have been some blog posts from other companies adopting this in 2017 when Basecamp was writing about six-week cycles, among them Intercom (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intercom.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;6-week-cycle-for-product-teams&#x2F;) and Buffer (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buffer.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;6-week-cycles&#x2F;). There have been other blog posts about the book since it was released, but I&#x27;m curious to hear from the HN community:<p>Have you implemented Shape Up at your company? How has that been going? What have been some of the benefits&#x2F;downfalls?')
