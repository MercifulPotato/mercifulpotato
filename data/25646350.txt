He wouldn&#x27;t use the term &quot;interpret&quot; of course, for excellent and fascinating reasons that I can&#x27;t quickly cram into an HN post, but you can find them in his book The Beginning of Infinity (I was convinced about this area of what he says in the book, not about everything else he says there -- there&#x27;s a LOT of stuff in there!).<p>By the way, I don&#x27;t know whether or not you meant to imply that Deutsch is not a physicist, but he is -- and well known for his work on the fundamentals of quantum physics.')
