Item(by='nirui', descendants=None, kids=[25244179, 25244579], score=None, time=1606644780, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25244046, text='Problem is, the maintenance was for the entire mall with only very little done to your store, and the checkout employee that you mentioned can only do the one job with probably of taking your money as hostage.<p>Also, in a real word mall, the rent and maintenance fee will not increase as you makes more money. Yes, they can try to sell you a better location for a higher price, but it&#x27;s a mutually beneficial sell (You get a better location from the sell).<p>My point: 30% was too much for what Google&#x2F;Apple is providing.<p>Let me also add:<p>&gt; And imagine that you are selling goods with almost zero marginal cost<p>First of all, developing a product costs money, you need to pay everybody including yourself. After all that, advertising, user support etc all costs money. So even if Google&#x2F;Apple wants other people to treat this service as a mall, it&#x27;s not a mall, they don&#x27;t even provide lighting, long bench, air conditioning and free toilet (all of these are inescapably expensive to maintain). Instead, it&#x27;s more like a searchable list + content delivery service where people can search the item and then download it. They should design their fees more close to that.<p>Now, imagine saying this to your user: &quot;Hey dear user, yes, that 30% increase in price won&#x27;t give you any advantage compare to those who directly purchased it from our website. Yes, it&#x27;s expensive just because you brought it from Google&#x2F;Apple, nothing else, because we end up receive the same amount of money.... yes, 30% every month for your subscription, and this is the only approved way for Google&#x2F;Apple to allow us to provide our service to you.&quot;')
