I&#x27;m from a mediocre country where I went to the best CS college and 99% of the things I learned there was from powerpoint presentations, pdf scripts or books full of math exercises. I still got into FAMANG as my first full time job and so did many other people from there. I just never saw the value in our professors. They mostly repeated stuff from text books, had 10 year old lab assignments and similar exams for 20 years. And I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that bad. It teaches you enough of the basics for average programming job or as basis for you to expand into what&#x27;s more interesting to you specifically. The only thing missing was cool projects like having your college develop GHC or stuff like that.<p>Point being, I think college professors overestimate their impact a bit when regarding bachelors&#x2F;masters topics. All that is too basic to really need some expert domain knowledge and is knowledge which hasn&#x27;t really changed that much the last 20 years. SVM&#x27;s were invented in the 90s. Linear algebra some time before that. The rest is industry or postdoc stuff.<p>I get the &quot;teaching&quot; part but if you are &quot;teaching&quot; a room of 50 student&#x27;s it isn&#x27;t really that different from watching a youtube video for them.')
