My guess is the terminology is purely for the little guys, the users who never ran a server themselfes. I used a server a friend&#x27;s friend of mine hosted for a long time before setting up my own and most of the time I got the feeling the users really where a bit jealous of the admins in their own little Kingdom. Now, discord has given all of those people the power to create a kingdom of their own with the press of a button, running somewhere in a datacenter without the involvement it took before.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this point I deem mostly good for the users, abusive admins bullying people where a problem since the bbs times, but the new price is more than I&#x27;m willing to pay. I&#x27;m just so very, very sad that everyone else is for some reason fine with being bullied by discord instead of someone&#x27;s older cousin.')
