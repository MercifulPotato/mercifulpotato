Item(by='lvs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604166770, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24941070, text='&gt; In 1985 the US’s Food and Drug Administration said the likelihood of any health risk from methylene chloride was so low “as to be essentially non-existent”.<p>This is somewhat poorly phrased. Methylene chloride is a neurotoxin and likely carcinogen, but it will be driven off by the roasting process. The boiling point of DCM is 40C, and roasting occurs at 200C, so any residual solvent should be long gone early in the roasting process. Nevertheless, this solvent is destructive to the ozone layer and should be phased out of industrial processes as much as possible.')
