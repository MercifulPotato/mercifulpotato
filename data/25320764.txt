Item(by='yellowapple', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607225359, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25319674, text='&gt; The idea doesn&#x27;t include any kind of automatic stabilization system to set the UBI at a sustainable level.<p>Except it does: land value.<p>This right here is the basis of geolibertarianism, which calls for a minimal government that exists solely to collect LVT and redistribute it directly as UBI.  The UBI distributed should be equal to the opportunity cost externalized by private&#x2F;exclusive land use.  The cap would be a 100% LVT, where all land is leased from society as a whole (or more precisely, this minimal government representing said society).<p>So:<p>&gt; Who decides how much UBI is enough?<p>The land market.<p>&gt; What procedure will that person or body use?<p>The appraisal of the market value of land (sans the improvements upon it, like buildings).<p>&gt; What is the algorithm that prevents UBI increasing without bound?<p>Supply and demand of land.')
