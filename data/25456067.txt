Many of the usual complaints about PHP stem from the old versions, which are indeed far from perfect. I&#x27;m not going to tell anyone it&#x27;s better than something else, but saying it&#x27;s bad because it used to be bad or that a lot of people write awful code in it is disingenuous. I&#x27;ve seen more bad code than good and in all possible languages.')
