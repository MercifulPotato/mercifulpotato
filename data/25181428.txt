I&#x27;m 41 but I feel like, I don&#x27;t know, 26 maybe. But I&#x27;m definitely not. If I was 26 right now, I would probably have instagram, fb, etc... whereas I have no social accounts, except, I suppose HN.<p>I have literally no way of knowing what it would be like to have been born in 1994 instead of 1979... it&#x27;s so crazy how fast things change.
