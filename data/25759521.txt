The multicore TDP of a Ryzen can be as low as 5W per core and as high as 20W per core if you boost it a lot. It&#x27;s purely a matter of what you are setting the frequency to.<p>The M1 core is not that far away. A single core can boost up to 15W or more. The reason why laptops catch up to desktops in single core benchmarks is because their single core power budget is almost exactly the same but every time people act as if there is still a 4x energy efficiency gain left to be exploited when there isn&#x27;t.<p>Idle power is a matter of how integrated your system is. The M1 is highly integrated so it will consume less power just like any other integrated SoC. When people buy desktops they want to get as far away from an integrated system as possible.')
