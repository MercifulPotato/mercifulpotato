There are some companies that just can&#x27;t be bootstrapped, the up-front cost is too high. There are some that would suffer from the high-growth demands of VC.\nIf you&#x27;ve got a plan that starts with high-fixed costs that over time becomes low-fixed cost at scale, then VC is probably the best way to go.\nIf you&#x27;ve identified low-hanging fruit to solve problems for people, bootstrapping makes the most sense.<p>Any arguments for or against seem to imply either way is a one-sized fits all solution.
