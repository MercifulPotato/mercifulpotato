Seems expected that it would be the techie folks consolidating all their friends because they were more willing to use multiple services than the average non-tech user. Even Trillian was fairly niche by comparison, just far less so than Pidgin.<p>Pidgin&#x27;s psychic mode plugin was great fun, though.')
