It was about economic and political integration and competition with the South.<p>Here&#x27;s a very tame source: &quot;The Civil War in the United States began in 1861, after decades of simmering tensions between northern and southern states over slavery, states’ rights and westward expansion.&quot; [ <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.history.com&#x2F;topics&#x2F;american-civil-war&#x2F;american-civil-war-history" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.history.com&#x2F;topics&#x2F;american-civil-war&#x2F;american-c...</a> ]<p>Which of those 3 items you think the North could not care less about (much less go to war for), if it wasn&#x27;t for its economic impact?<p>Continuing from the same source:<p>&quot;In the mid-19th century, while the United States was experiencing an era of tremendous growth, a fundamental economic difference existed between the country’s northern and southern regions. In the North, manufacturing and industry was well established, and agriculture was mostly limited to small-scale farms, while the South’s economy was based on a system of large-scale farming that depended on the labor of Black enslaved people to grow certain crops, especially cotton and tobacco.&quot;<p>The tie with slavery is all about the economy:<p>&quot;Growing abolitionist sentiment in the North after the 1830s and northern opposition to slavery’s extension into the new western territories led many southerners to fear that the existence of slavery in America—and thus the backbone of their economy—was in danger.&quot;<p>And that&#x27;s the general causes. The immediate causes for the declaration of war have even less to do with it, and it was all about the secession of several states - i.e. whether the federal state has control over them or not.')
