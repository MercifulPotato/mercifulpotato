This makes a lot of &quot;scientism&quot;(not scientists) people very angry , but personally my best guess is that &quot;spacetime&quot; will be seen as an evolutionary adaptation, or much more of a morphable cultural construct that is no more real than any other human narrative received through narrow sensegates and molded by fitness filters.<p>This is not an escapism from death, because that prospect can be as absurd or as frightening as death itself. But i am personally leaning more to the side of &quot;the seer keeps seeing&quot; at the moment.<p>The dennet&#x27;esque &quot;lets just explain consciousness away&quot;, western perspective and ultra reductionism has always seemed extremely silly and banal to me - there simply can be no dualism, and the arrogance and narrow mindedness is a huge blindspot. They got everything upside down, - great and useful in one context but useless in another.<p>My own journey started with a deep dive into mediation, then Dzogzhen meditation, lucid dreaming exploration (Dream Yoga), the realization that you can be aware even in deep sleep &quot;like in death&quot;, very absurd, then i became intrigued at GÃ¶dels theorems (via Godel, Escher, Bach ), and lately i have found scientists like Donald D. Hoffman and Bernardo Kastrup much more sane than many of their contemporaries.<p>That Hoffman associates (as in disagrees very much but have debated) with charlatans like Chopra is a bit annoying but looking back i think the western divide between &quot;spirit&quot; and science is fundamentally wrong, most, and i really mean all most all the the biggest thinkers we canonize today were into the weird and ungraspable, it has just been scrubbed from the reductionist retrospective. Also Hoffman really is doing all of the math if you go look at it and ignore the pop cultural shredding machine and even though his radical ideas might be gimmicks as Julian Janes or Hofstadter i think they point to a coming revolution where everything is going to get extremely &quot;weird&quot; in both math and physics.<p>Real insight exists in the liminal, i think.<p>Everything is more cyclical, warpable, field like, emergent, tantra-timelike, archetypal, perspective dependent, interpolated constantly and upside down in any paradigmatic sense.')
