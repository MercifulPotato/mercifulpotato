YouTube has been the master at this market, TikTok too! I think there is plenty of space for more short-form content.<p>Argument 2: No one wants to pay for streaming content. Netflix and Hulu have plenty of varying length content that people willingly pay for.<p>Ultimately, Quibi itself was weird. Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but their marketing strategy was, high end short form content, code for Hollywooy-esque content. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this style of content, but when I watch something short-form, I expect it to keep my attention when I&#x27;m actively holding my phone.<p>YouTube and TikTok content are both edited to be high paced and leave little room for air. That keeps it engaging when you&#x27;re on your phone because you just can&#x27;t look away. If I wanted to relax after a long day, I want to sit on the couch and turn on the TV. That&#x27;s where typical Hollywood content fits in. Lots of space in between spoken dialog, music, and more reflective pacing.<p>Quibi tried to give you TV pacing, but short-form format and ultimately that was rejected in the market.<p>Why on earth didn&#x27;t they test this thesis before blowing through a billion dollars?')
