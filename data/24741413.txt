Personally I think Apple books or Kindle and such are great for novels but they are awful for textbooks or technical books.<p>The question is whether anyone here interested shares my sentiment and would like a service that allows a user to privately start an invite only “class” of 10 users to collectively buy a production quality ebook rendered from the paperback version at flat rate of around $25 per user?<p>I’m really just gauging whether the premise intrigues anyone here—the details of how it would work are less important at the moment. The service would not be large scale, just a hobby business really. I think making otherwise dry or neglected books more illustrated and fun to read is worth the money compared to the crap you find on torrents or online—books can be a large time investment and so the book you choose will determine your learning outcome.<p>Anyways I’m certainly not in it for the money, I would just enjoy the opportunity to refine my craft so to speak. If anyone here just likes the premise of a PDF as a Service I would be glad to hear your feedback. Thanks.')
