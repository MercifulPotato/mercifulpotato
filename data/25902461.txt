Social online games are fostering a toxic &quot;win it or die&quot; mentality that is making children anti-social physically and introvert. Bullying practices just got to the next level with games such as Fortnite, Free Fire, etc.<p>And the industry profits with that by applying psychological gimmicks in their games, the same ones applied by Vegas&#x27; casinos. The problem here is that they are applied on children that are unable to fully fathom the mid-long term consequences of their decisions and that keeps them playing and forgetting the external world. Their mental health is better until the day their parents take away their devices and send them to play outside. Suicide rates doubled over the years. Antidepressants use doubled over the years.<p>Social media by itself is not the problem. How big techs use them to profit (The Social Dilemma) is the problem.')
