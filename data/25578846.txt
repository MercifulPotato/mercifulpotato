For example, I barely know what a Support Vector Machine is, nor could I do a linear regression without a lot of hand holding. But I can design a passable tensorflow model and improve it.<p>It would definitely be very hard to do any meaningful research from this position, but I know enough to be useful (er, or dangerous) and can read papers and code to keep up with recent advancements, and try things out like different convolution designs, layer designs, gates, functions, feedback, etc.<p>(On the topic of reading: Karpathy[1] and Colah[2]&#x27;s posts have a wealth of introductory conceptual information and images in them, and helped our team discussions a lot while we&#x27;ve learned.<p>1 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;karpathy.github.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;karpathy.github.io&#x2F;</a><p>2 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;colah.github.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;colah.github.io&#x2F;</a>)')
