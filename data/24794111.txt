With interest rates at historic lows, there&#x27;s no reason to believe buyers aren&#x27;t going to continue to acquire homes.<p>Now - in other markets? Maybe there will be a correction, but that&#x27;s actually bound to help <i>my market</i> and likely others too, as people move from expensive areas to less expensive areas.
