For High School, I would assume the first may be more important than the latter, and you may have good benefit from teaching FP as a paradigm in a language they are taught elsewhere or might have other reasons to use. You can spend less time teaching syntax and more time focused on patterns&#x2F;practices.<p>Which is to say, maybe start out in Typescript itself? There are a lot of great more functional paradigm-focused libraries out there in &quot;Fantasy Land&quot; [1] and &quot;Static Land&quot; [2].<p>A benefit to starting in Typescript as well would be that you could move to Elm or PureScript if there is time&#x2F;interest and reuse many of the same libraries and&#x2F;or even some of the earlier TS code&#x2F;projects.<p>It obviously seems like a trade-off that using a language that isn&#x27;t &quot;strict&quot; or &quot;native&quot; to the functional paradigm, students might be tempted to avoid learning the functional paradigm and fall back to old habits. But on the other hand, that can still be a useful escape hatch to avoid frustration, especially with High School students who might have enough other stuff on their plates that some leniency might be handy&#x2F;warranted (and for High Schoolers they shouldn&#x27;t have that many &quot;old&quot; habits to fall back on anyway). It could be good teaching praxis to start with &quot;Why did you fall back to doing this imperatively&#x2F;OO&#x2F;what-have-you? Did you try X? What if you explore Y that we discussed in class?&quot; You and the students might learn a lot from dialogs like that.<p>Just some thoughts. There&#x27;s probably no &quot;perfect&quot; language, but sometimes the best language is the one people already know because that gets a lot of the basics out of the way and out of the focus.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fantasyland&#x2F;fantasy-land" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fantasyland&#x2F;fantasy-land</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fantasyland&#x2F;static-land" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fantasyland&#x2F;static-land</a>')
