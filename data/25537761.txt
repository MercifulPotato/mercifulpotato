The best predictor of your target is: your target. In this case it’s predicting who will buy your product. Using a proxy such as income and education is a good start but surely cannot be the best approach because it artificially limits the search space. The best target is some ML-determined combination of features. My guess is that for niche items such as expensive watches and cars, Facebook’s targeting may be too liberal with lower income earners. But I think this the result of being very good at targeting the general audience for medium-low priced goods and services.')
