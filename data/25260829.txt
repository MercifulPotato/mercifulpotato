Doug Mastriano was not presenting legitimate concerns about election fraud. There isn&#x27;t any evidence for such it is literally a smokescreen for a desired takeover of the American government by a hostile minority.<p>The nypost and Mastriano are traitors in the old and simple constitutional sense of conspirators against the legitimate form of government on which all other freedoms hinge. It isn&#x27;t that they are attacking Biden he like all leaders will be a transitory feature in our system of government here today and gone tomorrow. What they are attacking is a democratic form of government by polluting the essential contest by which we choose our leaders with lies about candidates and lies about the process in order to undermine the whole thing.<p>The fact that such actions aren&#x27;t sufficiently clear cut to rise to prosecutable crimes doesn&#x27;t mean we ought to forget their betrayal. It is OK if twitter doesn&#x27;t lend its microphone to Mastriano or the nypost. Let them rent their own website if they prefer. Ntd.com is incidentally a laughable source that nobody ought to credit. For gods sake the story you linked is actually them reporting on a story from the epoch times.  For the record the real and complete story is that twitter NEVER suspended the senators government account and says that it suspended the personal account because someone reported it for impersonating the senator and it was reinstated.<p>Presumably a more reliable source would have included the entire story.')
