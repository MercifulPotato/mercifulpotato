It&#x27;s used in the one time pad which is essentially the &quot;smallest&quot; cryptographic scheme that is perfectly secure (perfectly secure has a mathematical definition in this context, it&#x27;s not saying there can never be any attacks).<p>In general the reason why is that if you have two random variables x and y, where x has any distribution (so for example x could even be &quot;attack normandy on june 6&quot; with certainty) and y is uniformly distributed across all n-bit strings (so it could be any string of n zeros and ones with equal probability), then you can show that x ^ y appears as if it is also uniformly distributed across all n-bit strings as well.<p>Because of this property it&#x27;s used frequently in many higher order methods as well.')
