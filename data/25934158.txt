I really have no knowledge of ratios here but there are at least some processes working against increasing the amount of energy that needs to be expended to heat the surrounds.<p>Additionally, if this fire is mostly underground then it&#x27;s likely that you&#x27;ve got some oven action going on where a lot of the heat produced by the fire isn&#x27;t just whisked away by air to dissipate to nothingness - instead it&#x27;s trapped by the insulation of earth and being converted into phase changes more efficiently.')
