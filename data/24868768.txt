The government reviewed it and agreed.  A random third party (the goodlaw project) forced the government to reconsider and collect the tax retrospectively.<p>I don&#x27;t want to live in a world where a random third party can &#x27;telltale&#x27; on me to the government after I&#x27;ve already been given the go-ahead.<p>In my mind, the correct route for this should be that the third party asks the government to clarify the law, and then Uber is forced to pay VAT from that point forward.')
