But that as a result of a fixed human nature, the mistakes of the past will almost certainly be repeated. As John Gray states “politics is a succession of temporary and partial remedies for permanent and recurring human evil.”<p>In other words, the political traditions we have currently should not be torn down in the name of progress. Further, we shouldn&#x27;t try to overthrow dictators like Saddam or the authoritarian rule in China (the opinion on Saddam is that of John Gray). This is because, as is apparent in Iraq, anarchy may rule. And when it does, it&#x27;s very difficult to reach some level of civilisation and peace.<p>TL DR: It is easy to tear down a spider web, and very hard to rebuild it.')
