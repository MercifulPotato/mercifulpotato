FM radio certainly doesn&#x27;t play the type of music I like.<p>I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll buy some of the songs I had marked in Google Play Music. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll buy all of them or even if I can.<p>Also I haven&#x27;t owned a CD player that connects to a computer in 7 years. Even the gamer PC I just built 2 months ago I didn&#x27;t put a drive in it.')
