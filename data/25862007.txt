It does have a private mode for that, so you could upload your music collection and share it with just a few friends or something.<p>(Edit: I tried funkwhale out as a way to privately share a small online radio station&#x27;s music library with its DJs. It didn&#x27;t suit our needs ultimately -- I felt the UI &amp; search &#x2F; filtering affordances were lacking for our use case -- but you could use it in a hybrid public&#x2F;private way like that if you want. Libraries have some access control features.)')
