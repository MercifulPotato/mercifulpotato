That&#x27;s the current record by argentinian critics in a long 14 days festival. If she&#x27;s really good, and the movies are good.<p>If there are a couple of bad movies a day, you will not be able to watch 5 a day. The advantage to watch it offline, as in a press screening booth, is that you can skip the bad ones immediately. Then you can skim over most entries, typically a big festival has over 200 entries. 60 is a very small one, but a higher possibility of more good movies. Still in 10 days, that would be 6 a day, unheard of.<p>Most critics catch 15-20 films a festival, 2 a day. Better critics do 4 a day. Max 5, maybe on 1-2 good days. \nWith online festivals, as Sundance right now, the numbers go up by a factor of 5. Sundance beats all numbers right now, because you are not limited by movie seats. Currently there are 10.000 ratings in the third day already. The previous festival record was 6.000 for 14 days. People are watching like crazy from their LA and NY homes. Normally 30.000 folks from LA invade this small mountain village for two weeks.<p>And for Sundance or Cannes you don&#x27;t need to win a lottery of 1 over 20.000. You just go there, and watch the movies. In Cannes even for free. At Sundance for 20 bucks if you are a fan only.')
