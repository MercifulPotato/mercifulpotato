If the WSB crowd (and hangers on) runs out of money, then suddenly the buyers left in the general public might think the stock is worth $10 rather than $300 and adjust their orders accordingly.  The result will be no buyers left, plus a lot of retail traders that bought at $250-325 hoping to ride it to the moon and desperate to get out before the price reverses.  Shorts cover easily, at whatever price they name, and longs lose their shirt.<p>I&#x27;m hearing borrow fees are at about 80-100% annualized now.  That works out to around 0.2-0.3% daily, so carrying a $10K position costs you $20-30&#x2F;day, a $1M position costs $2-3K, etc.  Someone with enough money to stomach that kind of risk can easily afford that.')
