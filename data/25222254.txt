It&#x27;s things like integration of asset management tooling, referencing setups and the ability to send data easily between applications and departments.<p>Blender has alembic support which is great for geometry, but its USD support is still nascent and limited to export. Additionally because it doesn&#x27;t use Qt, it&#x27;s hard to integrate tooling that can otherwise be shared between apps. (note there are third party projects to integrate Qt in Blender).\nIt&#x27;s also only recently that Blender has started following the VFX reference platform, which previously meant that all your dependencies and Python code needed to be redone to support Blenders versions.<p>The support for things like OCIO etc is also relatively new.<p>With regards to the Blender foundation and support contracts, it&#x27;s quite different than what a traditional support contract offers.<p>Usually a support contract means you have a dev that responds to your companies needs, where they&#x27;ll support you with custom builds of the software if needed, including back porting patches to your production locked version.<p>The Blender foundation instead takes donations towards development of future versions of Blender and it&#x27;s still very hard to convince them to support specific studio needs. You&#x27;re most likely NOT going to get backports of fixes to a production locked version of Blender.<p>It&#x27;s only recently (2.83) that they&#x27;ve started having LTS releases..<p>----<p>To caveat all of this, I&#x27;m not saying Blender shouldn&#x27;t be used for productions. It&#x27;s very capable. I&#x27;m just providing perspective on why it&#x27;s not finding a strong foothold against incumbents even when it has some very strong on the surface features that Maya doesn&#x27;t for example at an infinitely better price.<p>I have confidence that the Blender foundation are moving in the right direction after what seems to be a cultural and priorities change with 2.80 onwards.<p>Part of the 2.80 changes also brought a lot of outside funding from Epic, Ubisoft, Facebook and more that I believe will help steer Blender well in the future to unseating Maya etc.<p>I don&#x27;t see Blender unseating Houdini anytime soon though.')
