Even against current gen batteries, it can&#x27;t win. Against next generation batteries that will be on the road far sooner then viable hydrogen car it doesn&#x27;t even have chance to compete.<p>The same goes for virtually all commercial land transportation. Maybe if you have some super long distance transport routes into remote areas, but that is likely less then 1% of the market.<p>Its my believe as well that battery electric flight because of its operational efficiency will start to push chemical flight up market and eventually only intercontinental flights will be chemical. There is a clear path to this with current battery developments that are in the pipeline.<p>I don&#x27;t know enough about ships to judge what their requirements are. Maybe there hydrogen or other green manufactured fuels like methanol or dimethyl ether could have a future.<p>However all of this said, hydrogen survives mostly because of massive global governments how somehow fixed on it as a solution. I don&#x27;t know why this is the case, when there are tons of other promising technologies that could fix a lot of things get barely no attention at all. Hydrogen as a &#x27;battery&#x27; for grid level extra energy for energy has many competitors who are mostly ignored. Maybe because oil company have been pushing it as &#x27;the future&#x27; for a long time, but that is getting into conspiracy territory.<p>What really baffles me is that we have government all over the world talking about hydrogen pushing trail programs paying money to oil industry and car makers to set up pilots and so on, at the same time we have companies like Tesla showing a viable way to get to reasonably cheap TWh factories and many other battery startups who barley get any government support at all.<p>There are big research funds for things like Battery 500, or DoD&#x2F;NASA work on Sulfer batteries. There are commercial players monitoring that and working with them, but they don&#x27;t get money to set up huge production of these technologies.<p>So lets continue to do fuel cell and hydrogen at the research level. But all those huge junks of money that they want to use to force down prices are much better invested into battery next generation battery technology, specifically setting up huge factories to build such. Because they replace carbon now, and will continue to do so for the next 30 years.  Land transport and short distance flight, and many ships are clearly ready to be replaced with battery electric transportation, no need for some price hydrogen miracle that will be now-where near ready at mass scale by 2030 to do the same.')
