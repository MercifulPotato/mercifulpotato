U3 is the official unemployment rate, but they report the others as well[1].<p>For U3, you are considered unemployed if you do not have a job, have actively looked for work in the prior 4 weeks, and are currently available for work. U4 is that plus anyone who wants a job, but gave up looking because they don&#x27;t think they will find one. U6 adds in people who only have part-time work but want full-time work.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Unemployment#United_States_Bureau_of_Labor_statistics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Unemployment#United_States_Bur...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;cps&#x2F;cps_htgm.htm#unemployed" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;cps&#x2F;cps_htgm.htm#unemployed</a>')
