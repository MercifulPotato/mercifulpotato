If you had a PhD would you prefer to work as a taxi driver?<p>It&#x27;s a mix of multiple factors:<p>- Some masked racism (usually in form of &quot;needs Canadian experience&quot; meaning for most people: either you spend some time in a cashier&#x2F;cleaning&#x2F;etc job or you aren&#x27;t getting through to us)<p>- Curriculum stuffing&#x2F;PhDs from some smaller countries might not be worth the paper they&#x27;re printed on (which should be easy to sieve in an interview - but a Canadian won&#x27;t go out of the way to help you - not even a bit)<p>- Peculiarities of the Canadian job market (centralization depends on area&#x2F;specialty, etc)')
