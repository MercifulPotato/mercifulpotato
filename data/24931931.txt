Not nuclear weapons, not rogue states, not even asteroids. We could &quot;colonize&quot; an uninhabitable Earth more easily than any other planet. The fact that we could colonize a different planet makes us different from past species in mass extinction events.<p>Human civilization on Earth is founded on the assumption that the environment will be Earth-like.<p>Yes, if we had all of the resources&#x2F;organization we have now, we could &quot;&#x27;colonize&#x27; an uninhabitable Earth&quot; but following a cataclysmic event, we wouldn&#x27;t.<p>As a species, we _might_ survive but even just a nuclear war between say the US and Russia would probably set civilization back by, say, a thousand years.<p>That&#x27;s with current military technology. Weapons don&#x27;t get less dangerous or harder to use over time.')
