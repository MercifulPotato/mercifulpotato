Is what you&#x27;re talking about a data sci&#x27;s responsibility or not? If collecting, analyzing and deploying data in reports or db is too difficult for you, data sci isn&#x27;t for you. I&#x27;m not telling them HOW to do their job. I&#x27;m clarifying that you have to DO the job if you signed up for it. Dont like it? Get out. We all screwed up by taking jobs we didnt like. Nothing wrong with that. Get out of the kitchen if you dont like the heat or the smell.')
