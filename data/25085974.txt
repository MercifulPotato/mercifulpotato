First, the confusion -- &quot;why is everyone calling out my name all of the sudden?&quot;.  Then he shifts his attention back to the conference... &quot;there&#x27;s no way they saw me&quot;.  Then &quot;How did they see me!??!?&quot;.  Then &quot;can I deny this?&quot;  Then eventually... &quot;I think my life is ruined.&quot;  How do you look someone in the eye again, when you know they know?  His life over in an instant, all because he misjudged the line-of-sight from his camera (while making the <i>horrible</i> decision to &quot;relax&quot; while on a work call).  One slip, and his world collapsed.<p>Most of us skate right up to the edge of disaster on a daily basis, and aren&#x27;t even aware of it.
