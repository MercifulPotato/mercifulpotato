The rates parts of NH (e.g. southern) might be higher $ per&#x2F;$1K, but the valuation will be way lower -- your 4 BR cape in Arlington might be valued at $1M, but it&#x27;d be $200K in NH.<p>Up in Merrimack, Sullivan counties in NH, the tax rates are lower than Southern NH.  Towns in MA like Lexington ($15&#x2F;$1K) and Amherst ($21&#x2F;1K) are ridiculous (and have high valuations).<p>(and no, $12K on a $400K house seems outrageous, that&#x27;s like $30 per $1K)')
