Ruby DSL&#x27;s are still just ordinary syntax for method calls and block parameters, there&#x27;s no new syntax at all. Sometimes it can look like it, maybe because ruby method calls don&#x27;t require parentheses? But no library truly adds syntax to ruby, they just define methods that can be called.<p>I am not familiar with elixir, I am curious if what we&#x27;re talking about is an ability in elixir to truly add new syntax, or something more like Ruby so-called &quot;DSLs&quot;.')
