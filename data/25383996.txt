You can&#x27;t buy $AAPL and expect it to 10X on you ten years after Steve Jobs died. Opportunities come and go, and you often have to see several of them before you&#x27;re in the right position to take a swing. When Apple was a huge opportunity, I didn&#x27;t have any money! My dad didn&#x27;t have much either, and I leaned on him to buy an iMac way back in 2001. That $1299 would have been worth $698,467.54 in Apple stock today.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stockchoker.com&#x2F;?s=AAPL&amp;d=20010101&amp;a=1299" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stockchoker.com&#x2F;?s=AAPL&amp;d=20010101&amp;a=1299</a><p>&gt; ideal conditions that happen maybe two or three times in most people&#x27;s lifetime<p>You&#x27;re missing my point entirely. These conditions happen all the time, but most people simply don&#x27;t think the right thoughts. They choose <i>not</i> to think about things that are coming and act accordingly. I&#x27;ve been on both sides of this, and I can see it&#x27;s a matter of knowledge and motivation, not luck.<p>May, 2020: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22970810" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22970810</a>')
