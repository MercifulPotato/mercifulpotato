Item(by='yorwba', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606298021, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25206226, text='&gt; Are languages slowly over generations going away in small european countries?<p>On the contrary, small countries are the ones most likely to keep languages alive.<p>Consider Luxembourg: with less than a million population, they still have their own distinct official language, Luxembourgish (in addition to French and German). If you picked any Luxembourg-sized chunk of Europe and went back 200 years, you&#x27;d find a similar situation with a small community speaking a language as distinct as Luxembourgish is from other official languages in Europe.<p>But the formation of nation states with a centralized compulsory education system also meant compulsory instruction in a standard language, internal migration of people who only speak the standard language and not the local dialect and eventually mass media only available in the standard language. So by now, &quot;one language per country&quot; has become pretty much the norm, with only limited recognition for sub-national languages.<p>Even in Luxembourg, not everyone speaks Luxembourgish (Wikipedia says 50.9%, but that&#x27;s suspiciously also the proportion whose <i>nationality</i> is Luxembourgish, suggesting some confusion between the two concepts). But if I had to choose whether Luxembourg or some random city in Germany is more likely to preserve a distinct language, I&#x27;d definitely bet on Luxembourg.')
