There&#x27;s a proven market for Serverless offerings, so how would people react to a SaaS product that:<p>a) Did database management for you, a la Amazon RDS (perhaps later supporting BYO Cloud Database)\nb) Provided a software programming layer that simplified coding, versioning, deployment and rollbacks of Stored Procedures\nc) Perhaps provided a language environment that lets you program with an SDK in your language of choice, and then &quot;lifted&quot; that into stored procedures<p>My first thought when faced with this is, how do I do application monitoring, logging, exception handling, paging? Perhaps this is a solved problem, but I&#x27;m curious.')
