Static site generators are great for maintaining static sites with many pages that share templates and commonly-reused components, and React specifically is basically an HTML templating language that just also has the ability to run the same code on the client and update the page while it&#x27;s open, which is really useful if you have any dynamic bits on your page. It&#x27;s true there&#x27;s some stuff downloaded and processed on the client that&#x27;s dead weight if you&#x27;re not actually using any dynamic features, but it&#x27;s asynchronously downloaded and the page successfully does its initial render before that and it&#x27;s about the size of an image or a font, so I think worrying about it in most cases is a bit overblown.')
