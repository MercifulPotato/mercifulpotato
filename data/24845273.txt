How do I know which domain to open if I can&#x27;t find it with some search engine or with advertisement. I don&#x27;t think this is limited to Google. Every search engine&#x2F;social network have automated process for blacklisting sites, and there is no human to contact if they blocks your domain. I am yet to see large search engine&#x2F;scale social network which provides reason for low views to the owners&#x2F;posters.')
