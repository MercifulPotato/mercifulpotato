In fact Minnesota&#x27;s per-capita rate of COVID deaths just surpassed Sweden&#x27;s even though they&#x27;ve done much more in the way of lockdowns. Seem to be some confounding variables at play here besides &quot;are you locked down or not?&quot;<p>&gt; They can in fact simply decide &quot;I&#x27;m done&quot; walk off the job and go live in a cabin.<p>This is a fantasy scenario. Most nurses are probably in no financial position to do this and leaving to find another job is a dicey prospect right now. I agree that we should not put the hospitals or their staff under undue stress which is why it&#x27;s such a crime that COVID is being used for cover to furlough staff and impose budget cuts.<p>The degree of hospital overcrowding seems overstated at the moment: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;tlowdon&#x2F;status&#x2F;1334565211148152832" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;tlowdon&#x2F;status&#x2F;1334565211148152832</a>')
