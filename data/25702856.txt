I would be opposed if every newspaper was required to post whatever the president wanted.<p>The necessity of communication to the the people should be filled with an official government website that isp&#x27;s have to allow access too or something. And the president should only be able to use that when acting as the president not campaigning etc.<p>Two issues that make this look worse are the idea that the president needs Twitter or even Facebook to communicate to people. And that the president acts solely as the president on the platform. Neither of these are really true.')
