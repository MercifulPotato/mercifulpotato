It doesn&#x27;t take too much time nor too much effort for any self-examining historian to understand that you can&#x27;t create a &quot;right impression&quot; of history at the level of the general public. It will always be partial, truncated, falsified. Your cherry-picked period is misunderstood by the general public ? Too bad, that&#x27;s part of the job. The best you can hope is making somebody interested enough that someday they&#x27;ll have to reflex on historiography, philology and epistemology.')
