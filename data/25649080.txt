Item(by='Wowfunhappy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609871734, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25648290, text='&gt; Kids don&#x27;t give a shit about walking to school in the dark. I know, as someone who was recently a kid and resented winter &quot;daylight wasting time&quot;, I would much rather have had more hours of daylight in the afternoon when I was finished with school and could actually do fun stuff outside, rather than useless daylight in the morning while I&#x27;m sitting on the bus or in a classroom at 7:30 AM. And as an adult I feel the same about work.<p>I was actually thinking of &quot;walking to school in the dark&quot; as a safety issue. You and I probably live in safe communities, but not everyone does. And, sadly, the same communities that have more crime are frequently the ones less able to afford services like school buses.<p>But I also think a lot of kids and adults don&#x27;t actually want what they think they do with regard to DST. Having more daylight in the evening seems appealing, and it&#x27;s what I wanted when I was youngerâ€”but then I was in a situation where I had to get up an hour earlier in the winter. It&#x27;s not fun.')
