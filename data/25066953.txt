Given that you used a piped command in the terminal to search your Linux distribution for mp3s, I&#x27;d say you&#x27;re in fact one of the very Silicon-Valley types you mention.<p>I can&#x27;t think of anyone in their 20s with whom I interact who don&#x27;t use Spotify, personally. It&#x27;s all I see amongst the younger colleagues at work. Of that age group outside of work, everyone&#x27;s &#x27;year in review&#x27; music summaries on social media are spotify-generated, and everyone who sends me &#x27;hey check out this song&#x27; links are sending them for Spotify (with a few youtube videos I guess).<p>I&#x27;m sure there are people, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but Spotify seems so ubiquitous amongst everyone I know who is in their 20s (even at arm&#x27;s length) that I definitely believe my library of mp3s and player make me a product of my age and the odd one out.')
