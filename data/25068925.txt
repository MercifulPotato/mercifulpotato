Item(by='jstummbillig', descendants=None, kids=[25071885], score=None, time=1605182788, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25068834, text='&quot;Automatic Inlining of Fonts&quot; seems like a pretty huge deal to me (considering, of course, that the framework is stable and huge stylistic changes like react hooks are in fact not what you want out of a stable framework but mostly a display of its immaturity â€“ even if the feature itself is great). Do any of the competitors include something similar?')
