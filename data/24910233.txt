How do you know they paid the right amount? I turn and show you my receipt, and you hope it&#x27;s not faked?<p>The answer is they don&#x27;t do that - and they do it the other way around.  The user shows THEIR QR code to the merchant (or automated kiosk).<p>Which means they still need a terminal - and it&#x27;s going to be slower than NFC.<p>And NFC works when my battery dies.')
