It seems to fit with the product. Unfortunately, the cult-route they went with produced a busy page with lots of animation that distracts the reader. Also, overlapping headings with animations and changing colors immensely reduces readability.<p>If it weren&#x27;t overly animated and the headings were legible, this design might actually be pleasantly nostalgic. But in its present state, it makes me wish for old radicle, when it was built on ipfs and had no GUI. The overt use of animation is exactly how I tend to think of unnecesary GUIs.')
