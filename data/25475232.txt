We terminated the host accounts associated with certain of these meetings.<p>And about sharing information on dissidents with the government,<p>&gt; While the complaint alleges that the former employee obtained Zoom account and user IDs associated with the Xinjiang region of China, our investigation shows that this data was anonymized, and at this time we do not have reason to believe that it was shared with the Chinese government.<p>This is hard to believe given how difficult it is to operate any company in China without very close ties with the CCP.')
