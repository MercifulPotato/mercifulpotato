I would not expect something like that to be responsible for more than, say, a 5-10% RAM usage decrease though.</i><p>I think you can reach a lot more than that. Presumably, on Intel they use something like LZO or LZ4, since it compresses&#x2F;decompresses without too much CPU overhead. But if you have dedicated hardware for something like e.g. Brotli or zstd, one could reach much higher compression ratios.<p>Of course, this is assuming that memory can be compressed well, but I think this is true in many cases. E.g. when selecting one of the program&#x2F;library files in the squash benchmarks:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quixdb.github.io&#x2F;squash-benchmark&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quixdb.github.io&#x2F;squash-benchmark&#x2F;</a><p>you can observe higher compression ratios for e.g. Brotli&#x2F;gzip&#x2F;deflate than LZO&#x2F;LZ4.')
