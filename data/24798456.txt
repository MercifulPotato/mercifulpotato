I read through the whole thing, including the emails he shared. Some snippets below for folks who may not read the whole thing.<p>The people we let go had joined because they believed in our product and mission. They had done nothing wrong, yet suddenly there was no longer a place for them. I remember letting go of someone I had known since college. She turned to me and said, “I took this job over something that paid more, and now what should I do?” These agonising decisions kept me up at night for weeks, and I know it was much harder on those affected.<p>That group of professional challenges was more difficult than anything else I’ve faced in my career. At the time, I told a teammate that it felt like I was playing seven-dimensional chess because of the complexity of the negotiations combined with so many conflicting challenges at work.<p>I was also juggling personal challenges that were far more stressful than the hurdles at work.\nIt started with absolutely brutal fertility issues that my wife and I went through, beginning in 2016. \nOne of those tests revealed unexpected, terrifying information. I was diagnosed with cancer. I only remember a pair of words from the first conversation with my doctor: “two tumors”.<p>For the next several months, my emotions would sometimes pour out in a tidal wave of tears and yelling. Anger, frustration, fear, confusion — there were so many feelings to contend with.<p>I worried that the team would use my diagnosis as an excuse to throw in the towel, that my health would become a distraction, cause the company to fail and make things that much worse.<p>To this day, I cry every time I go to the cancer center at Stanford.<p>I hadn’t had a headache in 20-plus years and now I couldn’t go through a full day without experiencing crippling pain in my head.<p>By the end of 2017, I was completely worn out.<p>Persistence was my superpower. But now I’ve now come to understand that persistence is a double-edged sword, and my decision not to take a break, to not take more off my plate, hurt me, my family and the company. That was the biggest mistake of my career.<p>depression and burnout can make even small challenges feel like a big deal.<p>I had gotten to a place where I only focused on the losses and couldn’t accept positive things.<p>my daughter looked at me and said, “Daddy, you always look so sad”. She was five. It was the push I needed to change.<p>A successful and healthy transition requires one to live in the nothingness between the end of one period and the beginning of another.<p>FINALLY HIS FIRST EMAIL(feedback to the board member) IS AN EXCELLENT READ.')
