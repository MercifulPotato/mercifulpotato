Thanks to them we have other car makers pushing against right to repair as well.<p>Because of the current right to repair in Massachusetts (I think the only state) they have to provide the service manual. However, they make you pay $100 per day and it&#x27;s online only with all kinds of measures to prevent you from downloading it.<p>Any other car&#x27;s service manual can be picked up in the store for a reasonable price.<p>If you no longer own a car they should not be allowed to sell it to you. Make it lease only and if it breaks, they need to deal with it, like a cable box.')
