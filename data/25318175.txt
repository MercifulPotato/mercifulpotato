For every instance of corruption you&#x27;ve listed, the outlet in question can still report on something else that others won&#x27;t. That&#x27;s the marketplace of ideas. Attacking each one for being imperfect on its own diminishes the chances that a given piece of information will be reported in the future.<p>Now of course that doesn&#x27;t mean you should blithely <i>believe</i> what they say, or think you&#x27;re getting the whole picture from any one. But they do all collectively form the press.')
