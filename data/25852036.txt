In fact we&#x27;ve not had to push hard on sales due to our customers calling former colleagues who moved to a competitor to tell them &quot;you have got to get this software&quot;. Having great support has been key to this experience.<p>Most of our support people have been recruited from our customers, so they know not just our software well but the processes and regulations around it, allowing them to quickly understand the issue at hand and offer relevant help.<p>So while it might look like a cost center on paper, I&#x27;m quite certain it&#x27;s a massive net gain overall.<p>Of course as you say, we work hard to mitigate the cost of providing that support, like routinely looking at implementing changes that&#x27;ll reduce repeat support issues. Maybe as simple as reworking a dialog text, to adding more automation.')
