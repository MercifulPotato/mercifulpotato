Is the <i>Debug^2</i> framework publicly available? Any chance it will find its way into the test suites of the debuggers?<p>&gt; Our framework feeds random source programs to the target toolchain and surgically compares the debugging behavior of their optimized&#x2F;unoptimized binary variants.<p>I thought this had the flavour of John Regehr&#x27;s work, and sure enough, they&#x27;re using <i>C-Reduce</i>.<p>An interesting somewhat related paper about automatically exposing bugs in C compilers, by Regehr et al: <i>Finding and Understanding Bugs in C Compilers</i>, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.utah.edu&#x2F;~regehr&#x2F;papers&#x2F;pldi11-preprint.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.utah.edu&#x2F;~regehr&#x2F;papers&#x2F;pldi11-preprint.pdf</a><p><i>edit</i> I missed the author&#x27;s comment in this thread that <i>Releasing the software is a step we are discussing.</i> Please do release the framework, ideally under a standard Free and Open Source licence.
