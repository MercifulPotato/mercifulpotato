When confronted with questions about the violence on 1&#x2F;6 you responded with references to the violence perpetuated by BLM protesters.<p>Correct, I was comparing <i>the violence in general</i>. This is different than your original claim that I was comparing BLM property damage to the Capitol Hill murder.<p>&gt; As far as I have seen, there were no murders committed by BLM protesters as part of any protests, riots, or whatever you want to call them. Even in this post you are still referring to &quot;BLM murders&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m thinking of incidents like Michael Forest Reinoehl (Antifa). He murdered a right-wing activist and was very explicit that he did it because he believed the right-wing was a threat to Black lives. In any case, we&#x27;re not going to learn much by looking at the outlier instances of violence; in both cases there are much more uniform trends of lesser degrees of violence spanning from trespassing to property damage to assault. All I&#x27;m asking (indeed, all anyone is asking) is that we hold BLM rioters to the same standard as MAGA rioters, BLM assailants to the same standard as MAGA assailants, etc.<p>&gt; protests, riots, or whatever you want to call them<p>To be quite clear, I&#x27;m distinguishing between the protesters (and protests) who are by definition peaceful and rioters (and riots) who are by definition violent.<p>&gt; And like I said previously, we are already comparing millions of people protesting over months in cities around the country to thousands of people in one city protesting on one day. There were vastly more opportunities for violence at the BLM protests and yet the only person to person violence seen appears to be in response or initiated by people on the other side.<p>The murder is an outlier, you can&#x27;t conclude on the basis of this single event that the broader group is uniformly more dangerous. I don&#x27;t know what value there is in even trying to compare how dangerous either group is; what&#x27;s important is that we&#x27;re holding violence to the same standard and not glorifying some violence and condemning others on political grounds.<p>&gt; One was much quicker to instigate violence against people.<p>What? How do you get there? There were tons of assaults recorded on camera during the BLM protests going back to probably 2014 including many unprovoked assaults. In ~2016 one guy went on a killing spree, explicitly targeting white police officers (and as I recall, WaPo or someone released a sympathetic portrait article rationalizing the mass murder). I don&#x27;t have tremendous sympathy for MAGA folks, but there&#x27;s half a decade of clips of people getting the shit beat out of them for wearing a MAGA hat in the wrong place, virtually none of which featured prominently in the media.<p>Again, this isn&#x27;t about which group is more violent, it&#x27;s about consistency. Even if MAGA folks are more violent, it doesn&#x27;t justify us completely letting BLM violence off scot free. If you (universal) failed to condemn years of BLM violence, you have very little credibility to demand justice for an afternoon of MAGA violence.')
