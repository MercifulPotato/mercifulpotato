I don&#x27;t store cookies or any PII data at all so by definition, it&#x27;s hard to distinguish between two different visits - are they from same person or different people?<p>An alternative approach is used by Simple Analytics - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.simpleanalytics.com&#x2F;uniques" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.simpleanalytics.com&#x2F;uniques</a> where they use referrer header to derive unique visits. They mention that they don&#x27;t use IP addresses as they&#x27;re considered fingerprinting.<p>But it looks like a hash function (whose salt gets rotated daily) strikes a good balance between fingerprinting while maintaining user privacy. Any downsides to this approach?')
