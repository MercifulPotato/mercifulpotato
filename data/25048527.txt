You almost always will get more even if the startup hits, which is rare.<p>Of course plenty of people <i>prefer</i> to work at startups because the environment is more fun and you have direct influence on what ships and often direct contact with customers.<p>Remember when Google suddenly gave an across-the-board 10% raise to every employee to try to stave off defections to startups?  Sure, there are certain jobs that are fun (depending on your interests) and of course it&#x27;s easy to find &quot;phone it in&quot; positions at FB and Google, but most of my friends avoid FAANG or are glad they left.<p>Once your comp hits $X there&#x27;s more to life than money.')
