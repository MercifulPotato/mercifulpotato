Finally fed up, I recently had a generator installed that attaches to the natural gas line.<p>I know that purchase was effective, because a week after it was installed there was a big storm and power went out everywhere <i>except</i> my neighborhood. Just having a generator successfully wards off power failure, you never have to actually turn it on.<p>I submit this is objective proof that I am living in a simulation and none of you exist, you&#x27;re just artifacts of the simulation.')
