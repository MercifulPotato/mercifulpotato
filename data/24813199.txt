I do recommend getting the Pro version as it makes that stuff more easily configurable.  Some people will take issue with that, but for me as a power user it&#x27;s worth it to have that additional control over something I use all day every day.<p>ETA: I use linux and MacOS at work, and linux is quite good for that.  I find MacOS infuriating though - worse than Windows even for basic window and file management functionality, and worse for configurability.')
