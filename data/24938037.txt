Many ADC&#x27;s nowadays also have built in anti-aliasing filters, and can be quite cheap. Likely the easier and cheaper option with better results for most basic applications.<p>Still a basic RC filter as the op mentioned can quiet the higher frequency pops from Arduino circuits. Many applications benefit from a 16bit ADC if only to get a clean 14bits out. For those curious about the problem, here&#x27;s a short write-up on aliasing:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;e2e.ti.com&#x2F;blogs_&#x2F;archives&#x2F;b&#x2F;precisionhub&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2015&#x2F;09&#x2F;04&#x2F;aliasing-in-adcs-not-all-signals-are-what-they-appear-to-be" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;e2e.ti.com&#x2F;blogs_&#x2F;archives&#x2F;b&#x2F;precisionhub&#x2F;archive&#x2F;20...</a>')
