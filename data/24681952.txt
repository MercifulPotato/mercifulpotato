I would like to insist more on the false &quot;industry vs. academia&quot; dichotomy, that was mentioned at the end of the post. I was asked the same question at the end of my PhD: &quot;Do you want a one-way ticket to academia, or a one-way ticket to industry?&quot;<p>After 8 years of back-and-forth, I settled on both.  I think this should be the norm. Professors should take a break from paper writing to work on a startup and&#x2F;or be in industrial board meetings to know what to research next.<p>I have so many friends that kept a foot in both industry and academia. I find the model very valuable.')
