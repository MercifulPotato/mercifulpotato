Because patreon.com has a bunch of seemingly pointless clicks for posting content.<p>Here&#x27;s the step-by-step for posting a video from the creator page:<p>1. Click on Posts in the sidebar. An animation creates a dropdown - this frequently stutters even on a reasonable desktop and creates a small delay.<p>2. Click on New. This loads a new page where you can select a post type.<p>3. Click on Video. This loads another new page where I can select Vimeo or Add URL.<p>4. Click on Add URL. This immediately creates a textbox under the button that I can paste a URL into. I can set a title, tags, additional content and post it.<p>---<p>Compare this to uploading a video to Youtube:<p>1. Click on Create. This immediately opens a dropdown.<p>2. Click on Upload video. This opens an upload video box that you can click on to open a file upload dialog or you can drag a file onto it. If you&#x27;re on the Youtube frontpage then there&#x27;s a page load in this step, but if you&#x27;re on the Creator Page, then there&#x27;s no page load.<p>3. While the file is uploading you can fill in the title etc and even press Publish immediately (while it&#x27;s still uploading).<p>I understand that the two cases aren&#x27;t equivalent, but the experience of posting content feels better on Youtube. I think in terms of UX something like imgur or streamable are great examples.<p>Edit: I was overly harsh at first. It&#x27;s just a part of UX that has consistently annoyed me with Patreon. Overall it&#x27;s decent, but these small things make it <i>feel</i> worse than it is.')
