Politicians are doing crazy stuff and reversing direction 24 hours later all over the world because that&#x27;s what public health &quot;experts&quot; are doing. The WHO is notorious for it, they have routinely made contradictory announcements within days or weeks of each other in 2020 and this will probably continue in 2021. Public health is just making it up as they go along and this is reflected through politicians, who basically just do whatever they&#x27;re told by their &quot;expert&quot; committees even if it makes them look foolish.<p>gov.uk is run by software engineers, presumably pretty good ones. They make decisions based on data and know how to interpret it.<p>One thing that has become super clear to me in 2020 is the huge quality gap between CS culture and public health culture, at least in research. Public health research papers and especially epidemiology papers contain not just severe errors all the time but are flat out deceptive in ways I just never see in the output of CS research or the software industry. For example I never encounter bogus citations in CS papers but that happens all the time in epidemiology papers. Public health research superficially looks and feels like science but when you scratch the surface the scientific method has gone AWOL, good data practices have gone AWOL, basic logic and integrity has gone AWOL. It&#x27;s just a disaster zone.')
