Part of reforming yourself is attempting to undo the damage that you have caused in the past. And so part of that reformation would inherently have to be, retracting or attempting to undo the damage caused by those public statements.<p>&gt; A different way to put this would be: Is it possible to reform yourself and not try to undo the damage of your past actions in some way? Are you truly reformed if you wave your hand and do not take responsibility for them?<p>is not at all similar to this:<p>&gt; Can you really become a better person if you haven&#x27;t attempted to undo harm you caused? If you have changed, part of that change is acknowledging that you harmed people, and how those actions were harmful. You can&#x27;t acknowledge that you have harmed people, and then handwave that harm by ignoring it, and still say you are a changed person.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s inherent to self-improvement that you would want to undo the harm that you have caused, if you understand it.<p>&gt; And if you don&#x27;t, then can you be said to have improved?<p>Because to me they are relatively close retellings of the other.')
