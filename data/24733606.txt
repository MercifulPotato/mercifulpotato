Item(by='xyzzyz', descendants=None, kids=[24734165], score=None, time=1602272265, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24733334, text='&gt; It&#x27;s unfortunate discussions can&#x27;t be kept over ideas and policies instead of veering towards persons.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a matter of ideas vs persons. Already I hear that speech and ideas are violence, and violence requires fighting back (by complaining to HR that you made them feel unsafe). Of course, you cannot keep quiet either, because &quot;silence is violence&quot; too.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s unfortunate discussions can&#x27;t be kept over ideas and policies instead of veering towards persons.<p>This is a sensible expectation, and I think that&#x27;s what reasonable people should be able to do. However, my experience tells me that there&#x27;s nothing to win by having such conversation in work environment, so I&#x27;d prefer them to be avoided altogether. However, both the company as an institutions, and many individuals working on it, are insisting that the employees have these discussions, no matter how irrelevant it is for the actual job. This is the reality on the ground in most big US tech corporations.<p>&gt; I feel for people that suddenly need to discuss such topics, it means that they probably don&#x27;t have IRL friends or friends outside of work if they really feel that they have to talk about no-work related issues at a work lunch. It&#x27;s sad.<p>I don&#x27;t think that this is the case. In my experience, it&#x27;s the more social people who are insisting on having these conversations. I think this is because the more social people are better at gauging social climate, and the purpose of these conversations, often purportedly about diversity and inclusion, is to enforce uniformity and exclusion of people with alternative views.')
