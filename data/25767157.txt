That&#x27;s the problem. With x86 you pretty much can say &quot;we&#x27;re targeting processors made after 2010&quot; or whatever and that&#x27;s that. You make one binary and it works.<p>RISC-V allows a combinatorial explosion of possible CPUs. You can have a CPU that supports extension X and not Y, but another one that supports Y and not X.')
