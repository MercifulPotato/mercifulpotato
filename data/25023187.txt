Same reason why you don&#x27;t need to engineer an SMPS, you buy a module (if you are a hobbyist) or buy a chip and read the application notes (if you are making a product).<p>If you are just gluing modules together, then just get the SMPS module and save yourself the weight. If you think you need a linear power supply, then why do you need a linear power supply if you <i>don&#x27;t</i> need a linear amplifier? Just seems odd.')
