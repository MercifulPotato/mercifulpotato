You can&#x27;t be so na√Øve as to believe that this enforcement action won&#x27;t result in prison for some, destroyed lives for others, and because laws and enforcement are man-made, there&#x27;s also a guarantee that your dragnet will punish some innocents, and let some guilty go (maybe because they can afford great lawyers and&#x2F;or bribes). And of course, because this would be a very controversial measure, it would be highly politicized.')
