Item(by='paganel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603741828, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24896650, text='&gt; the romance of technology close.<p>That&#x27;s the thing, after 15 years of doing this as a job (and after a few illuminating books on the subject) I found out that there&#x27;s not that much &quot;romance&quot; about this industry, and more than that, I often ask myself &quot;are we the baddies?&quot; (like in the famous YT video [1]). For my current peace of mind it helps that my present job is nothing big, nothing that wants &quot;to change the world&quot; through technology (presumably for the worst).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hn1VxaMEjRU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hn1VxaMEjRU</a>')
