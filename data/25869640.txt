They suck all the air out of the room and prevent others from innovating.<p>&gt; Loon didn&#x27;t fail, Google&#x2F;Alphabet just decided they were going to discontinue funding. Now they hold a pool of patents they don&#x27;t intend to do anything with. Now they will point that funding elsewhere and do the same.<p>They did EXACTLY what you are asking for the last X project that was sunset.<p>From <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.company&#x2F;projects&#x2F;makani&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.company&#x2F;projects&#x2F;makani&#x2F;</a>:<p>&gt; In 2020 Makani’s journey as a company came to an end. To share the lessons and insights the Makani team gained from their 13 year journey developing an entirely new kind of wind energy technology, the team created The Energy Kite Collection, a portfolio of resources including a technical report, Makani’s entire avionics, flight controls and simulation code repositories, flight logs for every crosswind flight of the M600 prototype, technical videos, a new simulation tool called KiteFAST created with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and a non-assertion pledge for the free use of Makani’s worldwide patent portfolio.')
