Even with UE4, people end up learning C++ because there&#x27;s only so much you can do with the Blueprint flowcharts before it becomes an unmaintainable mess that grinds your development speed to the ground. It&#x27;s also pretty much a law of nature that every nontrivial game eventually develops a scripting language (unless it&#x27;s already written in one, e.g. Python).<p>But it&#x27;s absolutely true that you can teach artists to code - within the limited domain - much easier than you can teach programmers to draw or write stories.<p>A personal opinion: I&#x27;m not entirely sure that being entirely art-driven is necessarily a good direction for games either. You can build a pretty game out of default UE4&#x2F;Unity&#x2F;Godot building blocks, but it&#x27;ll be rather quickly recognized as a cookie-cutter game with custom art. If you want to innovate on, or even carefully tune, the gameplay itself, you need to code your way out of engine defaults.')
