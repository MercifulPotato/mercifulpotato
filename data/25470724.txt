A few years back I switched from Visual Studio + ReSharper to Rider, and haven&#x27;t looked back - it&#x27;s such a fantastic, fully-featured, stable product. I have a personal license that let&#x27;s me use ReSharper, Rider, dotCover, dotMemory (love this!), dotTrace. Some of the best money I&#x27;ve ever spent, and I happily renew year on year. I also love the pricing model that reduces the cost after years 1 and 2 as a loyalty bonus.<p>And in the main, JetBrains actually seem to pay attention to what customers ask for in their online feedback site.<p>I&#x27;m looking to get into either Go or Rust soon, and I&#x27;ll definitely be using GoLand&#x2F;CLion.')
