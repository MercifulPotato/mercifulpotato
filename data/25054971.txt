Since it doesn&#x27;t have the full housing around the USB-A connector, it tends to have a bit of motion in the port. Its not even that the device is flexing, its pushing on the pins on the USB port more or less as it moves. I can&#x27;t speak for the USB-C version, as I don&#x27;t have one and I don&#x27;t suppose it has that same thing going on.')
