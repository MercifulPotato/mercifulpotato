Nothing I&#x27;ve found from a hedge fund is even remotely close to crying foul... but here&#x27;s a collection of quotes<p>Citron research (not a hedge fund, but one of the parties that had a large short position) put out the following video generally supporting redditors and wsb: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=yS4yPsmaDDQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=yS4yPsmaDDQ</a><p>Melvin Captital (Hedge fund that took a big hit), as far as I can tell, has not put out any substantial statement, but none of what I can find that they did put out is crying foul. Examples of what I can find include &quot;The social media posts about Melvin Capital going bankrupt are categorically false&quot;, &quot;&quot;Melvin Capital has repositioned our portfolio over the past few days. We have closed out our position in GME (GameStop)&quot;<p>The only statement I can find from Citadel (hedge fund that invested in Melvin) is from their CEO, saying &quot;Gabe Plotkin and team have delivered exceptional results over the history of Melvin. We have great confidence in Gabe and his team&quot;.<p>Point72 (another hedge fund investing in Melvin to bail them out - and who already had $1 billion under management with Melvin) had their chairman say &quot;I&#x27;ve known Gabe Plotkin since 2006 and he is an exceptional investor and leader. We are pleased to have the opportunity to invest additional capital and take a non-controlling revenue share in Melvin Capital,&quot;. I haven&#x27;t found anything else.')
