He is not only a Benedictine monk, he is also a very reputable scholar and has been an executive director of the Hill Museum and Manuscript library since 2003 that has Harvard, Yale and Oxford University as his alma mater. Heck, I cannot even think of anybody else that has more credential than him in the Greek and Latin manuscripts as being maintained by the monasteries [1].<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Columba_Stewart" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Columba_Stewart</a>')
