The facts stand on their own. There is of course a separate discussion to be had on the value of ritual slaughter to an individual or group’s religious expression, but I think that needn’t be considered in order to determine that animal killing according to kosher laws is not an inhumane method of killing an animal, and it’s rules of slaughter were among the first and most enduring form of an animal welfare.<p>Also tangential to this entire conversation is the merit&#x2F;morality of animal consumption whatsoever, and whether it can be morally defended in the modern context, but I think that’s also best left for another day.')
