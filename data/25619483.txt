Stop the war because there is a US citizen there ? \nIf you are a reporter, your chances of getting killed in a battle by a stray bullet is much biggger than getting hit by a coordinated US attack. And if you do not want to take that risk, get the hell out.\nAnd you want US to disclose the military attack plans because of your recklessness. Well, I am sorry for you but you have to bear the consequences of your own decisions. Nobody will cater to your pompous ass claims.')
