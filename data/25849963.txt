I thought using a strong unique password was enough but of course this is not the case nowadays.<p>One thing I feel is a must is use MFA everywhere. Unfortunately not every service supports it.<p>Other is fwd all your emails to one point. I could have easily prevented the huge bill had I not used a very old email that I don&#x27;t check anymore. So lesson is even if it a yahoo address make sure to fwd it.<p>Also this isn&#x27;t big but every time you signup for a free trial mark the thing physically on a calendar. I have been charged recurring subscriptions so many times after trial expires.<p>What else comes to mind?')
