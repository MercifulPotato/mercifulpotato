And they shouldn&#x27;t be denied access to that treatment (like they are now) because addicts and corrupt doctors misused the product. Addicts deserve sympathy and compassionate treatment, but we shouldn&#x27;t ban an entire class of useful medications because of the addicts&#x27; misuse (eg, we don&#x27;t ban cars because some people drive drunk).<p>If you&#x27;ve never known serious chronic pain, all I can tell you is that it&#x27;s a different world than the one I knew before I got sick.')
