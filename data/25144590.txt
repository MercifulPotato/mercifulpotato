We pretty much always study specialisations of tensor algebras, of which GA (or more generally Clifford algebras) are an example.<p>There are no interesting formulas in a tensor algebra, because the whole idea of it being “most general” (every other algebra is a quotient) is that it has no relations. It is only when passing to more specific algebras (symmetric, exterior, GA, ...) that the subject really becomes interesting.')
