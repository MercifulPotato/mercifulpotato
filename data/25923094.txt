But this actually has no driver, no user-space, no file system. It receives boot parameters and communicates over TCP or UDP. Mmmm I&#x27;d call that a program that receives command-line parameters and communicates over the network. But &quot;program&quot; sounds a lot less exciting than &quot;unikernel&quot;.<p>It does not even manage memory or processes or anything like that. It uses a thin C wrapper to load on virtual machines or . Just like you could with any program that does use any OS facilities.<p>It does not have process, praising cooperative multi-tasking over multi-threading or multi-processing. Cooperative multi-threading means every part of your system is dependent on every other part behaving correctly to yield the CPU at short interval. Mis-design any single algorithm in the system to be quadratic or worse and you can have long, unpredictable scheduling delays. Forget doing anything requiring real-time responses. Even semi-regular response times are not guaranteed under cooperation.<p>You could achieve the same goals with a statically linked program in any languages...')
