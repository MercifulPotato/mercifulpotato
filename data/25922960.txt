A company I work with has clients who sign agreements annually, so their standard deprecation period is... one year. If people are building commercial products or internal tools on your API, you&#x27;ve got to give them longer IMO.<p>Also it makes sense to phase deprecation. Start by no longer issuing new API keys. If your API has a messages or comments field in the return object, you can add a notice that it&#x27;s deprecated with a link to the new API to discourage new development.<p>The biggest thing (IMO) is to make the transition process painless. If there&#x27;s functionality that v1 has that v2 doesn&#x27;t, users who like that functionality will cling to v1. If there&#x27;s an endpoint in v1 with no clear equivalent in v2,  that&#x27;s gonna slow adoption unless there&#x27;s a clear transition process documented somewhere.')
