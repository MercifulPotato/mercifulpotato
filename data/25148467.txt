Item(by='forest_dweller', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605785633, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25136342, text='Dusk is an amazing game. The gun, movement and general mechanics of the game are solid. The action is solid and the level and enemy design is great.<p>There are quite a few “wow” moments in the game.<p>For those that like these games I also recommend Amid Evil. The game is excellent and well worth a look for many of the same reasons.<p>Some of the other “boomer” shooters have been a bit hit and miss. Ion Fury was good but Tbh is a bit easy. prodeus is okay in bursts and wrath of aeon is solid but like the original quake can get a bit boring. Some of the other FPS games in the same vain have been &quot;I&#x27;ve played it for a day and probably won&#x27;t play it today&quot;.<p>These days I am playing Doom mods via GZDoom and there is soo much there now you could just play doom mods and never play anything else.')
