I am ordinarily a massive blockchain skeptic, but it could possibly be usable here. It should be possible to create features like user creation, changing passwords, data querying using sone kind of blockchain that is not in control of a single entity. I feel such a service would be useful and can be made now, but I also feel like it would be quite hard to use as well.<p>Think of something like Amazon Cognito or Okta, but decentralized and transparent.')
