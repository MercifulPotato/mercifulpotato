It&#x27;s not censorship, it&#x27;s moderation, and companies have every right to moderate what content is allowed on their platforms.<p>I think it&#x27;s important to distinguish between the two.  Censorship, that is the government proscribing or restricting what people say and thinks in general&#x2F;public&#x2F;day-to-day life, is an egregious attack on people&#x27;s liberty.  I think we shouldn&#x27;t tolerate any limitations on free speech.<p>Moderation, or companies determining a code-of-conduct for the properties and platforms they control, is the same as someone telling you to shut up or get out of their house if you say something that offends them.  I think what&#x27;s important there is that the code of conduct is clearly stated, objective, and enforced even-handedly, which hasn&#x27;t always been the case as of late.')
