Because its important to have more control, where you can customize and adapt the customize background engine.<p>The other thing to take into account is that Chrome itself will want to compete in this vertical, with little modifications a Javascript &quot;application&quot; that reuses the same browser engine you already have in your machine (BTW, I think there is something called &#x27;Carlo&#x27; that basically achieve that).<p>This is a really brutal market to compete, so i&#x27;m inclined to think the opposite. Its hard to propose real value here , and if you don&#x27;t do it, its hard to beat more well established propositions.')
