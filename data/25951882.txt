The brokers cannot mint credit out of thin air if they don&#x27;t allow margins. Hence, the cash in the broker is backed 1:1, and they won&#x27;t have liquidation issues.<p>If Robinhood cannot fulfill these trades on margins, that is totally fine, they can halt on the margin trades if there are &quot;liquidation issues&quot;. For all-cash trade, there shouldn&#x27;t be any liquidity issues otherwise it calls into question how they manage their deposit.')
