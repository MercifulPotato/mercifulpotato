But, from that very article:\n&quot;Despite the virusâ€™s sluggish mutation rate, researchers have catalogued more than 12,000 mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genomes.&quot;<p>Now, that doesn&#x27;t tell us that these mutations matter, but that&#x27;s because we don&#x27;t know which ones matter.  But even a rate of two single-letter mutations per month could theoretically result in 2^10 different variants in less than a year.  It almost certainly won&#x27;t, because many of the mutations will be the same (some parts of the genome almost certainly are more likely to mutate than others).  But a rate of 2 single-letter mutations per month, is not much of a limit.<p>The nature article you reference (for which thanks, btw) says its mutation rate is about half of influenza&#x27;s.  Which is, yes, less, but that&#x27;s still really fast compared to almost anything that isn&#x27;t influenza.  Even a slow-mutating virus is still mutating fast.')
