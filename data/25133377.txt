Medical experts have been wanting this for a while. Dr. Michael Mina was the first to get my attention on how important at-home-tests could be in curbing covid-19. I just wonder why it took them so long? How bad could the side effects be for a test that is a couple of percentage worse than PCR? I think the FDA was too conservative on their timeline for this when we think of how many people are dying today. I also think the FDA is being too conservative on approving the mRNA vaccines, but that is another can of worms.')
