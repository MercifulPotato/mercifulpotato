If it&#x27;s warm, I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;s an even better environment for bacterial&#x2F;spore growth.<p>IIRC, the reason Zojirushi gives for not keeping rice warm for too long is that it will get yellow and hard.  I don&#x27;t think they mentioned food safety concerns.  Mine does have a small vent hole, so I guess the moisture must escape eventually.')
