When dirt is your best feature, you have to fall back on hype.<p>Venus and Mars are both extremely difficult environments, overwhelmingly moreso than Antarctica, the middle of the Takla Makan Desert, undersea, or in orbit, and also much harder to get to and from. No one has attempted living sustainably in any of those, and there is no proof they could if they tried.<p>So, only billionaires&#x27; public fantasies make them seem doable at all.
