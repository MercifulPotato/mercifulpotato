If there&#x27;s one area of study that ties together observations and models, it&#x27;s stats. But stats suffers from the same problem that programming does: people think it&#x27;s a tool that they just need to know a little bit of, so they don&#x27;t defer to the proper authorities in the area.<p>Of course this is just anecdotes, but I do have a friend who did stats as a phd and this is the attitude that seems to be common: stats (and code) are minor tools that won&#x27;t affect the outcome of our experiment.')
