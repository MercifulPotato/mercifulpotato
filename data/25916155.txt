This is what magical languages, like in the late Renaissance, were about. The only thing which comes close to that today is code for computers. Essentially, these are languages which, when executed, something happens. They are languages of efficacy. They carry, not meaning, but motivation to activity. This Kabbalistic question is very interesting; someone showed me, recently, a sculptural object, which, when illuminated from various angles by a source of light behind it would cast, one after another, each of the Hebrew letters on a screen. In other words, this was a higher-dimensional object which had the entire Hebrew alphabet somehow embedded in it. When I mentioned this to Ralph Abraham, he said, &#x27;Well, all you have to do is digitize and quantify that object, and weâ€™ll be able to compute from that three-dimensional object to a 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-, or 9-dimensional object, which would cast all letters of all alphabets into matter.&#x27; So one way of thinking of the &#x27;transcendental object at the end of time&#x27; is as this kind of Ur-letter or Ur-word in hyperspace, from which, as it sheds the radiance of its syntactical numenosity into lower and lower dimensions, realities as literary functions of being constellate themselves.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThere was a Standford professor that studied this extensively and while I don&#x27;t bu 100% into it, he makes a pretty compelling argument. The 3d molds that he created when held at specific angles and viewed, they certainly resemble letters of the Hebrew Alphabet. In turn, the way he holds them in both hands (arms extended out or twisting) represents specific meaning! In theory this should work with other languages as well but the bottom line, going back to the idea that our language <i>itself</i> is a trickle down effect from the outer workings beyond our current dimension.<p>All of this should be read with a very open mind however, nonetheless, the original video, the various &quot;sacred&quot; geometries (why are they even sacred to begin with?), inspire thinking that what if languages and symbols representing ideas are simply projections?<p>&gt;  more mechanical than magical.<p>This. As we learn more and more and our understanding expands, I don&#x27;t see why not.<p>(I&#x27;m really pleased that we can have this thread on HN)')
