Maybe people don&#x27;t realize that Ikea makes both low-end and mid-range products. They will gladly sell you a $25 entertainment center (Lack-based) and a $500 entertainment center. The expensive items last and many classic designs remain at steeply discounted prices from original manufacture date. (For example, the PÃ¶ang originally costing ~$300 adjusted is now $79.)')
