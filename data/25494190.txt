A decade ago, I have coded some bot for an ego-shooter with RTS elements and have learnt so much from it (while having a lot of fun).<p>It starts with basic things like waypoint systems vs. area awareness systems plus the relevant routing algorithms like A*, but goes on to organizing a group of players and finding good strategies. And all of that with a limited time budget and an changing environment around you. Last but not least, you want to emulate human behavior which is probably the hardest part as it includes changing you behavior according to your situation (don&#x27;t run straight against a wall for 10 seconds) but also taking into account the weaknesses as e.g. humans can&#x27;t aim perfectly.<p>Granted, what I have done has a huge field of challenges, but even with a 2D engine I think you can learn a lot from the experience.')
