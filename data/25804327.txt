Hi!<p>Well, if you&#x27;re speaking about non-negative integers, you don&#x27;t have the problem of the primality of negative numbers.<p>If you&#x27;re considering relative integers, still you don&#x27;t really have a unique factorization property, because negative integers do not have a factorization altogether (in terms of positive primes). So you have to stipulate that a prime factorization is not just a &quot;product of primes&quot;, but a &quot;product of primes, perhaps times -1&quot;, which is still not the way you usually define it. So I am not totally convinced.<p>In the end, everybody just pick the definition they like.')
