Were classified and 2. Were purloined by our enemies. That would demonstrate what needs to be demonstrated.&quot;<p>So the plan was to gather evidence that Clinton had committed a crime (allowing classified information to be obtained by a foreign adversary).  Are you saying that trying to prove your electoral opponent is a criminal is not allowed in a democracy?  That that is, as you say, &quot;a clear case of violating democratic rules&quot;?  You think the Trump campaign should have just ignored the possibility that Clinton&#x27;s conduct was criminal, since thinking such things isn&#x27;t nice?')
