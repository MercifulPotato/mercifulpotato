PostgreSQL itself is arguably a service, but the database probably is not - you&#x27;re probably crawling all over its implementation details and data model.<p>You <i>could</i> take a stand and say, &quot;All access is through stored procedures. They are the API.&quot; And, if that API operates as the same semantic level as a well-crafted REST API, then you could make an argument that that particular database is a microservice that just happens to have been implemented on top of PostgreSQL. But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen such a thing happen in the wild. It&#x27;s much more popular to use an ORM to get things nice and tightly coupled.')
