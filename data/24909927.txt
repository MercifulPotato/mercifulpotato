Aside from the missing documentation, there seems to be a lot of touch points where the code is tightly integrated with BigCommerce&#x27;s npm library.<p>At this point, it does not feel like the headless ecommerce part swappable. I&#x27;m sure that with time, the team will probably extract this out so that it&#x27;s more plug and play (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vercel&#x2F;commerce&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vercel&#x2F;commerce&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2</a>) or will require the libraries (ie. for Shopify, etc) to follow a certain pattern.<p>If anyone on the Next.js Commerce team is reading this, the other thing I noticed is that this requires a BigCommerce account. Would be great to have a functionality where one could test out all the end points without needing a third party service in local development. I happen to have a sandbox BigCommerce shop, but there&#x27;s quite a few steps to get one set up.')
