Not a complete experience but add to it some continued (Windows) or sketchy (Mac) use of those OSes from their very first release (80s &#x2F; 90s).<p>I&#x27;m trading those two nuisances, one very small, the other invisible, for other much larger problems<p>1. Not using Windows, which is a pretty much horrible experience. Good for gaming, which I don&#x27;t care anymore on a PC, bad UX. And I&#x27;m targeting Linux servers anyway.<p>2. MacOS and it&#x27;s top bar and the menu at the top. It was OK on the very first Mac because the screen was so tiny that it actually saved space. It was perplexing or infuriating when the screens got larger. Unfortunately it stuck and it will be like this forever. And Macs don&#x27;t have physical buttons on the touchpad.<p>So I&#x27;m happy with my Gnome desktop, configured with: the top bar at the bottom merged with a Windows like task bar, no dock, hotkeys to swap virtual desktop by customer project, no animations, visible permanent scrollbars (but I show only their outline on the background color of their window.)')
