Pascal<p>The book itself is pretty interesting but there&#x27;s one line in there about how Dave Cutler always takes his vacations on time, every time without question.<p>It never goes into any more details but that seemed totally at odds with what I expected? At least when hustle culture and the idea that leaders don&#x27;t take breaks seems somewhat prevalent nowadays (or at least in the mid-2000s)<p>As someone whose parents don&#x27;t take vacations all that often, and came from a small town where there&#x27;s that sort of &quot;I&#x27;m a good person because I work harder than you&quot; mentality, I was kind of hoping Cutler might reveal his philosophy of why he takes holidays without failure.<p>Maybe he just likes holidays and I&#x27;m over thinking it haha')
