These cases occurred at 3, 9, 37, and 48 days after vaccination. One case (onset at 3 days postvaccination) was reported as resolved with sequelae within three days after onset,  and the other three were reported as continuing or resolving as of the November 14, 2020 data cut-off with ongoing durations of 10, 15, and 21 days, respectively. The   observed frequency of reported Bell’s palsy in the vaccine group is consistent with the expected background rate in the general population, and there is no clear basis upon which to conclude a causal relationship at this time, but FDA will recommend surveillance for cases of Bell’s palsy with deployment of the vaccine into larger populations.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;media&#x2F;144245&#x2F;download" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;media&#x2F;144245&#x2F;download</a>')
