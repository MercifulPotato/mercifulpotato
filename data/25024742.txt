I only have one live and i don&#x27;t want to have covid right now nor any long term issues from it.<p>Yes, Please continue to have discipline and hold out against peer pressure to lower your guard. As someone who got covid, early 20s, exercise daily, low-processed food diet, no history of health issues, I got a mild case of Covid and the post-covid stage for me is much worse than the actual illness period and this phenomenon is very underrated in people’s discourse about risk assessment. Most people on this forum feel great arguing the pandemic on paper but have no lived experience of what this does to your body. 70, 80 days out where you feel super fucked up, new symptoms arise, random shit like pressure in your heart and chest, body aches day after day, extreme sensitivity to the cold.[0]<p>Imagine if covid were named HIV instead and people said, “look! After 10 months all these young people haven’t died. It must not be a big deal. Probably the flu”. Which is to say we still don’t know much about the virus.
