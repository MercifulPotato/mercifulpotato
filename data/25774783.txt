I also never understood why Europeans focus so much on income inequality (<i>&quot;OMG, programmers and managers get paid too much, tax them more!&quot;</i>) and not wealth inequality where old, established families can keep rolling their wealth from generation to generation nearly tax-free and see their assets apreciate substantially while the working class bares the brunt of taxation and are getting squeezed every year more and more by wage stagnation and inflating real-estate prices.<p>It&#x27;s a real mystery to me why people aren&#x27;t up in arms about wealth inequality instead but I guess as long as the working class is provided with a minimum of comfort (food, shelter, healthcare, education, sex) and are kept busy with the ratrace for the next big career move during the day and with an endless stream of available entertainment and consumerism in the evening, they&#x27;re too busy to notice, care or bother to do anything about it.')
