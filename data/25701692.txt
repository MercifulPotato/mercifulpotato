There are a lot of different embellishments (probably more than 200) used very frequently with 3 to 10 individual gracenotes in them. Most general music notation apps are not so good with dealing with this - MuseScore, for example, has a massive list of all possible embellishments which you have to scroll through to try and find the one you want.\nPipeScore tries to take advantage of the patterns in gracenotes to reduce the number of options by categorising them (e.g. the &#x27;doubling&#x27; class has 27 different embellishments in it, but they are all dependent on the notes immediately before and after the embellishment, so instead of manually choosing the correct doubling you just choose &#x27;doubling&#x27; and it automatically gives the right one)<p>There are other dedicated bagpipe apps but none of them are as frictionless as I&#x27;d like.')
