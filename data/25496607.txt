For those of us in Apple-land, that started around 2016 for laptops and 2018 for iPad Pros. The iPad Air just went USB-C a few months ago, and the base model iPad I assume still comes with a USB-A charger (though I didn&#x27;t check).<p>But at least with USB-C instead of MagSafe I can get a $17 multi-port charger with 60W power delivery and 3x USB-A ports to hook up at my desk, and keep the laptop brick handy to toss in a bag or use elsewhere without digging it up from under my desk every time. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.monoprice.com&#x2F;product?p_id=24425" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.monoprice.com&#x2F;product?p_id=24425</a>')
