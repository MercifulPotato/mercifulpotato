After a short amount of time my brand new phone just stopped working, the insurance said it was a factory issue, I sent it in for repairs.  They couldn&#x27;t fix it so they sent back a certified refurbished phone.  It wasn&#x27;t the same quality, the new keyboard was clicky and the refurbished felt spongy.  I called to complain but I ended up in a support loop getting passed around in a circle of people who had no authority to fix my situation.  I paid for a new phone with full insurance like a good little consumer and got a used phone.<p>Ever since then I buy budget phones; phone insurance is a scam, phones are intentionally difficult to repair, and I don&#x27;t want to spend $1k on something fragile that I keep in my pocket that has a high likelihood of being dropped on accident and the only recourse being whatever policy Apple has to benefit itself.  I wish we lived in a world where consumer electronics were owned by the user.  A 30 year old NES can hold value, I have doubts about what 30 year old smart phones will look like.')
