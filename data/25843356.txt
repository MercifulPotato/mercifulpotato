And their vaccine seems to work. It is just difficult to deploy on scale, that&#x27;s all. And my impression is, politicians and officials in Germany, and the EU it seems, are underestimating that. Which slows down vaccinations. And then the public and the press jumped in, only to push for increased purchasing. Which doesn&#x27;t help a bit until the last mile, in Germany handled locally by the states, is figured out.<p>A pill version, or just one general doctors practices can store and handle, will have a huge impact IMHO.')
