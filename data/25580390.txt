Here&#x27;s some aggregated data to provide context on how road networks are composed and the changes they go through.<p>The road network in Sweden is comprised of 36 million+ distinct coordinates that form 3 million+ roads which are joined on 2.4 million+ nodes.<p>In the first half of 2020, 16 thousand+ class (funktionell v√§gklass) 9 roads were added to the network, consisting of 2,769 km of road. Class 9 roads are the highest classification of roads in the Swedish road network and is loosely defined as &quot;where vehicle traffic normally doesn&#x27;t occur but is totally possible&quot;. Class 9 roads compromise 38.2% of all road links in the Swedish road-network for vehicles.<p>This represents the lions share (64.22% number of road links, 75.33% km of road link) of the changes in the road network during the first half of 2020.<p>This data originates from the NVDB service of the Swedish traffic agency and can be viewed here on a map:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nvdb2012.trafikverket.se&#x2F;SeTransportnatverket" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nvdb2012.trafikverket.se&#x2F;SeTransportnatverket</a>')
