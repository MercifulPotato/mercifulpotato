For the first time ever I&#x27;m nearly an expert on something on HN.<p>There&#x27;s quite a few arguments in here which run the gamut from &#x27;interesting point that people who work on clean energy think about a lot&#x27; to &#x27;very close to, if not a straw man argument&#x27;<p>There are some really interesting micro-biome studies that show there are local effects that are caused by wind turbines and solar arrays, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen a study which has said that the amount of carbon produced by these local changes in biomes is anywhere near the carbon saved by the move to renewables.<p>The REE exploration problem is also a good point on current EVs, but there&#x27;s a good chance that new batteries will have no Cobalt in them at all (as an aside, the reason that companies are looking to migrate from it has little to do with the scarcity, but more to do with the fact that it&#x27;s largely mined in very, very poor ways, I&#x27;m looking at you, Glencore).<p>The point about intermittency and &quot;Wind and solar promoters need to start admitting that they are not capable of providing this type of continuous and on-demand electricity supply on a national scale that modern societies are used to&quot; is not an overly well made one, there are a bunch of ways around this and it&#x27;s one of the biggest challenges being faced today in the industry. HDR, battery technology have come a long way in the last little bit.<p>Anyways, take the article with a grain of salt as you should do with everything.')
