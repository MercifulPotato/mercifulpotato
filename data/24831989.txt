This means that no matter what I do with my email, I can log into the gmail account and see every email I&#x27;ve received for years sitting in my inbox.<p>I don&#x27;t really recommend this setup, I&#x27;d really prefer to cut Google out of the path entirely, but I can&#x27;t do that without abandoning my email address.')
