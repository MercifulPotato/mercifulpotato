I had projects before I started working, and still have projects now. They are a hobby. Just that. When I don&#x27;t want to code outside of work, I dont. When I want, I do. I don&#x27;t feel guilt for not completing something. Most of them fail or are never finished, yet still I enjoy them, and I&#x27;ve learned a lot from them.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m just boggled at how many people appear to find it unimaginable and unrelatable that a technologist likes technology enough to mess with it for fun, even after work.<p>I do get their point though, they feel bad because they are not one of those. But that&#x27;s just the way things are. There aren&#x27;t many people who got into tech because they REALLY like it. Not because it&#x27;s a &quot;good&quot; job or because it&#x27;s the lesser evil.<p>And by that I don&#x27;t mean the people who only code at work or learned about tech later in life are bad developers, not at all. Nevertheless, they are the vast majority and they are quite different than the passionate young kid who codes for shits and giggles. It doesn&#x27;t help than they are socially pressured to be like that. They end up hating it. Like when you have a brother&#x2F;sister that is better than you at something and your parents always say &quot;WHY CANT YOU BE LIKE YOUR BROTHER&#x2F;SISTER&quot;.')
