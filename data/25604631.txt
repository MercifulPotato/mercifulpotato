Confidence and charisma seems to tell our so-called &quot;reptile brain&quot; that this is a big alpha that should be followed, and I strongly suspect that the effect also tends to down-regulate the rational mind in the same way that stress and fear do. I&#x27;ve experienced the &quot;if they&#x27;re in the room you agree with them&quot; type of charisma more than once, and personally I always found it creepy and disturbing.<p>Looking past superficial confidence and charisma is something that should be explicitly taught.')
