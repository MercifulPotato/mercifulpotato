It was a forensic audit of physical machines from Antirim County: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uncoverdc.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;14&#x2F;antrim-county-forensic-report-shows-manipulation-of-votes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uncoverdc.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;14&#x2F;antrim-county-forensic-repo...</a><p>“The system intentionally generates an enormously high number of ballot errors.\nThe electronic ballots are then transferred for adjudication. The intentional errors lead to bulk adjudication of ballots with no oversight, no transparency, and no audit trail. This leads to voter or election fraud.” Based on the study, the group concluded that the machines should not be used in Michigan nor should the election results in Antrim County be certified.<p>In this county, the vote was actually corrected. And knowing these machines were capable of 70% error rates should have triggered a full statewide forensic audit in Michigan at the least.<p>Heres the surveillance footage of 30K suitcase ballots with absolutely no chain of custody after the entire building was shut down and all poll watchers kicked out on the basis of a bullshit water pipe leak story, being counted between 11pm and 1am the night of the election: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rumble.com&#x2F;vblh33-attorney-jackie-pick-exposes-georgia-election-fraud-at-state-farm-arena-ele.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rumble.com&#x2F;vblh33-attorney-jackie-pick-exposes-georg...</a><p>At any rate, it&#x27;s not a hunch.
