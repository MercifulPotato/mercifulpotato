I could easily show that I didn&#x27;t place the order.  They refunded my card, then immediately deactivated my account for violating their terms of service.  I&#x27;m not sure how their screw up caused me to violate something other than I asked for my money back.  At any rate, best of luck.  If the only way to profit is to steal from people and hold restaurants hostage, karma will have it&#x27;s day.')
