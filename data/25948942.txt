Being poor is not a good mindset since it is tied to insecurities and uncertainty around food, shelter, and healthcare. Relying on the benevolence of the rich is likewise a plea to the morals of people who historically have not felt the need to behave in a way that fits your specific morals.<p>The problem is how does one get to a point where the golden age arrives? FLOSS treats this as being incentivized by legal and social means, i.e. software licenses for use and education by orgs such as GNU. This doesn&#x27;t always solve the issue (as recent events show) but it has been more effective to work within the system and push things forward than to take a stance and live on a hill for it.<p>Politically, you can see similar events be carried out. China has an explicit governmental goal of eventually entering full Communism. I&#x27;m not going to debate if that is a _real_ goal of theirs, but they believed that it could be achieved and people could be given opportunities to achieve that by first opening up to world markets at large. This was after the Great Leap Forward plans failed. Judging by the difference between the GLF and China today it went well for them to operate within the system as well.')
