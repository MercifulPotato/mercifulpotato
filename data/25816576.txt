If you actually look at the cost involved. Putting all the funding into Shuttle simply made the Apollo architecture to expensive.<p>A much, much, much, much better strategy would have been to keep the Appollo hardware and evolve it. Plan for 1-2 Saturn V flights every year. Use the F1 engine on a smaller vehicle (like Saturn 1B) and use that vehicle as the work horse for both the military and NASA.<p>This would have allowed them to mass produce the engine, reuse the same pads. It would have given them much more capability compared to Shuttle and it would have been considerably cheaper.<p>It was bad engineering choices, not simply the budget. They cut the wrong things.')
