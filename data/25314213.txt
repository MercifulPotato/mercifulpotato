If they wanted to tell people &quot;Hey, in the future, don&#x27;t do that,&quot; they could. There&#x27;d be more of an argument there if the common case was that, say, people ignored the system and submitted anyway and hoped nobody would notice.<p>(... Also, comparing this rule to our overpoliced society where everyone commits some sort of crime and the police just choose who they go after kind of reinforces my point about unfairness. Sure, it may have been strategically wrong for her to not do everything by the book, but if so, it&#x27;s very interesting that the in-house ethicist has to play by all the rules to not get fired and the practitioners can safely skip them.)<p>Anyway, the culpability for rubber-stamping this paper is <i>on the person who rubber-stamped it</i>, given that short approvals are commonplace. Saying &quot;You should have known that this approval didn&#x27;t really count, so it&#x27;s your fault for going through the normal process and not realizing it should have been abnormal&quot; is nonsense. That&#x27;s literally the job of the reviewer, and if the reviewer can&#x27;t do that, someone else needs to fulfill that role. At <i>worst</i>, if they told her  on day one &quot;Your job is publishing high-impact papers with fundamental conflicts of interest with the company, so everything needs detailed review from X in addition to the usual process,&quot; that would be different. But they didn&#x27;t. Better yet, they could have flagged her in the publication review system as needing extra review. There were lots of options available to Google if they weren&#x27;t trying to make up rules after the fact to censor a researcher.<p>And in any case, she gave advance courtesy notice of the planned work: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;timnitgebru&#x2F;status&#x2F;1335018694913699840" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;timnitgebru&#x2F;status&#x2F;1335018694913699840</a> Someone could have said something then. They didn&#x27;t.')
