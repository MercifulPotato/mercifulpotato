The reason there are so many is that I want each atomic unit to be distinguishable.<p>Part of that is motivated by the will to save often in case something goes wrong. Part is to let continuous integration validate with high granularity. Part is to allow for binary search on revision history to reproduce rare bugs and isolate the specific change which introduced it.<p>These considerations may explain the correlation with “top performing” - although for what it’s worth I try to make commits which remove more lines of code than they add whenever possible.')
