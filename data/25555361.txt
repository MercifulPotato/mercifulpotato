Next year I started to &#x27;prepare&#x27; more for the future (water tanks, food, generator, gas storage) etc.<p>This year was crazier than ever, we got hit by an earthquake. And believe it or not, it made us feel &#x27;alive&#x27; (and other mainland families on the island were reporting similar things). Just as we were sorta done making preparation for the earthquake, Covid-19 arrived at the horizon, but I was prepared this time. We ordered survival food, solar cooker, buttloads of sanitizer (which became useless because we decided to use gloves instead) etc.<p>Also got a gun permit and got into guns. I aim to start carrying it once life resumes.<p>You may find many or all these measures ridiculous or unnecessary, and you may not have to do these exact things, but whatever you need to do to &#x27;feel that hunger&#x27;, will appear ridiculous and unnecessary to you.')
