You can see this in some of the rulings for PA election law. For example, some counties were counting mail-in ballots with deficiencies, while others were not. In some cases, like the PA senate seat that spans Alleghany and Westmoreland counties, this would lead to some people&#x27;s deficienct mail-in votes either counting or not counting based solely on if they live in one county vs the other. Or that the PA constitution and voting law is very explicit in detailing what events qualify one to use a mail-in ballot.<p>So in specific scenarios (which may or may not have swayed the election), it appears that rule of law may have been violated. And that in itself is concerning.')
