Why? Well because you constructed this straw man argument that I meant literally no one in Poland cares about the Western SJW values. It is obvious that you will find people like that - usually among &#x27;grievance studies&#x27; graduates, or heavy social-media users that tend to become infected with the &#x27;woke culture&#x27;.<p>Regarding misogyny, sure we have it here. Same with misandry, but somehow only the first issue is important according to the church of SJW.<p>Xenophobia is not an issue when you realise that Poland in the last years issued more residence permits to non-EU immigrants than any other country in the EU.<p>From what I see, you do what usually woke people do - they take some issue, fetishise it, misrepresent by a factor of 10 or 100, then claim whoever doesn&#x27;t agree with their view is a fascist. And in the meantime people in Poland live everyday lives, not caring about all that stuff. Half a century of soviet propaganda made us more immune to the progressive socialist propaganda than most societies, I suppose.')
