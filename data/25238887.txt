I do see variable names about as bad as in my example though, and I see them being fixed. They typically arise from some copy&#x2F;paste where someone wanted similar logic but forgot to rename a variable.<p>I don&#x27;t see people renaming from say numberOfItems to noOfItems or similar, if that&#x27;s the type of renames you&#x27;re referring to. Can you give an example of a rename you are seeing?')
