The PTX &quot;virtual machine assembly&quot; is fully documented. SASS is not documented, but it ain&#x27;t a secret either. SASS follows closely with PTX, with exception of some &quot;barrier bits&quot; that seem to track dependencies (probably compiler-managed read&#x2F;write dependency chains).<p>&gt; Each SIMT thread on NVIDIA GPUs for Volta onwards has its own instruction pointer. And yes, it&#x27;s scalar instructions at the ISA level.<p>When your &quot;scalar&quot; instruction executes 32-threads in parallel (subject to an execution mask), that&#x27;s called SIMD.<p>The instruction pointer is to resolve deadlock conditions with locks, and the 32-wide SIMD cores will execute one-at-a-time to prevent deadlocks. But your goal as a GPU programmer is to get as much 32-wide execution going on as possible.<p>1-at-a-time serialization is very, very bad for performance. Its POSSIBLE to do on Volta, but highly recommended you stay away from that cornercase (you lose over 95% of your performance).')
