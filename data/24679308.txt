Basically, brain was made for body to experience less of that stress.<p>As an example of what BDNF does: endurance exercise is known for elevating serum BDNF levels long-term [1] and endurance exercise has been shown to help with Parkinsons&#x27; [2].<p>Thus, can it be that these speaking two languages experience more of that stresses thorough their life? The article does not suggest that these factors were, well, factored out.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6613032&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6613032&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;28870627&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;28870627&#x2F;</a><p>PS<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;260394068_Long_term_habitual_exercise_is_associated_with_lower_resting_level_of_serum_BDNF" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;260394068_Long_term...</a> - they suggest that habitual exercise does not produce more BDNF or it is not BDNF that acts on the brain, I counter that body utilizes it better, just like glucose in blood.')
