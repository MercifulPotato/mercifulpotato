I respect Richard for what he did and how he has viewed things, but I am much more cynical about the world. This is likely a small exception out of hundreds of thousands of times that &quot;the janitor&quot; got completely screwed over, if they were even given a chance to begin with.<p>I mean, it happens on the daily. The startup I previously worked for had this &quot;test&quot; API, I helped turn it into an essential API that brought the company a ton of money, and I saw 0 of it. My title got bumped, I guess.<p>And now, I work on something even less visible. If I do something at work that saves thousands of my coworkers thousands of hours a quarter, I don&#x27;t see any of that. Nor can I show it, because the higher-up management people don&#x27;t know what a Jenkins is or what an Artifactory is. How do I sweep these &quot;floors&quot; so well that the CEO can see any of it? Even the coworkers that use my stuff directly don&#x27;t give a shit because they have code to write and my improvements save them ~20 minutes a day every other day or two.')
