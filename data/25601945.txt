Item(by='jolmg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609492908, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25600423, text='&gt; Folks, especially the young, can take it much more seriously than it was meant to be.<p>Most of the time, we can&#x27;t know people&#x27;s ages from their comments, so your apparent conclusion that this is age-related confuses me.<p>&gt; This might be their first “adult” conversation, so to speak, and the idea is not to squelch them but not to drag down the general tone of discussion either.<p>In the adult conversations I&#x27;ve had, people generally show enough respect to give equal weight to all appropriate contributions to the conversation. Dismissively silencing a participant with no explanation is something more exclusively seen among children.<p>&gt; the psychological impact of the downvote.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t call it a psychological impact. It&#x27;s just a surprise we all get over. The surprise comes because we seemingly are having a good conversation going as we might in real life. However, the casual graying out seems like a big disparity with etiquette in face-to-face conversations.<p>Personally, I understand it&#x27;s just a difference that comes with the different medium.<p>The way I see it, flagging is for inapproriate comments like something containing porn, or indisputable hate speech, etc. Graying out is for comments that are not inappropriate but have low signal-to-noise ratio, like &quot;That&#x27;s cool!&quot;, or that go against the guidelines. Upvoting is for conversation subthreads one is interested in, to get them higher and hopefully with more participants.<p>Use of the upvote and downvote are not standardized though, so people use those buttons with different reasons. Same happens with StackExchange.')
