According to [1], there used to be &quot;TiddlyWeb&#x2F;TiddlySpace, a robust serverside that supports revision history&quot;, but TiddlySpace (a hosted service) is dead, and TiddlyWeb (an open source codebase that I guess was the backend for TiddlySpace?) seems to be no longer maintained and mainly targeted the &#x27;old&#x27; (pre-5.x) TiddlyWiki.<p>That&#x27;s too bad for me, because I have a use case where I&#x27;d otherwise be very interested in using TiddlyWiki.  I love that links load instantly, I love that forking a TiddlyWiki is trivial, I&#x27;m interested in the idea of dividing information into smaller-than-a-normal-wiki-page &#x27;tiddlers&#x27;, and I like the UI design.  Overall, I can&#x27;t find any other software that quite matches TiddlyWiki&#x27;s capabilities.<p>But my use case is for a publicly editable wiki, so it&#x27;s critical that revision history not only exist but be integrated into the UI.  Right now, as far as I can tell, the closest approximation would be to use TiddlyWiki&#x27;s feature of auto-saving to a Git hosting service (which for some reason supports <i>only</i> specific hosting services, not arbitrary remotes?).  Then you could browse the history on that service.  But that would be a totally separate site from the wiki itself, which would create an awkward user experience.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Jermolene&#x2F;TiddlyWiki5&#x2F;issues&#x2F;436#issuecomment-36062142" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Jermolene&#x2F;TiddlyWiki5&#x2F;issues&#x2F;436#issuecom...</a>')
