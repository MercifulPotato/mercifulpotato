Others seem to prefer to start with the algorithms of matrix operations. Of course you need to understand both so it&#x27;s a matter of style&#x2F;preference etc.<p>Also take a look at Shilov&#x27;s Linear Algebra. Two things it has going for it is that it&#x27;s a lot cheaper and more compact than most books. On the other hand, it&#x27;s dense, and doesn&#x27;t really lean on geometry to explain anything. The 3blue1brown videos make a great compliment to it (or to any book).')
