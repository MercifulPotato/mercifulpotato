If browsers implementations are impossibly complex for anyone other than large companies to implement then the concept of &quot;open standards&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean what it used to.<p>I&#x27;m looking forward to the inevitable renaissance of the Open Web which respects the fact that the internet is for end-users[0]. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a million cool things a web page _could_ do but that doesn&#x27;t mean that&#x27;s what users want. The web needs more end-user participation, not more functionality. An end-user focused web would focus on security and simplicity over novelty. I&#x27;m not sure where this all went so terribly wrong but I&#x27;m convinced that it won&#x27;t always be like this. Disruptive change is something our industry is very good at.<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc8890" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc8890</a>')
