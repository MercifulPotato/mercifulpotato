In 2018, as a junior programmer, he said he was making ~$700&#x2F;month&quot;<p>Take this in context. $400 for a starting tester (aka zero qualifications) is standard for eastern europe. As a career, it&#x27;s on par with call center operator.<p>2-3 years later, he switched to &quot;junior developer&quot; in the same company. I&#x27;m reading this to mean there was a conversation with the management that went like this: &quot;You seem like a smart guy and you did a couple of javascript online classes. We&#x27;ll switch you to dev and teach you how to program properly - oh, and you get 10% raise along with it. When you can do useful work we can renegotiate&quot;.<p>One may teach himself useful programming in a couple of years while working full time as a tester - it&#x27;s definitely possible. But the baseline probability is that at that stage he wasn&#x27;t yet productive, and still required what&#x27;s basically paid training for 3 to 6 months.')
