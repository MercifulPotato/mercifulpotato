Bitcoin&#x27;s capacity has been limited its entire life, the limits were coded in by Bitcoin&#x27;s creator. The limits are integral to protecting Bitcoin&#x27;s decentralization, and have nothing in particular to do with lightning.  Alternative blockchains without functional limits such as &quot;BSV&quot; are so bloated that it is practically unreasonable to run nodes, leaving participants blinding trusting third parties.<p>These trade-offs were well understood long long ago (e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.bitcoin.it&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Scalability&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=14273&amp;oldid=14112" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.bitcoin.it&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Scalability&amp;action=h...</a> or <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitcointalk.org&#x2F;index.php?topic=3118.msg44789#msg44789" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitcointalk.org&#x2F;index.php?topic=3118.msg44789#msg447...</a> or <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitcointalk.org&#x2F;index.php?topic=2500.msg34211#msg34211" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitcointalk.org&#x2F;index.php?topic=2500.msg34211#msg342...</a>).<p>Liquid isn&#x27;t some replacement technology for Bitcoin, it&#x27;s something it&#x27;s a distributed-centeralized (federated) system that can do things Bitcoin and other completely decenteralized systems cannot do like offer instantaneous settlement.  It trades off decentralization to for latency.  When users have funds in exchange they&#x27;ve already substantially lost their decentralization benefits, for for e.g. rapid arb between exchanges this tradeoff is probably a good one.<p>Bitcoin gives people the freedom to use their money in a bunch of different ways.<p>&gt;  nullc have some close relationship with Blockstream.<p>I haven&#x27;t have any relationship at all with blockstream for over three years now.')
