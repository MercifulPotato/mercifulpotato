Until there&#x27;s too much wealth disparity, and Peter is willing to pay more than Paul has in total for desert-grown almonds. Either Paul steals the water or he dies, and thieves aren&#x27;t popular.<p>Of course there&#x27;s another form of currency - votes. I can&#x27;t really say they&#x27;re universally distributed, because FPTP screws up the purchasing power of a vote. But I&#x27;d give good odds on a <i>very</i> strong correlation between a functioning democracy and cheap water.')
