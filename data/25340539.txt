The US government could have made military investments elsewhere and Fairchild Semiconductor would have just as easily been in another state.<p>California and the SF Bay Area doesn&#x27;t get credit for that. Heck, Silicon Valley was a bunch of fruit orchards for decades. Could have been a different set of fruit orchards in a different state.<p>Had Fairchild been elsewhere, the Traiterous 8 would have become the kingmakers they became in a different place and Keith Rabois or someone like him would have moved to that ecosystem instead to develop relations at the right time and become rich.<p>Seattle is the perfect counterfactual to the narrative you&#x27;re invested in. Microsoft is Seattle&#x27;s Fairchild.<p>Saying that all they are doing is &quot;cutting a check&quot; betrays the fact that you&#x27;ve likely never actually worked with a successful VC. The successful ones do so much more than cut a check. For example, the hard work they put in to help you identify and hire talent is indispensable.')
