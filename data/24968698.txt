Item(by='HenryBemis', descendants=None, kids=[24969075], score=None, time=1604328716, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24968438, text='&gt; I realized that it is all fundamentally unfair and biased<p>(apologies for the long post)<p>imho it&#x27;s all about boundaries. You may have have a strong disagreement with a family member about a topic. But if they have a car accident you will drop everything there and then, and run to them, even if you &#x27;hate&#x27; them for voting XYZ, or believing in Zeus or Ganesha. Silly example: when I donate blood, I don&#x27;t care (EDIT: care = I am not concerned) about the religion, colour, nationality, etc of the person that will receive it. I do it to help save a life. Anyone who is a donor does it to save someone else&#x27;s life.<p>It could be the case that your (vs your family&#x2F;loved ones) lifestyles are fundamentally different i.e. you are married to a person of X religious persuasion, or Y nationality, or X colour. In which case, &quot;hi, Boundaries, bye&quot; and then THEY made the conscious choice to remove themselves from your life, and NOT the other way round.<p>In your example, (again imho) saying something anti-semitic bad, just like saying anti-black is bad, same like saying anti-(i.e.)-italian is bad, etc. I have written in this forum before, we all got 1000 reasons to dislike&#x2F;separate and&#x2F;or hate one-another (vegans vs meat-eaters, followers of Y religion vs followers of Z religion, ManU fans vs ManCity fans, and so on).<p>My definition of freedom is the following: your rights stop, where my rights begin, and my rights stop, where your rights begin. I know, this leaves a pretty large grey line. If I like Sepultura, I will use my headset but leave me alone, and I will leave you alone while you listen to your Spice Girls (using simple example to avoid passionate responses).<p>&gt; I had to be careful not to voice opinions to keep good relationships.<p>The Minimalists say &quot;you cannot change your friends, but you can change your friends&quot;. If you have to fake everything to be liked and accepted by a certain group, then perhaps withdraw yourself from that group? In the end it is your choice.')
