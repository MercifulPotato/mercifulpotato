I still don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very compelling evidence that he was building a bomb, and weaker evidence that if he was building a bomb, it was to hurt people. Maybe he was just trying to make his own fireworks. He shouldn&#x27;t be doing that in an apartment, cuz risk of accidental explosions, but it seems hasty to start painting him as a domestic terrorist.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I fully agree with this. All I&#x27;m saying is, we shouldn&#x27;t outright dismiss the possibility that he was building a bomb, simply because he&#x27;s an open source developer.')
