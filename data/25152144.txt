Item(by='sleepysysadmin', descendants=None, kids=[25153537], score=None, time=1605808291, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25150369, text='&gt;While I agree with this in principle, it assumes a level of reasonableness in the discussion that is simply not there for many people who hijack online forums.<p>People have lost the ability to discourse with others that&#x27;s for sure. If you do know how to do so, you can turn a comment that is unreasonable to derive a conversation out of them. I do this all the time.<p>&gt;They are &quot;spreading misinformation&quot; in the sense of shouting over everyone else and not observing any rules of civil discussion. What they say is often not even coherent enough to be worth trying to refute with better speech. The only way to keep the forum viable at all is to ban them.<p>And the point being made is once again confirmed. You cannot have community when all opposing viewpoints are banned. Your community becomes an echo chamber.<p>In fact lets even back off slightly. Let&#x27;s say we are pre-echo chamber. What happens, how does it become? As I said it was moderation. It can be the mods themselves or the downvote system. Every community has a bias and the people who agree with the hivemind get the most upvotes but the opposing viewpoints get downvoted. So what happens? The most reasonable people are removed first. This is a goal, if you remove the reasonable opposing viewpoint, it leaves your hivemind and the unreasonable opposing viewpoint that helps reinforce the hivemind.<p>So now that we have all these echo chambers and no communities. How healthy is society? It is far worse off than 10 years ago.')
