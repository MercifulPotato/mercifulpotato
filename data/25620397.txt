But now I&#x27;ve learnt the logic of how to navigate twitter I find it very intuitive.<p>Twitter have tried to have their cake and eat it too by allowing a reddit or hn style tree (which is good for discussions) while having their ui present it as a linear feed (which is good for engagement). This has lead to their current solution where the branches are presented in a choose your own adventure way. Now because the linked tweet has three replies, it has to show all three of them and leave it to you to select which branch you want to go down by clicking on it or the show replies prompt (though it does give primacy to pixprin&#x27;s replies to self).')
