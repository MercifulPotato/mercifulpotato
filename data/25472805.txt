Item(by='sascha_sl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608330178, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25471449, text='Cyberpunk has bugs and omissions that are a lot more severe than a typical AAA game launch, and certainly more than a typical CDPR game launch. Witcher 2 was rough, but never this rough, and Witcher 3 was a large improvement.<p>I played Watch Dogs Legion the other day. They don&#x27;t even come close to comparing in terms of quality. Legion has functional AI and maybe a glitch every 2-3 hours (but I&#x27;ve had zero of them be game breaking, they&#x27;re mostly geometry of physics related). Cyberpunk has weird things happening around every corner, sometimes quest breaking, sometimes visually hilarious, always showing the lack of polish.')
