I don’t really get why they have to be MLM. Many years ago, my family bought a lot of Amway and Tupperware stuff. They were high quality wares that can last a lifetime even through some abuse. We happily paid money just for the sake of owning and using them, not because we wanted to “evangelize” and make money off them. We still have a lot of Tupperware from back then that still have perfect sealing capability and remain as tough as ever.')
