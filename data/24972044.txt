Item(by='TheDong', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604345354, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24958086, text='&gt; The author of the article is specifically struggling with his evangelism. He says he thinks the world would be a better place if everyone used spaced repetition. I don&#x27;t know (can&#x27;t imagine honestly) what sort of utopia he envisions, but he needs to show instead of tell. Just like I need to.<p>This standard isn&#x27;t tenable for some things.<p>For example, I think the world would be a better place if we gave everyone free healthcare. What&#x27;s that, the standard for this has to be me literally doing the thing I&#x27;m advocating for?<p>In a similar vein, all the author&#x27;s really saying is &quot;if people cared about learning, and implemented strategies to learn, we&#x27;d live in a better world&quot; (a more informed, thoughtful society perhaps). Whether SR actually accomplishes any of that is questionable, but the idea that people continuing to practice to learn will improve the world does not seem like it merits a &quot;show me and I&#x27;ll believe you&quot; answer.<p>Just like it&#x27;s unreasonable to say &quot;well, implement free healthcare, until then I won&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s worth doing&quot;, it&#x27;s unreasonable to say &quot;convince everyone to use SR, until then I won&#x27;t use it or be convinced&quot;. It&#x27;s an impossible bar.<p>It&#x27;s also impossible to lead by example for aggregate behaviors. If you think that a park would be better if everyone picked up dog poop, and you lead by example by picking up all your dog&#x27;s poop, that doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re wrong if other people still don&#x27;t pick up their own dog&#x27;s poop.')
