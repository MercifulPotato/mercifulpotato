This includes states with republican leadership. And every court case brought against the election results has failed.<p>Even if you accept the idea that in many ways it is difficult or impossible to audit the results (I don&#x27;t agree), the only evidence that has been presented against the result are absurd conspiracy theories and patent falsehoods as well as testimony from people with an axe to grind.<p>In other cases we have seen (Gore) there was an actually agreed upon issue. Hanging chads on the ballots were real and verifiable. This is not the case today.<p>Also let us be clear that this has not happened before. It is not before the current administration that &quot;massive voter fraud&quot; has entered the conversation. It was presented in 2016 despite Trumps win (amusing). It is presented now for no other reason than to distract, raise money, and serve the fragile ego of the President.')
