There&#x27;s really no reason at all that a &lt;vcenter&gt;ed element couldn&#x27;t be vertically centered at all times within its containing box, even as its containing box changes size, except a stubborn and dogmatic unwillingness to accept that web pages aren&#x27;t magazine layouts.<p>It would be more accurate to say that HTML is <i>progressively</i> rendered. As information comes in, boxes move and change size and eventually settle in their positions.')
