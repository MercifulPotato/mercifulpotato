If the planes go twice slower, would their deaths per kilometer stay the same, or would deaths per hour? I am willing to bet it&#x27;s the latter.<p>In that case planes have the same chance of failing (mechanically or through human error) as cars do. It is very difficult to increase that safety factor, maybe impossible.<p>The conclusion to draw from that, is that you can&#x27;t point at car manufacturers and blame them for producing unreliable &#x2F; bad quality machines.<p>On the other hand, measurement per kilometer implies that as a traveller you should use a plane where possible, but obviously they can&#x27;t replace car in a daily commute.')
