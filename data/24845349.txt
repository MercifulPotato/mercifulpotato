Item(by='fjfaase', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603262929, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24834965, text='One of the most important reasons why we write programs, is because computers are slow and have limited memory. Computers only appear fast due to a host of tricks. The most important trick is the memory pyramid: with at the top a small number of very fast accessible memory (think CPU registers) and at the bottom a very fast but many orders of slower accessible memory (think the whole of the internet). And a lot of business is about moving data up and down the pyramid.<p>It looks like most software engineers are still unaware of this. Why do we still encode Unicode strings as UTF-8 strings in memory, why not as double linked of Code points? Not because we cannot, but because it is faster and uses less memory.<p>Another big problem is related to multi-user modifications of shared data structures and that high-level semantic modelling is hard for most people. If multiple agents (people) are modifying a data structure, then those changes need to be combined in a semantic correct way. A complication factor is the fact that most data structures are distributed (also due to the memory pyramid) and that a lot of effort is needed to synchronize modifications.')
