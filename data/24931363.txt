But it needs to be sense, and not arbitrary, capricious behaviour. And you&#x27;re right that&#x27;s something you can never quite encode in the rules. But that doesn&#x27;t mean we shouldn&#x27;t have them. Real world laws are also subject to interpretation, with tons of unclear edge cases, but it&#x27;s still good that they ban murder, theft, and those kind of things.<p>But yeah, except in extreme cases, I would expect an organisation of such an event to indeed mildly tap the offender on the wrist and maybe help to prevent it in the future. Or tell the complainer that it&#x27;s not actually a violation of the CoC when it isn&#x27;t.<p>Not everything needs to be punished. Just informing people is often enough.')
