Especially as smaller and smaller companies can meaningfully seek investment by public listing. At the end of the day, there are millions of tiny ventures that could reliably provide 10x returns, yet the market cap is so small that the due diligence cost for a major investor is prohibitive. But as the sheer number of investors increases, the spread of investment to smaller companies will increase. Smaller investors also have far lower diversity of knowledge, which is likely a good thing, as the stock market is notorious for underfunding longshots in median, and if you have diversity in knowledge, you are more likely to have atleast one person with good knowledge of the common if wrong consensus regarding a prior for something.<p>We still need to improve regulation, especially with regards the amount of work to become publicly listed, and develop memes which protect against common scams and bubbles.')
