One goal recently, I think, was to get 4 quarters of profitability to get listed on the S&amp;P 500, among other reasons. These credits exist, so they factored that in to what they needed to do to show a profit. If they did not exist then Tesla (Elon Musk) could have altered what they were doing some to get to profitability. Maybe get there a quarter later, push up short term production trading off R&amp;D, etc. I am not a CEO but this is what they do.')
