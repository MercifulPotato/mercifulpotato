Reduction is an important cornerstone in physics and it’s a way to validate if a theory is on the right track even when things are not measurable.<p>I do not think it is correct to say that special relativity for example gives 10^500 possible classical theories.  We know special relativity needs to produce same outcome as Newtonian mechanics or Maxwell’s equations in the limit as velocity tends to 0.   In my simple example, we have 2 well established theories which bound the possible outcomes.  This is all possible even without knowing the speed of light.')
