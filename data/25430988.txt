Obviously if I&#x27;m some small shop the gov&#x27;t shouldn&#x27;t get involved in how my servers operate, but once you become a large public general purpose messaging company, like Twitter for example, with millions of users, you&#x27;ve crosses a threshold where you should be treated similar to a phone company insofar as your legal right to arbitrarily censor perfectly legal speech.<p>I urge anyone who disagrees to just watch Joe Rogan episode with Tim Pool and Jack Dorsey where it all comes out into the light.<p>If phone companies started terminating service or interfering in any way with communications, the courts would immediately intervene to stop it. The main epiphany all Americans need to have is that these Big Tech companies are identical to phone providers in every way that matters, when it comes to censorship rules.')
