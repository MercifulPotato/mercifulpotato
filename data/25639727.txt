Sometimes I stay up late surfing the web and then don&#x27;t get enough sleep because I have to wake up the next morning to do some bullshit, but I&#x27;d do the same thing if I was sitting in a chair - I don&#x27;t surf the the web at night because my computer devices tempt me into doing it, I do it because it&#x27;s fun.')
