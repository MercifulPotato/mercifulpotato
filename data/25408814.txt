This doesn&#x27;t change that problem at all. The gains are in security (reducing complexity and attack surface) and packaging. However, it uses coarse isolation with a single process model, so you would be compelled to isolate via many vm processes, which pushes the security&#x2F;isolation management up to the container level and can incur a performance penalty.')
