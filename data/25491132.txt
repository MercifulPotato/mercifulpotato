There&#x27;s just no surface area for issues, it&#x27;s talking to storage and a network card. Desktop Linux with the wrong display drivers can crash daily.<p>Windows can be rock solid. I do game dev and am forced to have it as my daily driver. I have a 3900X, 2070 Super, do machine learning, VR development, game playing, peg it at 100% CPU overnight and I haven&#x27;t had a blue screen since I bought it.<p>Buy the wrong laptop with shitty drivers, though, and BSOD is a way of life. Although Microsoft cracked down hard on this over the last decade, the WHQL initiative. They were well aware Windows stability was suffering at the hands of third parties, and put processes in place to validate their work.<p>And OS X, since it barely has to work with third party drivers, is more or less rock solid. You buy a MacBook Pro, plug an Apple mouse in and use it like that for years, maybe you never see a fault.<p>When it does interact with third party devices in my experience it&#x27;s not better than Windows. Bluetooth handling in particular is quite poor.<p>This wasn&#x27;t intended to be some kind of argument. Defending MS on the internet is of zero interest to me. I was intending to say, if you&#x27;re forced to use Windows professionally and it&#x27;s not stable, you absolutely do not have to put up with that. I don&#x27;t.')
