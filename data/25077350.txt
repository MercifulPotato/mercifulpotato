It&#x27;s the whole package. It just so happens that Scheme and Racket have a minimal syntax to enable more regular semantics and advanced macros.<p>I would recommend at least checking out Racket and giving it a chance if you&#x27;ve never even heard of Scheme. If you like Python&#x27;s syntax, then you might be interested in the Rhombus project that the Racket team is embarking on or Pyret, both of which have Python-esque syntax. I&#x27;d also recommend F#, which has just as clean, if not cleaner syntax than Python.<p>It&#x27;s hard to call Python&#x27;s syntax perfection when it is missing piping and pattern matching. Python can&#x27;t even do multiline method chaining without an extraneous &quot;\\&quot; character or parentheses. Python also doesn&#x27;t have a multiline comment syntax.')
