I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with saying &quot;Gee, this store is making way more money but its employees are being paid the same, that sucks&quot;. I think indexing the minimum wage to inflation makes sense. I think a lot of low-skill jobs should be higher-paid, and I think raising the minimum wage is a good tool in some cases (although I think the people pushing for national increases often overlook the effect that a doubling wage will have in a rural area where the cost of labor really does impact the ability of a smaller store to stay open).<p>My point is just that I don&#x27;t think &quot;wages should keep pace with productivity&quot; is true. If wages always rose with productivity, we&#x27;d be focusing all the gains on the people in the sectors where productivity is growing, and not lowering the cost of goods for everybody else.')
