You might take this as an indirect endorsement of content. But by that logic, a site with no moderation simultaneously liberal, conservative, and centrist because all are allowed. I guess you can say that it&#x27;s political, but because it allows all content it&#x27;s political nature is all-encompassing. Calling a completely apolitical stance political is sort of like calling Atheism a religion. It&#x27;s arguably correct but it&#x27;s really the absence of religion.<p>Also, I think your whiteboard with a swatstika analogy demonstrates the shortsightedness of this sort of &quot;inaction is endorsement&quot; line of thinking. What about a candidate who&#x27;s family was personally affected by the Holocaust and is so mortified to see the swatstika that they are too uncomfortable to even do anything about it? What about a South Asian candidate for whom the symbol doesn&#x27;t elicit a reaction because of it&#x27;s prevalence in South Asian culture? Or what about a candidate who thinks, &quot;the people at this company definitely aren&#x27;t Nazis, clearly this was part of diagram or something.&quot;')
