So we have a few options:<p>* people can do what I said, retrain, maybe move, do something else<p>* people can do nothing and get benefits to sit there doing nothing.<p>I don&#x27;t think there is a third option, but let me know if I&#x27;m missing something?<p>The issue is, 80% of people refuse to the first one. They sit in rust belt towns and die deaths of despair.<p>So what do we do?<p>Trumps solution, which they have chosen, is nothing. We do nothing. No healthcare for them, no improved benefits, no retraining.<p>Since they chose that, I could live with it. But I don&#x27;t want to be tied to them and live with the rest of the shitty things trump wants to do.<p>I&#x27;m more than happy to hear a solution here. I&#x27;ve tried not to blame anyone. I honestly believe that it wasn&#x27;t their fault the coal mine (etc) closed. I just don&#x27;t see an option beyond waiting for them to die before we can progress economically or socially.<p>And that&#x27;s not really acceptable to me. I&#x27;m gay, and I don&#x27;t think I should be forced to be a second class citizen just because other people are bitter about their life and voted for a Fuck Everyone candidate. I&#x27;m sure there are women who will want reproductive health rights that feel the same way. I&#x27;m sympathetic, I came from just suck a place. But there does come a point where I feel like saying &quot;you&#x27;re not dragging me down with you&quot;.<p>Full disclosure: I&#x27;m actually a brit. But we have the exact same thing happening here. Only its Boris Johnson and Brexit (which will last much longer than trumpism).<p>I hope you can understand where I&#x27;m coming from.')
