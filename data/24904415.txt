Back then, the trademark was not even filed by the lawyers (if you look to the USPTO filings), so I&#x27;m not sure how the hostile actor argument could apply here (if we really buy into that argument).<p>As reflected in other comments in this thread, it&#x27;s not in Wasmer intent to trademark WebAssembly. And we successfully course-corrected any actions way before it was even public.<p>We have been continuously pushing the limits of WebAssembly since we were founded. The success of Wasmer as a company solely depends on the success of WebAssembly as a technology, and is on our best interest to continue pushing it forward.<p>In fact, I&#x27;d argue that Wasmer has been pioneer in:<p><pre><code>    1. Open-sourcing the first working Rust WebAssembly runtime (wasmtime existed when I created Wasmer, but was not able to run anything [1])\n    2. Creating a Package Manager for WebAssembly [2]\n    3. Creating WebAssembly embeddings for non-js languages (PHP, Ruby, Python, ...)\n    4. Running WASI fully in a browser, including an online shell [3]\n</code></pre>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;issues&#x2F;142#issuecomment-461129940" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;issues&#x2F;142#issuecomment-4...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wapm.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wapm.io</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webassembly.sh" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webassembly.sh</a>')
