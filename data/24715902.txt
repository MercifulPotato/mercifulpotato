Growing and harvesting good smokeable flower is generally a lot more expensive than just growing biomass for oil. Trimming is also a big expense. If you want untrimmed flower you can buy it by the pound quite cheap and trim it yourself, but then you&#x27;ll see how much labor it is to create a good hand-trim.<p>That said 10 brownies for $30 sounds like a good deal to me.')
