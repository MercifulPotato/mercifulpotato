What is detailed about RDR2? I played it, and its world felt mostly empty and devoid of variation. Even in cities, it severely lacks details, partly owing to the &quot;mundane&quot; historical period it is set in.<p>Cyberpunk has vastly more variation in NPCs, models in general, textures, light sources, and so on. In my playthrough, the largest crowd present in RDR2 was maybe 10 people on screen at the same time. Twenty at best. In my mind, the level of ambition doesn&#x27;t compare, unless you were to limit your Cyberpunk experience to the Badlands.')
