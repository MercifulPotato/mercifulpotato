It is the best client I&#x27;ve ever used, for every single database I&#x27;ve tried it with (mostly Postgres, some SQLite and Redshift as well). Autocomplete just works, it will create schema diagrams for you that are accurate and useful, it&#x27;s data export tools are obvious and fast. I pay for a license personally for use on side projects, and use it at work on a daily basis.')
