There were no hard feelings, the company knew that could happen and could afford it, and of course, why wouldn&#x27;t they? (I mean, I guess it was hoped that sometimes they would prefer working for the consultancy for a while). But it was a kind of experiment, and indeed the experiment showed it was not really a sustainable model, I think they stopped doing that.')
