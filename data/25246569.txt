I had this realization the other day (which might be completely wrong) but it feels like US computing industry is a lot more business focused than the European computing industry. E.g. most DAWs are built by European companies (Ableton, Logic (before Apple acquisition), FL Studio, Reason, Bitwig).<p>Same goes for the demo scene. The demo scene was really big in Europe, but it feels like it was never that big in the US (but I might be wrong).<p>I legit wonder if part of the reason is due to the popularity of Amiga in Europe.')
