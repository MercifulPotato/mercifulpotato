If you track the overall popular vote from day to day, you will see it has increased drastically to a degree that far overshadows the late counts of mail votes in the few states that decided this election.<p>This is because many other states that were not swing states, &quot;red&quot; and &quot;blue&quot;, simply aren&#x27;t getting any attention. But the late counted mail votes in those states have followed the same pattern as PA. If you believe PA is somehow special in this phenomenon, you are wrong.<p>Finally, if you want to complain about your perception of a problem with late votes skewing things, the cause of that comes down to election laws in PA which prevent processing of such votes until election day, which was a law that PA sought to change so results would be known earlier, but they were blocked in this effort by GOP state legislature.')
