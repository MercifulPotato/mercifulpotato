I used autotools for a couple of projects that I wrote in C. Ultimately it wasn’t terrible but I have to say I still don’t understand most of what autotools was doing under the hood, just that it checked which libraries were installed and yelled loudly if the ones I needed weren’t available.<p>Since then I’ve started rolling very simple Makefiles that just call the compiler. cc will complain loudly when it can’t find the right headers, and for these simple projects I don’t need any configuration flags, so why worry about all the machinery of autotools?')
