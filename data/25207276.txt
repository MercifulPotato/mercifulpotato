It&#x27;s our ability to time bind information past our lifetime. We can use oral traditions, or write down what we have learned. And the next generation doesn&#x27;t have to start from scratch. And thus you get exponential growth in knowledge.<p>It is complex language that separates us.<p>As a data point, it is true some crows have taught their nestlings how to use cars to crack shells to get at the tasty tidbits inside, but that learning doesn&#x27;t seem to have propagated very far.')
