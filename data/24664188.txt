Secret shopping isn&#x27;t illegal, and using tools to secret shop isn&#x27;t illegal either. Going after camera manufacturers because they are tools used to secret shop <i>certainly</i> isn&#x27;t illegal, even if the camera was called the &quot;SecretShopper 3000&quot; and paid you to do it.<p>The users on the other hand, if they were unaware of what the extensions were doing in exchange for that money, might have a case against the extension manufacturers. But how could Facebook possibly have standing?<p>Not a lawyer, the above are feelings.')
