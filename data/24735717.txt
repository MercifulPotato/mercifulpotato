Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602289263, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24733764, text='&gt; The objection you and others are making to TFA is that you can&#x27;t choose to be apolitical, because everything is political. Your contribution is to propose that people might claim things are apolitical to prevent people from realizing the truth about how political they actually are.<p>You&#x27;re still not really getting what I was saying.  Directly claiming something is apolitical won&#x27;t actually create the state I was talking about.  To do that you actually have to get a bunch of influential people to talk about some political idea like it was obviously some kind of natural or social law or something.<p>Not everything is political, but many people are ignorant of the political nature of many things.<p>&gt; Your appeal to newspeak is pretty pointless, as it applies only inasmuch as it does to anyone who might claim that something is its opposite, for example the slogans &quot;the personal is political&quot; and &quot;silence is violence&quot;.<p>You&#x27;re thinking about the slogans like &quot;freedom is slavery,&quot; which weren&#x27;t Newspeak and would have been unexpressible in it.<p>&gt; But you haven&#x27;t really contributed anything to the conversation. You&#x27;re just saying &quot;ah, but what if they&#x27;re &#x2F;lying&#x2F;! To &#x2F;trick us&#x2F;!&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m contributing the the conversion that you want to have, which makes it a little baffling why you&#x27;re engaging with me and not one of &quot;the others&quot; who seem to be who you really want to engage with.')
