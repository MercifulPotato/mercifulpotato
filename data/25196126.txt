I&#x27;ve used plenty of other editors on CP&#x2F;M and now that I&#x27;ve got used to ED I just don&#x27;t find them as quick or often as powerful as ED.  That doesn&#x27;t mean that they don&#x27;t have extra features that can be useful, but considering how little I use those extra features I think ED comes out in front for me.  I think the accompanying video demonstrates quite well how easy it is to use.')
