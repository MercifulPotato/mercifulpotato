I assume he got north of 125k for a top dev job not 70k<p>You could grow a lot as an engineer in three months in the right environment assuming a guided curriculum is able to channel your energies in the right places and teachers&#x2F;fellow students are able to help as well. I imagine you could also be bored for 3 months, or overly stressed for 3 months, and have negative feelings in regards to that experience. Like most things in life, its not right for everyone and its not wrong for everyone.<p>I have lots of friends who&#x27;ve paid for coding bootcamps, most are rather content with the services provided. I know some students as well that feel they were swindled out of cash because they weren&#x27;t able to get a top tier job right out of the program and resorted to previous career path that they were already unhappy with.<p>I think its great that the good bootcamps that show success are trying to branch out to more normal learners, not just the greatly gifted or qualified (like an Ivy league degree) few, it is a noble sign that these schools are trying to expand using their special sauce to help more averagely qualified student transition into professional software engineering. Ivy league schools, do not do this. They have hundreds of years of success and don&#x27;t feel the need to teach more students every year. (in regards to their on campus facilities not online programs that clearly dont offer the same experience)<p>If Lambda or the other top tier bootcamps capped their programs at 10 students a year or cohort, all of whom had ivy degrees or significant personal experience, all of whom who would get jobs immediately out of school, they would better be able to keep their graduation rates&#x2F;salary rates top notch, they wouldnt have any students complaining online,<p>I commend them for trying to expand and help more students, and im sure they will stumble and get better as time goes on.<p>None of the good bootcamp schools that I am aware of just ignore feedback, because they know students will stop going to the school if feedback is ignored as they dont have hundreds of millions of dollars in funding like universities do.')
