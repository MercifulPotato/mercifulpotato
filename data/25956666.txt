Item(by='skissane', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611924297, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25951705, text='&gt; It reminds me of a pet peeve of mine, the term “on the spectrum” for autistic people.<p>That&#x27;s a pet peeve of mine too, but for a different reason – there is more than one spectrum in the DSM-5. There is a whole big section entitled &quot;<i>Schizophrenia Spectrum</i> Disorders and Other Psychotic Disorders&quot;. The concept of &quot;obsessive compulsive spectrum&quot; was also considered for inclusion in DSM-5, but ultimately didn&#x27;t make it, but if you look at the work group list inside the front matter, one of the work groups was called &quot;Anxiety, <i>Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum</i>, Posttraumatic, and Dissociative Disorders&quot;. And there are other spectrums discussed in the literature of psychology and psychiatry, such as the &quot;bipolar spectrum&quot;, although that isn&#x27;t mentioned in the DSM-5. People who say &quot;the spectrum&quot; instead of &quot;the autism spectrum&quot; appear to be ignorant of those other spectrums.')
