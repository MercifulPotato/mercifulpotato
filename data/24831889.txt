I hate that it exists, I hate that it is used, and most of all I hate that it is popular. It&#x27;s irrational hatred (I think distate is legitamate), but I can&#x27;t deny it. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my general aversion to gamer culture, or the fact that it&#x27;s an electron application, or that it just came out of nowhere, and suddenly was everywhere. I decide not to use it, but still feel left out. I&#x27;m glad and sad.\nI go out of my way to ensure that my contacts don&#x27;t use Discord. At the begining of the pandemic, my friends wanted to use it (the TeamSpeak server we used to use was full), but it didn&#x27;t work on my end, AFAIK because of strict browser policies. Luckly we swiched to mumble, and it works great. The effort to configure it at first it greater, and the defaults can be improved, but I&#x27;m far happier this way, without being sucked into another horrible service.')
