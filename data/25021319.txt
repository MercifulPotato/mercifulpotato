Not by looking at two yes&#x2F;no outcomes. This is the exact point they are trying to get across, which you wrote off as annoying.<p>You do raise an interesting point about the betting markets - I too am very curious about whether they have a better track record than people like Nate Silver. Looking forward to someone analyzing their relative accuracy over a large sample of independent elections.')
