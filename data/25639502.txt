We thought this as well, bought a subscription to test it and talked with their support telling 500 websites cost $500&#x2F;month. We spent time setting this up and when we asked a second support person, they said for over 100 websites we need to buy their $2000&#x2F;month package.<p>Nowhere in their pricing page shows this and support reps don&#x27;t even know their pricing clearly. We ended up wasting time with them.')
