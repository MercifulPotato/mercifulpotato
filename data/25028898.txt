We won&#x27;t.<p>People who cared about this in the UK; our best bet was to stay in the EU which is not nearly so extreme about it as the UK is. The current UK government is looking forwards to jettisoning the protections and human rights that were afforded us by being in the EU.<p>That said, the current UK government is fantastically inept. Everything they touch turns to shit, and any time BoJo says he absolutely won&#x27;t do something - he&#x27;ll crumble in a fortnight (see e.g. every EU negotiation, Lockdown 2.0, the feeding children fiasco, etc etc).<p>There are current UK ministers whose names have become bywords for incompetency and government fuckup. If the UK decided to ban encryption tomorrow, and the government put their best people on it, we&#x27;d be looking at a decade or so before they got anywhere. The EU are heading to a more moderate place, but they will get there faster by virtue of not being British; by not having to do it via the dream team of Johnson, Cummings, and whoever is in charge of screwing up everything they touch this week (Chris Grayling, the man who paid millions to a ferry company that had never owned, chartered, leased or in any other way been involved with a ferry or single ferry route, historically takes this role).')
