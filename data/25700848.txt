The studies that this figure are drawn from are generally twin studies based in wealthy Western nations. Heritability tends to increase with wealth, economic equality, and ethnic homogeneity, all of which are unfortunately selected for in the formation of these trials. This paradigm is thought to be a gold standard, as it reduces independent variables, but it fails to capture the effects of intergroup environmental disparities in a profound way.<p>The range of SAT scores at a US prep academy populated with the progeny of relatively closely related families will be substantially determined by heritable differences between individuals. Outside of that, it&#x27;s disingenuous and irresponsible to throw out that 80% figure as a general measure of intelligence heritability. In fact, not even the studies say <i>that</i>: 80% is the measure for middle-aged and senior adults. For everyone else, even their measures are substantially lower.')
