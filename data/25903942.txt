And humans ground their experience in each other.<p>A very clear example of this is my experience of introducing people to Surströmming.<p>You could find countless videos on Youtube of people doing the &quot;Surströmming challenge&quot;. They all come expecting the &quot;smelliest food in the world&quot;, barf bags ready, giggling friend holding the camera. The results are predictable. People start barfing as soon as the can is opened.<p>If the novice instead comes to a proper meal setting, with plates and cutlery rather than the barf bags, the experience will be different. Nobody else at the table is freaking out. so why would you? When the smell hits (it&#x27;s similar Kimchi) maybe the novice will make a comment about it, but that&#x27;s all. Not everybody will take to Surströmming on their first try, though many do. But I&#x27;ve never seen anything even close to the Youtube freakouts. Expectations matter a lot.')
