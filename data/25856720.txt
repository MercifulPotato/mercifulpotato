It is hesychasm, and it would have been nice for the article to do a more thorough dive into the roots of this practice in Christianity – and I mean <i>all</i> Christianity, not solely the Catholic church where it was demonized, but the <i>other</i> side of Christianity where it was adopted as a core tenet.<p>I&#x27;m referring to Eastern Orthodox, which would have simply been &quot;Christianity&quot; to Dostoevsky. Hesychasm was a sort of ritual prayer to retire &quot;inward&quot; and away from all the senses in order to achieve a more direct union with God, often by using a word or a mantra to concentrate and free the mind. This practice was characterized as &quot;magic&quot; or &quot;mysticism&quot; by Western Christianity [1], as was alluded to in the article.<p>In any case, it dates from Gregory Palamas in the 13th-14th century, ahead of Molinos&#x27; 17th. Interestingly, there is a lot of argument about whether hesychasm is quietism, even though quietism is the translation of the term hesychasm – my guess is because nowadays the Catholic church is trying to be more friendly with the practices of the Orthodox,  recognizing them as fellow Christians, but trying to avoid contradicting its previous word.
