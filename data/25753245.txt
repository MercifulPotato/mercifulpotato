There&#x27;s a great ecosystem of packages on pfSense, that you can install via the web UI - making it a really feature-packed for a homelab.<p>However, recently I&#x27;ve been moving to VyOS to pfSense, which is basically a stripped-down Linux distro, with a heavily tuned FRR routing stack built on top of it.<p>VyOS is an open-source fork of Vyatta, which was previously owned&#x2F;released by Brocade networks.<p>It operates with a CLI, like many enterprise&#x2F;commercial routing products. It takes a bit of getting used to, but it&#x27;s really great to use in practice, and makes it easy to diff configurations, or rollback changes, or copy the same configuration across multiple devices.<p>And of course, it implements with config-management software like SaltStack&#x2F;Ansible (via Napalm), which is something that pfSense. If you have multiple pfSense devices, you basically need to point&#x2F;click via the web UI on each one.<p>For APs - Ruckus is great, as is HPE&#x2F;Aruba (they have a new low-cost line that&#x27;s targeting the Prosumer market) - they have both been leaders in the wifi field for ages, and have things like AP handover, RF tuning&#x2F;optimisation, adaptive antennas etc down pat.')
