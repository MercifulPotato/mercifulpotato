They may very well help catch more criminals, but police need to have probable cause and can&#x27;t just go on fishing expeditions.<p>As far as a _federal_ mask mandate, it&#x27;s clearly not within the enumerated powers. I think you could potentially make an argument for state&#x2F;local mask mandates when it comes to _public_ areas, given that all powers not granted to the federal goverment are reserved for the states and the people. I would still probably consider that authoritarian in nature.<p>That&#x27;s just for masks as well. As far as locking down or limiting size of gatherings, while it may be a very good idea to do something like that during a pandemic, Imo it wouldn&#x27;t be constitutional, as the freedom of assembly is explicitly protected in the first amendment.<p>Freedom can be dangerous, but I prefer it to the alternative.')
