Even the Mongolians (Song dynasty) and the Manchurian (Qing dynasty) rulers adopted those methods to maintain power during the consolidation phases.<p>The Tibetans are a great example. Both the Mongolian and Manchurian descended rulers had left Tibet as an autonomous region primarily because the rulers themselves were Buddhist. However, the Qing dynasty had asserted state power over the theocratic rule of the Tibetan lamas, including changing how the tulkas (such as the Dalai Lama) were identified and selected. That all happened in mid-1800s.<p>The contemporary assimilation of Tibet comes from well-used playbook the Chinese have employed:<p><pre><code>  1. Suppression of the written language and standardizing on the same written script\n  2. Suppression or assimilation of cultural symbols and ideas\n  3. Imprisonment or subornment of cultural leaders (such as the monks and nuns, or if you read this whole drama: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dorje_Shugden_controversy ... the main protest organization got shut down when allegations of funding from the Chinese intelligence apparatus came out)\n  3. Colonization by assimilated groups\n  4. Creation of economic and trade ties (such as the railway that was built all the way to Lhasa).\n</code></pre>\nEvery year, Tibet is less and less Tibet, and more and more Chinese.<p>You can actually see some of this going on, if less aggressively, in Africa. China, after all, have a rich history in developing and maintaining vassal states.<p>These are things the US is not willing to do. And I am not saying that it is ethical or moral. The result though is that China has far greater cultural unity than the US currently has.')
