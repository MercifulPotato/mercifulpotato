The prescription mills force heavy handed regulations that spook the insurers and hospital legal teams, which leaves two extremes: on the one hand are doctors who can&#x27;t empathize with the patient and are super strict with any sort of scheduled medication and on the other are doctors whose offices don&#x27;t see enough patients taking those drugs (or even a single problematic case), so they neither know nor care about the risks and give the drug out freely. Since their numbers are so low, no one thinks to bring up the issue.<p>The doctors who are most qualified in making the determination are often the ones with the most legitimate patients taking those drugs but all the legal teams and regulators are completely incapable of differentiating them from the prescription mills (excuse me, &quot;pain management centers&quot;).')
