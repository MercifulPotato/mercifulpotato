While nowadays there would be tech for implementing that, historically it has not been so, so the momentum of the history is perhaps making advancements slow?<p>There were some new cameras introduced here some time back which were advertised to be able to have quality sufficient to detect that seat belts and cell phones: but still, pictures were taken only when exceeding the speed limit, so those factors could not be used as the primary source.')
