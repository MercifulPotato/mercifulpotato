But working in teams, or even mutiple teams on the same software, then go solves a lot of problems for you..<p>Yeah its a dumb language, missing a  lot of features. But there is only 1 way to program, dependency management is sane (no circular dependencies), and the language is build for readability, not for writing code fast and elegantly...<p>Often short dense code with complex types is just really hard to read for your overage joe programmer.<p>We&#x27;re not all computer scientists here.<p>Go is designed to write maintainable server side programs that can utilize concurrency in computer these days. Therefore they left out generics... I hope its coming.\nI do wish error handling and generics where part of the language... And a tuple type indeed.')
