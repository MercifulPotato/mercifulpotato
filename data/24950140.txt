I studied the related protein CRY2 for part of my PhD (ironically not why I joined the lab), and now I’m doing human genomics research. It’s encouraging that this recently described heritable mutation causing familial DSPD is getting more attention. Most normal chronotypes (non-night owls) don’t even know DSPD is a thing.  The Facebook groups for DSPD are full of truly emotional stories about how hard life with DSPD is.  They are also full of people connecting over relief and validation that we’re neither freaks nor consciously at fault for our late schedules.<p>Unfortunately, accessible genetic testing is probably a long way away.  It looks like 23andMe won’t tell you if you have this mutation;  the variant rs184039278 that causes CRY1 Δ11 disappointingly isn’t part of their panel.  Whole exome sequencing might  work, or might not, depending on the capture kit.  But if you suspect you have DSPD, my advice is to see a sleep doctor as soon as possible to get a diagnosis. You’ll get prescribed a morning light box like I did.  Your brain will get tricked into thinking it’s later than it actually is.  It’s not a cure, but life and the 9-5 should get a little bit easier.')
