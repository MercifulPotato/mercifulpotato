Back in High School, I was a bit mystified as to why Le Chatelier&#x27;s principle should be so nearly universally applicable, until I realized that the sample set is extremely biased... if a chemical system isn&#x27;t even metastable, it doesn&#x27;t get much broad attention.  Stable or metastable chemical systems must have locally stabilizing responses to change.  Even for things like combustion reactions, we mostly study stable flames, except for niche studies.<p>I realized there&#x27;s a generalization of Le Chatelier&#x27;s principle that&#x27;s almost a truism for any system that exhibits something approaching short-term stability or short-term bounded oscillation.<p>If some brain state weren&#x27;t locally corrective, then it would be a transient brain state, and excluded from the most intuitive notion of normal brain behavior.  So, we&#x27;d expect that for normal brain behaviors, we&#x27;d see corrective responses to change.')
