It will be sobering to see what it is after corona. Perhaps half of adults will be unable to find work.<p>Additionally, for the first time in history, we are close to &quot;general vision AI&quot;, which will have an effect on unskilled labor. (In Silicon Valley, OpenCV is already commonly used to elimainate QA staff.)<p>So I don&#x27;t see how looking at stats from 150 years ago is relevant at all.<p>And the US has a horrible track record on job re-training, as in virtually none.<p>Your optimistic post applies to US coastal computer programmers, but is completely tone-deaf to most other people who actively switch employers for even $1&#x2F;hour more.<p>The US has also created a self-inflicted wound on college students with debts that will destroy fertility and financial progress for most young people. Western society is ill from a thousand cuts, but worst of all in the US. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the birth rate halves in the next decade.')
