See the discussion about speed gains Apple got from accelerating common calls in their OS.  You will never convince a bin part&#x2F;least common denominator manufacturer like Intel or AMD to do that.<p>Just because other ARM cores suck today doesn&#x27;t mean they have to forever.  Apple&#x27;s don&#x27;t.  They took it seriously.  Perhaps Amazon is too and we are just at the start of their journey.  It took Apple over 10 years to get to where we are with the M1.<p>You cited one of the significant contributors to performance -  the 8-wide decode.  x86 is hamstrung to 4 because of legacy.  We aren&#x27;t at the beginning of the story with ARM for performance, but ARM certainly isn&#x27;t nearly as hamstrung out the gate by the legacy of x86 either.<p>Heck, is there anyone making a pure 64 bit x64 chip?  There&#x27;s a bunch of overhead right there.<p>Your right that ARM isn&#x27;t magical - but ARM does have the potential for significantly more runway and headroom.  The trade off is backwards compatibility.  As most code continues to move further and further away from direct hardware interaction, is that backwards compatibility as valuable overall as it was 20 years ago? 10 years ago?<p>I guess we will find out :)')
