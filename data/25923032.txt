If you have to keep N variables in mind, its about the same if they&#x27;re at current depth or 1 level deep.<p>To me the most evil form of DRY is when you get functions calling functions with arguments that are just passthrough. If a function only uses an argument to call a subfunction, it&#x27;s a sign that those functions should be decoupled and better orchestrated.')
