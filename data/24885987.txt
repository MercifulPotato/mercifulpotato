Item(by='Fnoord', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603631127, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24885849, text='&gt; Whenever I had a chance to run on nvidia binary drivers, the only things I occasionally missed were some new features, or having to wait a bit longer to update the kernel. Stability was better, drivers more performant, and I don&#x27;t remember daily fighting with memory leaks.<p>I had a Nvidia Riva TNT2 and later on an Nvidia GeForce. I ran Linux on it.<p>I had stability issues with the driver, but I solved it the following way: ran one X server with a DE, and another X server with Nvidia&#x27;s proprietary driver (mostly for games). This way, if I had to kill the X server using Nvidia&#x27;s driver I didn&#x27;t lose any work.<p>If that wasn&#x27;t enough, all the bloody time there were massive security problems found in Nvidia&#x27;s proprietary driver. I don&#x27;t know if that is still the case, cause I switched away to ATi in the 00s, and Intel graphics cards + ThinkPad as laptop. ATi&#x2F;AMD has come a long way ever since. Their FOSS drivers are stable, and they deliver (see various Phoronix benchmarks).')
