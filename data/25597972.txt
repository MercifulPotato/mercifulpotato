No user request or bug report gets lost. Issues with insufficient info get followed up on by an ops&#x2F;support person. All feedback and actions go into the ticket. Something that can be worked around is documented and resolved. True bugs get logged to the dev backlog and linked to the support ticket. Works like a charm. The users can see the ticket history without really learning much about JIRA. Devs in know exactly how the issue was reported and triaged. Probably 3&#x2F;4 of issues are resolved without a dev ever being roped in. And no user ever wonders what happened to their request.')
