This is true even of existing fossil fuels, though we tend not to think of it that way.<p>2) The process of converting CO2 to hydrocarbon fuels leads to a decrease in atmospheric carbon.  Burning these fuels or fossil fuels (what I assume you mean by &quot;the existing process&quot;) produces an increase in atmospheric carbon.<p>This means it&#x27;s possible to create a net-positive, net-neutral, or net-negative outcome with respect to atmospheric CO2 concentration depending on how you balance these two processes.<p>As you point out, &quot;zero emission&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean the same thing as &quot;no net CO2 release&quot;; rather, it more often means &quot;zero emissions of CO2 at the point of energy usage,&quot; with CO2 emissions usually occurring elsewhere.  That said, with a system of hydrocarbon fuel production from air-captured CO2 it is genuinely possible to have &quot;zero emission&quot; mean &quot;zero net emission of CO2 over the entire energy transport process.&quot;<p>EDIT: The key enabling technology is, of course, carbon-free renewable energy, of which solar is likely to represent the lions&#x27; share as time passes.')
