Europe &#x2F; African Dictator.<p>This &#x27;riot&#x27; was incited by as sitting President and attacked part of the electoral process, for that reason it&#x27;s <i>much</i> scarier than any of the possible excessive damage during the summer. Although in fairness, burning down Police Stations is also much more than just &#x27;burning a building&#x27; as well.<p>Buildings can be replaced, Democracies cannot.')
