It could instead involve an out-of-band app store, where accessing a URL zero-installs a heavily-sandboxed plugin required to view it, and loads it into the browser. (Implementations of this: iOS App Clips; Sandstorm grains.) But those apps are usually still created by the same developer as the document anyway, so there&#x27;s little difference between this out-of-band zero-install app approach, and having Turing-complete web documents. Either way, the developer of Boogle Maps can still mine bitcoin in the background while you have the map loaded.')
