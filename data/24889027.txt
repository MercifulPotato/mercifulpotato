For example, do you prefer desktop clients because of feature superiority and&#x2F;or better OS integration? Do you generally prefer web clients when you&#x27;re performing an ad-hoc task and&#x2F;or need on-to-go&#x2F;quick access to something?<p>I&#x27;m curious to learn more about folks workflows and how they incorporate web vs. desktop clients into it effectively. For folks that are using web clients, I&#x27;m also really interested to how how many of you are installing PWAs when available.')
