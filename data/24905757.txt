Have you been to say the US or Australia (both very low density)? &quot;Private property NO TRESPASSING&quot; signs everywhere. Very few official trails. If you want to walk from A to B you better have one of those trails or you find yourself walking next to a road (without sidewalk).<p>Compared to here (high population density, Germany) or say the Alps, where you can use any road used for forestry or farming. The only thing you can&#x27;t access is small gardens in relatively high density villages.')
