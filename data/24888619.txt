Diversified portfolios tend to have better risk-adjusted returns because their returns of individual investments are (supposed to be) relatively uncorrelated. Financial risk managers are always on the lookout for previously unidentified correlations between investments in their portfolio since that might increase the risks beyond what what has been agreed upon as acceptable with the clients.<p>The payoffs of multiple career tracks on the other hand are almost never uncorrelated. First off there is the obvious case that it is the same person doing all of them. This makes all labor-intensive careers very correlated in matters when a single event touches their health. Also, investment success of one stock usually means nothing (neither negtive nor positive) for other stocks in your portfolio. In most careers though, the payout of many careers is heavily tilted towards the higher end of the achievement spectrum and that may not be attainable without a full-time investment into that career. I don&#x27;t think anyone would argue that an athlete dividing their time between three or more sports has a really good chance of becoming a professional in any of those, for example, because to be a professional athlete you need to be at the very top of the game and can&#x27;t afford to spend 66% of your available practice time on other things. The correlation of these activities is actually very far from zero and therefore diversifying careers does not make sense from the start from an risk-management perspective. The rest of the article builds on that flawed premise.')
