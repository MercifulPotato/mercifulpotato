VR is going to have to get to the &quot;pick up and play within 60 seconds&quot; level of convenience before I spend any more money on it.  Getting my glasses to fit correctly in the headset is a pain. Adjusting the focus when I put it on is a pain. Software that tells me everything is working fine when I have no picture is a pain. Setting up the play area every time I start up because I breathed too hard since last time is a pain. Not being able to recommend it to anyone I know because they&#x27;ll rely on me to sort out the problems is a massive pain.<p>When I tell someone to buy a Nintendo I know they&#x27;re not going to call me to complain about how annoying it is to use.')
