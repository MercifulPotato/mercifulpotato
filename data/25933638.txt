It is also &quot;batteries included&quot;, and does give you more tools out of the box for backend work. It&#x27;s actually really nice to work with and maintain in my opinion.<p>I would say though, that for very quickly creating new applications that get the job done, js has been the fastest for me. And while django and similar give you more database stuff to work with, honestly that feels like a solved problem, and it&#x27;s often easier to not have to do any backend work at all, and instead use something like hasura. And next does include backend code too for functions that you need to write for the backend.<p>Obviously, this isn&#x27;t ideal for a lot of problems. I think if you can get away with it, you can be really productive. I&#x27;ve made crud apps for work with this stack in very little time.')
