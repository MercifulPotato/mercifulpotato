It&#x27;s also fraud handling, forex, invoicing, marketing, distribution, and fees for apple to operate the marketplace, plus their cut. I&#x27;m not going to defend 30% as the number, nor the _enforced_ 30% cut, but the 10x cut is not an apples to apples comparison. It&#x27;s the equivalent of saying &quot;just use OVH instead of AWS&quot;')
