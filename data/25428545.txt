Item(by='ChrisMarshallNY', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608024670, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25426976, text='The author, himself, seems to be a pretty interesting chap.<p>There’s many axes to these graphs, and we constantly try to boil it down to simple 2-axis plots.<p>For example, there’s smart, then there’s <i>driven</i>. I have worked with many very intelligent folks that fall to pieces, when unpredictable things happen, or when presented with challenging conundrums.<p>I knew someone who was definitely <i>not</i> a gifted, intelligent person, and was quite aware of that. I won’t go into his story, but he had a lot of personal challenges that most folks would consider “showstoppers.” It would have been quite easy to throw in the towel, and give up on a future.<p>He did not. He worked hard, for many years, and refused to let the attacks and sneers stop him. He pursued education in the IT field, after his original vocation was eaten by new tech. He was the oldest (and, likely, most-tattooed) person in his classes.<p>He ended up working at one of the most prestigious labs in the world, and was obviously valued by his employers. He worked there for a decade, before his unexpected death, earlier this year.<p>If people here knew of the particular challenges this person faced (not my story to tell), I guarantee that mandibles would be hitting the floor.<p>He was definitely below average in many ways, but above average in other, very important, ways.<p>No matter how much we have on the ball, we all have weaknesses, which will never be addressed, if we refuse to see them, and we often have strengths that we may never know, until the fecal matter hits the air circulation device.')
