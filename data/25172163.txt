Id highly recommend looking into the features&#x2F;extensions of postgres, there&#x27;s a lot of great stuff that goes beyond just being a database which can save a lot of time and grief depending on the application.<p>There is a risk of mixing storage&#x2F;business logic, and you might end up being tied to postgres, but it&#x27;s manageable using functions&#x2F;views&#x2F;schemas. And its also a really convenient place to do some business logic, as all your data is right there and available via a very expressive&#x2F;extensible query language.')
