They activate identity and trigger negative partisanship. Simply trying to refute lies only embeds them further. Profiting from the outrage machine (dopamine addiction) has created a vicious cycle, and worse every year.<p>Is this really what we want?<p>The founders had the notion that democracy requires an informed populace. When the audience of NY Post, Fox News, OANN, and others are objectively, stubbornly anti-informed, how is democracy served?<p>What&#x27;s the alternative to censorship? How does Truth prevail in the public square?<p>Even Good Samaritan Chomsky has no response to the Paradox of Tolerance.<p>--<p>For my part, I think it&#x27;s hysterical that Facebook and Twitter censored a NY Post. That&#x27;s like the biggest dealer of crack cocaine indignantly tossing a hit of molly in the trash, because that crap ain&#x27;t no good for y&#x27;all.<p>I&#x27;m still baffled why any one would get their news from NY Post, Facebook, or Twitter. It&#x27;s quite a stretch to call any of that &quot;news&quot;. So I don&#x27;t see how allegations of censorship even apply.')
