They wanted to program computers all their lives. They were born for it. After spending six, eight, ten years in the industry, they quit for good. Now they&#x27;re running breweries and hydroponic farms, with no desire to ever again touch a compiler, let alone get back into the fray.<p>Are these people who also made a ton of money via RSUs or Stock Options? If so, the answer is clear, right? They simply... don&#x27;t have to work on things they don&#x27;t care about. They have the money they need.<p>Slava mentions doctors later on as a contrasting point, and I think that case is the same. If they became overnight millionaires, lots of them would stop putting up with the daily drudgery.')
