What have you found worked\nin terms of being able to put users first\ninstead of higher ups in the chain of command?<p>Search:<p>- I tried 3 search queries and no results.<p>- It looks like the entire corpus is only 97 entries.\n  I would suggest considering removing search all together,\n  and instead just putting the data in a single packed\n  table. You can fit 100 rows of data in 3 scrolls.\n  Then someone can &quot;search with their eyes&quot; or even ctrl+f.<p>- As a rule of thumb, I try to wait until I have over 10,000\n  rows before I add any type of search to a page. At the very\n  least, I never add search when I have less than 1,000 items.\n  Measure the time it takes people to find things and you&#x27;ll\n  see probably a 10x speed up if you go to a single page.<p>Information Density:<p>A general critique I have is that there is\nvery low information density on this site.<p>You could fit 1,000% more information on these pages.<p>A book I highly, highly recommend, that you can buy used\nfor only $1.49, is New York Times Page One:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;New-York-Times-Page-One&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1578660882" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;New-York-Times-Page-One&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1578660882</a><p>NYTimes has been serving the people of America for over a century,\nand so you&#x27;ll see the patterns they&#x27;ve evolved over the past 100+\nyears. One of the main ones is high information density.\nI would try and cram more and more on the page. People that need\nbigger fonts and more accessibility have a range of tools on their\ndevices to transform sites into accessible version for them. Now\nI&#x27;ve been in places where leaders pushed back against this, but I\ncan tell you for a fact that your numbers will skyrocket if you\ngo to higher information density which will increase the odds\npeople will find the info they are looking for in a shorter time\nperiod and eventually come back to your site.<p>Visualizations:<p>I would put search in a corner, and one of your\nmost interesting visualizations front and center!\nWhat are the top 10 coolest stories you&#x27;ve found while\nworking on this site, with this data? Bring some of those to life!<p>Great stuff!
