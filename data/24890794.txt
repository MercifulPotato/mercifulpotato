I have the keyboard, mouse and monitor on a sort of &#x27;breakfast in bed tray&#x27; type thing I made. This tray fits on top of a little desk I made. So I can work at the desk or in a bed sitting up on cushions if I want.<p>When I&#x27;m not in my computer room I dont want to be using a computer anyway, so theres no downside for me.')
