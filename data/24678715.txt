I have a distant grand uncle and an uncle both in the B club. They were essentially waved through to set up shop in UP - even though they&#x27;re Muslim, openly religious and practicing, and have literally been photographed very often inviting Rahul Gandhi and other Congress leaders to their homes right before elections.<p>Money talks.
