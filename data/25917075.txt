I recommend it every now and then to friends or coworkers because I haven&#x27;t met a single person yet who&#x27;s seen that show. Very underrated.<p>My only gripe was that it seemed in season one, they tried a bit too hard to add drama to the show to appeal to a broader audience that isn&#x27;t that interested in the technical stuff. Especially Joe Macmillan just felt over the top and just not credible at times. They made up for it in season two though, adding a lot of back-story for him and making him just more consistent in general. But even then, season one is still the best imo.')
