The article is pitched at leakers but it could just as likely be pitched at journalists.  If you consume news from an outlet that doesn’t follow The Intercept’s advice then complain immediately to the editor.<p>When you leak something it needs to be credible.  Removing watermarks also reduces the fidelity and therefore the credibility.  If 99% of the screen is blurred and the audio has been transcribed then how does the receiver know this is a real leak at all?<p>The answer lies in reputation.  Leak high fidelity material to a trusted third party, usually a journalist.  This can include just showing them the material though that involves meeting in person.  They will verify the source material, summarise and down sample it to conceal the source actor, and maybe even destroy the source material itself.<p>The economics are simple: if you get a reputation for revealing sources then people will stop leaking secrets to you.  Newsrooms that rebroadcast Zoom caps verbatim are revealing sources and need to clean up their act if we are to continue to rely on what’s left of <i>The Fourth Estate</i>.')
