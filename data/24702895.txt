I recounted a particular experience I had, and some people extrapolated that into a claim that all of the South is uniformly homophobic or some other statement I&#x27;m being held to which I didn&#x27;t make.<p>If I&#x27;m actually making general statements, I would say that big cities in the South are more gay friendly, though they&#x27;re still impacted by state politics and as you enter the suburbs and especially rural areas you encounter much more bias. Two hours north of Atlanta is much worse than two hours north of San Francisco. If push came to shove, I&#x27;d feel more welcomed in Atlanta ITP than in many parts of the Central Valley; but I&#x27;m also not particularly interested in grading on a curve. But everyone&#x27;s mileage will vary, and all the tradeoffs involved are complicated and will differ between different people and even in the same person at different times in their life.<p>These subtleties are lost, though, because my comment wasn&#x27;t intended to provide a comprehensive overview of life as an LGBT person in the South, but to counter someone who was writing off someone else&#x27;s experience as merely a way to feel virtuous about their self instead of anything real. It&#x27;s a common response to many negative experiences from marginalized groups, so I see it as perfectly natural that I drew on my own experiences to call it out.')
