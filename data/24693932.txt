Item(by='linguae', descendants=None, kids=[24694030], score=None, time=1601947672, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24693667, text='There&#x27;s one issue: what if the only homes available in exurban areas are large, single family homes?  I would love to buy a brand-new modestly-sized single-family house under 1,000 sq ft in an exurb like Tracy or Hollister provided that it&#x27;s in the high $300K or low $400K range.  I believe there are many people who wouldn&#x27;t mind purchasing a condo or townhouse in an exurb.  The problem is I don&#x27;t see many being built in these areas, although in the downtowns of these places there are older single-family houses that are of modest size.  Every now and then I see townhomes in exurbia that start at roughly 1,300 sq ft., but that&#x27;s it.<p>Here&#x27;s something I&#x27;m wondering: why are there no suburban or exurban developments that strive to build new versions of Downtown Palo Alto or Downtown Mountain View, with walkable commercial areas, some apartments and condos near these commercial areas, and some modestly-sized houses built a little further away but still within walking distance to the commercial core?  Suppose developers built a &quot;New Palo Alto&quot; near Tracy or Hollister, which is within commuting distance from Silicon Valley.  I&#x27;d buy in a heartbeat.')
