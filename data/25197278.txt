If built with longevity in mind, wood framed houses can last around five hundred years, which is more than enough time for technological advancement to allow us to deal with excess carbon by then. Even if they&#x27;re only designed as typical buildings are, it&#x27;s still a good fifty years of buffer as wood in a house in addition to the buffer as they were growing as trees.<p>Forests are a real part of the solution.')
