I was there 10 years ago, and it was surprising just how much of that country remained scarred from the war in the 90s. Especially in the countryside it was common to see shot up old concrete buildings. Painful reminders, but a lovely country where even middle class travelers like myself could afford to eat excellent fresh local seafood and wine with every meal, and it was lovely to have my cousins from Bosnia stop by for a day in Dubrovnik.')
