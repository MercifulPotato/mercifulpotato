The build farm is just another user that builds everything from source.  If it didn&#x27;t catch up with the builds because someone just changed a package definition then you might be requesting a binary that hasn&#x27;t yet been built.<p>Slow download appears to depend a lot on location to an extent that we suspect peering problems.  The main build farm&#x27;s head node is connected to the internet from a well-connected research campus with dual 10G.  Multiple tests have concluded that the configuration from server-side software, to network hardware of the server, down to networking in the data centre is sane.<p>Maybe we&#x27;ll have to bite the bullet and (again) use a CDN to better serve users that inexplicably experience slow connections.')
