But I think society is in a bad place already. This incident showed how vulnerable we are to the arbitrary whims of big tech (not just social media), who increasingly are becoming gatekeepers&#x2F;editors&#x2F;censors rather than providing neutral platforms. In this case, Twitter was caught red handed because of a long history of other &#x27;hacked material&#x27; that has been allowed on their platform (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thefederalist.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;11-hacks-leaks-and-hoaxes-that-twitter-and-facebook-didnt-throttle-because-they-hurt-trump&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thefederalist.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;11-hacks-leaks-and-hoax...</a>), but bias&#x2F;deplatforming&#x2F;censoring has become so bad that I would have not been surprised at all if they made no change to the policy and just continued operating with open political bias.')
