I think this is a left&#x2F;right brain dichotomy here. I learned git on my first software dev job and learned it _deeply_ by executing on the command line. This infused a deep, practical understanding of how the distributed system worked.<p>Alsoâ€”I&#x27;m a language guy. Picking up languages, reading in other languages, just &quot;clicks&quot; for me. But math? Pffft. Forget it. I barely scraped myself out of college with my CS degree intact.<p>I learned Russian and Spanish just for fun!<p>My theory is that git is learned like a language and retained like a language. Tools like &quot;GitKraken&quot; are just &quot;Duolingo&quot; for your brain. They don&#x27;t replace immersion learning when the stakes are high. (Not claiming this is the &quot;best&quot; way to learn, but boy is it effective)<p>Anyway.. I&#x27;ve never really struggled with git, nor with it&#x27;s advanced notations. But algorithms? Hard, math-related thinking? That&#x27;s an every day struggle. Perhaps the author&#x27;s opinion is geared from the perspective of more functionally-paradigmed thinking?')
