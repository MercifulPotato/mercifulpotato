Sure, it could be true.<p>Frankly I doubt that they&#x27;ve done a detailed enough analysis to know these kinds of things at TRL 2-3, at best they&#x27;ve done a back of the envelope calculation based on lab results at small scale to show it&#x27;s not obviously stupid, or if they&#x27;re really on the ball they&#x27;ve got a license for Aspen and have some incredibly oversimplified model that shows it&#x27;s not obviously stupid.<p>Really, at this development level, &quot;not obviously stupid&quot; is a pretty positive thing. If they&#x27;re doing the work right, they are trying to demonstrate that it&#x27;s stupid every day because that&#x27;s how you avoid discovering it&#x27;s stupid after five years of R&amp;D and $50M.')
