Focusing protection on the vulnerable while allowing the rest of society to function could&#x27;ve spared us both from the worst of the pandemic&#x27;s destruction and the economic destruction --<p>That&#x27;s an unrealistic idea.  You can&#x27;t have unchecked community spread and &quot;focus protection on the vulnerable,&quot; without literally imprisoning them in an isolation bubble <i>for a year or more</i>, which is far longer than the successful lockdowns have lasted.  There are places in the world that have <i>already</i> opened up, virus free.<p>The rule with this pandemic seems to be: the more half-ass you are at controlling it, the more pain and expense you get.<p>&gt; &quot;economic&quot; is a bit of a misnomer too. There is a greater cost to lockdowns than just economics. Mental and physical health also suffer. Those that can&#x27;t get preventative care they need suffer. Depressed people and those with anxiety who turn to drugs, alcohol and suicide suffer.<p>If you really cared so much about people&#x27;s &quot;mental and physical health,&quot; why are you advocating a policy that wouldn&#x27;t lessen it, but rather concentrate the damage and increase the burden to on the vulnerable?')
