Should HN allow low effort comments and memes in the name of free speech? When online communities have no moderation, they inevitably get hijacked and become awful.<p>It&#x27;s actually nice that instead of Twitter just hiding&#x2F;deleting the offending posts, the posts are still there for you to see (in a less convenient way) so you can decide yourself that you&#x27;re happy with the standards Twitter is trying to set.<p>If you&#x27;re not happy, you&#x27;re free to go find or create another community online that has moderation you&#x27;re happy with. I don&#x27;t understand how anyone can feel they should be allowed to inject themselves into a community and act however they want with no repercussions, and everyone else just has to put up with it.')
