Ships are mini-cities, so it takes all types of engineers:<p>-Naval Architect - (Specializes in hull form design and structures.)\n-Marine Systems Engineering - (all about the machinery plant design to make the ship move)<p>ME&#x27;s and Navarchs work side-by-side.<p>Here is a list of schools with Navarch and Marine Engineering degrees [1]<p>Webb and USMMA (i.e. Kings Point) folks are all over the forefront of this industry.<p>These are the primary degrees. If you search the above two job postings, you will find plenty of companies working in Ship Design. These degrees will give a decent treatment to all of the fields needed to succeed in ship design.<p>Other specialists we work with:\n-Electrical Engineering\n-Hydrodynamicists\n-RF &amp; Network Engineering (for C4I systems)\n-Mechanical Engineer\n-Data Science (demand increasing rapidly with the emergence of unmanned shipping)\n-Physics (especially thermodynamics) or Math\n-Materials Science\n-Mechatronics&#x2F;Robotics\n-Logistics&#x2F;Supply chain\n-Reliability Engineering\n-Shipyard (Production) Management\n-Simulations and Game developers\nThe list really does go on...<p>I work with a mechanichal engineer who worked for an elevator design firm before entering our industry and they&#x27;re one of the best &#x27;marine engineers&#x27; I&#x27;ve worked with. Most everyone understands they don&#x27;t know everything, and new perspectives are the womb of creativity, so people with varied backgrounds are welcomed.<p>Type of companies to look for:<p>1.) Defense contractors (e.g. General Dynamics, BAE, Gibbs &amp; Cox, Gen. Atomics, many MANY more)\n2.) Private Navarch&#x2F;Marine Engineering firms\n3.) Shipyards (NASSCO, HII, China Shipbuilding Industry Corp, Hyundai Heavy Industries, etc.)\n4.) Cruiselines, Ferry lines and other commercial ship owners\n5.) Workboat companies, and Offshore (e.g. oil) Industry\n6.) Smaller yacht, racing craft, pleasure craft designers&#x2F;builders.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=schools+with+naval+architecture+programs&amp;oq=schools+with+naval+&amp;aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0j0i457j0i22i30l2.6437j0j9&amp;client=ms-android-tmus-us-revc&amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;ie=UTF-8#fpstate=tlexp&amp;htiq=schools%20with%20naval%20architecture%20programs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=schools+with+naval+architect...</a><p>P.S. - I&#x27;m in dire need of a solid data scientist (big data analytics&#x2F;sensitivity anaysis, model building), so if someone&#x27;s interested, send me your contact info.')
