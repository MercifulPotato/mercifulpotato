I look for 80s steel frames in decent condition and the right size.<p>My impression is that frame building is a highly intensive hobby and a labor of love. The frames become practically heirlooms. Some of the bikes are just stunning. There&#x27;s a fair amount of specialized equipment involved, and brazing &#x2F; welding are arts unto themselves.<p>Perhaps (just my guess) a bamboo bike is less intensive since it&#x27;s basically glued together, to over-simplify. This might make it a much more accessible project.')
