I&#x27;d love to see some data about it<p>As you said in a comment below:<p>&gt; According to Volvo&#x27;s own data 60% of PHEV buyers never plug them in<p>You confirm what I said in my unpopular comment above, on paper PHEVs reduce emissions by a lot but in reality, as a fleet, the numbers are far worse than suggested. Many are company cars because the company wanted the tax cuts and subsidies, others just test the waters with this electric stuff. They don&#x27;t go full BEV because they can&#x27;t reliably charge. The UK is a great place to have an EV, with the most people living in (semi)detached houses in Europe [0] and cheap electricity. Most of the rest of Europe doesn&#x27;t do so well at either point.<p>I can&#x27;t <i>show</i> you data but I personally know it from a very reliable source who has access to this kind of (unpublished) data from one large German manufacturer. While their EV owners charge every day, less than 1 in 6 of the drivers who ever plug in their PHEV (~40-50Km of range in ideal conditions) do so at least once every 2 days, and only about 25% of Km are driven in EV mode. This average is pulled up by those very few who charge regularly (every 1-2 days). Some more kilometers are &quot;electrified&quot;, EM gives a boost from standstill or under hard acceleration. And a huge percentage of PHEVs were <i>never</i> connected to a charger. Real life fuel consumption of the fleet is <i>4 times higher</i> than the official numbers.<p>&gt; I drive a Volvo XC60 T8 and that&#x27;s completely not what my stats are. My long term average over a year is 3L&#x2F;100km.<p>Yes but you have to admit that you&#x27;re close to the ideal case, you charge every night and drive almost exclusively electric, and you still get 50% higher consumption that the official numbers. Doesn&#x27;t this tell you anything about the reality of the whole fleet, and not just your particular situation? All numbers I find online for real life fuel consumption for an XC60 T8 points to an average of over 7l&#x2F;100Km. For every PHEV that&#x27;s almost always charged, there are a few PHEVs that are almost never charged. This doesn&#x27;t lead to great overall fuel numbers. Perhaps better than pure-ICE but certainly nowhere close to the official numbers. If I had your car after 2 days of driving I&#x27;d run out of juice, have nowhere to charge conveniently, and just fill the tank.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;eurostat&#x2F;statistics-explained&#x2F;index.php?title=File:Distribution_of_the_population_by_type_of_dwelling,_2018_(%25)_LCIE20.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;eurostat&#x2F;statistics-explained&#x2F;index.php...</a>')
