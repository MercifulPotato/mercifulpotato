Human medicine is sufficiently complex that its negative consequences are extremely ripe for black swan events.<p>From that perspective, your argument falls in the same hole as Ben&#x27;s: based on a retrospective view of bounded outcomes, you are trying to argue about unbounded future events. The real risk of a rushed vaccine rollout is not a repeat of the 1976 incident, but a medical disaster which is unpredictably and massively worse. Modern medical red tape exists precisely because of the risk of such disasters.')
