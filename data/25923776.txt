It&#x27;s unfortunate that there&#x27;s not a version of creat() that takes a path to a directory (for determining on which fs to create) but doesn&#x27;t link the file, plus a version of link() that takes a source file descriptor instead of a source file.<p>If extended to support non-file fds, the link function might also do some interesting things, like have TCP connections show up in the virtual file system, similar to Unix pipes.')
