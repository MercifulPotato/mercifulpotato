It was a broad statement of what was going to happen<p>If he hadn&#x27;t been in denial he could have acted sooner and save a lot of those people that instead died.<p>It&#x27;s the PM responsibility and anybody else.<p>If we were talking about Italy, for example, I would tell you that 60% of the covid related deaths are a responsibility of Attilio Fontana, the president of Regional Council of Lombardy who left elderly to die in nursing homes while he was subcontracting the supply of medical equipment to his brother in law and when journalists found out he tried to repay the debt using his own money from a Swiss account (yes, he has secret money in Switzerland)<p>But in UK B.J. is the major responsible for the debacle.')
