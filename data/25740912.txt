They make it sound as if it was unusual? Sometimes people even succeeded (Lincoln, Kennedy), so it is not a new development at all.<p>I remember when Obama came to Europe he was only speaking behind a wall of bullet proof glass.<p>I also remember lots of ritualized symbolic killings of Trump, most notable that &quot;comedian&quot; holding up a severed head in his liking.<p>Tbh I suspect this is theater to create an inflated sense of threat, that will be used to justify all sorts of unpleasant activities.')
