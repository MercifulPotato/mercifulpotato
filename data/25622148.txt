The reference is useful at a high level, the autogenerated stdlib stuff is highly hit and miss and I suppose will be ripe for community contribution when the method of generating it is nailed down.<p>The language itself is fantastic once you get a decent grasp of it, which you&#x27;ll probably achieve by reading the stdlib source to get a feel for what you need to do.<p>I&#x27;ve been using it to build stuff on my Pi Zero. Still hit a few snags with cross compilation and C interop, but it&#x27;s been a pleasure to write. I&#x27;m definitely keeping an eye on it as a good alternative to getting into Rust.')
