Their point is that you stick to the letter of the law (the constitution) rather than trying to bend it around current social norms and sensibilities. I&#x27;ve never met an originalist who thinks black people are &quot;3&#x2F;5&quot; of a person. They will cite the 13th and 14th amendments if you do. Clearly they would feel that the Constitution shouldn&#x27;t be changed ever if they felt the way you say they feel. They think if you want to change the Constitution (or laws in general) that you should pass a new law or amend the Constitution to fit the situation, not sidestep it with a liberal judge who thinks it should be interpreted through the lens of society or even social justice.')
