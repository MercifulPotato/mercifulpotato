It was part of the whole wave of P2P filesharing programs that came out between 1999-2002: Napster, Gnutella, Kazaa, Audiogalaxy, etc.  Amazing it&#x27;s still going on.<p>BTW, for folks new in tech - it&#x27;s amazing how influential that wave of programs were, even though they largely failed in the marketplace.  Napster founder Sean Parker later became the first investor and first president of Facebook.  Also involved in the wave (in a tangential way) was Mark Zuckerburg, whose Synapse Media Player got a $M+ buyout offer from Microsoft while he was still in high school.  Uber founder Travis Kalanick&#x27;s first two projects were Scour (a P2P filesharing app) and Red Swoosh (a P2P CDN).  I met the AudioGalaxy founder while working on Google Search - he later went on to become one of the early Waymo engineers.  The Kazaa founders later went on to found Skype, and we know where that went.  Chord (an academic research project in distributed hash tables) was led by Robert Tappan Morris (originally famous for creating the Internet Worm of 1988), who then went on to co-found YCombinator, which owns the website you&#x27;re reading this on.  The gossip protocol invented &amp; refined by Gnutella forms the basis for many cryptocurrency P2P protocols like Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum.<p>There&#x27;s probably several trillion dollars in market cap attributable to the intellectual descendants of a bunch of nerds who wanted to share stuff over the Internet and fuck over the RIAA, MPAA, and governments.')
