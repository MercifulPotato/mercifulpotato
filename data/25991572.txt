You&#x27;ll connect your bank account and do some security verification. Once approved you can buy whatever you want.<p>Although depends on what you mean by traditional trading. If you want see details charts and create market orders or limits, things like that, then you&#x27;ll want Coinbase Pro.<p>Coinbase is great for easy buying and then holding there in your wallet.
