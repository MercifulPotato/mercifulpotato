Sudden violent events have, time after time, been used to increase authoritarian control. I can absolutely see a line that starts with &quot;we need to get the Senate safe, also we&#x27;re going to give emergency powers to the president.&quot; Followed by attempts to prevent the Senate from meeting, increasing police and national guard presence.
