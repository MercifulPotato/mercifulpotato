Even if you deposited cash they would probably find some way to delay letting you use the funds pending some &#x27;internal checking&#x27;.<p>So in Robinhood&#x27;s case if there are many people depositing dollars to buy stock then that could be their reason or excuse to not have funds available for trading. Just a guess.')
