I think it&#x27;s ok, even good, to actually care about real-world outcomes sometimes. The stoics say that you should care about whether you acted virtuously rather than whether your actions lead to a good outcome, but if you don&#x27;t care about outcomes then the definition of virtuous actions must surely be baseless. If I really believe in stoicism, shouldn&#x27;t I just take drugs that make me feel happy&#x2F;satisfied&#x2F;virtuous?')
