Dark is intending to be &quot;batteries included&quot; and relieve developers of the need for a huge ecosystem with multiple libraries for everything.<p>&gt; <i>And yet they&#x27;re asking their customers to make the same bet on their proprietary language and platform.</i><p>I always use very popular open-source stacks.<p>That said, if given the choice between a tiny FOSS language and a tiny proprietary one (that might be profitable), I&#x27;ll always choose the latter.<p>Small languages are extremely vulnerable to extinction regardless of who maintains them. But if at least one person&#x27;s full-time job is to maintain a language, I feel much more confident than if 1-5 people are maintaining it part-time.')
