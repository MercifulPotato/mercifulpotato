And that usually happens because your product helped them get a win that moved an important metric to them.<p>Hint: Ask them about things they&#x27;ve always wanted to do, but couldn&#x27;t because it was technically impractical. There&#x27;s probably at least one diamond in there that would be &quot;easy&quot; with your product.<p>Hint2: Think more broadly about the kind of thing you&#x27;re trying to do, and get your team in that area. I&#x27;ve worked under CFOs as often as I&#x27;ve worked under CTOs, because &quot;saving money&quot; is near and dear to the former.<p>(Adapt as necessary to how French government works. Good luck!)')
