There&#x27;s a nuance to understand as well that these people deplatformed aren&#x27;t victims: they still have their freedom of speech, just not on these private platforms. It&#x27;s inconvenient for them, yes, that they depended on them, but their TOS were always clear from the beginning if they actually read or cared about their contents. This scenario isn&#x27;t akin to the Nazis going after one group, then another, then another - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;First_they_came_" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;First_they_came_</a>... - violence isn&#x27;t a group even if a mob forms a group, and understandably they&#x27;re an angry mob who believe to some degree that the election was fraudulent (but hypocritically it wouldn&#x27;t have been fraudulent if their pick one) - which all signs point to that it wasn&#x27;t - but because they&#x27;re not accessible to talk to and their media channels are perpetuating the lies and lack of critical thinking, it&#x27;s manifesting how expected, and why Trump et al have been inciting violence. January 6th could have ended with many more dead, could have been much more tragic had they been better organized.<p>If your child started saying racist things, would you just let them? I assume not. I assume you would escalate punishment until they understood and behaved with what&#x27;s appropriate, and if they didn&#x27;t, you&#x27;d probably kick them out of your house once you&#x27;re legally allowed to if for some reason they&#x27;ve become a terrible person; people won&#x27;t change until they&#x27;re ready to or there&#x27;s an impetus - sometimes, if not most of the time, all it takes is a parent saying you won&#x27;t get dessert if you don&#x27;t behave.')
