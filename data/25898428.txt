Decentralization is a complicated technology that needs a lot longer to mature than I think most people realize. But once it is mature - and we&#x27;re getting close, imo just a few years left - it&#x27;ll move way faster and more efficiently than the centralized world ever did.<p>In many ways it feels like decentralization is the same as discovering the internal combustion engine before modern alloys existed. We have to invent a lot of extra stuff to make decentralization practical, and we will, but the vision definitely started many steps ahead of the technological progress.')
