First, it depends on the personality. If you don&#x27;t find programming on its own gratifying and enjoyable, there&#x27;s no need to force it on the side. But second, if you do enjoy programming, are burnt out, and have never tried a side project, give it an honest shot. It is so utterly counter-intuitive that programming on the side can cure your burn out from programming as a job, but time and again that has been my experience. I don&#x27;t quite understand how it has this effect on me (and others), but it does. A few hours or a weekend of coding on a side project, and I come back to work like I&#x27;ve just been on vacation, sometimes even struggling to remember just what it was that was bothering me so much last week.')
