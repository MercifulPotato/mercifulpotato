Item(by='bryanrasmussen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603262506, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24844343, text='You should fire lightly early, and fire hard if late.<p>Where I live you have a month when starting were you can be fired with 2 weeks let-go period, after which it takes 3 months or more.<p>I think you should have an intensive monitoring&#x2F;evaluation in the first month, and fire lightly if you think there is a mismatch. After you have determined an employee fits you, if they stop fitting you try to figure out why, help them to fit again (are they the kind who gets bored, needs new challenges?, do they have problems at home? If you found someone who fits I think it is more efficient to make them fit again then try to find someone else who fits). I believe this is the way to go even in areas where you do not have the rules about the dismissal period that you have here.')
