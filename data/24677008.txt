Every piece of equipment you would need to do those things would need to be launched not just to low Earth orbit, but all the way to the moon, which is massively more difficult and expensive than building things on Earth and tossing them into orbit here.  Building a James Webb equivalent on the moon would cost trillions instead of billions and take decades instead of years.')
