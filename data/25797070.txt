Just moved to a new building and they added me to a whatsapp group for announcements &#x2F; requests etc. Also, movers, utility people etc would call and ask for a “location”. Not an address. A “location”, meaning sharing a location via whatsapp. Noone even mentions the name whatsapp. It is implied.<p>If you have children, most schools have whatsapp groups for parents and teachers to get in contact.<p>I mean I can find much more. Not having WhatsApp is not an option here. It is almost like not having a cell phone.')
