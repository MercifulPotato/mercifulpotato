My point is any platform, once large enough will have to deal with it. You can&#x27;t just ignore the consequences that come from ignoring it. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an independent problem in itself - the examples I gave you are direct problems that institutions face as a result of large scale misinformation.<p>Just saying &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t solve that problem&quot; doesn&#x27;t contribute in understanding how one can build more open platforms in the future.')
