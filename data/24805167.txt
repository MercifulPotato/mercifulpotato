This is awesome to see people working on different solutions to something I&#x27;m working on!<p>@jacquesm if you&#x27;re looking for someone to chat about this kind of stuff with - I would love to sync up!<p>--Shameless Plug--<p>I&#x27;ve been working on a passion project for over 2 years now called Piano Gym! <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pianogym.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pianogym.com</a><p>The idea is very much the same - in that a USB midi piano (in chrome for now) can be connected to the computer and used to play sheet music in contenxt.<p>HOWEVER, Piano Gym&#x27;s goal is much larger than Piano, and much larger than sheet music, despite that being the current state of the product.<p>Piano Gym&#x27;s focus is to apply spaced repetition and flash card based review systems to get people playing Piano and learning music theory in context, while ALSO managing review systems and check points. Eventually we want to do this for all instruments too!<p>We want you in the gym to do your reps!<p>Additionally anyone can create content there. Whether you&#x27;re a learner or a teacher you can make your own schools, courses, and lessons that others can enroll in to learn from!<p>It&#x27;s incredibly exciting and super cool to see other people trying to solve these problems.<p>If anyone is interested please come and join us at the gym - Piano Gym!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pianogym.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pianogym.com</a>')
