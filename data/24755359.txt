Item(by='quietbritishjim', descendants=None, kids=[24757683], score=None, time=1602516325, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24753858, text='&gt; I would be happy to see if you have any citations of dubious peer-reviewed articles or conference proceedings to the extent of the infamous Tsai integration paper.<p>I was making a general point that citation count is not a measure of article quality, not that there are any specific SPIE papers that are quite as bad as that example. There are plenty of other cases where low quality (but not <i>as bad</i>) articles have lots of citations but higher quality articles have fewer. I raised it because you used citation count as a proof of article quality in your previous comment, but I don&#x27;t find it to be evidence of anything.<p>(For the record, I just checked and the citation count is only 406 according to Google, not &quot;thousands&quot; as I claimed. The paper in question is &quot;A Mathematical Model for the Determination of Total Area Under Glucose Tolerance and Other Metabolic Curves&quot; by Mary M Tai.)<p>As it happens I have seen articles in SPIE that do have a similar flavour: a well-established existing area of mathematics that has been re-&quot;discovered&quot; in a more limited form in another context without acknowledgement. But it&#x27;s nowhere near as bad as the trapezium rule paper: in fairness, that area is something you wouldn&#x27;t learn about even in a typical undergraduate mathematics degree, and the articles were not limited to SPIE journals (but I think it reflects equally badly on those other journals). I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m not willing to name names in this case, both to protect my own identity (it might give away my field) avoid mudslinging at a particular individual.<p>&gt; The idea that you overreach on the veracity of journals from the SPIE is just highly strange as you make overarching claims of dubiousness to the point of fraud...<p>I&#x27;m sorry, I couldn&#x27;t quite untangle this sentence. Are you saying that I&#x27;m approaching the point of fraud because of my accusations against SPIE? (The &quot;as&quot; in the middle doesn&#x27;t quite fit with this interpretation.) I&#x27;ve told you, I&#x27;m going on genuine articles I&#x27;ve seen and even contributed to. I have no connection to SPIE or any other competing journal and no personal reason to discredit them. Do you have any personal connection to SPIE yourself?')
