Unless you can convince 200+ countries to adopt it as their formal law, said spyware could always find a place to call home and still infiltrate the world.<p>GDPR is a good example of a law that the US sheepishly somehow chooses to obey EU law (wtf, why didn&#x27;t the US obey the EU laws around recycling and energy and no free plastic grocery bags for the past decade? and all of a sudden they care about obeying GDPR?), but do Central&#x2F;South American, African, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries take a crap about GDPR? Generally not. They don&#x27;t care about EU law. It doesn&#x27;t apply in their jurisdiction, and they are not sheep. That isn&#x27;t to say privacy doesn&#x27;t matter, it&#x27;s just that the law needs to be locally implemented, not obeying some arbitrary EU interpretation of the idea that wasn&#x27;t even discussed with them.<p>As such, I think technical approaches are generally superior to regulatory approaches in user protection. They apply across the entire world instantly.')
