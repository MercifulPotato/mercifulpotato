So you can have a flux of heat from the hot part to the cold part, and extract a small part as useful energy.<p>If we take the press release at face value, in this device there is no difference of temperature. So if the Second Law of Thermodynamics is correct it is not possible to extract some useful energy to do something interesting, like turning on the lamp in the animation.')
