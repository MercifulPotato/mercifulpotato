It doesn&#x27;t seem like an older physician that is working from home should be weighted higher than nearly anyone working every day in the hospital, regardless of age or if <i>other</i> people in their department working in the hospital got sick already.<p>It seems like amount of contact with patients should have been weighted far higher than anything else (patients for elective procedures are required to get a virus test first, so amount of contact with untested patients like in ER, or covid+ patients like those who need to care for them, even higher). But I&#x27;m not a doctor or medical ethicist. If Stanford has a reason for not doing that, they can, well, explain it, if they want to look better. It makes me figure it was just not done very carefully.<p>It seems to me that formula was just not very good. While it&#x27;s technically an &quot;algorithm&quot;, sure, I think most of us in the field would just call that a &quot;formula&quot; not an algorithm. I think they use the phrase &quot;algorithm&quot; precisely because to the layperson it seems more mysterious, more sophisticated, more complicated, harder to question, less obvious that was just something humans did, possibly not very carefully.')
