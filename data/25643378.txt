Item(by='konjin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609835010, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25643242, text='<p><pre><code>    s&#x2F;not because it easy&#x2F;not beucase it&#x27;s easy&#x2F;g\n    s&#x2F;that ISO want 198&#x2F;that ISO wants 198&#x2F;g\n</code></pre>\nOther than that 10&#x2F;10. As readable as hacker news on my setup.<p>The only way that can be better if is you wrote it as pure text.<p>If you follow basic formatting like double new lines after headings and punctuation most screen readers do a better job of giving you the semantic information by breaks and tones than the always broken &#x27;semantic tags&#x27;.<p>Put it another way, would you want to read raw html to make sure that what you thought was a &lt;p&gt; was actually a &lt;pre&gt;? That&#x27;s what I get whenever I try and use those. Again a solution by people who don&#x27;t need to eat their dog food.')
