The intermediate strings are comments to a blog post... putting them all into Strings then joining them all up means you&#x27;ll have huge amount of RAM being consumed for no reason. Updating the DOM as soon as you get the information is optimal for memory utilisation and for user feedback, which are more important than the total time (even if the total time is longer, which I doubt because if there&#x27;s a large number of replies, most of them won&#x27;t be visible in the viewport and hence should be very cheap too.')
