I included par files in case something happened. There was a read issue with the hard drive (iirc, I wouldn&#x27;t reproduce it when I got the drive back, but they wiped it, so who knows), so they stopped the import halfway through. A couple of months later, I noticed a surprisingly large Glacier bill, but I couldn&#x27;t find the objects. After contacting support, I found out that the temp files were essentially in a hidden archive in my account.<p>I was pretty annoyed by the whole thing.')
