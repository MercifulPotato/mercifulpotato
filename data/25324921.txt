All interview performance is  kept on record at most companies. For 5&#x2F;10&#x2F;15 years or even more.<p>That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not a good idea to interview at a place when you&#x27;re unprepared. Not only are you wasting both your and the company&#x27;s time, but you&#x27;re also hurting your chances of getting an interview call from them in the future.<p>I have seen a lot of people I know make this mistake -- not preparing enough for a interview, failing badly, and then applying to the same company 6&#x2F;12&#x2F;24 months later, and not even getting another interview. Very frustrating.')
