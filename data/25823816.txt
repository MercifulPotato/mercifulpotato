You can easily get an appointment in Germany, even multiple times. If you have a referral, you usually get an appointment earlier than people who directly went to the specialist. However, if you have acute pain you will quickly get an appointment on the same or the next day.<p>Source: Me. just made the second appointment with a specialist within a week thanks to pain, appointment is tomorrow')
