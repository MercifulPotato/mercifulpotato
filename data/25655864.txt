I can&#x27;t even imagine what hidden skews are present in the 5% that agreed. This issue is systemic in consumer research and impacts both public (e.g. election polling, U.S. census) and private (pharmaceutical trials, media&#x2F;advertising research, voluntary AI&#x2F;ML training daat) polling.<p>Governments and businesses make biased, potentially discriminatory decisions if a non-random segment of the population chooses to never be counted. The ad industry attempts to circumvent this through non-voluntary passive tracking, which trades off non-response bias with bulldozing user privacy. The headwinds are only growing too, as consumer awareness of privacy lapses and the politicization of polling continues to reduce who participates in opt-in research.<p>Finding a solution to this that doesn&#x27;t resort to privacy-eroding tactics is a moonshot level problem in terms of the size-of-the-prize if solved.')
