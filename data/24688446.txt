The corporations are collected data from people that offer it - facebook etc is a sign-up service. It&#x27;s voluntary.<p>Sure we need some rules about what&#x27;s reasonable to record. In fact, we&#x27;re getting them. But reigning in corporations is harder than making a rule. Because there&#x27;s money at stake, it&#x27;s hard to get a ravenous corporation to change behavior with a little fine or whatever.<p>So sure, I&#x27;m on the side of privacy, as should have been obvious. But not sure I can fix this, sorry.')
