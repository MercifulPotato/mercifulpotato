It gets into the nitty-gritty of how memory allocation works and the overhead of maintaining a hashmap versus whatever optimized character sorting algorithms are part of your runtime.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;ve found that companies that want to ding me for those kinds of things aren&#x27;t worth working for. IMO, we&#x27;re better off having an industry-standard licensing board. Plenty of other industries do the same thing.<p>Edit: I&#x27;ve also spent an afternoon with a FAANG&#x27;s set of practice programming challenges. I won&#x27;t go into details out of respect for confidentiality, but they weren&#x27;t unreasonably difficult. I only want to work with people who can solve &quot;most&quot; of them. (No one&#x27;s perfect.)<p>The best analogy is like being a musician or an athlete. Anyone can learn to play an instrument or play a sport, but to be a professional musician or athlete requires something that takes more than practice. No one&#x27;s excluded from those industries due to lack of talent, but the people without the talent have to take the jobs that support the musicians and athletes.')
