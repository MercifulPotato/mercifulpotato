It gets into the nitty-gritty of how memory allocation works and the overhead of maintaining a hashmap versus whatever optimized character sorting algorithms are part of your runtime.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;ve found that companies that want to ding me for those kinds of things aren&#x27;t worth working for. IMO, we&#x27;re better off having an industry-standard licensing board. Plenty of other industries do the same thing.')
