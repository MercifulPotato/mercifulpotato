Aliases either exist or they don&#x27;t. When speaking of aliases alone, bash is no simpler nor more complex than powershell.&quot; If you had simply replied upthread with that in the fist place, it would have made a fine comment with a very high signal&#x2F;noise ratio. Unfortunately the rest of both comments is just noise, tanking the ratio.<p>As I explained upthread (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25862312" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25862312</a>), the internet is crazy-making this way, but it&#x27;s not some property specific to HN and it&#x27;s not something that&#x27;s somehow changed lately. It&#x27;s intrinsic to the medium, and we all need to build our skills in coping with itâ€”which includes not reacting from a provoked place. That&#x27;s not easy, but it&#x27;s necessary to the sort of community we&#x27;re trying for here, and we need everyone to work together on that.')
